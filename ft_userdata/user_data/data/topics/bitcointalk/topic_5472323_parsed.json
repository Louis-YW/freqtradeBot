      "body": "We know a lot about Bitcoin.15 years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin White Paper.The White Paper was published on 31 October 2008. Bitcoin is a digital decentralized currency, I have nothing new to say. How important Bitcoin is in our lives is slowly becoming apparent and Bitcoin is spreading all over the world. Those familiar with Bitcoin probably know how important today is. Today, October 31st is an important day for Bitcoin as the Bitcoin white paper was published on this day. As of April 10, 2023, according to data from Bitcoin.org, Bitcoin has been translated into 43 languages.Various people have commented on the Bitcoin White Paper on their twitter and I am presenting some of them to you.TheBitcoinTherapistTECH ME BITCOIN, SON",

To avoid repetitive replies.There's also the other one that's posted by a lower ranked member so I guess we're probably just going to see nothing new, everyone wants to celebrate the 15 years of whitepaper by starting their own topic. No worries as this will pass eventually, we just have to endure I guess .On the topic though, that's actually pretty awesome that it's been 15 years already since bitcoin has become a thing/concept that some brilliant mind created to create financial freedom against the oppressive financial system, with what the current state of bitcoin, I wonder if Satoshi ever thought it would get this big or that his masterpiece would have this much following.",

Today is the historic October 31st day in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto published his Bitcoin WhitePaper. This 9 page white paper is still with us today and this white paper is the first document of Bitcoin. This whitepaper is currently translated into more than 40 languages.Quote from: _act_ on October 31, 2023, 12:04:02 PMI saw this today, that today marks the 15th anniversary of the bitcoin whitepaper, a nine-page document that kickstarted the age of bitcoin.QuoteWhen Satoshi released the whitepaper on Oct. 31, 2008, it didn't seem like much. At first, the paper was distributed to a mailing list of cypherpunks, but it unveiled the concept of bitcoin to the world for the first time. The paper describes technical concepts such as Proof of Work and the Merkle Tree, and it gives us a glimpse into the problems that bitcoin addresses.The bitcoin protocol would begin in earnest on Jan. 3, 2009 when Satoshi mined the first bitcoin block, also known as the genesis block. So, bitcoin has multiple birthdays ‚Äî we wouldn't blame you if you celebrate year-round.In the below Q&A, Jameson discusses why the whitepaper matters, the context from which it sprang, and even some things it got wrong.https://blog.keys.casa/understanding-bitcoin-whitepaper/?utm_term=whitepaper-day&utm_campaign=security-briefing&utm_medium=email&utm_content=oct-31&utm_source=hubspotI like the questions and answers. You can also read it.Today everyone is celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Bitcoin White Paper.Maybe still many people don't know about when Bitcoin white paper was published.But today they will surely know.",

There is nothing bad about it though and it would serve as a reminder to new members getting registered and also they would have knowledge about Bitcoin inception after seeing this post of yours.I see it amazing how fast Bitcoin grew with a very strong momentum irrespective of the challenges encountered in the course of growing,¬† Bitcoin became more popular and the awareness together with the adoption keep rising that it would be very difficult for the government to resist I too in time to come or the nearest future.",

Understanding the bitcoinwhitepaper with Jameson LoppJust saying. To avoid repetitive replies.This topic dominates your link by the number of posts.  Therefore, I will also answer here. But I‚Äôll pull the post out of that topic.Quote from: hugeblack on October 31, 2023, 12:59:58 PMIt is strange that no one talked about it, but time passed quickly and events followed, which some may consider the beginning of Bitcoin, some consider genius block to be more important event, and others see Satoshi‚Äôs first post in the forum as the most important.This is an ideal opportunity to read the white paper. If you haven't read it already, now might be a good time.Everything is important, and a \"genius block\", and \"Satoshi‚Äôs first post in the forum\". All together. Even without at least one of these components, bitcoin would not be what we know it today.This opportunity to read the bitcoin white paper now is not only for those who have not read it yet, but for all bitcoiners, as a tribute of respect. And at the same time, refresh memory of what was written there. 15 years is a very significant date for electronic cash, which has been predicted to die countless times. Curious to know if haters will continue to call it useless and a scam even after all these years? How many years will it take for them to change their minds? The fact that bitcoin has existed for 15 years is already a sign of quality and an indicator of reliability.Quote from: Ayers on October 31, 2023, 12:15:36 PMI don't know what else to say, I just want us all to remember this day and give our deepest thanks to Satoshi for creating bitcoin for us.I don't know what else to add either. I simply internally and mentally express gratitude and tribute to the BTC-creator. Let it be so.",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing this information. 15 years looks too short to achieve a market capitalization of that much. I mean, it exceeds all other companies in terms of time. BTC really set new goals and outperformed all of our expectations. But in another sense, 15 years have passed, but I was only able to get a few years. Still, I consider myself early because, even though the time is 15 years, we still have a golden chance. If we compare these years, there will be 117 years remaining for BTC to be fully mined.BTC has outperformed all of our expectations, including Satoshi's, and that's awesome for all of us. I hope the market cap of BTC will double in the upcoming 15 years. When will the BTC be 30 years old? The age is just a number that looks so small, but great innovations have been made. Two countries have adopted it; many have banned it, but still, it is making a place in the hearts of many.And thanks for wishing Halloween, but unfortunately in our country there is no holiday, but its ok, I already made a leave.",

I used to forget things like names of things, people, and dates easily, but I didn't think after reading three repetitive topics without noticing until I read your reply. that I will forget that the whitepaper was released on October 31. Thank God, Satoshi did not release it on February 29, otherwise, we have to wait 4 to 5 years.Overall, time passed, and if we look back, it looks like only a few hours or days have passed, which means the time looks short, but 15 years is a long time, but BTC performed well and achieved a lot of tags. Some call it a way for freedom of speech, freedom of finance, open source, and freedom from the middle man, but those who don't like it call it terrorism, a source of obfuscating money, etc.Well, I hope people will now start to read whitepapers first rather than talk hugely about BTC.",

Every year, we should always remember the history of Bitcoin and how it made a great impact on many people and financial institutions for good. After just 15 years, Bitcoin is now a recognized asset comparable to the real gold and its value is getting bigger and bigger. The vision laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto remains to be valid and I am looking to its evolution in the next 15 years. Bravo!",

I have joined several market discussion groups on social media platforms and what I see is that no one has mentioned this issue in the past few days. People seem to be so absorbed in making profits from altcoins that they forget what created this market. I'm also here for profit, but important days like this are worth remembering, and to say thank you to Satoshi.",

Are you talking about crime ? I think that has nothing to do with bitcoin because as you also said bitcoin is a means of payment and everyone can freely use it, we cannot prevent or ban anyone. Just like fiat money or the banking system are also being used by criminals and even though they are centralized, the government cannot prevent crime, so bitcoin cannot be blamed . As an investor, I think we should ignore what the government says.",
