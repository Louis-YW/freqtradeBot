I guess it's not that widespread due to its scripted nature. But, it's never known to viewer. I think the wrestling more than real wrestling is just a scripted show as you point out,when I was a kid I used to watch it RAW one week and SMACKDOWN next week with Vince McMahon and some other old guy who become a wrestler.The problem with betting here though is not that widespread and most people do not like to bet on sports where people fight each other because we don't know the physical form of each fighter/wrestler.Here surprises happened from time to time like another wrestler coming to help not the favorite and the favorite lost the fight,this is why I think it is not really liked by gamblers.",

I guess it's not that widespread due to its scripted nature. But, it's never known to viewer. I lost my interest in WWE a long time ago after I discovered that it was scripted, I wonder how people still watch it knowing it is not real and that the outcomes are sometimes preplanned. Betting on WWE games for me will not be my number one choice knowing that the fight are already planned to favor one of the fighters. I am guessing this same reason I have about not willing to bet on it will be the same reason that some other persons have for not betting on the sport too. It is not exciting betting on a sport that is already scripted.",

I have tried to find crypto related websites that would have that ooption and wasn't able to find any. I only know betting rooms hat do not accept cryptos as is the case with betway or 888 sports. What I do is I charge my PayPal with cryptos and then I can recharge these accounts if I want to do some WWE bets",

They're scripted and the winner is already decided before the match. I've not seen any sports betting platform that allows betting in WWE. There may be platforms like that definitely but there's no point going into it.",

WWE should not be bet on since it is scripted this is the only sport that I have seen that is like a film, the actors already know the end of the film. WWE is just for entertainment and that's all.In my country the wrestling down here is real and you see that at the end of the competition the winner would be like the most powerful person in the community which will be feared and respected by people. Weeks before the fight,it must have been announced so that people that want to place their bet on the wrestlers will do so before time. I don't know why WWE is not the same as being real.",

I watched the world Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) program on TV for a while but it seemed to me to be completely fake and contrived and it was pretty boring to watch for long time. So I don't think it's reasonable to bet on it . Basketball can be a beautiful and completely natural sport where betting is reasonable . And boxing can also be a good sport to bet on",

I think betting can happen on almost any things. There's even betting on animals, and insects. In the sports category, there is also betting in exhibition boxing. So, why not in WWE? But the OP said that there are a few of them in the past but sadly it was removed one by one. There must be a deep reason behind that and not only to the fact that they are scripted.I think it's best to just enjoy watching them or we can gather our friends locally and that is how we make a betting. I am sure no one will be angry with that unless if you guys will stream it live and someone will report you to the authorities. There is still an alternative to WWE which you can place a bet online like MMA.",

Hard to place a bet on a scripted matches, we all know about this already and probably the site is removing this option because of no interest at all from the bettor. I just love watching this when I was a child because it looks surreal not until I realized that its just a staged play and everything fights with their script so its not worth it anymore. There might be some site who have this, but better to be more careful on betting on a scripted matches.",

Why come to the point to have an interest in betting on WWE?Are you aware that before (or maybe until now I'm not been updated now on this for several years already), events such as Wrestle Mania, Royal Rumble, etc., their official site already listed the winners right before the official telecast of it?But regardless, for a scripted match like that, don't consider putting a place for that. I doubt that you can even see that being listed in bookies.",

The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling was publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 in order to avoid taxes from athletic commissions.Upon the mentioned statment WWE is just entertainment and pre-planned.
