  "content": "In my country presently, we know how important cash has become, the government decide to renew our Fiat currency and it's not in circulation yet, for some reasons, some people believe that it was intentional because they don't want some bad actors to use Fiat to rig the ongoing election in the country.But since all this mess have started, many people are suffering, and I as a person have no hold the new fiat Note because I can't get a hold of one yet, and just because many stores prefer Cash than digital transfer, this have make me see how important Fiat currency can be.Some people will say that Fiat is trash and they keep all their money in stable coins, the truth of this is you are doing things wrong, the stable coins in crypto space are backed by nothing, they can vanish into thin air if the government doesn't want stable coins to exists.I believe that all stable coins are easier to trample on by the government, more than other crypto projects in this space, Fiat has it's usefulness, let's stop deceiving ourselves, the first time I ever purchased Bitcoin I use Fiat and I believe this is the same as everybody on here, unless you mine your own Bitcoin or get paid in Bitcoin working online. Do not trash Fiat yourself when it's actually needy, crypto and Fiat must co-exists until the government decide to go digital with Fiat themselves, and Fiat is not trash.",

I agree with you, we all need fiat money for our everyday life, without it it's very hard to function normally in most countries. But there is a difference between using fiat money to pay our bills and expenses every month and saving large amounts of money in currencies that are losing it's value over time. In my country we have at the moment inflation rates of 8-10%, while the bank pays 0.5-1.5% interest on savings account. It makes no sense at all to save money at the moment in a bank account. I would recommend anybody to invest their money instead, stocks and cryptos are two good alternatives. As long as we don't pick the most risky assets the risk of losing a lot of money is not that high. And in case we need some short term money we could always sell some of the assets again.",

Then who said fiat trash.Fiat money is legal in every country, even crazy people don't want to say and throw away fiat, what's more for sane people, crypto is currently still being exchanged for fiat, not all shopping facilities and places in every country carry out transactions with digital currency, fiat is the main basis as a sale/purchase transaction of goods, crypto is only a means of digital currency to be traded on the internet, there is no crypto internet access there is nothing to do, fiat remains, if the internet in this world perishes, fiat will still be used.We all know fiat is a source of needs and the economy of people around the world, the economy develops thanks to the exchange of fiat with goods, not with crypto, so whatever happens fiat remains as usual.",

It's because the stablecoin is also here to stay while also the government is trying to digitize everything governments are also launching CBDC. Of course, cash is still here and will still be useful.Every country today has an economic crisis. We still don't know though where our governments will decide what to do either to ban cash or crypto, best option, however, is just to keep the cash. The advantage is still in cash but keeping BTC is safer.",

Inflation in my country is 41% but still we are dependent on fiat for daily living. Our local currency is going down and there is scarcity of USD in our country. Bitcoin is no doubt a good place to save your earnings but only problem I see here is price volatility that worries me. You have 60$ in you wallet in the morning and by evening they are gone down to 57 or 56$. I think we are running out of options for savings. Despite all odds bitcoin is best option to save your money.",

The economy of some developing countries is cash driven. Their financial transaction is mostly through fiat because online transactions are either low or non-existing. In such countries, you need cash to buy almost everything so keeping your money in cryptocurrencies might do more harm than good. Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against inflation or an investment tool but in these countries fiat is king. Government policies also affect the use of cryptocurrencies. Crypto-friendly governments will also promote the use of cryptocurrencies. And from some indications, the Nigerian government is not friendly.",

But in as much as majority is going cashless and paperless and digital, still though some countries like here still uses cash, specially in developing countries.So it's not as trash as crypto fanboys would think and I guess this is just exaggerated and out of proportions.That's why I have also some cash in my money when I go out although a I have our local cash app here, like Gcash will some money as well in case the store chooses to accept digital payment.

Because the money was in the financing for them.Right now. We got overpriced cars sitting and even if you got good credit, you will get a 10% APR on a used car. So the dealer will need to lower the price slightly just to get you to finance it because they need to take into account the APR.

In addition, in some countries such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela, cash is so worthless that it is a sign that fiat is valuable in the right country in the sense that the exchange rate is high.crypto is a storage that is being enjoyed by many people, besides being profitable, transactions are also easy and fast so that many people switch to the world of crypto but the theft rate is very easy in the digital world, prices are less stable, and the value of money is difficult to predict.

Cash is king is what has traditionally been said, because those who have cash can easily exchange it into goods and services, unlike those who are poor (have no cash) or who have their wealth in other assets that have to be converted into cash in order to be able to spend. Let's think that it is very typical to have people's net worth in their homes and in a retirement fund, which are difficult to access and take time to convert into cash in order to be able to spend.On the other hand, cash is trash from the perspective that it depreciates enormously, as has been mentioned, so to keep a lot of cash makes you poorer. Knowing these two things it is best to have a combination of cash for spending and then investments.",
