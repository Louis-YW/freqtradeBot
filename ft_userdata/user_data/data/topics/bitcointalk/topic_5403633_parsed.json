Also, are you paying in stablecoin or the native token of the project? What is the target number of followers one must have?",

The project is most likely going to fail, you are not going to sell out your project and you will kick out your partner and give him nothing.Why would anyone want to work with you with no promises of ever getting paid? Obviously I could do the same as you and say that I wanted to launch a NFT project and if I sold for 1 million I would give the promoter 100k. But you really think any decent promoter would take a offer like that? Hell no.",

A very good promoter will never accept to promote your project based on the terms you mentioned. If you genuinely want to promote your project, you should set aside money for marketing. It's as important as the project itself, if you want to make 100k$ then you pay an influencer capable of making you that much money.",
