  "content": "Hey all,Second year Bitcoiner here.  Spend most of the time stacking but now have been using for a lot (feels good not feeding the fiat machine). But now I want to help further the Bitcoin economy than just mere buying. So I set up a new marketplace called Camel Road (yes it's based off Silk Road but minus the drugs). The marketplace is dedicated to  up & coming business/side hustles in the following categories: Home Appliances, Fragrances, Food stuff (spices, bagged foods), motors (car parts), textiles (fabrics), tech and services. Commission is at 7% and the modes of payment are Bitcoin (with Lightning option) & Bitcoin CashIf you any questions let me know.Website is here: https://camelroad.net/",

      "body": "Hi,I haven't given up on BitSuuq (now Silicon Exchange). Silicon Exchange is a marketplace focused on electronic and geared towards tinkers and electrical engineers. I wanted to make another marketplace that had more broader options for a wider audience. But because of your comment, I will put more focus on Silicon Exchange and it will be my main focus. I have already changed the payment processor for it to be solely Bitcoin. Thank you for motivating me.",

Did you block some IPs from some countries or something? As far as my internet experience goes with the VPN I use right now, even if they got blocked by some services I still get a notif or explanation about it.How will you guarantee that the buyer won't scam the seller or vice versa btw?",

With enough prep time plus resources you can fool any security measure.Checked Feedbacks are close but still you can get scammed from someone who has a bad time. Even after 10 Years of good standings.",
