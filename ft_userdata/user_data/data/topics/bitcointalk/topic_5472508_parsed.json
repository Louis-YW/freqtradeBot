Now when the country that have been attacked repel the attacks and the UN now comes in the settle the difference you will find out that most times the country that ignite the war finds it difficult to retreat thereby giving the UN no option than to take side with the country that was attacked. Now take a look at Russia and Ukraine war when the UN called for ceasefire did Puttin agree? No. Despite the fact that the both countries are members of the UN but if anyone disobey the call of the UN then they should be ready to bear the brunt. Then in the war between Israel and Hamas, Israel is a member of the UN whereas Palestine is not a member of the UN so in this case you know the reason why the UN is backing the Israelis.",

Nowadays, the images of war can easily reach all of us from the Frontline in a speed which was not possible before, now everyone has a phone and everyone can see civilians being the target and how military operations are carried out. There has been occasions I simply opt not to see anymore for a while and just read.Unfortunately, I do not think there is true neutrality in this conflict by any part, even those international organisms which are supposed to seek for a solution and stop the conflict will have some bias, not as much as people in Israel or Gaza have, though. If you believe you cannot handle so many bad news at this fast pace, both from Ukraine and Gaza, then just disconnect for a while.",

Quote from: Hewlet on November 01, 2023, 10:18:12 PMHas the UN be very neutral In the recent wars happening around the world?Was it them that delivered food trucks on the border of Rafa and Gaza to send food to the Palestinian people that are stuck in the Gaza-Israel war?Quote from: electronicash on November 02, 2023, 06:12:40 AMUN cant do anything when. they can't even send medics there. even if they are there they'd be bombed.I thought that Egypt allowed them to enter the Rafa border to send food and medics/doctors to the wounded ones and people who don't have food left and can't be allowed to get out of the border. Anyway, it's true that they can't do anything about this because if they step in and have their own bias on this war, another country might trigger and join the war because of their own bias. That's why they need to step carefully on how to bring these wars put into an end and they need to set aside the borders that have been made on this one and their sole focus is the victims. But with all and that, it should be peace that should be put at their top priority for all of the nations and the neighboring countries so that the casualties will be stopped and there will be no more innocent victims that will die.",

It would be like trying to separate large fighting dogs with your bare hands. Both these countries don't even want help. Israelis think they can handle it with superior firepower and US assistance.Palestinians are ready to die for the cause and they're prepared for guerilla warfare.

After after the 1984 to 1985 scrambling.of African countries by the world powers, I came to understand that war is always for a business purpose. Whenever there is a war among country, and countries that supposed settled the two conflicting countries will support one side and use it for trading of different commodities. Mostly selling of fish, gun, and other products. The war between Israel and Palestine would have been ended if America called the two parties for a dialogue but they supported Israel. Even UN is not neutral on the war. Though their peace keeping force is managing to settle the two side but there is biass game playing in there. War is always a business platform for others.",

Has the UN be very neutral In the recent wars happening around the world?If you want to follow politics and want to get the in-depth of it, you will get results but at the time you get the full result, you will have been part of them and taking fully part in their game of interest. Every sane human will certainly feel for those that are affected massively by this war, but do they care? Those that needs to intervene are also scared of being attacked or called names in the name of war which can create long lasting relationships to be cut. I don’t know what is really stopping any other people from resisting the attackers and halting the war but I believe it is all about a game of interest.",

How is the UN controlling who controls who They are the ones who are controlling, directly or indirectly involved in the war, one side is helping the other side in various ways, in fact, no one is actually doing the war support, everyone is working for their own interests.The United Nations is the scapegoat number three here because the United Nations does not have enough power to resolve the war with, because if the five permanent powers come up with a two-part cease-fire proposal, the other A party vetoing it would effectively disqualify Palestine and Israel The conflict between the Western world and Russia must first be discussed without stopping and they must hold peaceful talks to prevent their hegemony, then war will automatically break will close automatically Here thousands of civilians are dying children are being killed no one is looking at the humanitarian side everyone is busy with how to prolong the war here media or other What will the institutions do because everything is under their control here USA is directly participating Russia is also indirectly helping them how will they stop the war and UN will take action how to take action now The rest of the world should come together to recast the UN Security Council and the Governing Council and arrange for the new members to adopt a permanent path, or else a permanent five If the system should be canceled then it will be easier to solve the problem by forcing the two countries to sit together and fulfill the law. Moreover, the UN has nothing to do now. One thing is to support the American side Apart from appeasing the Palestinian side in the name of humanitarian aid, they are doing nothing and cannot do anything else, what should be done by Palestine and Israel through negotiations.",

Yesterday, United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken didn't drop any of such words rather to sympathize with the people killed, families injured and refugees. He more or less supported isreal chase for where the Gaza weapons are which is the reason Israel kept bumping civilian hide outs including hospitals, schools, ambulance etc. From the look of things, a seize fire is not around the corner for now except something changed.",

The situation in Gaza is dire and the UN and other international organizations must do more to protect civilians caught in the crossfire. The United Nations and its refugee agency must intensify their efforts to provide aid and protection to vulnerable residents of Gaza. It is imperative that all parties to the conflict comply with international humanitarian law and take all necessary measures to prevent harm to innocent civilians. The world cannot stand idly by while the people of Gaza suffer this devastating violence. Immediate steps are needed to end the crisis and bring lasting peace to the region.",

Once a major player like the U.S. jumps in, you can bet it's not just gonna be just fine. Their actions have this domino effect, pulling in allies like NATO and stretching the whole thing to last way longer than it probably would've otherwise. It's like a game of shifting interests, where one move in one region affects what's happening on the other side of the planet.

In my country i always experience politicians of different political parties come on air to abuse them selves, you'd feel like the two politicians will be sworn enemies for life, but you'd be very surprised that one day if their interests aligns, perhaps one of them decamps to the opposition party or there's a common loot to share, they'd shamelessly become best friends, smiling and hugging on national tv. So I think that there's not much differences when it comes to the national levels, I believe that nations will support a fellow country in conflict with another, based on their interest in their supporting country.",
