It can be considered to be the bedrock on which success can be built.Before you can be decisive in cryptocurrency, you have to have a certain level of confidence in yourself from what you could be able to offer to yourself, many of us won't be decisive because we are too dependent in whatever we do, being decisive begins from how you're able to allign to learning, having new ideas and being innovative, if we know nothing, am sorry we cannot make any decisions on our own talkless of it standing.Quote from: RioBlemz on August 14, 2023, 07:39:35 PMIn addition, If there are possible decision you know one can take that would be of benefit feel free to share.If you can dream it then you can achieve it, learning is the begining of it all, which is the first step of what should be seek after, when you get it then you're independent and can be decisive.",

      "body": "Because of greed, I was able to make hasty decisions that made me regretting in the end. That was the time when I never realized that bitcoin is only for patient people, aside from the fact that it’s a long term investment due to its highly volatile and unstable market condition. That time, I end up losing consistently until I realized I have to take a different perspective about bitcoin. Perhaps that was happening too because what I invest is never a small amount, but I jump on investing big that is obviously not an amount I can easily afford to lose. Now I’ve learned my lesson to take one step at a time, and to never expect too much from bitcoin especially if you are just a beginner investor in the market.",

      "body": "If it applies across every area of crypto investment, then I can say that the most important is deciding how long you want to hold your coin, the price at which you want to sell it, and the goal at which you want to archive with it after you have met your desired profit in the crypto investment. Secondly,  decisiveness on the coin or token one wants to invest in. There are some people who wish to invest, particularly in Bitcoin, but along the way, they get misled to invest in some altcoin projects, probably because of the promise of high APY from staking. Just last year, a guy wanted to invest in Bitcoin with about $3200 capital, but his friends convinced him to invest that amount with one defi project because of their 40% APY. But today, his investment is not even up to $67, even with all the compounded tokens from his APY. So, I just think investors should be decisive about the coin they want to invest in and also let every investor have a certain amount they wish to sell, so that if the market price falls, they wouldn't panic to sell, and if the price rise, they wouldn't be too quick to sell for just a little profit.",

I tend to agree with this.Jumping in with huge investments without a solid understanding of the market dynamics and risk management might lead to significant losses and then learning the importance of patience and a long-term perspective is spot on. Because IMO, being a beginner investor in the cryptocurrency market comes with a learning curve and there's no shortcut, it's important to gather knowledge and seek advice from experts to gain experience.",

Especially in the realm of crypto investment/trading, it is certain that the rush will destroy it. As you (OP) said, buying coins or crypto assets, but in terms of analysis or in terms of information that is still lacking or immature, that's for sure, it's likely that taking such actions will harm yourself. So the point is a feeling of haste, indeed it must be avoided, especially when it is related to money. And apart from the feeling of haste, the traits that you should avoid are greed, laziness, and inattentiveness. In the world of investment or crypto trading, this attitude must be avoided.QuoteHas there been anytime you made a proper decision with your cryptocurrency or improper decision, what was the decision you took and was it successful?To be honest, as long as I have been involved in trading and investing in crypto, I am grateful that I always do the right thing. The exact meaning here, I have never experienced a big loss. Then for small losses, I don't consider it.Then the action that I considered appropriate, I used to decide to invest directly in bitcoin. so from the start I didn't get confused about memecoins or altcoins, but I immediately put the money I had in bitcoin assets. And as a result, if I sell the bitcoin that I currently have, I already have a profit. But for now I'm not going to sell it first, because I'm waiting for the bull run market or the upcoming bitcoin halving.QuoteIn addition, If there are possible decision you know one can take that would be of benefit feel free to share.The most certain and the most accurate. For these years buy bitcoins. Because in the next year bitcoin will experience a halving cycle and usually after that the price will increase dramatically. So this year is a golden opportunity to buy bitcoin, because the market price is arguably still not too expensive.",

I could remember when I made hasty and uninformed decisions with my coin and the effect it really has on me it was not a pleasurable one.The proper way to be gain confidence in making decisive decisions as it concerns your investment in cryptocurrency is to give yourself to learning first, when you build a good knowledge about cryptocurrency productive decision making wouldn't be a thing based on guess work and luck for you but would rather be based on your critical analysis and study of the market based on a what you know and addition to experience.QuoteHas there been anytime you made a proper decision with your cryptocurrency or improper decision, what was the decision you took and was it successful? Do well to share your experience with us and possibly lesson we can learn From it If my memory serves me right I can remember around november last year someone told me about a landed property that was put on sale asking if I might be interested to buy, of which I was due to the location. But at that period what was at hand with me was just half the total amount the land is put up to be sold.Then I thought about withdrawing part of my BTC to make up for the total amount because the land was in a good location which I don't think I'll like to miss buying and the price was good too as the owner was selling in distress. While I was thinking of withdrawing some of my coins I had a second thought of taking a loan to fill in for the total amount for the land, considering that by the next 6months above from when I take the loan bitcoin should have rise in price from the $16k it was at that time.To cut the whole story short, I took the decision of taking the loan to get the land instead of withdrawing my coins cause that wasn't my initial plans for it, then it wasn't long before bitcoin price rose above $29k by  May 2023 and I was able to earn some profits from it that I used to pay off nearly 95% of the loan amount I took. Before taking such decision I had to weigh the odds after critical analysing the chart based on my level of knowledge and in addition to the bitcoin bull run in anticipation which gave me the confidence to go on with my decision for a loan. But that doesn't mean I didn't had a back up plan from my salary on a monthly percentage reduction for  servicing my loan just in case things go south. (Always have a backup plan).",

I wanted to make profit and was continuously buying when the price goes down a bit and then sell when the price moves up a bit thinking that I’ll make a lot of profit in the end. But at the end of the day, I was not able to retrieve my capital back. It was a lesson I learnt and since then I came to know about DCA method, which has been favourable and you don’t need to panic about your funds when you’re saving for long term.",

I was advised by some persons that I thought were knowledgeable about the Bitcoin market to sell off my coin because they predicted that the price will keep dropping and not recover. It was a decision I had to take within one day. The only place I got the right information was in this forum because the media was filled with FUD-triggering news. I kept reading posts here and I ended up not selling my Bitcoin. Today I am happy I took the right decision to keep my investment.",
