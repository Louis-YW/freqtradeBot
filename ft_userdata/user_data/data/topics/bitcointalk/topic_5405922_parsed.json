The bearish sentiments are definitely high among investors and traders, but calling it the worst ever Bitcoin bear market seems like a bit of a reachQuote from: TeslaWatt.com on July 11, 2022, 08:03:17 PMThe number of hodlers not selling ever under extreme market conditions has become higher than in previous bearish markets.As the Bitcoin market grows, investors have lots of history to understudy and this would definitely influence their resolve to hold or cut their losses. Much earlier when Bitcoin was still a very novel concept and there were lots of uncertainties about it, it was much more difficult to actually hodl than it is now.",

I do not think $17.8k was, or is, the lowest point we will see.Just some random ramblings to keep in the back of your mind, the 2017 peak was just shy of $20k and the last peak in late 2021 was $69k (lets call it $70k for our simple thought experiment.)So the difference in peaks between the two last bull markets was on the order of $70k/$20k or about 3.5x.The low between the peaks was around $3200 (Dec 2018). So if we use the same multiplier of 3.5x on the low, we would see a new low of roughly $11,200 this time around.Of course this is all just guesswork, but it does help to keep history in mind before becoming too confident in any bottom predictions.Myself I would be more comfortable placing buys once the price gets closer to the $11k area than the rather lofty $17.8k region. Another thought is since $10k is a major psychological level, we would perhaps test that if BTC does get down that far, so even $11k is probably a bit high to hope for a true bottom, perhaps we might see some dips down in the $9k's.Anyway DCA is your friend, but I would start investing very lightly at what I consider these high ($17k) estimates of BTC's bottom.",

An image that anyone can make with Paint.I'm not saying it's fake, but I'm skeptical of this data. It reminds me of the number of times since a year ago that I've seen the news that the number of Bitcoins leaving the exchanges (supposedly for HODL) just keep growing. I remember seeing a news story about it 3 or 4 times just before it dropped in price.",

The reason why price dropped is because the dumps are sudden and big where whales and panic sellers sell a large amount of bitcoin in a very short time but the buys are slow and spread over time.Besides if as you said bitcoin is leaving exchanges then it is supporting exactly what I said that people are buying bitcoin and moving it to their cold storages.

Now it is not the same, market is driven by all level of hodlers. In the past whales have the major contribution. Same as that we have cyclic market for stocks, here too similar thing is happening on four year cycle.The price that reached ath during the year 2017 month of November further started to drop and the next ath was reached during the year 2020. Later once again the growth continued reaching the ath in the year 2021. So, a four year cycle is on process. Upon which the market will move in a stable manner and the bullish moves would take time. So, realising this the people might've started to accumulate. This too can be a reason for increase in number of hodlers than selling.",

That's why they prefer to trust a company.The hardcore crypto traders/investors, who are inside the crypto world for several years, got disappointed by the crypto exchanges, so they are moving their coins out of them.In summary, increasing the amount of coins in crypto exchanges can be seen as a bullish indicator, while coins moving from exchanges to cold storage is more like neutral. The argument of this process actually increasing the number of HODLers isn't completely valid, because those investors could potentially their sell the coins, which are stored in their cold wallets.",
