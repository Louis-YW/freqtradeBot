The only reason I can think to keep it that way, would be as a contribution or tribute to SimpleMachines for powering the forum with their software...I wouldn't bet on that as there's already credit in the footer, but it's possible. It would be a nice touch if it is implemented correctly. I support the idea!",

I honestly didn't pay much attention to that sign since I registered (I think a lot of other users did too) because yeah the display isn't that flashy. While I stand by the OP's request, I don't mind it being considered longer. I think it's better to make the board inside the sub-board more visible.",
