      "body": "The creator of Bitcoin is unknown. The identity of the person or group of people who created Bitcoin is a mystery, as they went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies, which are issued by central banks, Bitcoin has no central authority or government backing, and its supply is controlled by an algorithm.since then, the network has grown and evolved, and Bitcoin has become a popular and valuable digital currency.You can follow :https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/bitcoin",

      "body": "Quote from: Izibemanime on December 13, 2022, 03:15:23 PMI am new here and I really want to know more about it, my neighbor just introduced me to itBitcoin is a very broad topic that, to fully comprehend, you need to be knowledgeable in dozens of disciplines, such as economics, cryptography, mathematics, programming languages,  game theory, monetary history, philosophy, politics, etc. In other words, it is almost impossible for an individual to be an expert in this field, to understand bitcoin fully in order to be able to answer any possible questions that may come up. It is the reason why it is sometimes better to focus on things that you are really interested in and for which you have the required skills to master. If you are an economist, then you should learn how bitcoin solves the problem of traditional monetary systems; if you are a programmer, then you should consider investing your time and effort into bitcoin's source code improvement; if you have no skills, then it is a good time to start learning because the world with bitcoin is a very interesting place to live.In my opinion, a good starting point will be reading the following books:The history of bitcoin:https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Gold-Bitcoin-Millionaires-Reinvent/dp/006236250Xhttps://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WMThe economics of bitcoin and monetary history:https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861The mechanics of bitcoin:https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Bitcoin-Technology-Decentralized-Explained/dp/1794326316https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388",

But you've come to the right place to learn about cryptocurrency. Participate in the forum and follow the rules.The thing is I wouldn't say these are reliable sources. Depending on what Youtube videos you watch, it could be a spool of lies or misinformation even if it's not intentional. So, I'd avoid Youtube videos unless they've been peer reviewed enough. There's simply just too much content out there that's just plain wrong. Books are generally the best place to start as they've had enough people peer review it. The native language barrier could be a problem in that, but I still think Youtube videos aren't the best place to go about learning Bitcoin.",

I also approved books as recommendation for a start, there are books you can download online about bitcoin, learn from them and read through the forum discussions boards about bitcoin, but OP has to be the type that likes reading provided that if he finds it an interest, learning about something may comes with it own challenges but it worth giving time and listening ears, language here couldn't be a barrier to that extent if OP understand English or if his local languages has a google translation, OP can also check the locales we have here on the forum maybe his own country or language is included.",
