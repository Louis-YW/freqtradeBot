  "content": "Hi all! In the last article, I looked at how to create accounts in SandBox and how to make money on season 3.In this article, I want to continue to develop this topic and analyze the rather hype SunFlower project.This project is GameFi, that is, a game with decentralized finance. Such games have their own economy based on cryptocurrency.The main asset in this game is land in the form of NFTs, land is a must to start the game. Now the token has sunk, like the rest of the crypt, so it’s very profitable to buy yourself a coupleIn this article we will understand:1. How to create multiple accounts without the threat of a ban2. How to buy land for each accountReading time 5 minutes!TrainingSo, we need to bypass the lock.Creating your first account is easy. Just register, follow the instructions and that's it.Another question, what if we need a lot of accounts? Like 10?Why they get banned in Sunflower:1. Using one IP of many accounts2. Using the same browser for multiple accountsThe rules are strict. One player has only one account. Bots and multi-accounting are prohibited. It will not work on a regular computer without manipulation to have several accounts. Having multiple lands is not forbidden, but you can only play on one. That is, you can buy land for resale, but you can’t farm on them.But the rules are easy to get around.What we need to not be blocked:1. Anti-detect browser - it will hide our digital fingerprint, change the browser data as if it were a completely different device and browser. In addition, they are very convenient for using multiple profiles and proxies. You can open several profiles at the same time, it is convenient to name them and always understand what kind of account it is. Next, I will analyze in detail how to configure it, we will use GoLogin2. Proxy - to change the IP, each of our accounts must be unique. Therefore, we will buy paid proxies, using free ones there is a huge chance of a ban, because other players can also use them. You will ban yourself from the land and get nothing from the game. https://proxy6.net/3. MetaMask - you will definitely need it as a browser extension. How to install, configure and use will be discussed below.Now that we have installed the browser, bought a proxy, we proceed to the very configuration of all this goodness and registration in SunFlower.Creating SunFlower Accounts1.     Register on the browser site  https://app.gologin.com/#/sign_up2.     We go according to our data and start creating a new profile. Click New Profile3.     Buy a proxy https://proxy6.net/order4.     Set any name for the profile (you will need this for convenience, then you can rename the profile) and connect the proxy5.      Click Create Profile - our profile has been created6. Click the Run button7. Download the MetaMask extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=ru8. Install the extension and register9. Create a wallet10. Save your passphrase11. Confirm Sid phrase12. Our MetaMask is ready13. Go to the game website and click Beta14. MetaMask opens. Click Next15. Next Connect16. It remains to connect Polygon17. Click Add and follow the instructions in MetaMask18. We agree and sign the contract.19. We have registered, we won’t be able to buy the land now, the developer simply doesn’t have itThere are a total of 152,300 lands in the game, they are NFTs, so they can be bought on opensea. Also, it will be possible to sell it there in the future, as well as gaming NFTs, these are various decorations or useful things.20. Go to opensea and enter SunFlower in the search21. Open the field Accounts22. We see the cheapest land with a red markYou shouldn’t take them, you won’t get income from them in the future and you won’t sell them for more.These lands were banned for violating the rules that we considered at the beginning, so we scroll further.Grey lands - not verified. That is, they have not yet been checked for the presence of a bot or multi-accounting, so it is gray. If you buy it for yourself, then in 2-4 weeks it will become active and increase in price.Colored ones are activated lands.Before buying, you need to look at the land itself and understand its merits.It is important that all the beds are open, there may also be something in the inventory.23. Go to the land you like24. Click to look in Sunflower and we are transferred to the gameHere is our land.As you can see, the beds are open, there are seedlings.The inventory is not completely empty.If you like everything, we buy on the opensea website.The land is now ours - we can start farming.What to do next?We registered an account, bought the first land and are not afraid of blocking. We are protected from all sides.We cannot be detected by hardware, the browser cleans everything up for you, changing your digital fingerprint.We can not be calculated by IP, the proxy has changed it.For a developer, we are different people, playing on different devices from different parts of the world. You don't have to be afraid of the block.Therefore, now we begin to repeat the actions that have already been done.We buy a proxy, create a new browser profile, a new metamask, etc.Then you can decide for yourself what to do.Farm and sell everything on the otc exchange?Please!Do you want to keep the land, then to sell them on the hype? - Please.All paths to SunFlower Land are open for you.Summarize:In GameFi projects, you cannot use multi-accounting - for this you will be banned, if they are calculated, of course.Play, earn, enjoy!Thanks for reading and good luck!",
