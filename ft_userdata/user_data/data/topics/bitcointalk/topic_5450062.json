  "content": "A small Cloud Mining page (https://www.cryptoatcost.com/) that spun off from a Canadian VPS provider (https://www.cloudatcost.com/) is making their own ERC20 token: CCT (https://www.cryptoatcost.com/cct-token). But this isn't a coin announcement: I'd like to know if what they're doing is an obvious scam.Although Etherscan does show the contract was made a few months ago, and they appear to have a Uniswap LP... they also said you'll be able to mine it using BTC ASICs. How would that work? I'm thinking they could actually be taking the hashpower to mine BTC for themselves... and then on the side they just directly distribute their worthless token? If they own the entire supply... then there's no PoW involved: they can just hand it out?The mining part isn't working yet: they just told current customers about the token today. I just don't see how they'll make money.Thanks!",

      "body": "Definitely some sort of scam because there is no possible way ASIC being sed for bitcoin mining algorithm can miraculously start mining ERC20 blockchain algorithm. There is vast difference between the two. That’s why they are called as Application Specific Integrated Circuits and they would be programmed to mine bitcoin algo itself. Most of PoW in ERC used entirely different algorithm which can easily be mined with simple graphic processing unit or sometimes CPU with 4+ cores. Anyways I do not want to get into the technical stuff because it’s entirely different subject of interest. What you are explaining is simply not possible and that’s why we can call it a scam. Also, why would anyone want to generate their own tokens? Just for fun? What would you do with them?",

It's most likely that they will just hand out those tokens that they already minted out of thin air. It's a reward scheme that aims to attract the gullible and greedy people to put their money into their imaginary miners.",

And anything associated these days with cloud mining, it's like 99.9% of them are an outright scam.And if there are a few of them that are genuine, I mean they really are few and be counted by your bare hands.",

It exists only in their web UI: can't withdraw it, can't swap it, can't sell it, can't use it to pay for any of their services. But you can stake it for 1-year terms.

There's no market force that could give it value. As a rule of thumb, cloud mining is ALWAYS a scam. If there would be real legit cloud mining, it would be so unprofitable to buy from a third party that no one would be interested. There has been so many of these cloud mining scams and even icos that i lost count long time ago. But they come in waves, when enough new people don't know about them and old timers forgot to warn the new ones, they will score some new \"investors\" again.",

At that time, there were a lot of bitcoin cloud mining service providers on the market and most of them ended up being scams after a few months.
