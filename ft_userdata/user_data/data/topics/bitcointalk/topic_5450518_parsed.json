It's only using a history basis so it's a risk. A good example is the game last night Denver Nuggets versus Phoenix Suns. The Nuggets are known to score 120+ points and it's on paper that they win most of their game at that score. No hard injuries happened, just CP3 hurting his groin but the known offensive players are still available. The starting line Over and Under was 228.5 if I remember it right. I didn't take that bet after what I saw in Game 1 where the Suns only scored 100. Thankfully, I was right, they only scored 87 yesterday, Game 2. It could help for a good basis, but for those who will bet, always check the rosters first and analyze how the game could end up especially now in the playoffs where defense is hardcore and refs are not calling soft fouls which means the time keeps on ticking down.",

This is the disadvantage of using this kind machine since the parameters of prediction is set by human and it needs to be updated regularly. The problem is if the developer doesn’t bother updating all those factor that you mention that will gives a huge impact in the game.I don’t think the presence of CP3 will not gonna give that much impact on the game for Suns to win. They are still managing to fight Nuggets side by side on 3rd quarter until some point on Q4. Their scorer is just shutdown badly by Nuggets defense. Anyway this is already for the NBA thread.Quote from: danherbias07 on May 02, 2023, 03:05:37 PMIt could help for a good basis, but for those who will bet, always check the rosters first and analyze how the game could end up especially now in the playoffs where defense is hardcore and refs are not calling soft fouls which means the time keeps on ticking down.Agree, we should always check the actual condition of the game before we made any bet on the matches. I experience this in the past which I place pre match bet with the Bucks. I’m too excited to place bet since Bucks has a higher odds while they are the top team. I just realized during the game that Giannis is injured that’s why the odds is so high for them.",

I think this is a great tool to help gamblers predict which team to bet on, NBA's not really anybody's game so there's bound to be teams that will statistically rise to the top which the Machine's Algorithm's probably getting a hold of. For other types of betting that are pretty circumstantial this wouldn't really work well. But for reliably predicting who's gonna win? I think that's more than enough. I say you take it for a spin OP. Let us know how your win rate's gone and make it a little scientific too so we can really say for certain that  the algorithm is working, perhaps make a small bet without using the algorithm vs using it in a set span of time, and then let us know how it did.",

Even with AI projects, existing data are only the basis of the information or the limit eith the information, such software would be processing. With ML in gambling, I am not really into it. I would more enjoy losing because of my decision than to rely with the generated data in particular with the outcome. Also, losing is more certain in gambling and I won't be happy winning because a tool just helped me. It could also promote an advantage over those who do not have the tesources to access MLs.

Even if it's just able to tease out better performance or possibly compare more data points in the long run. Even boosting the winning prediction percentage by one or two points extra could be very beneficial for players and start to balance the odds of sportbooks. It will definitely be interesting to follow a long someone making predictions that are actually based on an intelligent model, rather than random guessing by someone who follows the sport but is susceptible to blind spots in their knowledge like everyone else.",

The only credible source that we get from this machine was only the stats, everything else may not be available unless this machine is well maintained and updated every time there are changes from the teams in the NBA in general. One important factor to look at when placing a bet is the injury updates and player availabilities. This machine could also be a good source to analyse a match but of course it could be accompanied with manual research to make it more effective.",
