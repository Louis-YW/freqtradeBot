      "body": "Activity can never be converted to merit, nor will merit be converted to activity, but merit and activity are very vital for ranking up, as they both work hand in hand in order for you to obtain a new rank, so you need both to qualify for whatever rank you desire. Activity happens to be updated from your posts made in your account, and it's updating 14 activities every 14 days. No matter the number of posts that you make, only 14 posts will be converted to activity every 14 days. In that way, the merit system is to separate those who shitpost from those who make quality posts, as you need to make something meaningful either as a reasonable question or contribute positively in order to earn some merit, which will qualify you to gain a new rank. Like Charles said, it was in the past before the merit system was introduced; that's when those who already had attained a certain rank were airdropped with a certain amount of merit, which could qualify them for keeping the rank active. Aside from them, there is no airdrop merit again that I have ever read off in the forum unless for the (s) merit given to the merit source.",

Anytime you post within this period, your will get that activity but will not increase until you post, most times when you see profiles that have activity and post the same number, is because they have been making atleast a post in this period, my profile as I'm replying you will be having 166 posts and 166 activity and that is because I have been making at least a single post in between the previous periods.Merit on the other hand is what you get when another member reward your post and for every merit you received, you can only send out half of it to another person. Meaning, when you receive 2 merit, you will have 1 Smerit to send to another users when you see their post.your ranking depends on the relationship between your merit needed and activity. For example, to be a newbie, you need to have 1 activity and zero which you already have. To get a junior member rank, you need 30 activity and 1 merit and many more to legendary rank.",

And it's not possible for your activity to transform into merits. Not anymore. Since the merit system was introduced, you have to earn them by contributing quality post to the forum. Your activities counts every 14 days a total of 14, so long you create some post. If you are inactive your activity won't count.You may want to read this quote from theymos on how the merit system works.Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMIn addition to activity, everyone now has a merit score, and you need both a certain activity level and a certain merit score in order to reach higher member ranks. The required scores are:RankRequired activityRequired meritBrand new00Newbie10Jr Member301Member6010Full Member120100Sr. Member240250Hero Member480500LegendaryRandom in the range 775-10301000You get merit points when someone sends you some for one of your posts. Additionally, when someone sends you merit points, half of those points can be sent by you to other people.Certain users are designated as \"merit sources\". They can create new merit out of nothing, up to a limited number per month (which differs per source). I will not be posting a definitive list of merit sources (so that people don't bug them too much), though you'll soon figure out who they are if you pay attention.There is currently no such thing as a \"demerit\". I'm hoping that the positive merits alone will be fine. I could add demerits pretty easily later on if necessary, though.",

No, the number of activity you get no fit transfer to merit. Activity dey calculated by how much posts you make for the forum and as a newbie, e go dey count per post till you get to a certain level where e go dey take two weeks to add up. Merits are gotten as a result of when you make quality posts, you solve a problem or according to how e dey the giver for bodi but I go like advise you make you no put how to hurriedly get merits for front else e go make you start to dey create posts wey for no add value. The forum no get any particular time limit for a certain user to get to a certain rank wey go make you dey in a hurry to meet up or something. Although it depends on the motive for registering on the forum Sha but still on still e go beta make you no rush things because that way you fit lose courage if the merits no dey come. When you dey make your posts no carry for mind say you must get merits else e go come dey make you dey do eye service for where these big ogas Dem dey and e no go fit allow you do yourself; no originality or effort.",

As members for dis thread don explain give you, activity de de updated every 14 days, meaning say fourteen of your posts go court as your activity, no matter di amount of posts wey you make. Some of your posts fit to de rejected and dem no go count for your activity, I believe say di activity de help to immediately know how many days wey you don de for di forum, dat is if you de active for di forum, exception of those wey dem merit pass activity. Lastly if your merit pass activity, e fit slow you down to rank up, unit your activity increase reach di certain level. Merit na di main koko to rank you up for di forum, na im de determine your rank up for di forum. Somebody don share the chart to show how many merit wey you go get to reach a higher rank and di title of di rank. You no fit merit your sef for di forum, na anoda member wey get smerit to give fit merit your posts. If a member see your post and im like wetin you you write, maybe the quality of your post or di style wey you take deliver di post, im fit reward you with merit. Na so di matter be, as I sabi reach.Good luck to you as you don emberk on di journey to ranking up.",

      "body": "People wey dey here don already talk Everything you need to know, one thing I fit just add am be say, no matter the merit wey people give you if your activities never meet up wetting Dem demand you no fit still ranked up. The platform dey smarter than you think. For example you no fit jump from newbie enter member If your activities never reach 60activities and minimum of 10merits and also if your activities no reach 120activeties 100merits you no ft qualify for full member even though say you get 500merit and your activities count never reach wetting them need that means you still dey lower rank. So as a newbie you need to get like 30 activities to comot from newbie that is 1month. Then 2 months for junior member. 4month for full member and each one of them get there minimum merit to reach the rank you need just like@hatchy don already put for up👆",

The merit is being awarded to you by fellow members of this forum who found your contributions worthy enough. It is a credit you get for your efforts trying to solve problems by proffering solutions to the questions asked here.I can decide to give you a merit if I have some sMerits after you must have impressively solved my problem and that's the simple understanding of merit. the sMerit also know as sendable merit is more like 50% of merits you get starting from 2 merits since 1 merit will be half and there's not half merit in the merit system. These merits then go on to further give you leverage to rank up in the forum ranking system after you must have also attained some level of activities in the forum. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2766177.0There are a number of members on this forum who have more merits than their activities, so if an activity = merit, what would you say about those members?

Any way merit is easy to get, and higher rank is attainable as long as you have quality post and also quality replies. You can have a quality comment when you contribute something that was helpful, find a solution or some advice to a difficult situation/problem, disagree with someone that seems to be striking a point that is not valid especially when you have a different view on it. Merit can only be given to you by other members of the forum when they find your post or comment satisfying then it can be worth merit. OP you don't have to focus your mindset on the merit because as i know that you have the urge to rank up as fast, but it will take a little time and it is stage by stage. As you continue to progress on your rank you will find out that you have known more than you know when you initially joined the forum. Stay consistent and abide to the rules, it is the key to your success in this. forum.",

Your activities na from your accepted posts for two weeks, and na only 14 post the forum dey accept wey go come turn to activity, so inside two weeks if you post 25 things na only 14 go add up to you activity. While for your merit side na if you post something wey dey very interesting to the reader then the person fit send you merit, and mind you we still get wattin dem dey call smerit= sendable merit. So every merit wey go get the half of that number of merit go give you the sendable, so if person send you 1 merit na 1/2 go dey you smerit portfolio and if dem send you 2 na 1 go dey, just like that to any number. And the smerit you no go fit use am do any thing than to send am give person for em post wey you like.",
