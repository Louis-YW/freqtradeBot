Easy to use? Fees?I have not tried swapping on ethereum network before, but I guess the fee could be pretty high as the fee for making transaction is much on ethereum blockchain. It can be be very easy to use, and safe if the dex used is safe.Although, I can not recommend the wallet.",

It's a non custodial wallet, but still it doesn't a good wallet if you plan to hold your coins for long term.",
