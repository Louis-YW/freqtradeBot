  "content": "I almost got into a very smart and dangerous trap, well how this all started was from a job hiring offer on twitter where everything seems normal and legit. playmisterium asking for Community moderators ,Managers and testers so I applied for that offer and the next day I got a dm from their recruiter asking me if I'm interested in that job position and i will start 2 days of trial program before getting paid.Everything seem to be cool and that person is an official recruiter on their official discord server.What made things very suspicious is she asked me to download their game and launch it on my pc, before I open it i had to run a virus scan on that file thankfully I did that before launching it and get ripped off. this is their official website : Code:https://playmisterium.com/and these are some screenshots as proofs I tried to find out if anyone been scammed by them before I found this on twitterAlso if there is anyone who can tell us what kind of viruses they infected the file with? if it's possible uploaded on google drivePassword: playmisterium I hope people get more carful about the new scam methods",

Not a bad scam attempt indeed, and something that many would fall for. That's actually similar to how many of those YouTubers lost their channels that were later used for fake Elon Musk/Vitalik Buterin/etc giveaways. Scammers contact YouTubers asking them whether they are interested in advertising their product (usually some software), but before proceeding they of course ask them to download it so they can test it. Ignorant influencers of course accept the offer, download the program and then lose the access to their YT channel which is then used for scamming other people.",

Surely he got hacked the way you just explained Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on February 06, 2023, 09:38:27 PMIt's good you scanned the file before executing it otherwise you would have ended up spreading malware to your PC.I would have downloaded it and then tried scanning it using virus total, but their file limit is 650MB, the executable of the so-called game is 656MB. Maybe they did make it slightly bigger intentionally so that no one can try scanning using virustotal   Fortunately yes because i thought like why they ask me to download their game when i should be moderating their community that doesn’t make any sense. And when i said that the game doesn’t work they banned me. Which made me so sure it’s a scamQuote from: coin-investor on February 06, 2023, 09:57:03 PM Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on February 06, 2023, 09:38:27 PMIt's good you scanned the file before executing it otherwise you would have ended up spreading malware to your PC.I would have downloaded it and then tried scanning it using virus total, but their file limit is 650MB, the executable of the so-called game is 656MB.

Haha that’s one more reason that made me doubt them more the file is just slightly bigger for the most famous scanning file viruses website. I had to run the scan in another website. I don’t run any antivirus on my computer but i never download any file from unknown sources. I learned a valuable lesson before",

Further, unknown programs are considered risky and must not be run on a PC where they store and do important stuff. If for some reason, one needs to dabble into it, always try to compartmentalize.",

They are smart because people looking for jobs will do anything to get the position and also they game me a very tempting salary and made it look great.Quote from: albon on February 07, 2023, 04:25:53 PMYes, this is a game that contains a trojan virus, and indeed, I found many warnings from users on Twitter whose devices have been hacked by people who send DMs to hire testers after they download the Misterium game.Now they changed their story to hiring community manager and designers. Once you fill the google form a recruiter wil dm you and give you some rules and ask if you agree on them. Then after you agree he will ask you to open an account in some websites of meetings plus they ask you to download their game and open it to get your ID. I believe it's the part where you are going to lose your assets or even your documents in your pc",
