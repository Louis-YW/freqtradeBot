  "content": "I have generated a seed to see how it works in different clients and when I import it into electrum a warning message appears telling me that the seed has been created with bip32 and that they do not guarantee the security of the wallet because it does not follow the electrum standard.It tells me that by not keeping track of the version, they do not ensure compatibility in the future.my question is:Is the creation of the seed with bip32 completely safe??What standard are you referring to that is not contemplated in bip32?thanks in advance.",

      "body": "The seed phrase you are talking about is called BIP39, not BIP32.A 12 word BIP39 seed phrase provides 128 bits of entropy and is secure enough. Do not worry about the safety of your seed phrase.Even if electrum doesn't support BIP39 seed phrases in the future updates, there won't be anything to worry about. There are many other tools that can be used to derive the private keys from a BIP39 seed phrase.",

      "body": "Yes. Normal behavior, Electrum developers are responsible for the Electrum standard, and not for the rest, that's why they don't guarantee their security. In fact, the software won't allow you generate any seed that doesn't follow the Electrum standard. You can read more about it here: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/seedphrase.html",

This BIP explains how you can use the information at one level of the derivation path to derive the necessary information at the next level.If you find that too technical, then you could try here instead: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05.asciidoc#private-child-key-derivationOnce you understand how child key derivation works, then the next thing to read is this: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki. This BIP explains the standard for generating derivation paths.Here's another less technical resource: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths",
