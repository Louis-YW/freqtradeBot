  "content": "Bas ColdkeyAbout 2.5 years ago, user Basorexia created artworks representing Bitcointalk members.(Here is the link to the original thread : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5204109)Towards the end, he offered physical versions of his work.People sent him BTC to arrange an order, but he never shipped a single card and finally vanished after refunding a handful of users.A physical version of these artworks have been highly hoped for, so I have been approached to produce a few custom orders.Given how popular their might be, we have decided to produce them on a regular basis and offer them for sales.Currently, Bas Coldkeys with 20 different artworks are available.Here is the list of different cards that have been produced :– Krogothmanhattan– Minerjones– Owlcatz– Tweetious– Bitcoin Penny– Jcga– Chronicsky– Digicoinuser– Fattcatt– Teegumes– Dobzombie– Agrawas– Hox– Rxalts– Lesbian cow– Chibitcty– Basorexia– Mitchell– Theymos– YoggWe might expand this list with new artworks that are available in the thread started originally by Basorexia.These are denominated with 0.001 BTC (Buyer Funded).Mintage : not finite.Price :- 40 € per Bas Coldkey. (You will get a random one)  >> https://www.coldkey.eu/product/bas-coldkey-random-single/ <<- 640 € for a full set of 20 Bas Coldkeys. >> https://www.coldkey.eu/product/bas-coldkey-full-set-of-20/ <<No further funding is required.New ones are continuously produced in batches having the same serial.When a new batch is broken, we will distribute all the remaining Bas Coldkeys in this batch before breaking a new one.Get yours by placing an order on our shop !>> https://www.coldkey.eu/shop <<",

As for plagiarism, you could also go one step further - I actually \"PAID\" that asshole for my artwork... So... is it \"mine\" now? You see how gray this area is I'm sure ... Anyhow, I know a lot of people who paid that guy BTC, so let him come after CK if he wants, it'd be great to know his full identity!",

I do not see the anonymousminer card - was it made originally by Basoriexia's or only by Coldkey?Some anonymousminer Bas Coldkey exist.Every Bas Coldkey bears a design that can be found in the following thread :https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5204109Quote from: MoparMiningLLC on September 29, 2022, 02:41:31 PM3. Any issue with copying/using Basoriexia's original artwork? No, for the following different reasons :After the Bas fiasco, I have been approached by a few members with custom orders for Bas Coldkeys.I've also gifted a few AP Bas Coldkeys (on Silver cards) to users represented in the artwork.Most of the time, it was merely because I knew these users nicknames on the forum so I could make a relevant gift.Over time as more people become aware that Bas Coldkey are a thing, I kept getting custom orders.This went to the point where it makes sense to acknowledge these and turn them into a series.I don't like the idea of running a \"shadow series\" because I'm fulfilling custom orders around the same theme.Since this thread has been posted, a handful of bitcointalk users for whose Bas made a design approached me.They would like to order some Bas Coldkeys representing \"their\" artworks.Back then I've approached Basorexia to collaborate but they turned me down.I'm more than happy to discuss with Basorexia about options, should they return.Quote from: Lesbian Cow on September 29, 2022, 04:01:02 PMOh wow, just saw this, glad to see these designs back, shame the original artist disappeared with our btc.Great job yogg!Thank you very much LC ! Glad you like them.",

      "body": "Easy now Owlcatz - you are always so harsh. No one is attacking anyone here. I wasn’t accusing it - just asking if permission was obtained. I totally get that people paid and did not get what they paid for - total asshat that guy was. And maybe I used the wrong word - copying is all I meant. Typically regardless of an artists behavior (in Basoriexia's case - being a total douche) and whether you buy the art or not (those that bought art from say cryptoart.com would be frowned upon if they used the art they bought in some other piece and sold say 100 of them - they would heavily be frowned upon - so saying it was paid for gives rights to reuse is not valid imo. Ok so it was originally a Basoriexia for anonymousminer’s card - wasnt sure and didnt see it in your list. All good Yogg - I wasn’t complaining - more or less just curious and have seen it asked in other places - I figured the best place was to ask here and ask directly.That said - I will be on the watch for when there are more full sets to order.",
