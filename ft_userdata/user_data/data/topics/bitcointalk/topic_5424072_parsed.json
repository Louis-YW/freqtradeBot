      "body": "Probably the only 'truly' decentralized wallet we have today is Bitcoin Core, along with probably Electrum due to it's diverse contributors. Maybe you're looking for something non-custodial and open-source, rather than actually decentralized? Because a wallet not being decentralized is totally fine.Also, I don't think it's possible to have a decentralized wallet and have a debit card connected.",

Trust wallet claimed that they are non-custodial and open source. However, I have not verified it in any way. Another thing to consider is that if you connect your debit or credit card, you will not be able to use it without the involvement of a third party. Credit card purchases or transactions will not be made directly on non-custodial wallets. You should use a hardware wallet, but you will need a third party to connect your cards.",

Some people believe that there is no good decentralized wallet app, while others believe that there are a few good options. It is hard to say which is the best option, as there are so many different options available. Some of the best-decentralized wallet apps include Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Wallet, and Exodus. These apps are all very reliable and offer a lot of features.https://bestproductsreviews.net/mechforex/",

If not i think it should be The software itself cannot be decentralized because the code doesn't care about who is going to run it: it can be either a centralized entity or a community forming a consensus in a decentralized manner. Take the bitcoin community, for example, the decentralization in bitcoin is possible not because the software is designed in a certain way but because the community consists of people who have incentives to defend the principles encoded in bitcoin. Bitcoin has no centralized team of decision-makers, it has no marketing department to increase awareness and speed up global adoption, and it has no people in charge: everyone who joins the bitcoin community does it absolutely voluntarily. If you keep your bitcoins in cold storage, you can be sure that no one can take them from you; you are being defended by a strong community of supporters of decentralization. Now compare it to holding USDT in a wallet: your transactions can be censored, your addresses can be frozen, and the account of the issuer can be deleted by Fed. There is no decentralization, there is no hope, and the future is uncertain.",

If not i think it should be You seem to be trying to combine the incompatible, expecting to get a completely decentralized application with the ability to connect a debit card. Here you have to choose one of two. You can also separate these 2 functions: store the bulk of your savings in a decentralized wallet, and use another wallet for current needs, which will be able to connect bank cards. Why is this not a solution? This makes it even safer.",
