      "body": "No one can accurately tell what will happen next in the market but if it be bear market then itÂ  might come with so much shakings and won't be surprising if many exchange go bankrupt because most of them are operating on loans. The advice over time has been not your keys, not your coin been our own bank. Even in bull market leaving one's portfolio in a centralise exchange keeps one at high risk because hackers will definitely be on the increase so as to steal from exchanges working with more sophisticated tools. Any coin that isn't meant for trading or immediate swap is best kept off exchanges and for trading, reputable exchange is always the most preferred. Because the initial idea of the whole crypto ecosystem was to make individuals their own bank so leaving your coin on exchanges is like forfeiting the whole idea of decentralisation.",

Companies aren't going bankrupt for no reason these days. They go bankrupt because of the economic situation in those countries, for example in Germany they go bankrupt because of the high energy costs and the shortage of it.Exchanges, specially the big ones, are not going to go bankrupt that easily. They mostly go bust when they get hacked.QuoteI have some USDT that I plan to use to buy coins probably when BTC is down to 10k which I believed would happened in September but it never did so I moved the USDT out of the exchange back into my wallet.Do not relent, do not trust any exchange, trust only your private keys, remember, not your keys, not your coins. A much better advice is to not trust anything centralized which includes USDT which is one of the most centralized altcoins that can go bust at any time.P.S. There is no reason for bitcoin go any lower than this.",

Many of them have initial problems that they may overlook, which can be a key problem to the company letter on and they will have no choice but to go bankrupt.That is why proper planning is always recommended; any company or project that has proper planning appears to be very strong and would be difficult to bankrupt easily.QuoteForget about how big a crypto exchange have grown, do not leave your coins on exchange, we can never tell which exchange will go down unexpectedly in this bear market.Do not relent, do not trust any exchange, trust only your private keys, remember, not your keys, not your coins. Although some of the world's leading exchanges are very good and reliable, when it comes to cryptocurrency investment, \"trust no one.\" Those exchanges have total control over all of your investments in their exchanges, and they can also go down or bankrupt at any time, or they can leak your data because you submitted your details for KYC in the exchange.Keep your coins in your personal wallet and make sure your private keys and seed phrases are secure.",

For example, Mr A who has other sources of funds has over a thousand dollar in his trading portfolio on an exchange without making any withdrawal and maybe if there is any casualties, Mr A has where to fall back to and bounce back immediately and then Mr B on seeing or even hearing this, tends to put all his $100 in one portfolio in an exchange without considering any casualty and when the unknown happens Mr B will be stranded and then start calling cryprocurrencies scam.Please let's work to seek and find what works for us and when we do please we should also stick to it and try not to put money not meant for trading in exchanges",

The USDT is also centralised and you are not getting anything by holding it in return and they can take any action to bust you as said correctly so people need to understand these things and stay away from them and bitcoin is the best choice available to us.And those who keep their coins on these exchange just have a look at this image which says coinbase can sell your coins to pay liabilities in case of bankruptcy so what safety you are assuring from these CEX?Quote from: aysg76 on May 13, 2022, 12:39:56 PMSo are there are valid reasons why people prefer to keep their coins on CEX?
