  "content": "Investing to top marketcap coins                          Investment advice you hear in crypto a lot is \"Just HODL\". And if you ask what bags to hodl, most people will point to bitcoin and other top marketcap coins.                           In this topic i made few portfolios to check out how it would have played out if you had put $1000 dollars ($100 per coin) to top 10 marketcap coins years ago and just holded them.                          I am not including buy fees into this or staking possibilities, nor i am counting possible fork rewards. Also i am removing all the stablecoins for obvious reason.

TOTAL | CHANGE | $ 18.59 k| 1,858.63%As you see, some of the coins didn't really make it. Granted that some of the coins weren't really high marketcap in the first place, even though they were top coins at the time.(well except from bitconnect but that's whole another story)My personal bet is that you could still 10x your $100 with top mc coins with this tactic in the future but that it wouldn't really bring you financial freedom if you are poor in the first place. With small amount of money to invest ($100), you are better off finding micro/low/mid marketcap gems that has room to grow. And hodlThere's a high change that you might lose it all when you buy wrong shady low caps, but as it's only $100 you are gambling with, possibility of high gains outweigh the high risk imhoBecause your while your 24.10.2020 bitcoin investment is now up under 60%, consider being exremely lucky and finding microcap like shiba inu at the same time, and that you threw $100 to it instead....Again i am not counting fees but price per coin was $0.000000000168 and with that you would have got 595,238,095,238 SHIB... That's now worth over $6M and in 29.10.2021 it peaked in bloody $40M!!!And as history is that while most coins die, lot of the huge ATHs are small blips next to new ATHs in retrospect so hodling is most of the time the way to go, it just depends a lot what the fundamentals of the coin you hodl happen to be...Anyway, as this advice (invest to top coins) has worked quitew well in the past. I wanted to try and see if it would work now and i made new portfolio for 24.10.2022 top mc coins:             So here are top ten mc coins in 24.10.2022!:                          BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOGE, MATIC, DOT, TRX                          I am hoping that there's a change we all might still get rich with this tactic and just by hodling. So let's wait and see. Good luck everyone.                          --->You can follow new 2022 portfolio trough this link <---",

It is interesting to see that ETH, XRP and DOGE have a certain age and are today in the top ten. I don't see all three staying there for the next 10 years, though. Maybe one of them will, like ETH or XRP, because apart from bitcoin it is clear that there will be cryptocurrencies that will be important and continue to be used, but betting on bitcoin is betting on a safe value, while with cryptocurrencies it is more uncertain, because bitcoin is fundamentally different from the rest and investors know that.",

But if you dig a bit in top 25 coins and their future projections, it can be great to find coins. I feel like Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB will still stay as market dominator coins, I don't think I can imagine 4 one in that league.

The altcoin market is always like that, they will always change after every cycle, so to be honest, investing in the top 10 except BTC and ETH, all the rest is very risky.The good tactic in a bear market in my opinion is to focus mainly on BTC and ETH, the rest look for new gems in the market instead of the top altcoins. For example, the recent Aptos project could also be new gems that will replace someone in the next bull season. It’s a certain fact that altcoins in the market do not stay for long in their marketcap position, either they fall on the bottom or just gone eventually like a thin air. Even established altcoins that are on top of the list cannot sustain their position, except for ethereum and bitcoin that have been very consistent in their market position. So I’d say hodling long term for those top coins do not guarantee profits in the end. But with bitcoin and ethereum, history proves it that they can always gain sustainable profits.",

Good luck everyone.Meriting you for the effort with the portfolios, but completely disagree with this.It's impossible for everyone to get rich by just buying and holding coins, let's cut inflation out of the equation as its irrelevant if we talk about coins purchasing power in the future so for everyone to be at least 3rd world country rich you would need trillions in value getting into this, and not only that, but you will need trillions more as people are exchanging their coins for other things of value or for fiat, percentages are deceiving if we do a raw market cap value, and oversimplify things you will see that in all its history cryptos have managed to get valued at 3 trillion, for an x10 spike to happen and for everyone to be happy including the ones buying at 60k you will need 30 trillion, let's think this is possible and even that won't make everyone rich, not by a long margin.I really think that this whole we buy 100$ with of coins and in 10 years we're rich and not doing anything else needs to stop.QuoteIn 24.10.2021 top ten coins were...LUNA Just lol.",

What can I say if the project who make the biggest ROI and it's survive for around 14 years is only Bitcoin.It's a well known fact that if you hodled bitcoin from the start you would done well. But that's not the point now is it?  Nor is it relevant, because if i had gone back one more year to 24.10.2012, there wouldn't been real alternatives, nor i could find any chart data. And back then btc marketcap would have been $119M, (that would be nr 176 marketcap right now.) So obviously it had room to grow in retrospect, like shitcoins have now. Question is: how much more room there is?I was just pointing out that that they all were considered as low caps at some point, so you might want to takea look at low caps to get gains (that's why i mentioned shiba).And most of people in crypto are profit maximalists that don't care as much aboutFundamentals or code, nor do they understand them. I wouldn't judge them as they make most of the liquidity.Quote from: stompix on October 28, 2022, 07:38:55 AM-cut-I really think that this whole we buy 100$ with of coins and in 10 years we're rich and not doing anything else needs to stop.I actually agree with all your points, but i realize that i don't know how much more room there still is to grow. I thought that ETH marketcapwas way too high when it was $12 so maybe don't listen to me ... But eth and btc now? maybe 10x? And even that could take years. That's why i was talking about low caps as an alternative. As with buying low caps i have made most of my money.Quote from: Smack That Ace on October 28, 2022, 07:56:47 AMThis is certainly true, and if OP fully updated the rankings from 2009, it is evident that bitcoin has the highest ROI compared to the other cryptocurrencies.Can you remind me what btc marketcap was in 2009? Did you get my point about low caps?",

When i started with cryptocurrencies, coins were in the top 10 that you don't hear about anymore and that nobody talks about anymore. For example, PeerCoin, Mastercoin, NXT and MaidSafeCoin were in the top 10 in 2014. Who still knows them today? Unfortunately I can't remember which coins were in the top 10 in 2012.

Good luck everyone.             I only hold five of the ten types you describe, and the ones I like to hold the most are Bitcoin and Ethereum because they often go up and down at the same time. I don't even think it's a coincidence, but whenever I see a decline, the two very often experience the same thing simultaneously, as well as when there is an increase in the market. Although basically all the cryptocurrencies you describe are good to hold in the current conditions.The main reason for BTC and ETH to hold in your wallet is simply due to it’s large marketcap. Due to it’s popularity whenever the price goes down, people will tend to buy more and eventually the price will go up. The basic principle of supply and demand are shown when we basically talk about these two coins. Coming to the OP, it’s not always best to hold the top 10 coins, i mean not during the bear market atleast. Yes BTC and ETH can be considered as optional, but apart from this other coins might come with risks.",
