Although nested segwit too are 34 character long.Native segwit addresses (P2WPKH) are 42 character long. This means that you have been using Electrum wallet for a long time ago. Either you generated the wallet long time ago when someone can click on legacy on Electrum to generate legacy addresses seed phrase or you used console for it which newbies will not likely think or know of.There are reasons someone can be using legacy addresses, but know that with native segwit you can safe fee 42% more when sending from native segwit to native segwit addresses.Quote from: pxstein on July 24, 2023, 06:30:56 PMAnd there is no hidden (auto-)refresh of the available green addresses. All green addresses are hard linked to my walletand stay alive until I use them.After receiving coin to an address, another address would be generated for you automatically. Just click on 'receive' on Electrum GUI to get it. If you need another address, click on receive on Electrum GUI, click on create request to generate new address for yourself. Those are your receiving addresses. I will advice you to use receiving addresses.If you send bitcoin and you have change, it would be sent to your change address. Assuming you have 0.1 BTC UTXO received in a single transaction from Alice, and you sent 0.6 BTC to Bob, the change (0.4 BTC) would be sent to your change address on your wallet. Although, you can also use change address as receiving address if you like.

Just like the op, when I created my electrum wallet I was confused about the multi addresses generated that I had to go look it up on google and I got to know that the reason is to give the user more privacy. Because I wanted to know which address to stake on the forum, I imported my seed phrase on blue wallet and it generated just one address which is the topmost address generated on electrum wallet, then I had not used any of the address to receive funds. It could have been any of the 34 addresses, my question is why did blue wallet generated or gave preference for the first address?",
