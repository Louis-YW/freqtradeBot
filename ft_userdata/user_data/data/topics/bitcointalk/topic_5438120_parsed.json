There is need to take concrete steps to fight against this like1) Strict punishment for scammers who are caught doing fraud with crypto. This has not happened in past. In fact, in some cases, major scammers were let free because of connections or other reasons. There should be such strict punishments that no one can dare to think of scam in future because of fear. 2) Government should take steps to increase awareness related to crypto in general masses. They should hire experts to give detailed talks and  recommend measures to general public to remain safe.",

There's no need for them to do that, sometimes they're not even sure whether they'll support or not.",
