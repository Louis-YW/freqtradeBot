  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new here. As the title of this topic says, I'm here to share our experience and ask for advice. What is the best way to contact the moderators of the forum without wasting their time ? I'm part of the team of a very ambitious project, and recently someone recommended in our community that we share the project here. I of course agreed and said I will do it in the first possible moment. The guy initiated that is better he does it since he has legendary status here and is being a member since 2011.I emailed him with a short introduction and graphics about our project, and he made a post in announcements (altcoins).Then he started sending me his crypto wallet and insist i should tip him some money and i didn't agree since he volunteered to post and his post reached less than 15 people in that time.He then got mad and started spreading lies in the communities that i promised him money and lied to him. I provoked him by showing the chats and said there is nothing to hide. I asked him publicly how much money would he want, so he stops spreading lies. He went and spammed lies about how our project is a scam and our features are a scam too. We have a rewarding game on the website where people win daily prizes, so he insisted that is a scam, meanwhile his friend has won already, including many others. The whole situation is very frustrating, so I hoped I can share more information and screenshots with admins or moderators and get a warning for him.This whole situation shows only how toxic this space can be.",

The crypto community is made up of a diverse group of people with different backgrounds, experiences, and motivations. Just like in any other community, there are likely to be both good and bad actors in the crypto space. Therefore, it is important to consider the actions of individuals rather than making blanket judgments about the entire community. In your case, it is difficult to give an objective opinion because of the lack of information. I guess you can create a new topic and prove you are an official representative by placing a link to that topic on your website and social profiles. After that, you can report the old topic so that the moderators lock it.",

Other people can though express their views on the Reputation thread, which may (or may not) lead to some kind of (negative) tagging on one or more of the parties. - You are free to go and create your own Ann thread now, as there is no other thread on the same topic.",

Closing ANN thread It's good that it happened right at the beginning, and not after a developed discussion. he also turned out to be not really a supporter of your project, so the whole thing would surely culminate at some point.if your project is good, one troll won't hurt it much whatever he said on the net. if it manages to ruin your business in that way, you should think about the real strength of the project. in addition to all that, you also learned an important lesson that you must always agree on every deal in detail.you also learned how things go on this forum. Here you have marginal Legendary members and their status does not mean anything special for opening an ANN thread. Nothing more than if you bought a copper member membership yourself.Also, you can tag gondel on their trust page and point reference to this thread. I will probably send them a link to this thread, so he will be informed and they can respond here.",

If the guy doesn't come and explain why he is out there in all those platforms calling our project a scam and share anything that we don't know, I guess my questions were answered. I'm positively impressed from the helpful community here and will gladly continue following the Forum. I even received more offers for promotions, which are already way more professional and have stated clearly what they offer and how much they expect to be paid for the service. Most of them come with a package with other deals, so at least something good came out of the situtation.",
