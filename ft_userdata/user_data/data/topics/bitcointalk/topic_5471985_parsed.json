According to dextool, it has $42k liquidity and 5% tax for buy and sell. So its better you use more than 6% slippage to prevent transaction error.",

I'm still in awe that it took you more than a week to realize it or wait for a reply here, not that I am mad but don't be a spoon-fed your whole life mate that's just my advice.",
