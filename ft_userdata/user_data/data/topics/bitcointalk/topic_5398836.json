  "content": "Signs pointing to Bitcoin’s steady maturity and growth in the crypto space and beyond are undeniable, making a case for the cryptocurrency being the ultimate digital reserve asset.There was a time when all cryptocurrencies traded against Bitcoin (BTC). Speculators ventured into other coins when they saw assuring tokenomics or promising hype, but Bitcoin was their settlement coin of choice.Things have changed. Stablecoins now constitute a critical $150 billion pillar in the cryptocurrency market. Perpetual futures over-amplify market sentiment and, more often than not, dominate price action. Much more capital, including from institutional funds, has come into the market lately with only a moderate impact on Bitcoin’s price. So, some former bulls now dismiss Bitcoin as boring.Is this the end of Bitcoin maximalism? Probably not. But, perhaps, it’s time for more realism.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

Besides, media is already bashing mainly BTC anyway (such as your source) so why not make it the focal point of this counter-argument and hence, for maximalism?Besides, stablecoins are merely a surrogate for the fiat currencies they represent - what is so special about them that will make the international community adopt a surrogate of a fiat currency, managed by a corporation instead of the govt.?",

Stablecoins come and go(the algorithmic stablecoin,created by Terra Labs is just an example),Bitcoin Core is here to stay.Futures are being used as a financial derivative in all the other financial markets-stocks,commodities,indexes,etc.I've never heard someone on the stock markets to complain about futures/options trading to push the stock prices down.",

No other coin has made such huge ROI that it has surpassed Bitcoin's. The history of the prices of cryptocurrencies is an open book. Anybody could freely verify that it is Bitcoin that actually gives you a good return in the end. And why the comparison between Bitcoin and stablecoins?

Anyone who actually spends some time looking at technical details and not just chasing get rich quick scams will reach a similar conclusion. Once you've been in this space for more than a few years, you'll start to recognize the same patterns emerging over and over again. I first saw it with ICOs, promising the world, promising better technology, promising unbelievable risk free returns, promising to dethrone bitcoin, promising to revolutionize money. They have, without exception, not achieved any of this, and the vast majority of people who bought them have lost all their money and are left holding worthless bags. Then came IEOs, ITOs, and a bunch of other acronyms, which all made the same promises and have again all fallen flat. Next was DeFi. Let's look at Luna to see how well that's going, shall we? The new kid on the block is NFTs, and anyone who thinks that paying tens of thousands of dollars for a drawing of a monkey is either revolutionary or sustainable is a moron.Lots of people who are new to the space get sucked in by such promises, unaware of the many thousands of dead coins which came before which made the exact same promises. They either lose money and rage quit the space altogether, or they hang around, start learning, and slowly but surely stop chasing shitcoins and just buy bitcoin instead.",

For me I do not think am a good trader since trading does not only need a lot of time and effort it's also sometimes dependent on your luck therefore I choose to hold bitcoins and other Altcoins do have good opportunities ofcourse but then again the price of Bitcoins right now is perfect for buying.",

Just like another share market it became asset eventually. Otherwise I am sure there would have been similar craze and outlook towards bitcoin as it was in the mid decade. It was something new, everyone wanted to have the full bitcoin and that slowly gained the framework of whole trading stuff. However, one fact remains unchanged. Bitcoin is getting mined and those who are serious about bitcoin like institutional investors are stacking up bitcoin in cold storages!
