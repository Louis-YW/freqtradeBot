      "body": "Your idea to buy a portion per major support or minor support is not a bad idea according to the resources and researches I've made from other traders, there is a possibility that it would still go around $15,000 and I think it is a good buy already considering that the previous price is around $60,000. You can get a cheaper Bitcoin, my actual goal is to have a few Bitcoins no matter how much their price would get.",

      "body": "Breaking down into buy orders at 15k and 10k would be my suggestion instead of 11k. But there is a chance that the market might swing back before reaching 15k itself because people are going to start buying. Depending on how long this current bear trend remains this end price might vary.To be safe I think these are good enough prices to buy. However what happens to the money at hand? Dont end up with zero liquid cash at hand to spend on trading because lower than this prices are also possible in a real life scenario.I think at this point, the main question remains how much to keep for even lower prices. My suggestion is not to overthink this and spend and just wait it out for the time being till the market flips back.",

Everyone is expecting a sudden retraction but bitcoin keeps failing on key support levels. Some indicators are already turning blue for a buy. Let's keep our fingers crossed and watch other fibonacci levels for support. I'm sure one will definitely hold",

Buy those crap coins in bear market is really bad idea because shitcoins tend to lose it's value in bear market and long term, unlike Bitcoin who have good performance for holding in long term. You have been around this forum since 2017 where Bitcoin ever have a history of crash 80%, but you're buy shitcoins? lol. My suggestion is to sell those shitcoins and convert it to Bitcoin, if you don't want to, then we will sooner or later those shitcoins will become dead coins.",

The fact that the price has broken through the high of 2017 and is trading under it does not inspire confidence that there has been a market reversal.

From 17.8k to  19.5k , was a good bounce confirmation for me . (we are still at very low levels comparing to 69k , the futures shorts orders will close soon ) Im at profit now 20.455 us$ and still remains 50% of my trading capital in FIAT . just in case Quote from: kapalmabur on June 19, 2022, 07:20:36 PMso I'm really not worried about future losses, as I'm sure the price will hit new ATH in 2024Definitly we'll see new highs , more than 100k ? 200K ?.... .
