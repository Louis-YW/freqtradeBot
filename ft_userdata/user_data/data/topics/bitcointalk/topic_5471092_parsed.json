Would you deposit EUR to it till then? Will you be keeping your BNB that you might have been holding for card perks? Personally I'm really considering of selling all my remaining BNB and never using the card after this. There exist solutions with smaller cashback but no deposit requirements these days.",

      "body": "That's the bad news for those who use Binance cards actually they do have cashback if you purchase and use it frequently the chargeback level increases until 8%. I'm sure this would be bad news for users who usually use it.Since Binance announced that it will be closed soon better to terminate the card it's not safe to use after December 20.I don't think the BNB is deposited in your card. I think it is in your funding wallet but you still need to report it and terminate the card to make sure it won't automatically convert your BNB from funding into a Binance card balance.",

Though, Binance didn't say why the crypto debit card service is coming to an end but it's rumoured that VISA is pulling out of the partnership due to the regulatory scrutiny Binance is facing. Some users might have been attracted to Binance because of this service which gives them the opportunity to load up their crypto card and pay for good and services. Taking it off the table means the affected users may have to look for it somewhere else, which is as good as saying that Binance is going to lose a very few customers.",

Their volumes are ok, among the top exchanges in terms of volumes, and also their futures have decent liquidity still. But after KYC became mandatory in Binance, their strongest point was low fees and easy FIAT integration. Now without a card product many of their basic users will have one less reason to be there. And with both Visa and Mastercard specifically having made announcements against binance, things aren't looking that good for this part of their service returning. Hopefully in the future there can be more regulatory clarity and Binance can start offering a wider array of products. But for now it seems like regulators like putting them in a tight spot all the time.As of the cashback, for a while it was good in binance but later they reduced the limits way too much... maximum of 25 EUR cashback with 10 BNB held in binance? MEH... Even if cards return to binance they'd have to revamp the program to gather more interest again.",

It's still a strong product, I don't say otherwise, but Binance's initial business model perhaps was a little different and now regulations are starting to caught up; they'll need to pivot if they want to stay competitive. I personally moved over to Binance due to the low fees, but I was also drawn to it due to the majority of products it was offering. I highly doubt that there's going to be any alternative useful enough as this debit card was.Quote from: Rikafip on October 21, 2023, 08:11:43 PMIt was definitely worth it to own 1 BNB as it enabled us to have 2% cashback so i wasn't bad investment at all.

Definitely, 2% or even 3% isn't a cashback you'll find these days, especially on every single transaction. My credit card has 3% cashback and it's only limited to one brand of petrol stations, having that much for all transactions would be a blessing.",

The announcement did not mention any new details related to this. In general, there is enough time to search for alternatives, and I hope that this is not the beginning of something bad related to Binance.com.",

And then we have Mastercard pulling out of every deal completely on any kind of future partnership!This is just the end of FAFO, CZ adventures flying from one country to another, propping only empty offices everywhere, going through a dozen setup companies, the claims about Binance payments and not Binance trading which is a subsidiary of Biance Finance lost its license and that doesn't impact their business at all, anyone should have seen the outcome.Btw, real damage control over Binance:- we lost mastercard and south america and middle east ...but it's less than 1% of our users- we lost EEU...but it's less than one percent of our userssoon to come- we lost Asia..but that's less than 1%- we can't issue cards in Africa but we never had a card there so zero losses1%+1%+1%+0% =100%",

Speaking of the limit, even this current limit for Tier 3 cashback is more than enough for majority of people because in order to reach it you have to spend ~900 euro in a month and I don't think that many use Binance Visa that much.",

There’s P2P as an alternative way to cash in and cash out fiat using your bank account that doesn’t have any fees for trade. Those lousy cashback they offer is just minimal compared to the amount that you can save by trading on P2P that gives you freedom to choose for the best price.They will also remove their BUSD until February next due to the same issuer problem.

Have you seen the prices on binance p2p? Honestly they're not the best. Also the biggest issue is security because the account you're trading with in p2p could be a scammer. Honestly binance remains a good exchange and for SEPA deposits there exist decent alternatives in Europe so that's not an issue. But really the binance card cashback was one of the major reasons to keep BNB held as a retail user. It was convenient for every day transactions and it was not that expensive to get to the higher tiers of cashback compared to competitors. It'll be hard to find a replacement to that.",
