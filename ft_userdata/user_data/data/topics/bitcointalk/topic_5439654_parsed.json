Is in that format because that way it works faster, but normally in the bloom file we have all the addresses in hash 160 of the address that we are searching (or bruteforcing) the private key.So, making a bloom file with all the addresses is a nice feature if we are working with brainflayer, but since we will have tons of hash160 addresses, comparing each newly generated address with the bloom file isn't an efficient process... So, I don't recommend at all this way to brute force crypto addresses.",
