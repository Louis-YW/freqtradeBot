  "content": "Alik BakhshiChanging the purpose of the war and how it will end     At the SCO summit, Putin said that the purpose of the special. Russia's operation is the liberation of Donbass. Either Putin made a reservation, or his memory began to fail, but when he announced the start of the special on March 24, 2022. operations in Ukraine, the purpose of which, as Putin explained, was the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine. If Putin is in perfect health in Shanghai, then from what he said, the only conclusion that follows is a change in the purpose of the war. Thus, Putin abandoned his intention of denazification, which involves the overthrow of the fascist regime. In other words, Putin, if we recall his historic discovery that the Ukrainian people as such does not exist (1), because this is the Russian people, wanted to occupy all of Ukraine and annex it to Russia. As for the plan for the demilitarization of Ukraine, everything is clear here, with this Putin has a complete ..., if culturally in French, an affront.      Undoubtedly, the reason for changing the original plan is the defeat of the Russians, first near Kyiv and then near Kharkov. Everything goes to the fact that Putin's blitzkrieg will turn into a blitzcrah. The high motivation of the Ukrainian soldier and modern Western weapons, which, according to Putin, have no analogues, will lead to the victory of the free World over the Empire of Evil and Lies.  I wonder what Putin will tell his people if the liberation of Donbass suffers the same failure? How will the favorite of the Russian people explain why thousands of Russians gave their lives, and, most importantly, how will the people react to the defeat in the war with Ukraine? I remember the defeat of Russia in the war with Japan led to the revolution of 1905, and the defeat in the First World War ended with the disappearance of the empire and the transformation into a union of socialist republics, which collapsed after the defeat in the Afghan war. It is possible that Hitler's Germany would have lost the war if it were not for the enormous assistance of the USA and Great Britain.     It is difficult to assume that the Russian people will admit their guilt in the atrocity committed against the fraternal Slavic people of Ukraine. Really, as always, everything will be blamed on one Putin. Will the Russian people finally abandon the great-power worldview and Great Russian chauvinism (2,3) and, as a result, the empire, which is the cause of all failures. Would he prefer to live a lie (4), ignoring its consequences?1. Taras Shevchenko and Putin are representatives of the same people. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/69850.html2.

      "body": "This is not new. When America invaded Iraq in 2003, it claimed that it wanted to rid the world of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and after it became clear that Iraq did not have any weapons, the goal of the invasion became to liberate Iraq from Saddam Hussein's dictatorship. We later learned that the main objective was to steal Iraq's oil.I do not think that there has been a change in the goals of the war, except with regard to the declared goals for media consumption, in what looks like psychological preparation. Originally, Russia does not call its invasion a war, but rather a special operation, which turns out to have developmental goals.Russia has been planning this invasion since it declared the Crimea region as its own. And the whole world knew that the invasion was the next step, no matter what excuses they were promoting in the media.",

This is empty talk.When you think that you can analyze why any country does anything, and then write it out in such a short OP, you are missing a whole lot of it. Russian goals and traditions go back at least a couple thousand years. And so does the Ukraine... although neither of them were called by those names back then, and their borders were way different back then.When Putin and the Russian government try to follow their traditions and the goals of their ancestors, you don't know more than a tiny fraction of what is going on and why. The difference with Zelensky is that he barely knows anything, and he and his government are only trying to gain land and make trouble for people. You can see this in the fact that since 2014 the Ukraine has been killing people in the Donbas region, because they were mixed Russian-Ukrainian families.Now, when Putin wants to stop the killing, Zelensky mounts a gigantic war against Putin's police action. You have the whole thing backwards.",
