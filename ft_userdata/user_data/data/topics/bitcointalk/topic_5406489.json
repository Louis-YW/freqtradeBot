  "content": "Heya everyone!I was looking for the second HW wallet (I already own Trezor One for BTC, ETH) to hold my alts (like ADA, ATOM, NEAR etc.).I thought to get Ledger nano s+, but are there any open-source alternatives for +/- the same price?No need in bluetooth connection, basically the main purpose is to hold coins and connect to wallet once a month to check the balance.Safepal was one of the options (good price), but you know, China and closed source.Any suggestions welcome, thanks! (but please, only adequate solutions - I do not want a rare wallets with no good software background (maybe not Trezor suite or Ledger-live level, but still user-friendly)   )",

I’ve looked through the list already, but to be fair did not find a really good alternative (some do not support necessary coins, some are pure China, etc.).  As for ledger - yeah, I know about data leaks and already have disposable number and email for the order  But yeah, closed source chip makes me a little doubtful",

Though I believe the Trezor is much higher build quality and more open source (no black-box secure element).",

Ledger Nano S Plus supports over 5500 assets (not sure if that's just 'coins and tokens' or also NFTs and that kind of stuff) and does have those two coins.If I was you, I'd check how many coins I could transfer to the model T. Then check how much cash you hold in unsupported coins and evaluate if you're fine leaving them on the exchange or not.I'm not advocating for keeping coins on exchanges, but I'm also not advocating for using exchanges in general. There's still a point I'd like to make: withdrawing and depositing is not always trivial and without issues. Besides fees, you risk getting your coins stolen by the exchange.One recent such example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404704[Blacklist] of unreliable, 'taint proclaiming' Bitcoin services / exchangesI call a service unreliable if I can't know 100% for sure that what I deposit will actually be credited to my account or not.Especially for smaller amounts, it may really be simpler, cheaper and safer to leave them on the exchange. This may also depend on the exchange (size, reputation, ...) - some are more likely to pull off an exit scam than others.",
