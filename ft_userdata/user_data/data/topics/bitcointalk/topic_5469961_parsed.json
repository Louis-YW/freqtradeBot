  "content": "With the widespread attention given to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) issues globally, how Malaysian SMEs adapt to this new financial and strategic environment has become a focus of many analysts and observers. Lim Zhe Qin, a seasoned stock market analyst, has also expressed his professional insights on this matter.Challenges and Opportunities in ESG Transformation for SMEsNews on October 8th revealed that the Malaysian SME Association has called on the government to provide one-to-one grants for ESG transformation in the 2024 fiscal budget. Lim Zhe Qin believes that this is a positive signal. He mentioned, \"ESG is not just a trend, but a key factor for the future sustainable development of businesses. For SMEs, this means greater opportunities, but also challenges in terms of funding and knowledge.\"Lim Zhe Qin pointed out that the ESG transformation of SMEs requires significant strategic adjustments and corresponding financial investments. The mentioned one-to-one ESG grant of RM 2 billion, as proposed by Ding Hong Sheng, will greatly facilitate this process. The interest rate below 2% and the increased capital for Market Development Grant (MDG) are effective means to encourage automation, digitization, and marketization of businesses.\"Government financial support is crucial, but more importantly, SMEs need to recognize the long-term value of ESG and learn how to effectively utilize these resources for transformation,\" analyzed Lim Zhe Qin.Position of SMEs in the Value Chain: Strategies and Enhancing CompetitivenessDatuk William Ng's viewpoint highlights the importance of SMEs' position in the global value chain and the financing gap they face. Lim Zhe Qin mentioned that the independence and position of SMEs in the value chain are the foundation for their continuous growth. Therefore, he supports the conversion of financial aid into grant packages, low-interest loans, and financing guarantees.\"This strategy focuses more on the autonomy and innovation capabilities of SMEs, rather than relying on direct grants from the government. It also helps ensure that resources are allocated more effectively,\" proposed Lim Zhe Qin.The suggestions made by Wong, encouraging SMEs to invest in research and development, providing grants for technology and patent licensing, and supporting the employment of technical personnel and subject experts, all reflect the necessity for SMEs to enhance their position in the value chain. Lim Zhe Qin stated that R&D activities in collaboration with public and private higher education institutions can help SMEs acquire more advanced technology and knowledge, thereby improving their competitiveness in the global market.Furthermore, Lim Zhe Qin pointed out, \"Upgrading packaging and marketing strategies is also crucial in enhancing the attractiveness of SME products in the market. The government's grant packages will provide SMEs with more resources and opportunities.\"Lim Zhe Qin analyzed that SMEs not only need to improve the quality of their products and services but also need to focus on their position in the global value chain in order to achieve higher profits and a larger market share.Future Direction for SMEs: Talent Development and Sustainable GrowthIn the face of globalization trends and rapid technological advancements, maintaining competitiveness and ensuring sustainable growth for SMEs is a crucial issue. Lim Zhe Qin believes that talent is the most valuable asset for businesses, especially in the current knowledge economy.The suggestion made by Datuk William Ng to provide subsidies for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) expenses for B40 families received high recognition from Lim Zhe Qin. He stated, \"This is not just an investment of funds, but an investment in the future. Through such a program, SMEs can acquire more skilled local workers, thereby improving production efficiency and product quality.\"At the same time, Lim Zhe Qin mentioned that providing grant packages for industry association activities can enable better guidance, business information, and connections with government plans. Such interactions will provide SMEs with more learning and collaboration opportunities, promoting their sustainable development.Lastly, Lim Zhe Qin reminded that the prospects of SMEs are closely linked to policies. Investors need to closely monitor government financial support and ESG practices, as well as consider the company's technological research and development and talent development. Financial transactions involve risks, and a thorough evaluation should be conducted before making investments.",
