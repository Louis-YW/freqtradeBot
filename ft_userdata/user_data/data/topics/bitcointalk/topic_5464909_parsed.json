I just kept quiet for years and I don't know if they are still talking the same thing from what I've heard about them. Just saw a picture of them doing their own business.Not really crazy and weird but it's annoying when someone who's not an investor and has less to no experience tells that Bitcoin is a scam when they know that I'm into it.",

This is a common thing in technical matters.For example take the second statement \"bitcoin payments happen in seconds\", a bitcoin transaction does propagate through the network in mere seconds so in a way the first part is correct since a transaction reaches the receiver in seconds; however, the confirmation takes time which is the part where it becomes finalized (or irreversible).Or the third statement \"bitcoin relies on middlemen to pass payments along a route\" replace the phrase \"middlemen\" with \"peers\" and the term \"along a route\" with \"to other peers\" and it is a correct statement.",

I don't really talk to people about BTC, the people who are close to me already know about the network, some of them use it and the others are not just interested. The crazy thing that so many people think about BTC is that it is going to make them very rich, and when they realize that it doesn't work that way, they lose their interest. The best way to start off as a bitcoiner is by viewing BTC as only decentralalized money that is censorship resistant and permissionless, and you can speculate on the price later on.",

In many ways, Bitcoin best represents this transformation.Currently, some people I've interacted with have called investing in Bitcoin \"silly.\" But as you can see, there have always been detractors to every breakthrough idea, from the steam engine to cellphones. Its in the nature of paradigm-shifting breakthroughs to drive us to reevaluate our deeply held ideas.Ignoring Bitcoin' potential and underlying blockchain technology is equivalent to ignoring the influence of online communication in the 1990s. In addition to digital currency, the goal is to establish a more open, effective, and inclusive global financial system. However, always keep in mind that with enormous potential also comes great volatility. Be prudent with your investments, be aware of the hazards, and continue the dialogue.

They would go on to say that the reason why the price increases is because of the attention people are giving to it. And they believe that it won't be long until the government totally shut down bitcoin and every related to that it won't be even discussed or used in the public space. When I try to remind them about El Slavdor, they dismiss me and say that they'll abandon bitcoin and either return to the use of the dollar or apply to be a member of BRICS.

Some opinions especially the ones formed personally, or borrowed opinions are wrong.  I have a friend who said that investing in stable coins is better for them than investing in bitcoins because the price of bitcoin can fall, and they will lose their money. I have also had someone who had a very small number of bitcoins that they believe will be able to make them rich.
