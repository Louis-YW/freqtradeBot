  "content": "Dear Bitcointalk community,I want to warn everyone not to use Freewallet.org as a web wallet.What happened:On July 10, 2023, I decided to buy 120000 USDT TRC20 by P2P cash transaction. Find out about Freewallet.org, a good web wallet that works with USDT and TRC20. Opened the account with that service. Everything seems to look professional, and I decided to give the Freewallet TRX address TViVimsS3pQnwBPCdyotUzqE37QiCd4r8y to the seller. Everything went smoothly, and I saw my funds in my Freewallet account. https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/e5fcfe67218750bfe5a2c484724ba381c347875c2454e856274d25e7654380cdDirty things started to happen when I decided to withdraw my funds from another account. Freewallet cancelled my first outgoing transaction, and after I tried to make another one, they wrote that my account was suspended. I received an email from them saying \"We’d like to inform you that our security system has detected suspicious activity on your account.\" \"In case it was a hacking attempt, we had to temporarily suspend withdrawals from your account. This way, your funds will be absolutely safe, and access will be restored once the verification procedure is finished.\"Then I found out about a lot of the same cases all over the internet about the way to perform a scam. Even I agree to pass the verification process because my money is totally clean, but in order to pass verification, you need to enable 2FA authentication. Then I try to enable it in my account. Google Authenticator gives me the code, and Freewallet says it is the wrong one. So they made everything so that you couldn't restore your funds.Scammers' Profile Link: www.freewallet.orgAmount Scammed: 120000 USDT TRC20 Payment method: TRXProof of Payment: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/e5fcfe67218750bfe5a2c484724ba381c347875c2454e856274d25e7654380cdScreenshots: https://imgur.com/SYLiChuAdditional Notes: Please give me advice on how to act in that situation. I am ready to invest money in that case in order to make their lives harder. Can you propose a legitimate law firm that can take care of that situation? They also plan to make a website about their scam activities. I appreciate your help and advice.",

See the negative feedback on their profile yourself - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1177176Problem is, when you type in Google \"is Freewallet good/secure wallet\" (that's probably what majority of people write), you won't get bad reviews, and that's why many end up using them. What I am surprised though is the fact that OP used custodial wallet for such a huge amount of money.

But freewallet is still going strong and selectively scamming people on a regular basis.This either tells me they've got a very good lawyer and a TOS that allows them to selectively scam, or people tend not to follow up on their thread of getting their lawyer involved...This being said: the advice to keep making noise is usually the only advice we can give after the scam has happened... It seem to work from time to time, but most victims lose their funds.The only thing we, as a community, can do is keep raising awareness about freewallet's tactics.",

      "body": "Just when you think these scammers are finally gone, a new case arises, and I have to admit it with a pretty large amount. It doesn't make sense to repeat what others have already written, but it's definitely strange that someone who obviously doesn't understand even the basics invests as much as $120k in a way that chooses an intermediary with such a disastrous reputation.However, such an amount would activate red flags on any CEX, and I am sure that the account would be blocked until verification was made - with the difference that it would happen within some reasonable time, while Freewallet has a modus operandi consisting of endless requirements that few can meet.Given where the company is registered, I'm surprised there hasn't already been a joint lawsuit because there are hundreds or maybe even thousands of people to whom this has happened.",

I appreciate your help and advice.according to google their ceo is called -  Alvin Hagg, I recommend that while you are trying to see if your google authenticator sends you a code, you can look for a lawyer in your country for him to give you instructions of how can you open a criminal case against you freewallet.org and its CEO Alvin Hagg, I believe your country's police will have sufficient means to obtain his true location and send or order you to open the case against him in the court of country he lives in, I saw this thread about someone accusing him:Alvin Hagg and his Bitch Hanna Hagg Running Fake Company Called Freewallet.orgthis thread was created in 2018, that means the same scam scheme continues today. I hope you are not mistaken with the internet lawyer that you are not talking to him physically. look for a lawyer in your own country and he will give you all the instructions on how to proceed, do not hire a lawyer on the internet, you have to have a lawyer in your country and someone reliable and who has a good reputation and competence",

If OP started with small $ (100$) then he would not regret now.Review for this wallet is not good, i searched on google about it and first site user has given bad review on 22 October.
