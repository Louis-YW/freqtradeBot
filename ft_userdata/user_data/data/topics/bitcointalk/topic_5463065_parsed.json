  "content": "I just came across a new article on Aljazeera where the World Bank decided to pause new loans to Uganda over anti-LGBTQ law. Apparently, Uganda passed one of the \"most stringent\" anti-LGBTQ laws where one could be sentenced to death because of  “aggravated homosexuality” if they are found guilty of defiling or knowingly infecting minors through gay sex.More information can be got here - https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/8/9/world-bank-halts-new-loans-to-uganda-over-anti-lgbtq-lawSeriously, are those bank loans and aids to the Third World countries in good faith? I have always doubted this. Why aren't they halting loans when there are other documented gross Human right violations like unjust killing of citizens and corruption by the current rulers in different countries? But when it comes to anti-LGBTQ laws, it's suddenly a very important human right. Killing citizens is not that critical!Lately, Ghana might be on its way to pass a similar law - https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-supreme-court-rejects-bid-block-anti-lgbtq-bill-2023-07-19/ and all eyes are on themI saw some very sour souls when it came to the Qatar hosting the world cup recently, citing \"gross human right violations\". But the fact is that it was always about the culture. They wanted their culture to suddenly change to accommodate the western culture  . Gladly, this never happened.If these countries are really independent? Then why must other nations dictate on what they should do with their cultures and traditions?And why are these so-called Third World countries still relying on Loans?",

And quite a few of those countries have enough resources to get to that point but instead of focusing on rooting out corruption etc are passing laws repressing their own citizens.

A continent with so many resources that can make them self-sufficient is now depending on loans because of corruption. Even these loans are diverted to private pockets. The World Bank can not give Qatar or Saudi Arabia such a directive. Even when investigations proved that it was Mohammed bin Salman that ordered the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi, Donald Trump took the matter lightly. Saudi Arabia is independent but all African countries are the puppet of the IMF, World Bank, Paris Club, and China Development Bank. Africa will be under the political and social influence of these lending organizations until the continent becomes financially independent.",

FYI...All the world politics and problems are located in banking and making more mone3y. As people are pushed away from solid religion by bank-made problems, he banks have an easier time controlling the people. It will be their (the banks') downfall, of course. God doesn't like what they are doing. He patiently puts up with only so much... because He loves all people, and bank people are people, too.",

These countries think that it's going to be a normal loan, where both parties decide on the amount and interest and it's done, but that's not how the World Bank operates. It wants to be involved in internal politics, in lawmaking. It wants to decide on the course of action the country takes. It's like you had a lease on your car, but the company would call you and tell you if you can or cannot drive today, what gas station you can use, what tire manufacturer you're supposed to choose...

In this case Uganda has taken a step to protect minors from physical abuse because in most of LGBTQ cases the victims are the minor ones. I don't think that what's wrong when a country makes laws in their jurisdictions and I don't know why World Bank took a step like this to show them that they are not independent in making laws in their own country.I would say that the World Bank and its operations should be for the betterment of humanity and if a country makes a decision to stop something that can destroy the lives of hundreds and thousands of victims then I such cases they should be neutral instead a opposing such laws. I know that the law Uganda has made is quite cruel and inhuman, but if the purpose behind it is to protect hundreds of thousands from such abuses then I think it's still not that horrible. The offenders will most probably be scared because of such laws and the lives of minors will be save in a country like that.",

The UN works on the basis of human rights, and this includes the right to exercise you choice in gender, relations and many other things.

Africa is blessed with enough resources for it to become one of the richest continents in the world, with good leaders, they will not need any loans from the world banks, and they will not need to change their ways because of help that they need.With all these things happening and loans halted over refusal to conform, it will be an eye opener to people that Africa neeeds to start becoming more independent of the west.",

I have seen people from Uganda on Twitter (when all of this started) and they seemed okey with such measure.Also, I have read that Uganda tradition on Homophobia or their adverse feelings against the LGBT community does not come originally from their native traditions but was rather implanted by settlers and the missionaries who came from the European powers, during the colonial era. Either way, I do not think that cutting the economical and social help in a whole country is an actual solution, it may only enforce the idea on the LGBT acceptance being a enforced way of thinking and would drive even more communities to exclude their LGBT people in Africa. World Bank is not right on taking such a decision by itself.",

Because basically whether you agree or not agree with LGBT, I don't think it should be related to what is called the flow of money lending. Because if that reason is not respecting human rights, in my opinion that reason is very inappropriate. Why do I say it's not right? That's because in this world there is such a thing as religion, and religions like Islam and Christianity really blame these LGBT actions, and sin this behavior. So because of that, the point is don't worry too much about lgbt, let alone stop lending money to that country (Uganda).Because if you think about it more deeply, everyone must have a different point of view about LGBT, therefore, those who are pro-LGBT should not think that people who are not pro-LGBT do not respect human rights. And for people who are against LGBT, don't bother people who are pro-LGBT, because that's their business. So the point is that mutual respect must be used here. Because don't just want to be respected by other people, but still have to be able to respect other people (opinions, beliefs, and decisions). So the news you shared about the world bank not lending anymore because that country doesn't like LGBT, from my point of view, that's an act that's unfair and can even be called a lack of respect for human rights.",

Most countries of the world access loans from the World Bank and IMF but this condition to Uganda is strange. We know African leaders are corrupt and will mismanage the funds but it shouldn't be an excuse to interfere or try to change the beliefs of the people. The conditions for international  loans should be economic policies such as the devaluation of currency, retrenchment or removal of subsidies, and not social issues. If you halt loans because of these issues the citizens of the country will suffer the consequences. You spoke well uchegod when you pinpointed that this is a wake-up call to African leaders to stop depending on loans to sustain their economy. If they want to enjoy total independence, then they must seek ways to be financially autonomous.",
