You can buy it on Uniswap.Quote from: Len Saldua on June 05, 2023, 06:35:16 AMNot just referring to AImedis but there are several other tokens that require WETH to buy them, not keen on using WETH That's what they refer and that's why if you don't want to buy it with WETH, you have no choice and option because that's the very first requirement that a trader wants to be followed.",

If you're planning to buy from centralized exchanges, then the required pairs are the only option you have, but if you're buying from swap exchanges (decentralized exchanges), then you can buy with your ETH holdings. All you have to do is either swap your ETH to WETH or just proceed with the swap. Some Dex do the swap automatically when you want to trade with them, but the price difference might be noticeable since they will have to interact with the blockchain separately for each swap.",

And if I try to buy them with ETH... will I be unable to trade ?Not just referring to AImedis but there are several other tokens that require WETH to buy them, not keen on using WETH The token you are talking about AIMX is currently listed on a single Dex and that'sÂ  Quickswap, and currently you can buy it with wrapped ETH only. Most of those decentralized exchanges work with wrapped version of a coin. I have used PanCakeSwap a year ago, and most of the tokens were purchasable with WBNB only. I had to convert my BNB to WBNB for swiping to those coins.If the exchange only allows WETH then you must have to swap your ETH to WETH, and you'll have to pay the gas fees of the conversion. After that you can easily use the WETH to purchase the AIMX token from Qiuckswap by swapping your WETH with AIMX. The token isn't listed on any other exchanges and you won't be able to purchase it with any other currency in its current state. If in future the token gets listed on other exchanges then you might be able to purchase it with other coins.",

Â Yep, you can see the WBNB on BSC chain and WETH on ETH chain on the following links.https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2https://bscscan.com/token/0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095cOn layer two, wrapped token do also being used.Wrapping Ether into WETH is necessary because in order for the application/smart contract can be working smoothly, they need to behave to the same rules. You might wonder why the native token itself does not set/have the same all-in-one rules, well, if they are doing that, it would be inefficient and rather tricky. Why create 10 rules, when the core requirements only require 5 rules? On the other hand, there is a need to create 10 rules because the requirements demand that.",
