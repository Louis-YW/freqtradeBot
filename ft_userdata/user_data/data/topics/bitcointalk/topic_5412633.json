  "content": "Hello Everyone,I own the domain name 1.im along with one.im and 1im.com.I want to build something epic and time lasting on it with great importance to society and self-sustaining (revenue and expense-wise).I am considering building a Social Platform in the Twi^^er style with distinct differences to encourage perpetual engagement and a user-fare ecosystem of true free but non-harmful speech.Initial thoughts.It's free if desired to operate in that sense.Offering boosts to users that want to partake.Use Crypto (of any large and sustainable supportable kind),  Bitcoin, Eth, Tokens, Alt-Coins, and classic currencies (with CC processors) to boost your post(s) with your desired hashtags.Vs. the platform takes that money, it pays it out to the users who specifically follow and engage with the post(s) over a period of time (say first 48-96 hours, user settable).This would make the platform free but also pay to boost engagement and followers (inorganically), but then followers get paid to \"stick around\" and read the content.I already know obstacles to overcome will be bots and automatic followers.  Analytics and AI would counter this; anything unnatural (user-wise) would be siloed to a bot-only playground where they don't even realize it's happening.Do any good blockchain developers out there want to partake in this for equity?I am an entrepreneur, growth hacker, CEO, and marketing specialist; I can deliver north of 1 Million real U.S. users in under a year.Please respond with positive or negative thoughts on this project; I welcome all feedback no matter how fluffy or harsh you think it is; I am basically numb to tone as I look at all feedback as \"good\" feedback.CheersCT",

I own a portfolio of U.S. News Brands (mainstream news) that I intend to integrate with the platform as well to drive downstream engagement with the platform from everyday internet users who may or may not even be familiar with crypto markets and how they function.",

      "body": "I chatted with an IM startup earlier this year who had strong relationships with creators who had large audiences, in the millions. The creators were on other platforms and they were flirting with joining this startup. From the perspective of these creators, their major frustration centered around (1) that they were bound to the sometimes bizarre and constantly-changing terms of the platform [can't say this or strike for that] and (2) they were heavily restricted by the fee's on the platform when it came to monetization. Your idea for \"a user-fare ecosystem of true free but non-harmful speech\" could strike two birds with one stone here. If your system is somewhat decentralized [we can't take that down because we just don't host it] with an open and transparent means of payment where you monetize from the boosts and not torturing creators with unreasonable fee's , then I think you could be onto something. Luring a couple of the big creators onto your platform may start the snowball effect you'd need to overcome the strong moat twitter already enjoys and many have failed to overcome.",

      "body": "Hello, I believe there is a very good solution for you! It is enough to write an application that writes the messages on the Omega blockchain and we pay with Omega to this code to execute the recording! The chain already exists (Fork of Dash), there is also an application that sends messages anonymously to a common trollbox, the messages are remembered only for 24 hours by the masternodes. We even have this as an application in Android...! I believe that the whole community would love to meet you! And you don't need to reinvent the wheel one more time.https://omegablockchain.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/omega.pdf------------------Hello again,I haven't entered this forum for many years! I am about to launch a Token (I have the token and want to sell 1% of the amount as for the very beginning), for this token I will study how and where I should make the announcement. I don't do ICO, I've been working for almost 5-6 years on this huge project related to a new type of search system that directly corresponds to the requirements of the real estate industry. This new system is practically a real estate exchange meeting buyers with sellers and renters with owners without a middleman/broker/agent, an exchange that turned out to be able to record real estate transactions of its customers on chain if we wanted. This is a system that practically eliminates the need for a broker/agent/intermediary when buying or renting real estate. The platform already works with all of Europe and we are in beta test. Tell me how to sell some of the tokens to speed up the development of the project? Help if you can, this is a short presentation that I don't even know if it is clear what we have done?https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qY35INq03rwk0ApdIXVgAMoeSf68Xtv9/view?usp=sharing",
