You can’t urge everyone to hold since it’s their own money and not yours. This scenario already happened in the past many times and it’s a normal process to remove those weak hands to make the community pure strong holder. There’s always someone willing to takeover for those who are scared so let them be. Real bitcoin enthusiast don’t see the price of Bitcoin with current value. You will understand this if you watch many times how scared people react on every price drop.",

You will understand this if you watch many times how scared people react on every price drop.^Definitely right and this is true.Probably those people who are selling are not selling the below the price from where they purchased it, only dumb people will do that for sure. However, the real BTC enthusiast will not look at the market price closely, or watch the price daily, they aim for their goal to make a profit in a long term and that is the reason they hold it in a long term. BTC price has been proven that will always create an ATH and that time is near to come. So I am not surprised the real enthusiast will understand the word of long-term holding.",

When the price decrease then the value of their BTC will change but the amount of BTC that a holder have won't change at all. You are giving them the wrong information that they will lose the BTC that they areholding if the price decrease. As you can see, my explanation is what will really happen when some hold BTC and what will happen when price change.",

So now that the price has reduced by just about 8%, those that still bought in the range of $16k to $25k are not at a loss yet, and even the 8% drop in price is not enough to panic, unless for newbie investors. This is not the time to panic and sell off; the drop in price is even a better opportunity to buy more. Let us not forget that in 2011 Bitcoin fell by -99%.",

You lose it when you sell it.And it's obvious that Bitcoin will come back to 70k eventually so it's just a matter of time. Meanwhile, it's important to NOT be afraid and stay positive. DCA is also a good idea to accumulate some cheap BTC while you wait. It will make you even richer when Bitcoin will finally go up.",

I mean let's be serious and analyze the situation: bitcoin a just ~10 years ago was worth a few dollars, now it's worth almost $28k (~$27,600 while I'm writing), how could be someone worried? Also the whole ecosystem keeps growing, government are not as anti-bitcoin as they used to be, more and more people own and use bitcoin, several big corporations own it. Just use a little brain and you know why it's pointless worrying about today's price.",

We can't expect everyone not to panic, nobody is selling low price bitcoins, and everyone is holding their bitcoins, if that happens, I think the market will crash soon. The marketplace is like a battlefield, if we win, there will definitely be losers, and wanting others to win means we have to accept our losses.",

You can not beat the market in the long run if you are a daily trader.If you have a wider view, you will see that there is less volatility from Bitcoin. Yearly candles are able to show you a wide view on market changes. It helps you to see a trend better and the trend is upwards since 2009.The chart shows that in history, only one red yearly candle for each Bitcoin cycle. If history won't change, we will have 2023 as a green year and you don't have to worry about price changes in a few days.",

Even me i will feel scared as well on that kind of situation. Proper education and doing research in crypto currency can help an investor to have an open mind when it comes to investing. Always bear in mind that crypto currencies involves volatility that happens more often, you may earn profit or you may loose. What i can add up is to wait for the market to go down and take advantage of buying bitcoin then hodl it for a long time.",

I felt scared as well when I'm holding Bitcoin, but I continued to learn, and study, and from that I learn that Bitcoin really moves that way, and I adjusted into it to the point where I'm not feeling anything whenever Bitcoin's price goes down, and even if it goes up TBH.

I like how you address us. Anyway, I don't have any reason why not to hold Bitcoin at all. I mean I've got the time since I'm at my mid-20's still, and I also have the money to continuously accumulate it. I prefer holding as well as it is stress-free compare to when you are trading it. I'm also not afraid in Bitcoin's price going down. Like I said, I'm already at the point where I don't feel anything when price goes down, and goes up.",
