Plenty of time has passed in the meantime, but it could be that nodes with older software versions are trying to connect to your TOR node and they can't because they don't recognize the v3 addresses.",

If yes- what is the format?  Thanks by the way the debug tip is useful, would not have found that otherwise.",

I'm not aware if there is such router that blocks Tor traffic.Quote from: aar5ad on June 03, 2022, 06:29:34 PMShould the getinfo output show my address? Yes, it should show your local address. It's weird that the debug tells Tor was working fine but the localaddresses output shows none. You might want to check $ bitcoin-cli -netinfo, I don't know for sure, but see if the onion address showing over there.Quote from: aar5ad on June 03, 2022, 06:29:34 PMDo i need to add my onion address to the .conf file?I don't think so.

      "body": "Awesome thank you kindly.  Was reaching my tolerance limit on this issue.  Yes- my router is a higher end (enterprise) that get very granular with security options so i think that was the issue.  Or- my conf file didnt include my internal ip address (explicitly) as opposed to just the loopback.  Against my better judgement, i changed both (router and binding my internal ip in conf file).  Likely it was the explicit ip vs loopback.  Anyway- ill try the -cli to look for the the .onion address but somehow its working.  Is there a way that i can check external connectivity via .onion address vs ip?",
