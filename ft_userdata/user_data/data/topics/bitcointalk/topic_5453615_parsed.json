      "body": "Bitcoin and Ethereum uses different mechanism, while the latter can be staked, the former cannot. From your question the only way you earn while holding and not considering trading is to stake your coins and bitcoin doesn’t supports staking. Quote from: Outhue on May 22, 2023, 06:24:19 AMIs there any way to HODL and make more BTC? While holding bitcoin, I think the easiest way to earn more is just by providing a lending service. With the lending service strictly tied to been payed back on bitcoin worth and not necessarily dollar worth of bitcoin you can earn gradually with the interest rate that comes off it. Imagine having to lend out 0.1btc and the repayment is like 0.12btc this gives an extra earning while you still have your 0.1btc as an holding. If this doesn’t guarantees the much profits you are yarning for then it is best you pick up trading alternatives or you start mining bitcoin, both are profitable but expensive to startup and also involves risk",

The benefit is that the price has the potential to increase and you get to use a decentralized currency which resists inflation. Any form of staking or passive earning means it stops being decentralized.Quote from: Outhue on May 22, 2023, 06:24:19 AMAlso, What are those RSK Bitcoin for? Any benefit at all?

Holding means you don't touch it and you only wait to take profit with better price in future.Making more bitcoin is not holding, you are thinking about getting passive income with your bitcoin, like staking altcoins. It's not holding. If you send your bitcoins to a platform like exchange, that provides  you staking program with a APY for interest from staking, you can get more bitcoins. Think about risk before you do that because \"Not your keys, not your bitcoins\".When you send your coins to exchange, join staking program, you don't have its key. The exchange can file bankruptcy, suspend their operations like Hotbit.",

I know that Bitcoin is a proof of work coin, but I am only curious if there is something you can do, while planning to hold your Bitcoin for 2 years or more, is there any benefit of holding and making more Bitcoin? Most likely, yes. That's all that we can do with our Bitcoins and that's to hold it. You have the choice to put that into an interest account of exchange and you'll get to earn maybe somewhere from 2%-5% APY if you deposit there. But are you sure that you're liking that term if there are no keys that are given to you while you're allowing an exchange to hold your Bitcoins for you? That's why I've said that it's most likely that it is.Quote from: Outhue on May 22, 2023, 06:24:19 AMAlso, What are those RSK Bitcoin for? Any benefit at all? This?

Ethereum just recently moved from the proof of work algorithm to proof of staking and that's why you can earn more Ethereum from just holding and staking it. Bitcoin can't be staked and don't send your Bitcoin to any exchange offering staking rewards. Bitcoin is a currency while Ethereum is a platform used for building decentralized application and that's the difference between both projects. If you want to earn more Bitcoin, increase your income and use the money received to buy more Bitcoin, you can also trade Bitcoin and increase the amount you own but that's very risky. Staking increase the centralization of a project and Bitcoin can't have such traits.",

You can hodl but not only by holding, you have to have a specific target on your holding as to when to sell or limit your holdings to especially when you've earn some money over time after the bullrun happened and before the market begins to fall, you can sell out.Quote from: Outhue on May 22, 2023, 06:24:19 AMIs there any way to HODL and make more BTC? Target the bullrun season when the bitcoin will get to a new all time high but before then, study the price trends and know the current position, speculate well and buy the dip and hodl, you could also invent into bitcoin trading, which is a short time of investment and you could earn as well through this.",

But I think staking is only applicable to PoS that's why Ethereum move their model into it. But obviously Bitcoin is still PoW and I doubt that we will move into PoS in the near future.So in any case, yes, the best thing for a Bitcoin investors is HODL.Risk is that if you don't know how to have a good safety and security practice, there are chance that you might lose it through hacks.The obvious benefit is that you are going to make profits if you invest on a bear market, accumulate, buy and have the mentality to HODL and then wait for the right time to sell in a bull run.",

Yes you could only hodl and wait for its value to increase then sell it once its appreciated through monetary value. Once bitcoin drop again you could increase your holding by buying it back so basically you increase your asset in bitcoin. Its purpose is to be use for transaction for peer to peer as per Satoshi vission and goal. Cant really compared that into eth which has different consensus that can increase through staking.If you are fond of increasing your asset then go for altcoins. Cant really much do on bitcoin about this.",

Remember if you loan me 0.1btc today at 26+k to pay back 0.12btc in a month time and within that period of time the price of bitcoin dumps to 19k. When the person is to pay back and he pays you exactly 0.12btc,mate you made a big lost due to the price that you lend him at that time. It is better and safer to give out loan in fiat currency.The only way to make profit in bitcoin is to hodi for a very long time, maybe 10-15yrs with continuous DCA and you will be a winner.

I know that Bitcoin is a proof of work coin, but I am only curious if there is something you can do, while planning to hold your Bitcoin for 2 years or more, is there any benefit of holding and making more Bitcoin? I believe one of the benefits of HODLing is that your coins will retain its value owning to the near steady nature of BTC. It is also more secure.QuoteAlso, What are those RSK Bitcoin for? Any benefit at all? I didn't want to write so much as to explain to clearify what the RSK Bitcoin mean. One fact is that it isn't a cryptocurrency on its own to be used to facilitate payment. It enables smart contract for big transactions and trades. It is still under the BTC Blockchain network. It has cheaper fees and speed of transaction is faster than the regular BTC charge or transaction speed which is about 10mins. QuoteRootstock Platform (RSK) is a second-layer virtual machine that addresses specific limitations of the Bitcoin blockchain. It was introduced in 2014 by developers to increase Bitcoin transaction times and provide smart contracts.RSK is not a cryptocurrency or designed to be a payment method—it is a layer that works in the background to validate transactions much faster via merged mining.RSK also allows decentralized finance application developers to create their DeFi protocols, NFTs, or other digital assets using the Bitcoin blockchain. This will enable Bitcoin to become a cryptocurrency ecosystem similar to Ethereum.Fees have risen sharply since Bitcoin and Ethereum were first introduced, so RSK's innovative approach works to lower these fees.RBTC, or the RSK Bitcoin (RBTC), is the RSK token used to pay transaction fees for smart contracts on the RSK blockchain.Here is a link to learn more about RSK Bitcoin:https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-rsk-it-threat-ethereum/",

I'd probably stick with DCA and swing trades to earn more. Akthough it has bigger risk but if things would be done using the right technical analysis, things would be somehow fine.There's nothing wrong if an investor would enter the market and will just choose. The conflict arises from our expectancies; if you are looking for bigger profit and in a quicker way, then prepare to take risks. There's no way you'd earn easily in any field of investment so what more in this cryptospace wherein prices are way too volatile.",
