      "body": "Unless you host it yourself not having to go through KYC is going to be difficult.Your location matters too. Not all services are available everywhere. But if you are using a gateway to convert BTC to fiat most places are going to need / want to know who they are dealing with.If you are just accepting BTC and keeping it as BTC there are more options.-Dave",

Please take note that it's not indicated there whether the service requires KYC or not. The payment commission percentage and the number of supported cryptocurrencies are the only additional data provided. User Husires has also made a [.List] Bitcoin Payment Processors. The list is divided into self-hosted and hosted. The list also includes information whether Lightning Network is supported or not, whether there's KYC or not, and others. I hope these couple of threads would help you.",

You'll instead receive resources that will allow you to create a payment gateway with a full node and some lite code. There is heaps of open-source code that will enable you to achieve this, such as some great solutions have already been posted above. Your own solution using your own node means that:You do not have to worry about anything like KYC or account limitationsNo fees or charges on your transactions (except network fees)You are in control of your data.You can resolve any issues that arise with payments yourself by exploring your node, instead of having to be in touch with a third party to look into it for you.Don't trust a company when you don't need to!",

I assume OP has small shop and manages it himself. In this case, I don't think government is going to investigate his website and ask him for KYC documents and information of his customers. Everywhere I have paid with bitcoin, has no one ever asked for KYC documents, even eBay, Amazon and ecommerce websites don't ask for KYC documents.

More information about this is definitely needed on the forum and this post validates once more that the Cybersecurity and Privacy board would come in handy for elaborating on subjects like this.",
