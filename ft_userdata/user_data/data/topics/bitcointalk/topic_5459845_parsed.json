  "content": "Original Topic: Unboxing Ledger Nano S Plus 2023Author:joker_josueLedger Nano S PlusSome time wey I wan buy wallet hardware, and afta wey I don analyze am I com put am 4 mind say na Ledger Nano S Plus, wch I believe say na e dey suitable 4 mi 2 use. In dat sense, I com put am 4 mind say I go share dis new experience wit all of na 4 di whole cominiti. I den start wit di mos important point, make una open di box an see watin dey inside am, wit di share of some images and observations made.First of all, I go like 2 highlight am dat I buy am direct 4rm official website, and I no get any connection or affiliation wit Ledger.1. PackageAfter wey I don place order, 4 official website, I com dey notice am hw much I think e could be improved by Ledger. Di shipment was made by DHL and 4 tracking and ordering information, e com dey clear say origin na 4rm Ledger. Although 4 package were di order is located, e no get logo, di carrier label contained di name Ledger ( although very discreet ).I think e go be good 4 Ledger to try reduce am dis type of information as much possible, since malicious people go no di origin 4 di packaging and conclude dat  person wey dey handles crypto. I no no say na  disame true of oda brands, but e go be point wey we go consider by wallet hardware manufacturers.( I don put am 4 mind say I no go post any image 4 di package, 4 privacy reasons. )2. Ledger BoxDi Ledger box follows di simple line 4 brand, gray and black, and wit simple references di characteristics 4 equipment.3. ContentI com see am say e dey very very interesting, dat di first thing wey you go see wen opening di box na simple card saying: \"Trust Yourself\" ( Trust yourself ). Wit dat simple sentence, you go com convey di main idea 2 have and use dis type of equipment: make you trust us to save our money. A good marketing message 4rm di Ledger teamDen you go remove dis card, wit dis beautiful message, we Don see di rest of di content: di Ledger ( obviously ); USB connection cable; envelope wey get instructions; envelope wey det cards 4 di seed; and small key ring.4. Content: Envelope InstructionsInside a pink envelope, we com see several useful documents 2 start using di equipment and how to configure it. Dis documents dey in several languages, thus facilitating deir use. E dey includes a small card 2 showcase your \"Ledger Live\" application\". And a set of stickers in white and black, wit di brand logo.5. Content: Envelope SeedIn an orange envelope, we see three cards, wch allow you 2 write di 24 recovery words. I think it was positive 2 provide three cards, as dis don allows you 2 make several backups, or even use various strategies 2 store di seed. For example, you can divide di 24 words by di three cards, and den keep dem in three different locations, making it difficult 4 someone 2 discover di entire seed.5. Content: LedgerDi main one is small and light Ledger Nano S Plus, wit its design wel no 4 simplicity. Its small screen dey protected by film mey e avoid risks in transport. Di dimensions 4 equipment ( closed ) are: 62mm length; 17mm width; and 10mm height. Di main difference 4 dis model, 4 di previous one, is di dimension of di display, wch currently as: 26mm length ( di previous version had + / - 22mm ); and 11mm width ( di previous version had + / - 5mm ).6. ConfigurationAfter wey you don install am di official Ledger software - Ledger Live, I connect di wallet 2 di computer and start di configuration process. Wit just your two buttons, 2 navigate di menus, E dey easy 2 do  whole process. One button go move forward and anoda to go back, and  wey you dey press both at disame time, a choice go dey confirmed.Using di simple tutorial 2 follow, wch Ledger Live presents, di first thing you go introduce a PIN 2 di device, 4rm 4 to 8 numbers. Den, the seed go generate and wch we must keep, very well. I dey review each word two or three times, and den it moves forward and you have 2 enter 24 words 4 device 2 tek confirm dat registration don dey well.After dey don create di seed and e dey confirmed, Ledger Live suggested go update di equipment's firmware, wch I promptly performed. Den, you go start installing di apps 4 each currency. E get di capacity of 1.28 MB, and each app associated with a currency / token occupies only a few KB, wit few occupying more dan 100 KB.After wey di app don install, di card go create, and you go start using it. Dis whole process, done calmly, took about 40 minutes.I hope say you go like am, and if you wan no any more details just ask. And I go dey wait 4 your tips and suggestions. Code:EDIT: I don add few more details about Ledger.EDIT 2: I don decide 2 add di configuration details here.",
