It's caused by the pretty similar case like axie. people shall buy sneaker to play which lead it into the ponzi mechanism. Im sure that the price will be bounced back again but not for this time. This may go even lower than before.",

Also China waking anytime soon, the impact of the news might get it lowered and looks on the btc status isnt also favorable it could dump more. But check the technical analysis, it might also bounce too, asriloni is right it could be for short term or wait for the day to end before entering.",

The dump will not be forever and that was another panic sell that caused by the bad news for GMT. You are making the right point if you can go at the dip and then you may get instant profit from scalping GMT but remember if this is a very risky decision to be taken. It's not all of people able to take a very difficult decision like yours. You are so lucky enough to say that if you are able making profit from the dump that already occured.",

There is an opportunity to profit from scalping from GMT, but be aware that it is risky to trade when the Bitcoin market is in resistance, so if you are scalping then make sure the GMT price is lower than the current high, maybe 0.9 is the right price in my opinion and the target is 1-1.2 maybe hope can be achieved.",

You know it's like still in its early stage where you could hardly judge the real valuation of a project, regardless if you instead wanna earn from buying their NFTs I think that alone could do.",

You shall aware about that too, GMT was the most potential move to earn project in the crypto. Im sure that when this dumped so hard and there will always be a recovery for GMT. The pattern is quite easy to be predicted and i have bought at the dip as well. It seems like that we will see another dip to come soon with the bitcoin sentiment that was still feeling bearish. i hope that time will come as soon as possible",
