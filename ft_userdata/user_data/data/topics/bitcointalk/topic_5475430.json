  "content": "Attention, BitcoinTalk community:Please be cautious and aware of the fraudulent activities carried out by an russian individual named \"cryptofbi007\" & \"icryptofbi\" (ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º). This evil person has created multiple fake crypto QR code generator websites, including \"xmr-qr-code.com\", \"xmr-qr-code-generator.com\", and \"xmrqrcode.com\". These websites generate QR codes that only direct funds to the scammer's Monero (XMR) address: 84gHdF7rArqU6e9cbmfPi9iJR2QUU7CoX1XJEvAmQWXmSUkj3C3LVLW3ioHiqNc8iwGPcxCv5Fk13ZY k9fxQFLKuKEW54r6Please note that a saved archive of the phishing website containing the fraudster's Monero address can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20231122120748/https://xmr-qr-code.com/8.phpThis phishing scam involves tricking users into sending their cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet through a QR code, resulting in significant financial losses. The scam operator, known by the pseudonym \"cryptofbi007\" on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.To protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with \"cryptofbi007\". If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.The scam involving crypto QR code phishing works as follows: The victim enters the crypto address for which they need a QR code. Then, when they generate the QR code on one of the fraudulent crypto QR code websites, it always displays the same QR code on the final page, containing the fraudster's crypto address. Regardless of which crypto address the victim initially entered, the QR code will always belong to the fraudster, and the victim remains unaware. If someone sends cryptocurrency to the victim's \"QR code\", the funds will actually go to the fraudster, as the QR code belongs to them and displays their crypto address.His email accounts: The operator is known to use the following email addresses: \"cryptofbi007@gmail.com\" and \"uuyqq11qqaa@protonmail.com\".Due to this abuse, Proton Team has already banned the account \"uuyqq11qqaa@protonmail.com\", while the account \"cryptofbi007@gmail.com\" remains active.His YouTube profile: The YouTube account \"https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielenesto1\", named Gabriel Enesto (as of 12/22/2023) with Channel-ID: \"UCO5q0rVGQs4F4IKnNUbRERg\" belongs to the notorious individual known as \"cryptofbi007\". The fraudster \"cryptofbi007\", previously known as \"@gabrielenesto\" on YouTube, recently changed his YouTube handle to \"@gabrielenesto1\" with the intention of misleading and socially engineering individuals involved in this case. While the old YouTube handle now leads to an error page, people might mistakenly believe the link is incorrect, false, or outdated, whereas the actual YouTube handle as of 12/22/2023 is \"@gabrielenesto1\" and can be accessed.His Trustpilot profile: Additionally, the Trustpilot account \"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63c0b6a16503ee0012e7c049\" also belongs to this despicable character. He utilizes these platforms to defame legitimate companies due to the banning of some of his phishing domains and to sabotage his competitors, driven solely by his insatiable greed.Also, \"Cryptofbi007\" and \"iCryptofbi\", who is named Gabriel Enesto on Trustpilot, changed his country to France in the settings, which is why it shows FR on his clearly fake reviews; however, he is originally from Russia, using this method to manipulate both people and law enforcement agencies.His Reddit profile: The fraudster known as \"cryptofbi007\" went to the extent of creating a public and restricted Reddit group called \"qr_code_\" to bolster his deceptive crypto QR phishing scam websites in search engine rankings. This group can be seen at \"https://www.reddit.com/r/qr_code_/\".To further his illicit activities, the fraudster operates under the Reddit username \"Itchy-Attention8905\". More information about his activities and profile can be found at \"https://www.reddit.com/user/Itchy-Attention8905/\".His Medium Profile: The Medium profile \"@cryptofbi007\", which can be visited at \"https://medium.com/@cryptofbi007\" (banned), also belongs to the Russian cybercriminal who goes by \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk. Another Medium profile of this criminal fraudster is \"@wilman0919\" where he promotes his phishing mixer websites such as here: https://medium.com/@wilman0919/eth-mixer-the-tornado-cash-alternative-d4f8c581701c (Archive: https://archive.is/PXt0Z).His GitHub profile: Additionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 (banned), attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems. Here are the relevant repositories and issues:https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080While \"cryptofbi007\" attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.I recently discovered that a malicious individual known as \"@cryptofbi007\" (banned) on GitHub has created a new account on Github with the username \"@Ceytllle\" (https://github.com/Ceytllle). This person, using the username \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk, is falsely accusing random individuals who report phishing websites of being me, just as he did on the GitHub platform under his new account named \"@Ceytllle\" (banned). This is how I came to understand that these are multiple accounts of the same individual. He have linked a BitcoinTalk topic on a GitHub comment where he claim I am somehow involved with websites that I have no association or connection to. It appears that this fraudulent individual is intentionally targeting anyone involved in the fight against crypto cybercrime, including myself.Another GitHub profile which got created yesterday that might be of interest is https://github.com/AlbionNEO (AlbionNEO), as I follow a similar connection to the other profiles, including timings of creating and reporting.I obtained some of his social media accounts by reporting the phishing websites to domain registrars and hosting providers. The Russian individual behind these fraudulent activities went by the names \"icryptofbi\" or \"cryptofbi007\". Consequently, I received delayed messages that contained pertinent information from this fraudster.Furthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as \"Crypto-qr-code.com\", \"btc-qr-code.se\", and \"crypto-qr-code.su\". These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4WThe phishing websites \"usdt-qr.com\" and \"ltc-qr-code.su\" are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym \"cryptofbi007\", indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims. It is of utmost importance to raise awareness about these fraudulent activities to protect potential targets from falling prey to these scams.To aid in identification, please find below a list of all known phishing crypto addresses and domains associated with \"cryptofbi007\":Phishing Crypto Addresses by \"cryptofbi007\":1.

This behavior reveals their malicious intent.The operator of this crypto QR code phishing network is also involved in fake cryptocurrency mixer phishing scam websites. The phishing website \"eth-mixer.to\" uses the same nameservers that I researched for his other crypto QR code phishing domains, \"btc-qr.to\" (Archive: https://archive.is/UYrpT) and \"coin-qr.to\" (Archive: https://archive.is/9zHzB), which are \"grace.ns.cloudflare.com\" and \"hans.ns.cloudflare.com\" as of 2/20/2024. The fake ETH mixer phishing website \"eth-mixer.to\" (Archive: https://archive.is/I9Bnq) shows the same nameserver names and another fraudster's Ethereum address as \"0x1C0537db2BAcDB6B9f17aad6bb7356A6700e9FF1\". As of April 27, 2024, he uses a new domain, which is \"eth-mixers.to\", as the old domain \"eth-mixer.to\", which has now been redirected to the new domain \"eth-mixers.to\", has been flagged by anti-phishing security companies. (Archive: https://archive.is/mnhLM). The new phishing ETH address is: 0x9Bd4c820AE1eDeF28840dAaF704B7CE20C55b095.The same goes for \"btc-mixer.to\" (Archive: https://archive.is/TaqxC) where he uses his deposit Bitcoin address \"1AHkDZ1Ls6vjuME6XToP4wRqd3kmrYeQcp\" to receive stolen Bitcoin money, and \"ltc-mixer.to\" (Archive: https://archive.is/zszEY) where he uses his deposit Litecoin address \"LTdsbCtVridM36DTR2KrPLAwRtnDansD2Y\" to receive stolen Litecoin money. As of May 1, 2024, he uses a new domain, which is \"btc-mixers.to\", as the old domain \"btc-mixer.to\", which has now been redirected to the new domain \"btc-mixers.to\", has been flagged by anti-phishing security companies. The new phishing BTC address is: 14opz93THYBrYBa7NmnfW1HXwsBQKdbdpF. (Archive: https://archive.is/mnhLM). The same goes for \"ltc-mixer.to\" which redirects now to the new phishing domain \"ltc-mixers.to\". (Archive: https://archive.is/gd119). The new phishing LTC address is: LLs8KTkjYP8hTHCeQBbqP8geV4KcGs3Y2E.He has also now created a full cryptocurrency mixer phishing network next to his QR code crypto phishing network.Warning: Please be cautious of a fake crypto QR code generator scam conducted by users with pseudonyms \"cryptofbi007\", \"icryptofbi\", and \"Olgareva\".As the operator of this scam scheme resides in Russia, I recommend reporting the scammer on the following platforms, providing detailed information from this BitcoinTalk topic:Email: info@mvd.ru - Russian PoliceEmail: fsb@fsb.ru - Russian FBIEmail: incident@cert.gov.ruEmail: info@cert.ruIMPORTANT: If you are not Russian or do not have a Russian email address, I recommend creating a \".ru\" email address on websites such as \"https://rambler.ru\". For example, you can send a detailed report, similar to my complaint, to them from a Russian email address. This is necessary because other email providers, such as Google, may have blocked sending emails to \".ru\" addresses due to the ongoing war.IMPORTANTÂ²: In the police complaint, please remember to include the individual \"icryptofbi\" or also referred to as \"cryptofbi007\". This person utilized the Tether USDT address \"0xbee32483957f116c5830133188dca45b80b94fe6\" to receive the stolen funds and defraud numerous unsuspecting victims, resulting in the loss of several thousand dollars. He then transferred the stolen funds to his second address and then to FixedFloat. Don't forget to mention the contact methods for your police complaint report, stating that one can contact FixedFloat through email at \"info@fixedfloat.com\" or visit their website at \"https://fixedfloat.com/en/support\".They can provide server logs and IPs of the Russian cybercriminal who laundered the stolen cryptocurrency money there. This evidence can be presented to the police to ensure justice is served and victims are refunded.Report Cybercrime in Russia online: http://services.government.ru/en/letters/form/Report Cybercrime in Russia onlineÂ²: https://cert.gov.ru/en/abuse.html_Other Russian government contacts are available for residents in Russia:QuoteRussian Ministry of Internal Affairs:Website: http://www.mvd.ru/Phone: 8 (800) 350-75-28Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs Cybercrime Division (Department \"K\"):Website: http://www.mvd.ru/OVD/min/rukov_mvd/17/2012/258The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation:Phone: 02, 112The Ministry of Internal Affairs Public Relations Office:Phone: +7 (495) 667-72-64Address: 11 Sadovaya-Sukharevskaya st., 120090, Moscow, RussiaWebsite: http://government.ru/en/department/86/events/Economic Security and Anti-Corruption Department: +7 (495) 983-62-24The Economic Security and Anti-Corruption Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation deals with cybercrime and economic fraud.Stay vigilant and spread awareness within the crypto community.

The bottom line is we have to be very mindful with QR codes when scanning it.The phishing websites mentioned above are generating the same QR code for all crypto addresses entered by unsuspecting victims. This QR code leads to the scammer's cryptocurrency address, which is operated by \"cryptofbi007\" and the creator of these fraudulent crypto QR code phishing websites. This behavior contradicts the normal functioning of QR codes, as each deposit address should have its own unique QR code. However, the operator \"cryptofbi007\" manipulates the QR code generation process on these websites to always display their own QR code with their own cryptocurrency address, regardless of the crypto address entered by the clueless victim.This deceptive tactic enables the scammer to steal crypto funds from innocent victims who mistakenly trust the generated QR code. It is essential for users to exercise caution when scanning any QR code and to carefully verify the authenticity of the websites they are using.",

He falsely claims that anyone who reports them is also involved in the same malicious activities, exhibiting a cognitive bias whereby cybercriminals assume that everyone else is engaged in such activities, despite it being untrue.

What does someone even want to do with a QR code online generator? If you have an old wallet that doesn't support the default wallet converted to code, you can easily import your key to any of the open source wallets that support that and get your QR for whatever you want it for, or better yet, create a separate new wallet with a trusted device and a trusted wallet. That way, you can be assured of your security and privacy all together.Â It hurt me to see how ignorant a lot of people are and how unserious they take security matters, especially things that have to do with finances.",

      "body": "Unsubstantiated Accusations and Persistent Harassment by \"icryptofbi\" Exposed - A Case of Baseless Claims:It is evident from the previous replies on this topic that the malicious individual \"icryptofbi\" has already contradicted himself.Furthermore, I have noticed that this individual, \"icryptofbi\", has been making false and baseless accusations against random members of GitHub. These accusations lack any evidence, proof, or supporting documents.Despite his unwavering belief in these groundless accusations, I have observed that \"icryptofbi\" persistently harasses GitHub members under the assumption that they are somehow connected to me or that I am impersonating them. This assumption is completely false and unjust, as I have reiterated before.Alleged Connection Between Fraudulent Accounts \"Bitadvisor412\" and \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk Raises Concerns:I have recently come across a newly registered account named \"Bitadvisor412\" which exhibits striking similarities to my username and replicates the style and content of my reports. This occurrence raises suspicions for me, as the fraudulent individual at the center of this case has previously utilized similar malicious tactics against those who have reported and exposed their cybercriminal activities.I want to clarify unequivocally that I have no affiliation or connection whatsoever with the user \"Bitadvisor412\" on the BitcoinTalk forum. I emphasize this point to avoid any potential confusion or misunderstandings.Considering the established pattern of \"icryptofbi\" or \"cryptofbi007\" harassing GitHub members by creating multiple accounts with names resembling those they seek to harass on other platforms, it is likely that the new BitcoinTalk account \"Bitadvisor412\" also belongs to the same individual. It is plausible that this account has been created for future social engineering purposes or other malicious intentions.Unveiling Malicious Intent - Suspicious Behavior and Lack of Transparency in \"Bitadvisor412\" Forum Thread:I asked \"Bitadvisor412\" some relevant and related questions in the thread he opened on the Bitcointalk forum (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5479174.0). I also referred to my assumption previously stated in another post (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5479174.msg63397851#msg63397851). Additionally, I inquired about the reason behind his recent registration and the similarity between his username and mine, as well as the resemblance of his thread style text to mine, considering my reports.However, \"Bitadvisor412\" did not respond to my inquiries, which adds to the suspicious and malicious nature of this situation, especially when it revolves around important matters such as evidence and questions. Moreover, he abruptly changed the original post text to \"The issue has been resolved\" without providing any explanation or further details. This action appears extremely unprofessional and raises further doubts about his intentions.Reporting and Collaboration - Cooperative Investigation into Cybercriminal Activities Involving FixedFloat and Russian Federal Security Service (FSB):In the latest update as of 12/29/2023, I have informed both FixedFloat and the Russian Federal Security service (FSB) about this case, and they are currently investigating the matter. I have provided them with all relevant details and will continue to keep them updated if any further information is required. Official paperwork from the FSB regarding their investigation has been attached here for reference. Additionally, I have facilitated communication between the FSB and FixedFloat, enabling them to collaborate and resolve this case together in order to hold the russian cybercriminal accountable for their crimes, including the theft of cryptocurrency from innocent victims and money laundering.QuoteUncovering Malicious Impersonation Tactics - Warning against Social Engineering and Impersonation on BitcoinTalk and GitHub:Upon further investigation, I came across another newly registered account named \"JackETH\" that posted a reply in this thread: \"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472406.msg63411731#msg63411731\".Interestingly, I discovered a connection between this topic and a GitHub account named \"@JackWtx\" (https://github.com/JackWtx), which is also a recently registered account on GitHub. Both accounts on BitcoinTalk and GitHub contain the name \"Jack\". UPDATE as of 12/30/2023: After I created the post, \"@JackWtf\" (https://github.com/JackWtx) changed his name to \"@PeterBxs\" (https://github.com/PeterBxs) in an attempt to add complexity and evade detection, displaying highly suspicious and malicious activities that strongly support this fraudulent case.One aspect that grabbed my attention is the accusation made by an individual named \"icryptofbi\" or \"cryptofbi007\" against the original Jack (@Jackofusu80) on GitHub, insinuating his involvement in phishing activities. However, it is essential to emphasize that original Jack (@Jackofusu80) has built a solid reputation on GitHub for diligently reporting any phishing websites he encounters and promptly taking action against them. There are no public associations between the original Jack (@Jackofusu80) and any phishing websites. Nevertheless, fraudsters have targeted him with insults and harassment, feeling frustrated when their phishing websites get reported and subsequently blocked. Interestingly, some of the phishing websites from the crypto QR code phishing scam network created by \"icryptofbi\" have been exposed through Jack's vigilant reporting efforts.I had previously encountered a multi-account situation involving \"@cryptofbi007\" (banned) and \"@Ceytllle\" (recently banned), targeting the original Jack (@Jackofusu80) with harassment, insults, and baseless accusations.Now, the newly created GitHub account \"@JackWtx\" has posted a repository on GitHub related to MetaMask, linking to the same domain discussed in the BitcoinTalk link mentioned earlier in this post, where \"JackETH\" made a reply: \"https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/14685#issuecomment-1872424439\".Within the GitHub repository, \"@JackWtx\" tagged the real Jack (@Jackofusu80), who was the target of harassment from \"@cryptofbi007\" and \"@Ceytllle\" (both banned GitHub accounts of BitcoinTalk user \"icryptofbi\"). This incident occurred shortly after the previous mentioned GitHub accounts created by the malicious individual were banned.Update to this as of 12/30/2023: After I wrote this post, the GitHub User \"@JackWtx\" changed his name on GitHub to \"@PeterBxs\" (https://github.com/PeterBxs) in an attempt to manipulate and social engineer support teams and any readers of this post. It appears that he wants to erase any traces of his malicious activities, possibly in response to being exposed by me in this thread.Adding to the complexity of the situation, \"icryptofbi\" assumes in his texts that I am the real Jack (@Jackofusu80) of GitHub, which is not true as I have clarified before. Strangely, another newly registered account on BitcoinTalk has emerged with the name \"Bitadvisor412\", bearing similarities to my own name and even copying my thread reporting style.Upon analyzing this situation, a notable pattern emerges, suggesting a distinct parallel between the potential employment of malicious impersonation tactics and the utilization of social engineering techniques. It appears that the individual known as \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk, operating under the aliases \"Bitadvisor412\" and \"JackETH\", may be connected to this dubious behavior. Considering the circumstances, it is highly likely that all these recently created accounts on both BitcoinTalk and GitHub belong to the same malicious individual, \"icryptofbi\", active within the BitcoinTalk forum.I urge everyone to remain vigilant and aware of these cybercriminal social engineering methods being exploited by the individual which goes under \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk and \"cryptofbi007\" around the internet.",
