Before they were in a position where it became much more difficult to start a business or try different methods to tap other revenue streams.For those who profit with stocks, crypto and other assets as other means of income. The most common regret is not having started earlier. Time spent idle could translate to opportunities missed.There are some who believe the biggest danger is taking a chance. They play it safe.

Because you want the things you have to give to them  If you have big properties, gold, and BTC, you would want your kids to have them after you die but having none or just one is just not very productive.",

Some regret already having not learnt about Bitcoin earlier, am one of those who think I started my Bitcoin journey rather late, but the financial status of my nation right now, has rather motivated most of us to up our game and seek out other means of earning, of which Bitcoin is top.Also, the period when one is single, without family or siblings that are really dependent on you for survival, is the best time to follow dreams of the heart and be daring with financial investments.

Instead, we can concentrate on the here and now, doing everything we can to make the most of the situation. When we see others making money off of a new and developing asset class like cryptocurrency, for example, it's only natural to feel a twinge of FOMO ourselves. Yet, keep in mind that hindsight is always 20/20. Since there are always new opportunities, we should learn as much as we can, diversify our investments, and be aware of the risks. It's been said that \"Trees should have been planted 20 years ago when they would have thrived. This is the second-best time.\"",

Time is the most valuable resource in my opinion. because we may have heard from a young age that investing in stocks and other assets is beneficial. However, many of us lack the financial resources to invest in it. And even if we have spare money, we may not have enough time or be well-equipped to understand how to invest effectively. Investing is also risky and given how young we are and how little money we have, the risks may not be right for us. We must stop harboring regrets and embrace reality with optimism. As time passes, we live and learn. In any case, anyone can achieve success at any age.",

Please share what you believe to be the biggest risks in finance.Like you rightly pointed out, not taking risks is the greatest risk in life. Fear and indecision are one of the banes to success. There is no guarantee that a venture will be successful that's why every business or project has a percentage of risk attached to it. The greater the risk is sometimes the higher the profitability. Some person missed some good opportunities because they lacked the resources to finance it. Some person would have bought bitcoin many years ago if they had the funds to acquire it. People in the developing world are more focused on meeting their basic needs and surviving, investment is their secondary priority. But some people missed it out of fear and indecision.I don't blame myself so much for my past events because I can't change them. The mistakes of the past cannot be changed but one can learn from the past and change the present life. I will not also say I came to bitcoin late because I am earlier than billions of people, so I count myself fortunate. I am also early because I believe that bitcoin price will still go high and I might make some profit. I came to bitcoin because I was introduced to bitcointalk, so if I have known about this platform a long time ago, I would have come earlier. In summary, let the past go, maximize the present and plan for the future.",

There were no subjects on financial literacy, investments at school and instituteThose. the only real problem with my youth is the lack of information and the ability to get it. In the USSR, the speeches of the next, meaningless and useless \"Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU\" were printed in many millions of copies, but not a single book on the market, investments, financial literacy, etc. Features of the totalitarian system In the presence of initial information and a functioning brain - to adopt experience and learn and develop - it's just a matter of time!",
