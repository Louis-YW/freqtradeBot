  "content": "Hello everyone!I apologize in advance if this topic has already been covered. Unfortunately, I have not found anything about it.I found this logo, it was probably created in December 2009, when Bitcoin Core 0.2 was released. Is this the very first graphical representation of Bitcoin? Did Satoshi make this logo? Where could it be seen at that time? Any Sources?All I could find from Satoshi about the logo was this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.msg561#msg561https://imgur.com/a/GXkSfG9Thanks!",

I guess the earliest logo was the golden coin with the BC in the middle. The BC was later on replaced with the BTC that we now use, but the coin and its color or the background remained the same. This was finally replaced with bitboy's version: a white BTC slightly slanting to the right, in Ubuntu font, and with an orange-colored circle as a background.",

For the first time, the Bitcoin graphic symbol appeared on the icon of this version - the Latin letter B with two vertical lines, similar to the American dollar symbol ( $ ). Initially, there were two Latin letters BC on the Bitcoin icon.So, according to the text, the logo should most likely have been created between the BC and and B Coin logo.So it is NOT the very first version of the logo. I would still be interested to know where this logo came from and where it first appeared. I can prove that with the Waybackmachine further down in the text.Yes exactly, that was also the only thing I found too.Quote from: autumnleaf on January 14, 2023, 09:27:01 AMI don't think so, but I was curious too, so I looked it up.

The image files that Autumnleaf posted can't be accessed today either. But there should be at least a hint.If you look at Waybackmachine, how the download page looked on 08.01.2010, as shortly after the release of 0.2, then you can see that the old BC logo was still used.http://web.archive.org/web/20100108103942/https://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Quote from: Darker45 on January 14, 2023, 02:21:50 PMNo, it's not the one.

And why would someone fake something like that?You surprised me with this question, how many people had claimed that they are Satoshi Nakamoto? Of course, many of them. For that same view/reason alone, anyone could come forward to claim anything for themselves and their website, in some cases to gain recognition. People could do things for any reason, that's why I maintain the ground that only Satoshi could explain from the beginning to the end the challenges he faced, the prototypes of things before they eventually made into the bitcoin we are seeing and appreciate today. And this must come from a channel that is well known to be linked to him, not otherwise",
