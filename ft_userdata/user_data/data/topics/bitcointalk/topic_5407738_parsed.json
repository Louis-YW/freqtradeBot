I assume you created a paper wallet to be absolutely sure your private keys don't touch the internet, right? And I assume it has substantial value that you don't want to risk. In that case: sweep it offline, sign offline, and broadcast the transaction after copying it. That means you need to use a PC instead of a phone. It will probably be okay if you just use a hot wallet on Android, but I prefer the \"better safe than sorry\" approach.I wrote this short guide last year:Quote from: LoyceV on February 19, 2021, 05:35:55 PMOnline:Install Electrum on your PC.Import your address to create a watch-only wallet.Preview the transaction, Copy the unsigned transaction. Put it on a USB stick.Offline and running without hard drive storage:Get a Linux LIVE DVD. Use Knoppix or Tails for instance, or any other distribution that comes with Electrum pre-installed.Unplug your internet cable. Close the curtains. Reboot your computer and start up from that DVD. Don't enter any wireless connection password. Keep it offline.Start Electrum. Import your private key.Copy your unsigned transaction from the USB stick, load it into Electrum.CHECK the transaction in Electrum. Check the fees, check the amount, check all destination addresses (character by character).If all is okay, sign the transaction. Copy it back to your USB stick.Turn off the computer. That wipes the Live LINUX from memory and all traces are gone.Online:Use your normal online Electrum to (check again and) broadcast the transaction.Bonus:After moving all your Bitcoin, and once the transaction confirmed, check if you own Forkcoins.For reading: Topic title style guide.",

I have a Google pixel 5a.Are we talking about smaller amount of coins you want to sweep from paper wallet and spend?If this is the case you can use any open source Bitcoin wallet and scan QR code with your phone, but best option is to use airgapped phone disconnected from internet with Electrum wallet app installed.Here is one very good step by step tutorial by Crypto Guide how to do everything correctly:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixnTZDZ0-yk",

What you can only do is create a new wallet under \"wallet\" where you can import your backup seed. In this case, the sweep button is only available on the desktop version.@Tim101If you know the address where you want to send it you can make a watch-only wallet of that address(Make sure you have full control of that address) then sweep it wallet>private keys>sweep. This is an alternative suggestion from the above posts since the mobile version does not have sweep option you will need a PC to do this.",

      "body": "Sweeping is nothing else as transferring 100% of balance into address belonging to target wallet. It means that you do not need any special tool which would allow you to “sweep” paper wallet. Instead of that, just note down the address you want to use as a recipient, create a new wallet base on paper wallet data and then transfer the whole content of the paper wallet account into your prepared wallet. Advantage of sweeping function is that you execute it from your destination wallet, so you do not need to create a one temporary wallet for importing paper wallet. Why do you ask about program for a mobile? Are you forced to use qrcode as a source of private key instead pf text?",
