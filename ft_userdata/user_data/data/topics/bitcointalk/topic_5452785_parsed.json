I have dared to say such a thing because you have told real and active as well as you told non-drop. If your service is non-drop then why you are offering a refill warranty? Refill warranty stands for those services which can be dropped.",

Only what OP did was drop an email address so prospective clients would so they could get to him very fast. No introduction, no portfolio no explanations. This is not what you think you could comprehend when it goes sour. Do not engage with this without proper research. All these;Â \"Premium FollowersAll Real & Active100% Safe & SecureRefill GuaranteedNon-Drop Followers200-400 Per day Safe Delivery\" Â are nothing but bot-generated and I do not think this is feasible in a natural process.",

It also shows how careless you are towards the events happening on here.While I wonâ€™t want to judge based on your post, I canâ€™t help but say that this is a major red flag ðŸš© which may possibly affect you if youâ€™re not careful.Yes, itâ€™s a market place but you should try to gain some level of trust before placing ads, especially ones that looks fishy.It is also important to note that purchasing followers violates the terms of service of most social media platforms and can lead to penalties such as account suspension or removal of purchased followers. It's better to focus on building genuine followers through authentic means rather than risking your account and reputation by resorting to quick account growth. I personally think this shouldnâ€™t be tolerated here.Lastly, as a beginner, I suggest you focus more on creating more quality content so as to boost the confidence and trust of others engaging you.",

I have reported some of those posts, but they it is still unhandled. Just moved on to the digital goods section.",
