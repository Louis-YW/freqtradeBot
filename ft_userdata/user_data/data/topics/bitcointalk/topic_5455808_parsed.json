  "content": "Determine if the team is a loser against the spread, a loser on the money line, or a loser on bothTeams that lose against the spread and money line are usually bad bets. You can find a winning game among an SU and ATS loser, but it doesn’t happen often enough for you to make long term profit betting on the team.We want teams that have no worse than a .400 record against the spread or no worse than a .400 record on the money line.A lot of times straight up winning teams are bad against the spread bets. The more a team wins straight up, the more oddsmakers adjust spread lines in favor of underdogs.Remember, human beings like to bet on winners. So to attract action on the other side of the line, oddsmakers turn favored teams into underlays with ridiculous spreads.Once we find the team, we can move to step 2.Discover why the team loses.400 teams aren’t the same as a .300 team. A .300 team is likely just a bad team. But a .400 team often has a losing record due to some anomaly, like an injured offensive lineman, or like in Milwaukee’s case versus Miami in this year’s NBA Playoffs, their best player not being one-hundred percent.Try to find out why the team loses. Once you believe you’ve discovered why, move to step 3.Read more→ https://n2g.io/43c2c11",

I hope you change your marketing strategy because the current one is not good Exactly. Show proof first and then we'll believe. You OP are not something special right here (pardon if it sounded rude) as there are countless people here that are like you, who advertised some form of winning strategy, mostly to unsuspecting  and stupid bettors here who are in it for the money and not for the entertainment, only for these people to lose considerably in the process. I suggest you give us something to work with, as a lot of newbies here in the betting parts of the forum fall victim to scams that involve some form of betting edge to give them more wins in exchange for fees. Plus these games although player skill still has a role, are all in essence games of chance (as Slow Death mentioned) so to find how they lose and then use that information to win games tells me that you're either scamming people out of their betting money, or you're a time traveler in the future hoping to make quick cash out of your apparent clairvoyance given the fact that you lived in the future, seeing all the wins from these games. In which case I'd tell you to either piss off, or to piss off cause what benefit would you get from this?",

I do also have the feels basing up on the title alone that there would be some sort of advertisement of services.Its true that we do have some some tipsters on this forum which are actually for free for someone to follow on on which i would say that it is really better to stick into that one.If this one is really that real on having the general idea on betting into the underdog or against the ML then you would be able to make win if there's an upset but we know that this doesnt happen all the time.",
