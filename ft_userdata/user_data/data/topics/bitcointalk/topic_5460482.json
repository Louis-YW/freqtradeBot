  "content": "Peer-to-peer Privacy focused BlockchainThe main network of Kiirocoin is developed based on Firo. Kiiro is a cryptocurrency aimed at revolutionizing the community by rewarding members through a unique 60% Proof of Stake (PoS) and 20% Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. Built as a fork of Dash, Firo, Raptoreum leverages the power of the Firopow algorithm and asset-creation capabilities to create a sustainable and versatile community ecosystem.The vision of Kiiro Chain is to build an infinitely scalable distributed high-performance computing network and become the most important computing infrastructure in the era of AI+ metaverse.What are we doing on bitcointalk?Kiiro Blockchain is an open-source and community driven project, we encourage and seek contributions and innovative ideas to keep making Kiiro better and better by each passing day.Quick Kiirocoin Facts:- Kiiro is a next generation cryptographic currency.- It supports instant transactions and privacy using lelantus protocol.- ChainLocks Protects Against 51% Attacks- Kirro has no premine and was launched fairly and transparently- Total coin supply will most likely be near 60 million- Kiiro uses the FiroPow algorithm for mining which is Asic Resistant.Features- Untraceable payments- Very Low Fees- Unlinkable transactions- Blockchain analysis resistance- Nearly 51% Attack proofTokenomics of KiirocoinThe Kiiro tokenomics model is designed to support a balanced and sustainable ecosystem by distributing rewards among smartnodes, Proof of Work (PoW) miners, and developers. The tokenomics model is as follows:- 60% MasterNodes (PoS)- 20% Proof of Work (PoW)- 10% Governance Fee- 10% Community RewardsThe masternodes mechanism will receive 60% of the rewards, incentivizing small and medium-sized businesses to participate in the Kiiro ecosystem and earn coins for their trading activities.Website:https://kiirocoin.org/Whitepaper:https://kiirocoin.org/docs/Kiiro_Whitepaper.pdfExplorer:https://explorer.kiirocoin.org/Github:https://github.com/Kiirocoin/kiiroSocial:Twitter: https://twitter.com/kiirocoinTelegram: https://t.me/kiirocoinDiscord : https://discord.gg/yFbbrtPscqWallet:Ubuntu 18: https://github.com/Kiirocoin/kiiro/releases/download/v1.0.0.0/ubuntu-18.zipUbuntu 20:https://github.com/Kiirocoin/kiiro/releases/download/v1.0.0.0/ubuntu-20.zipWindows: https://github.com/Kiirocoin/kiiro/releases/download/v1.0.0.0/windows.zipMac: https://github.com/Kiirocoin/kiiro/releases/download/v1.0.0.1/mac-kiirocore.zipLogo:https://explorer.kiirocoin.org/img/logo.pngGPU Miners:Nvidia GPU: T-Rex Miner (closed source, 1% fee) https://github.com/trexminer/T-Rex/releasesAMD GPU: Team Red Miner (closed source, 2% fee)https://github.com/todxx/teamredminer/releasesAMD GPU: SRBMiner-Multi (closed source, 0.85% fee)https://github.com/doktor83/SRBMiner-Multi/releasesExchanges:https://safe.trade/trading/kiirousdthttps://xeggex.com/market/KIIRO_USDThttps://nonkyc.io/market/KIIRO_USDTMining Pools:https://miningpoolstats.stream/kiirocoin",

Once the ROI is higher then the nodes will stop and start dumping the coin. To whom? What's the utility of the coin?    - team has a \"community\" funds, they keep selling coins everyday to collect $ for development. Sure, that's legit but they collected ~20k and nothing has been done. They are keep saying that Shared nodes are under development. 2. No usability:   - The sole purpose of the coin is (imo) to be a ponzi for those that want to run a node.    - 51% attack resistant & privacy - nothing new here, just a fork with some different configurations 3. Shady approach:   - Their core members and owners are writing like 14 y/o.   - They lack professionalism. They are giving unbacked replies, empty words.   - their whitepaper is copy pasta from 3 other coins (all dead) Avian Network and Arsa - I wouldn't be surprised that the \"team\" is the same4. Low social presence:   - Barely a few tweets, no announcements (beside them selling the coins for \"development\")   - They said they applied for CMC but not Coingecko - we shall see if they are getting listed   - No updates on discord. A few messages here and there but that's all. When people are asking legit questions their answers are :\"it is normal to have copy paste whitepaper\", \"you are fudding\", \"this is not your concern\" etcMaybe I'am wrong but these are quite consistent red flags.Wish you all good luck",

We are testing shared nodes platform and it will be out soon we are trying best to finish it and launch asap but things take time. We have also finished 90% development for android wallet too and now started working on IOS. Update regarding all these will be shared is discord so everybody can see it. The funds we collected so far will be all utilised for sure it’s not going to sit there in wallet forever. About economics it’s nothing new that we are trying to do it’s been successful for few projects I have seen I personally don’t see a problem there but everyone have different opinions of course.I agree the social presence is bit low and we lack some good marketing also but don’t worry I can assure you that will be improved and we are in touch with some good crypto communities and YouTube channel if everything went well an interview will be soon out where we openly talk about our approach and future plans.Have a good day",
