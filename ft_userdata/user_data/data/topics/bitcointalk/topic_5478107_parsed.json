Server is still partially accessible on my end though, IIS appears running, but everything is very slow. The 503 error sort of hints towards a resource issue, one way or the other.Yeah looks like DDOS. Not much I can do about that. As I said in the other thread, the forum is full of deranged trolls with nothing better to do. BPIP is only known or useful to bitcointalkers so no one else would have any interest in bringing it down.Quote from: Mia Chloe on December 16, 2023, 06:49:59 AM<~~~>Please is this an error my end ?

After BPIP, there are two more websites: loyce.club and ninjastic.space that have scrapers on forum topics, posts and more.I don't say BPIP is not important but this thread is not about that. It is more like creating a topic to get impression for post quota or for merit.It is very easier to see other available threads and no prohibition to join those available threads for discussions. Creating new topics is unnecessary.",

It consists of simple public data that is almost of no use to them but still they attacked it.So sad, I hope the admins of bpip would have regular backups of it so they can relaunch it soon.I am highly dependent on bpip but only sometimes like whenever I have to calculate my 120 days merit or have to review someone's profile like how much merits they have gained and from which person and even when I have to confirm that if some member have been banned then archive is written under there profile on bpip. It is a great tool and I hope it would be recovered soon.",

But now it works.Just curious now, is the DDoS attack safe on browser extensions?",

Of course if the extension needs to fetch something from the server (like rank and DT level as you mentioned) and the server is being DDOSed, it may not be able to get that information. But there is no safety issue.",
