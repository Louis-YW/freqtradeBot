Wanting to withdraw $20 because 'I'm done with crypto' sounds to me like you were playing with money you couldn't afford to lose and without following basic money management rules.",

So if you want to withdraw Bitcoin from Binance you must have equal or more than 0.0012 BTC on your balance.if you really just want to leave everything, I don't think there is a fee for a transfer between Binance users. Well, maybe you should try to find someone here to whom you would send coins to Binance and he would send them to your wallet or whatever is possible.",

There could be policy changes that you're not aware yet. An example would be the need to pass their KYC verification before you can make any withdrawal there.How about converting your BTC into an altcoin with a lower minimum withdrawal? Try looking into XRP or Doge. I don't use Binance anymore so you may have to check that yourself.",

That way you can sell without any additional charges and also it's still very fast within an hour you can get the cash without any stress. QuoteIf I deposit like another 20 bucks in BTC can I like instantly withdrawal the whole amount or there's some restrictions on that?For Binance you need a minimum of 6 confirmations before you can withdraw or trade with your deposited coin so the only limiting factor is if the 20 bucks is up to the minimum required for withdrawal, I haven't used Binance since a long time so I don't know their minimum withdrawal at the moment. Edit:I just checked my Binance account and the minimum withdrawal amount is 0.0012BTC (plus transaction fee) which is ~$30 which means you can't withdraw your $20 BTC at this moment but you can try to convert it to an altcoin with a smaller withdrawal limit and them withdraw to your wallet.",

Since you are stopping crypto now then sell it to usdt or fiat, as far as I know the limit is only little on usdt withdrawal. You dont need to add more funds mate cause $20 could be withdraw even so thats huge already.",

If you verify the account, you can transfer it to any low fees altcoin, withdraw it, and then try to sell it here or anywhere else for cash.But if you do not verify the identity, then yes, adding $ 20 will enable you to withdraw, but most of your money will be lost on withdrawal fees.",

But you can withdraw other crypto if you just exchange your BTC for another crypto. For example USDT, Binance minimum withdraws 10 USDT at this moment. So you can easily withdraw your $20 in USDT without a deposit again.",

I would like to add that converting bitcoin to usdt is free on Binance because all bitcoin trading is free on the platform. This means that you will not lose anything out of the $20 you have.You can easily sell that amount to anyone from your local area (you can find them in social media groups for bitcoin exchanges but make sure to deal with a trusted buyer) and he will hand you $20 directly, since the amount is small and transferring it in any way will require the intervention of a third party who will charge a commission that may spend a quarter of the amount as fees. The transfer from Binance will not cost you more than 1 dollar, and if the person who will buy from you has a verified account on Binance, you will be able to send your twenty dollars or any amount (it does not matter if it is Bitcoin or any other currency) for free. Don't forget to make sure that your account on Binance is verified.",
