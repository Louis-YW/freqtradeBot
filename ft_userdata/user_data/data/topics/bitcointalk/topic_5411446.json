All while it has no actual uses and users, its code is not properly reviewed and developers are just chasing hype with their new features. That's how we end up with coins like Terra Luna that inevitably collapse and defraud investors. Bitcoin does not need smart contracts and tokens because the world does not need them.",

      "body": "The thing is, 20% of innovations on altcoins are related to doomed enterprises such as:- Proof of Stake (aka. sell the network to the largest whale)- DeFi, which is just lending without a govt. bailout net (!!!)- NFTs (abused to make money and many are on the brink of being auctioned off at fire-sale prices)- Smart contracts (always getting hacked especially by NK, because nobody can cover all edge cases properly)... some slightly more sensible things like:- Increased blocksize (== centralization, more illegal content on blockchains)- Ring signatures (makes transactions 100% anonymous BUT at the price of being cross-haired by all governments around the world)- Tail emmission (very difficult to get right, has net result of either introducing inflation in the coins or drastically underscaling the network's security)- Stablecoins on layer 2 (central entity managing the coins = corruption)and that is ignoring consensus-disrupting features like difficulty bombs, forced hardforks, and \"development funds\" and \"founders rewards\" taken away from miners to enrich devs.70% more of the innovations are just weak copycats of the 20%, so the altcoin teams who implemented this stuff have security headaches way more frequently than Bitcoin although they do get patched eventually. But the vast majority of shitcoins never get a patch... they are literally unsafe to use for day-to-day commerce.The rest of the 10% is innovations which have proven themselves to be sustainable, like merged mining (it even has a BIP or two), lightning network, and MimbleWimble (sorry, I don't see regulators like Australia going after Litecoin) for example.The last section is the only stuff that's even going to be considered going into BTC. I know that because I've wrote BIPs, proposed some, commented on others so I'm well aware that it's difficult to arrive at a majority consensus about all the parts related to an issue.I'm not concerned about the market: The market mostly consists of people who want to get rich quick. You'd think they'd go sign up for Andrew Tate's Hustler University scam instead of bothering us here, but they actually directly them to exchanges to long&short (especially short) crypto so yeah. When the bear season comes in, the current crop of long&short traders get torched by the price body slams, and get replaced by even more but equally dumb long&short traders.The number of newbie traders (the primary userbase of crypto), is only going to increase assuming there is no government regulation related to that. That's one thing we know. What we can't estimate is what the proportion of Bitcoin users in proportion to transient long&short traders is going to be after 20-30 years, let alone at 2147.It was never about being the most innovative, it's about being the most secure and stable form of money ever. We've got people attacking us left and right, saying \"bitcoin's a bubble\", \"bitcoin mining pollutes the environment\", \"bitcoin enables crime and terrorism\" and so on, so forth. All because we collectively chose to liberate the financial system from aggressively-lending banks who have more solvency crises than earnings calls (which people seem to be OK with until they lose their life savings!). This is territory which altcoins haven't even mapped yet - the market caps say it all.Most of these so-called \"crypto\"-currencies are actually centralized or have a strong capability of being influenced by a central entity (e.g. a government or a very rich person or corporation). So they are not truly decentralized. Most do not have significant, real transaction activity in the first place.Bitcoin's the only cryptocurrency that can be advertised truthfully as decentralized, vulnerability-free, and having real-world levels of transacion activity. People criticize it as \"ancient\" because it only does on average 7 transactions per second, but they're not even giving us a chance to figure out a totally-decentralized solution to that [Lightning network is still experimental alpha]; they are being impatient and are expecting Rome to be built in one day.I repeat: Bitcoin dominance is at 40% because the other 60% are just looking to make a quick buck. Bitcoin was never meant for those kind of people, it's meant for real users who want to buy and sell stuff with it.Quote from: eddie13 on August 27, 2022, 04:59:05 PMLook at the top altcoins..

Bitcoin is no longer an experimental sandbox where you can just introduce any feature without testing it first. It is a mission-critical program now, so if even the slightest error is introduced, it has the potential wreak unimagineable havoc on people's life savings...This testing requires almost-scientific observation of the feature's behavior in real-world conditions. Altcoins volunteered to be test beds so we are watching how its behaving.Let's take smart contracts for example (NFTs and tokens are just specific types of smart contracts so the same reasoning that will follow also applies to these technologies).This is a technology that replaces the script interpreter with a programming language. It also means that its just as possible to accidentially introduce bugs in the smart contracts which can't be recitified without possible fund loss.History way before bitcoin has shown us that programmers can be quite sloppy, even on mission-critical systems, and Solidity and other smart contract langs are no exception. People will still make bugs by accident because its human nature.Even worse, because of the very nature of the applications that use it, all bugs are now upgraded to security vulnerability status because even the smallest bug can allow for theft. Take nation states like North Korea for example, who think that anything inside a smart contract is their personal treasury.Years ago, people observed exactly this on Ethereum, and then thought: Is it really worth the risk to implement it just for market share? Accordingly, the answer they arrived to was: No.Observing new features getting trialed in altcoins is a common way for people do discern how well this would work out for Bitcoin. In a majority of these trails, the results are very poor and indicate failure, because no design is fool-proof, not even the ones in Bitcoin.Like I said, it's not foolproof, but this scientific method allows us to immediately throw out the ideas that will never work on Bitcoin.I should remind you, that Bitcoin has reached the $20K - $60K range not because of innovation, but increased faith in the existing tech.",

Bitcoin has a very clear and defined real world use - as a currency - with millions of people using it for this exact reason. What's the point of 99% NFTs other than to make profits for their creators? What's the point of 99% of tokens other than to make profits for their creators? I don't want them anywhere near bitcoin.Leaving out stablecoins, then the token with the largest marketcap is Shiba Inu. Knowing absolutely nothing about this token, I decided to read the text about it on Coinmarketcap:Quote from: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/Once upon a time, there was a very special dog. That dog was a Shiba Inu, and this dog inspired millions of people around the world to invest money into tokens with the dog's image on it.Yeah, I don't want my global peer to peer currency, which is securing and transferring billions of dollars worth of value every day for people around the world, encumbered with this sort of trash, thanks.Quote from: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/Shiba's success sparked an avalanche of copycats, such as BitShiba, Shiba Fantom, Shibalana, King Shiba, SHIBAVAX, Captain Shibarrow, SHIBA2K22, SpookyShiba and countless others. In total, there may be well over 100 Shiba Inu copies, and the number keeps rising constantly.Over 100 clones of a completely pointless memecoin. I'm more than happy for Ethereum to bog down their whole project by catering to this sort of nonsense.Tell me what problem Shiba Inu is addressing? What question can be asked in which Shiba Inu is a solution (other than how do we part fools from their money)?Next up is wrapped bitcoin, which would obviously be pointless on the bitcoin network.Next up is UNUS SED LEO. The only reason it exists is to bail out Bitfinex after they lost a whole bunch of users' funds.If you can present a token which actually solves a real world issue, and isn't either some part of a get rich quick scam or otherwise built simply to make the creators profit, then it could be a potential addition to bitcoin.

What question can be asked in which Shiba Inu is a solution (other than how do we part fools from their money)?In general, all derivatives of Dogecoin as well as anything that runs on their chain is useless for all practical purposes. It's full of greedy vultures who want to make a profit of $10 or $100* shorting their preferred DOGE shitcoin.*I call them foolish greedy people aka. cheapstakes, instead of intelligent greedy people.",

What I do see value in more than being as simp for BTC just because BTC is that itger avenues could take crypto into other interesting and worthwile avenues. Could those avenues be explored with BTC? Maybe if the tech is up to the task, but that dosen't mean it needs to nor does it mean that we are creating comoetition with other coins, just that ideas that might get overlooked or dissregarded can find a home somewhere else. Your assumption that people who do work in BTC dev are all knowing and without fault, and you sir would be wrong.",

It is absolutely functional..The point is that most run to some other shitcoin to do these things instead of using Bitcoin..Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on August 28, 2022, 11:46:31 AMQuote from: eddie13 on August 27, 2022, 09:38:59 PMThe vast majority of NFTs, tolken issuances, and smart contracts are being done on altcoinsBecause the vast majority of these things have no real world use. Bitcoin has a very clear and defined real world use - as a currency - with millions of people using it for this exact reason. What's the point of 99% NFTs other than to make profits for their creators? What's the point of 99% of tokens other than to make profits for their creators?

I would be curious to hear if other people are regularly using other such projects?You don’t want all this thriving economy to be flowing on Bitcoin rather than its competitors?You don’t want Bitcoin miners making all this profit off of TX fees rather than the competitors?You’d rather all this volume be on Bitcoin competitors because you simply dislike them?Like it or not, OpenSea has done over $30 billion in volume.. On the competitors blockchains..You know what they are even doing? They are even taking MY stuff, that I created on Bitcoin, wrapping it into Etherium, and selling it to be traded on the Etherium blockchain!I have even caught these f***s claiming to be the creators of MY stuff after having wrapped it onto ETH, and even some straight up plagiarizing MY stuff..OpenSea lists things on 3 shitcoin blockchains, but won’t list things on the Bitcoin blockchain.. “I would be curious to hear if other people are regularly using other such projects?”I use the crap out of Counterparty on Bitcoin.. It’s worth less than 1/3 of the Bitcoin that had to be burned to create it now, and is only listed on one obscure exchange..Everyone on this forum: “We don’t want that on Bitcoin! Ick! Let the shitcoins have all that economy..”Ok guys..Well I like to use Bitcoin because I think USING Bitcoin is good.. I think pretty much ANY use of Bitcoin is good, and would rather give my business to Bitcoin than those centralized shitcoins (as loyse correctly points out)..But just because they are centralized doesn’t mean they aren’t competitors, taking economy away from Bitcoin..Exactly what TPTB want..Most “crypto” users don’t know or care much about the principles of decentralization, and are happy to just use some centralized competitor..“Let them” I guess eh? Don’t compete?“Those Japanese cars will never be able to compete with the American big 3” they said..“They aren’t really competitors because they aren’t exactly the same”…",
