But I’m not expecting that Akaho can give hell to Casimero base on there previous matches performance. Casimero is still the best on this division due to his experience and overall strength. Reach is not that a huge advantage since this is just a division for speedy boxers and not a heavy type.",

      "body": "So Casimero is already weight up to super bantamweight since there's no way for him to fight at bantamweight, Akaho seems to be an easy opponent for Casimero. He should win this fight, maybe he will trying to fight with the top 10 boxers and then challenging the champion to get a belt. Akaho has many fought, but the boxer he fought is mostly an amateur with bad record, that's why he have a good record.",

Record shows, Akaho also keeps knocking opponents so this seem a fair fight for a guy determined to bring the monster dead. But the monster is no touch for this man yet. John Casimero was shouting to give him a shot against Inoue for a long time I'm seeing this is a leg up for him to achieve it once he defeat Akaho. One more year I think can't be that bad than waiting for more years to finally given a chance to face Inoue.",

Besides being over-cocky, he also has a disability which is overconfidence and this may be his Achilles' heel. That is why I totally believe he will not win the fight. My bet goes to Akaho who is overzealous should use this to his advantage and end up winning the fight",

For sure many of us here have missed him against Butler and that he should have the opportunity to face Inoue. Anyhow, his team learn their mistakes so it's somewhat John Riel is on a comeback trail. And with that, Casimero will be looking for a sensational win against Akaho in December. I'm expecting no less than a war and Casimero winning by knock out.",

Casimero also need to focus so we can see him fighting again. Is this match already settled? Can’t wait to see him back again after a few months of being inactive. I’m not familiar with Akaho but I’m sure he’s a good boxer as well because he is being matched with Casimero.",

Casimero should reclaim himself and get a belt for him, still have time to prepare for this, this can be a great match to end the year.",

This fight shouldn't be a problem for Casimero even though he is inactive for 16 months.I hope though that this time, Casimero's camp should now be able to avoid those recent problems why he was being stripped out of his WBO title.",
