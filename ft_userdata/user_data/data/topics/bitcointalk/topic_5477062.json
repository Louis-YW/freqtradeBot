But depending on what that is official.Before I know this forum, I saw it abbreviated as BTT on another forum that I was. People that I know are calling it BTT until yesterday that some people said it can be called BCT.I will choose BTT as bitcoin is called BTC.",

      "body": "Earlier before now, all I knew about the forum and its abbreviations was btt. I have even seen where someone abbreviates it to BTTF (bitcoin talk forum), which sounds okay to me, calling it BCT right now. To some, they will really understand it, but to many, that will be a total new word in their ear. Even if they have come across the word, they will give a total different meaning to it, and out of many, only a few will think about it as a bitcontalk forum. Me, I also stand with the BTT, as that is what I have known the forum with for a very long time till now. Referring to bitcoin as BC, many people will also see it as a new coin and not related to bitcoin as we all know it as BTC. Any new word might make it appear to be a new coin all together.",

      "body": "A more suitable abbreviation should have been BCT, however,  BTT have gained so much popularity that changing it now will really be very difficult. Subconsciously,  everyone seem to have accepted the BTT as abbreviations and even those not part of this forum too. I have read several Bitcoin and cryptocurrency related articles in LinkedIn,  Quora, and even Reddit where this forum is usually abbreviated as BTT by the authors as a way of indicating ownership of those works. These articles are widely read by people across the globe. This shows how  far the BTT abbreviation has gone. Finally, considering the proliferation of cryptocurrencies,  I'm confident that BCT would have already been associated with various coins and tokens... a simple search in coinmarketcap will readily confirm this. In conclusion, even though it makes a lot of sense using BCT for this forum abbreviation,  changing it from BTT will be difficult and rarely effective.",

I'm used to referring to this place as BTT and I think rightly so. BCT doesn't sound representative enough IMHO. Let's dissect it a bit more. BTT could stand in as BiTcoinTalk but what can BCT stand in as BitCoinTalk? Well, I think we've to remember that Bitcoin itself has always taken a \"T\" immediately after a \"B\" as in BTC. So, I think it will be really awkward to address a forum named after it as BCT, rather than maintain that sequence it's known for. If anything at all, BTCT – BitcoinTalk better suits than BCT but that will be long and boring to pronounce. Who cares, then? I'm stuck with BTT.",

When looking down into what he explained there is a sense to change the usual BTT to BCT but we are too common with the previous abbreviation of BTT and this could be very hard to change though at some point people would get it confused but as time goes they will get used to it.So far I votes for BCT.",

BTCT looks very suitable. It's appropriate since Bitcoin (BTC), I remember I saw some old users on reddit using the term BTCtalk which is very particular when they were talking about this forum. But whichever as long as this is the one they are talking about it's the same thing. Its less confusing if they just spell it all out.",

But it did not look good and was even a little time-consuming to write than BTT. I also saw many other forums and news articles that prefer to write BTT. I am not so sure about news articles but I think they also used BTT or maybe I am imagining, I have to confirm that part so don't take it for granted maybe some other users might confirm it. I prefer BTT because we use the first two letters BT as for Bitcoin and that's official, and the last T word for Talk, but if we write BCT and the first two letters BC the C word makes nothing, officially proved. Because BTC means Bitcoin. And BCT did not mean bitcointalk while BTT means bitcointalk.",

On the other hand BCT sounds more as a cryptocurrency pair, for example BTC, ETH, XBT, ADA etc.I wonder who was that person that choosed WO, lol  .",

But since I have always seeing BTT it seem my brain and eyes are kinda getting used to the BTT so I think I will still prefer the BTT as Bitcoin itself is called BTC, BT-bit and C-coin or we can also join the whole combo making it BTCT",

But now that you've asked and giving it a second thought, I think BCT is more appropriate because you can clearly see the letters well represented in the 3 syllables; BIT-COIN-TALK, while BTT does not follow the syllabic representation.",

Although, the forum domain is three syllabic words (Bit-coin-talk) the correct abbreviation should have been BTCT (BiT-Coin-Talk) . IMO, the correct abbreviation is supposed to be BTCT, but how well does it sound if pronounced? I think it doesn't sound so well for me, probably because I am used to calling it BTT right from the first day I knew about the forum and also based on how frequently I have seen it abbreviated here.We cannot also say that the correct abbreviation for Bitcoin is BT; therefore, it is still wrong to abbreviate bitcointalk as BTT.Although from your POLL, I will choose BTT, it's mostly used.  Quote from: PowerGlove on December 08, 2023, 05:51:13 PMLooks funny to me, like: wHy I nO GeT MeRiT on BiTcoinTalk?  ,  what's this man saying?",
