  "content": "hey hi guys! i logged into my electrum acc and saw that all my funds was sent to another address, it's like someone logged into my acc and paid all my funds to someone by one payment. is it hacked? i didnt even login at the time that transaction happened. if it's hacked couldit be because of using a free vpn? and is it safe if i make a new wallet with another information on electrum?also i scanned for malwares there were none.thanks in advance",

Which means you're opening a wallet file, not an account.Quote from: aiaihey on May 28, 2022, 02:50:52 PMit's like someone logged into my acc and paid all my funds to someone by one payment. This sounds like a malware-like case. What's your OS? Did you verify the signature, as said above?",

Nope. Unrelated, there isn't any vulnerability from that version on.I provided the two scenarios and the only thing you can do now is to just re-install your operating system and ensure that you thoroughly validate[1] your file before installing it.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5240594.0",

This will automatically open Kleopatra and it's the only logical explanation I can think of because Electrum doesn't need Kleopatra to run.After formatting your device's hard drive and reinstalling the OS and Electrum, make sure to create a completely new wallet by generating a new seed. Do not reuse your old wallet by recovering it from seed.",

As proposed by others already your computer might have been infected by malware. My question above is not an uncommon attack vector to compromise a wallet or get it compromised rather as a result of a wallet owner being somewhat reckless (your mnemonic seed words should not be saved in a way where they can be easily stolen; digital pictures/files can be stolen e.g. by malware without noticing it, accidently shared, ...).You should try to figure out what went wrong to prevent that in the future.",

You do not yet know for sure how your wallet was compromised. It could have been your Electrum version, it could be malware on your computer, it could be how you stored your seed phrase, it could be something else entirely. If you cannot work out how your wallet was compromised, then at a minimum you'll need to format your computer and reinstall your OS from scratch to be sure you do not still have malware on your device.Quote from: aiaihey on May 28, 2022, 03:41:54 PMalso when i use older electrum version it open without needing kleopatra to be open, but 4.4.2 version needs that other app so it will work, it's confusing/Why do you have two versions of Electrum installed?Unless you have made a typo, then version 4.4.2 is malicious. The latest real version is 4.2.2.Electrum does not need any other apps open to run. If your Electrum is opening other things in the background, then chances are it is malicious.",
