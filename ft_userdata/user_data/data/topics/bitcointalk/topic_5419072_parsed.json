Now that they see how bad the vaxx really is, they are rising up against their own military to get the vaxxing stopped.Military servicemen call for an end to the Pentagon’s vaccine mandateQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-10-31-military-servicemen-call-end-to-vaccine-mandate.html#A group of military servicemen has called for an end to the Pentagon’s Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate. It expressed concern about the COVID-19 shot’s harms through a 100-page report addressed to Congress.The report featured statements from pilots and other military service members injured by the vaccine, including multiple anecdotes. It also included an aviation safety officer’s discovery of vaccine injuries that were not reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).“This is just a small sample of many vaccine-injured service members who have decided to come forward and share their heartbreaking stories,” the report stated.An officer who went by the pseudonym Lt. Col. William P. Anton, who has served more than 20 years in the military, spearheaded the report to Congress. However, he was “shocked and frustrated to have only received lukewarm responses from a couple of senators and their staffers.”“Injuries to my fellow service members are happening right before our eyes and we know the solution [stopping the mandate], but no one is doing anything about it,” he said.Anton also expressed disappointment over the senior military and civilian leadership.“They are each in their own way aware of the ill health effects on our service members or the negative impact on our military’s readiness, and yet they remain silent,” he stated. “They justify their silence as obedience to military orders because that is easier than to acknowledge their own lack of moral courage.”Brighteon.TVAnton believes that the senior management would not want to risk their next promotion so they have not “heard” their call to halt the vaccine mandate.“In the military, people are willing to die for their country and the men and women standing right next to them,” but he is concerned that the management “are not willing to lay down their careers to speak out on what is going on.” (Related: Cover up: DOD silent after whistleblowers expose COVID ‘vaccine’ injuries in military.)COVID-19 shots injure pilots, rendering them unable to fly...",
