You can't, yet. You have to become a full Member first.2. You can change your signature by going to Profile -> Forum Profile information but you can't make it clickable or use colors because you're a newbie. 3. You need to become at least a junior member.Check this topic[1] to know more about the ranks and the restrictions that come with them[1].If you want to lift some of these restrictions without waiting, you can buy a copper membership[2][1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178608.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385104.msg24371150#msg24371150",

To get the points? Yes, copper membership would raise the restriction on posting images and give your profile the privileges of a member ranked account.No, you do not have to make 30 posts or get the required activity. It's a quicker way than ranking up directly.Quote from: Team_MegaPari on October 06, 2022, 10:43:46 AMSo my next steps are a membership and a proper engagement into discussions?If you've decided to purchase copper membership, then yes, those are the next steps.Read the forum rules and engage constructively.",

So my next steps are a membership and a proper engagement into discussions?While copper membership can give you few perks that are not available for newbie rank, there's no real need to buy one as you can engage in discussions and write posts normally with a regular newbie account. For me personally, it only makes sense to get one if you plan to advertise your business here, or if you plan to offer some services.",
