People are more likely to comply with requests when they see an account with the blue tick because they assume it is real. We should discourage people from purchasing this badge, and we should use greater caution when interacting with accounts that have many followers and the blue badge. Scammers take use of every channel available, and this Twitter scam seems more ideal because they can quickly win people over by spending a little money.",

After some of the popular airdrops that give free luck to thousands of people, airdrops like that of Uniswap and Arbitrary that just happened recently, newbies have been wanting to explore any opportunities that they see about trending projects and airdrops. It's only a few people that usually do some kind of research about a particular project to determine if they are truly doing airdrops or not, or if the link they get from some sort of random social media user is legit or not. They are always in a hurry to participate in order for the slot to not be filled before their entry. If people can learn how to DYOR, the rate of people falling into scam traps will reduce, and the scammers might as well reduce the resources they spend on tools as it will turn out not to be profitable to them.",

This phishing domain, which is seven days old, also has been down, and this is the result of reports and complaints submitted by positive people to protect as many newbies as possible who still do not know the difference between a phishing domain and a legitimate one. Indeed, there was an airdrop for the SEI project. Of course, scammers took the opportunity to disinform SEI communities, mislead and deceive them, especially Twitter, through accounts impersonating the SEI name, and by DMing people who ask for help on how to claim airdrop coins, they send them malicious links and phishing domains, They also publish tweets continuously and mention many Twitter user accounts to trap them. Unfortunately, Twitter is now free of censorship and is full of bots, spam, and chaos.",

Good thing that account was already flagged down but we don't know if another account will emerge and will try to verify itself and will make another looking legitimate airdrop from SEI or any other project that has taken the spotlight lately because of how successful their launching was. Having these criteria for having a blue checkmark makes it easier for these scammers to stay on this platform, X/Twitter.Â  Quote from: https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accountsEligibility criteria for the blue checkmarkOnly accounts actively subscribed to X Premium are eligible to receive the blue checkmark.Our team uses an eligibility criteria on when the checkmark is given to ensure we maintain the integrity of the platform. Your account must meet the following criteria to receive or retain the blue checkmark: Complete: Your account must have a display name and profile photoActive use: Your account must be active in the past 30 days to subscribe to X PremiumSecurity: Your account must have a confirmed phone numberNon-Deceptive:Your account must have no recent changes to your profile photo, display name, or username (@handle)Your account must have no signs of being misleading or deceptiveYour account must have no signs of engaging in platform manipulation and spamAs we look at the bottom part of non-deceptive. I wonder if they really are filtering all of these subscribed to their premium/blue checkmark. Because it looks easy for them to get verified and this is giving the idea for other scammers that they can do that and imitate and fool people with the use of other known projects.",

Could you provide more context or details about the situation?I think this ussr seems to be talking about the rewards which is given to early users. They are wondering why the rewards were so small and are comparing it to recent Airdrops like Sui, ARB and Aptos where a significant number of wallets received Airdrops (100k to 1 million wallets) after thorough verification. But SEI project gave Airdrops to around 7 million wallets and each wallet received $2 to $20+ worth of tokens. This is clearly mentioned in their articlehttps://blog.sei.io/atlantic_rewards/They acknowledge that these airdrops attract bots and suggest that if the project had given airdrop to verified wallets then everyone get good profit",
