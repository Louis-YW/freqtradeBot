      "body": "@OP, I have never seen nor heard your website but this is what makes me remember a lot of things from this thread: Don't get tricked by hidden spam on this forumQuote from: hatshepsut93 on October 07, 2019, 06:07:12 PMWe all know to not click on any suspicious links, and on this forum spam usually gets deleted pretty quickly. However, there's a special kind of spam links that often stays for longer periods of time. It usually looks like the following:Code:Has anyone tried this service?*link to the service or just name of the service*By making it look like the original poster isn't promoting the service but merely asking people's opinions about it, such thread generates much more clicks and genuine replies than the usual spam link that gets deleted after a few minutes. The sites that are spammed in this way are usually the same scams, ponzi's, phishing and malware sites.Here's some tips for distinguishing genuine questions from hidden spam:1. OP is a brand new account.    If OP is a fresh account, they probably were registered with sole purpose of starting this thread.2. The thread is created in incorrect section.    If you see such threads in board other than Service Discussions, it should raise a huge red flag.3. The OP is very short.    Legitimate topics about services usually start with some small personal review or short description of a service. Spam threads usually start with just a single question like \"Have you heard about X?\".A lot of signs that you've there OP just as what it's been told. And it's good to bring this up in here so that everyone will have to remember all of these signs.",

I'm not an expert in checking whether a site is scam or not and that's why I thank you for describing in sufficient detail the reasons why the site might be a scam and luckily I haven't made a deposit to the site.",

Bitcoin addresses and wallets don't need to be authenticated, unlocked, approved, or anything similar. The whole idea is to have you deposit the coins to that address and then they are done with you.

Feels like when you want to scam people on crypto world, you need to be a lot better in the fake stuff because as we can see here from skylarx and end up with something that would be found out and you would be ousted quite good. In the end, we are not going to end up with anything that would be usable with this website at all, it is a bad one. I am 100% willing to wager that OP asked about it because they wanted SEO and promotion for the website, and instead of getting good attention, it got bad attention and now a little bit worse compared to when they started this website.",
