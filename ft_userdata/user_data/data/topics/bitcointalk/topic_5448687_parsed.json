You can choose every pool you want, not the pool is the point, choose the right miner - gminer at the moment for cfx+kas+zil. Gminer also has the option to continue mining while it mine zil - you can adjust the dual hashrate in zil windows too. My kaspa hasrate at the zilliqa mining went up from 400mh to 500mh for this short. so you loose nothing on the 2 algo, other miners loosing 3 - 4% mining time if you add Zil (as often explained - zil mining window is overall longer than 1 minute!!!!!)And why you using ezil for zil? use flexpool or crazypool - a lot higher reward of coins. I know some people fudding flexpool, but the rewards on zmp flexpool for zil is same or higher as crazypool with less mining time. i tested it now for 3 months and checked all every day.you don´t need a etc+zil pool anymore or for long time. miner developers added native zil mining option to there miners. Teamredminer can mine 3 coins on 3 different pools at the same time - same for: SRBminer, Rigelminer, BZminer, Gminer, TRM for sureother good option is ergo+kas/rxd/aleph/iron..... +zilYou cant use Binance or Coinbase for selling your coins? Sorry i don´t know much about the USA law about crypto.",
