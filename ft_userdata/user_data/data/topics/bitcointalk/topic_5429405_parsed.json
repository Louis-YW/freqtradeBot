These falls would lead to more awareness of the need to keep your coins in a safe decentralized wallet. This would make Bitcoin stronger and shield it from the negative influencea of these centralized platforms.The security sector have always been a lucrative one, especially in areas that are experiencing insecurity. Your advice to consider investing in the security or funeral sector is not for me. I am wondering how you got the statistics that the problems of FTX or others would lead to a high rate of insecurity and deaths because in my country I am not sure up to 1% of the population engage in cryptocurrencies, thus I am wondering how it would make the security or funeral sector lucrative.",

I also see that insecurity is becoming a big problem to the world and communities trying to secure themselves as government keep failing to maintain the primary aim of government, the security of life and property. Therefore, the demand for security guards and other aspects of security is in high demand like dogs. We have more increase in the rate that young men are going into the field of security guards and agents to recruit security personnel and export them to needed countries.",

It just costs too much for individuals to take actions against crypto companies that are scammers. The lucrative business exists for reasons with government's involvement or tolerance. I am not defending any of them, just trying to tell the truth. Bodyguards and security services might be in great demand to protect all the money those guys ripped off.",

I am not saying that Binance will never die but what they are doing shows us that they will still be with us and will become even stronger after the death of FTX. If they want to stay in business, they need more credibility, and they are doing it. We should support them rather than vilify them.An exchange crash is not good for the market, so I hope people stop those negative thoughts and build a healthy market together.",

The only thing that might nudge them to increase the size is if their wealth goes up or if they have received particular threats or think they are in danger for some other reason. What a depressing though about funeral services, but I guess nothing changes there either, in bad economic times when people feel a lot more desperate or don't have enough money to survive then tragedy is more likely to strike in different forms. The fact that food and energy costs are high could cause a lot of misery.",
