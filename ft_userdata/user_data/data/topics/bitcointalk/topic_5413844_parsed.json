He knows he cannot provide any evidence he is Satoshi (because he isn't) via any of the methods the community are interested in, such as moving coins or signing a message,* and so he chooses instead to use a system which can be fooled with technobabble and by those with the most money to pay.Quote from: Royse777 on September 17, 2022, 08:09:22 AMAll waste of time.I agree, but now that such cases exist, it is in all our interests to support Hodlonaut (or anyone else fighting CSW) and to start to put an end to CSW's nonsense and threats to others in the community.I'll link again to Greg Maxwell's Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ws8wfd/starting_september_12th_in_oslo_norway_hodlonaut/ikxqxoo/*Of course accepting that a valid signature is necessary but not sufficient in the quest to prove someone is Satoshi.",

So to believe CSW you have to believe he introduced the bug, then fixed it, then re-introduced it, then waited on Hal to make his report, and then fixed it again. Lol.https://nitter.it/bitnorbert/status/1570769461954879490#mhttps://nitter.it/wizsecurity/status/1570773434904485893#mCSW's submitted pre-release .exe file has an identical checksum to the first public release version. The problem here of course is that while the checksum is valid for the first public version, it is invalid for CSW's pre-release version. This shows that his pre-release version was created simply by taking the first public version and changing a few minor things, i.e. a barn door forgery.https://nitter.it/wizsecurity/status/1570773441061748741#mAbsolute lol. He tried to make it look older simply by changing the version number in the readme file.https://nitter.it/bitnorbert/status/1570766382048096260#mhttps://nitter.it/wizsecurity/status/1570942661959491584#mAnd he included a reference to compressed public keys, which weren't used for another 4 years.So he has obviously submitted forgeries, but what I find hilarious is just how bad these forgeries are. Referencing things which didn't exist at the time, doing something as simple as just changing the version number, apparently completely oblivious to the existence of checksums. This is the technical equivalent of using white-out on a date and writing an older date on top and thinking no one will notice. You are telling me the best forgery the inventor of bitcoin can muster up is changing the version number in a .txt file? Lmao.",

They contain zero footage from inside the court room. Perhaps this is deliberate given how terrible CSW comes across in all the clips we we have been getting from Bitcoin Magazine.Looks like so far today there has simply been testimony and questioning of other cybersecurity firms regarding the KPMG reports. Despite these firms being called by CSW's team to cast doubt on the KPMG analysis, it seems both were unable to do so and largely agreed with the KPMG findings, only able to offer small criticisms around the edges and not against any of the main findings - i.e. that most of the documents CSW submitted were fraudulent. Seems like quite the fail on the part of CSW and his team today.Apparently all that is left is closing statements. Would be great to get full videos of these, if anyone from Bitcoin Magazine is reading!",

I bet that idiot wanted a PhD to look smarter but all real sciences were too difficult for him so he went for the one where you can bullshit the most and nobody will be able to say if it's real or not. Then he went to the Internet and tried to push his bullshit there but it's not that easy when you have archives, screenshots and databases.",
