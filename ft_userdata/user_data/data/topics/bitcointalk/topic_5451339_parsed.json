But probably I'm not going to watch Eurovision semifinals this year, as it will happen exactly on the same time as Champions league and Europa league semifinals. But I will turn on final on Saturday.So far I heard just few songs from this year contest. Loreen is big favorite according to bookmakers and there is no doubt that she will win again, same like in 2012. For the first time her song didn't left me big impression, but when I listened it second time, I liked it more.Seems that UK finally took Eurovision seriously, especially when it's held in their country after many years in the bottom. Their song is catchy and it sounds good on radio:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRaVGKk4k6kPoland is worth to mention. They have generic pop song and singer who can't sing live. Compare music video and live version:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRaVGKk4k6khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANM4CwbE0IsThere is so many memes made about it. Bejba, it's kinda krejza .",

She have great song, but it's not even close to song that she had in 2012 and won. And Finland looks like strongest candidate to give them fight. Jury voting is always contraversial part of voting. They also often vote based on relationship in poolitics or simply vote for neighbours.Croatia isn't for everyone's taste, but I see them reaching good place. Such avangarde performances rarely can compete for a win, but Top 5 is possible.",

Last year Ukraine won, of course, mainly due to the very high favor factor of the rest of the world. I think this year will be different. Saturday night is the final. I believe the rules will be very different this year than usual. Not sure what the rules say this year. Last year Ukraine won, but the number 2 came from England and that is why the Eurovision song contest is held in Liverpool. I've seen a report, it's very much alive there in Liverpool and all the people seem to be on it. Still, I don't think it can be compared to a final of the CL or the FA cup in football.",

Nothing complicated, just simple pop song that fits to EurovisionSweden - main favorite, but I wouldn't say that was my favorite songItaly - seems that they simply can't send bad songs to EurovisionUkraine - not bad, but for me their folk style songs fits better to Eurovision than elecetronic ones like thisNorway - is it only for looks that I heard something very similar before?Isreal - they're getting hyped much, but at least for me it's nothing special, though Noa Kirel is really beautiful.Croatia - song that you can love or hate. Personally I liked it a lot, but they're not going to winUK - they have good song this year, but live performance on stage looks weak.Really nice how UK included legendary songs made in Liverpool.
