  "content": "The early stage of bitcoin usage was as fun as childhood. As bitcoin grows, it's expected to face different challenges and difficulties, like in adulthood. Although bitcoin is at its teenage age, most of the hilarious bitcoin expenditure happened in the first 3-4 years of bitcoin's existence. For instance, on the 5th of November 2013, someone paid to store the lyrics of \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" on the bitcoin blockchain forever. The lyrics to the song are on block 468060 with 494267 confirmations. This transaction reminds me of the numerous uses of the bitcoin blockchain aside from trading coins. It's fascinating to utilize not one but all aspects of the blockchain. But, a colossal amount of users have sunned themselves under the profits and loss of trading in the blockchain network. And neglect other features that makes the blockchain unique and decentralize. https://www.blockstream.info/tx/d29c9c0e8e4d2a9790922af73f0b8d51f0bd4bb19940d9cf910ead8fbe85bc9b?expand",

Yet it's mainly known for making people rich or poor. It's known for scammers rug pulling investors, crypto (sextortion) blackmails, drugs, money laundering, ico bubble where it was mainly sold as a solution to problems that doesn't require blockchain in the first place, rich and poor people bragging with collectable jpgs, PoW as a waste of energy that's destroying the planet. All this without understanding how it any of it works, and apparently it's occasionally Rick Rolling people.We need a serious PR upgrade.",

Even up till this very moment, the blockchain is being used by many around the world to store and make transactions, the opportunity and services that offer true blockchain and even the government are taking advantage which is why there has been wider adoption of Bitcoin among people.",

Yeah, how about no!People try to leave their marks on everything, there are hundreds of messages from stupid quotes, to prayers, to links, everything.Satoshi did so with the first block, hundreds tried to copy him for fun.Not everyone who did so was a \"visionary\" some did it out of boredom.https://decrypt.co/55642/the-5-best-secret-messages-hidden-on-the-bitcoin-blockchainQuote from: thirdprize on November 09, 2022, 04:16:24 PMOnce it is on the blockchain there is no way to get rid of it.  https://gizmodo.com/someone-uploaded-child-pornography-to-a-blockchain-ledg-1832398480That's on the BSV chain, once CSW finally goes to jail for all his scams that chain will die just like hundreds of shitcoins have died.The blockchain is not something that magically keeps data alive, it's the same as a torrent, if there are enough seeds the file will be available forever if nobody shares it or in the blockchain case, there is no full node available the chain is dead and nobody can retrieve the data anymore.",

However, I have a question, when they are no full nodes available and later on a full node connects to the network would they be a means of retrieving transactions that happened during downtime? what do you think will happen to the already stored transactions?",

Again, neither the blockchain nor nodes are something that exists like air everywhere without human assistance, they are databases, and nodes are the copies of that database hosted by someone, if those persons decide it's not worth hosting the nodes anymore as the said shitcoin (BSV in this case) is worthless then there will be no reachable copy of the blockchain anywhere and nobody can run it anymore.Go to the end of the altcoin announcement board herehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0;sort=last_postAnd check, are all those dead shitcoins's blockchains still reachable?Quote from: Accardo on November 10, 2022, 05:54:37 PMHowever, I have a question, when they are no full nodes available and later on a full node connects to the network would they be a means of retrieving transactions that happened during downtime?If there are no full nodes there is no mempool, and there is no network at all, so if one full node comes back online from its slumber it will have no idea what happened while it was offline, it will have no idea even about the blocks that were mined after it shut down.",
