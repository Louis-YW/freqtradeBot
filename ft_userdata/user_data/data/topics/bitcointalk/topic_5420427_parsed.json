Exchanges do indeed make life easier with their services of buying/selling/trading, but for storing they're probably the worst option you could ever take. Hardly doubt the exchange would help you as well since if they go under, they're probably going to take you with them as well.On another hand, people would still be perfectly able to trade crypto with or without exchanges. They make life easy, but in no way are they a necessity. Cases like what happened to FTX only push the idea that exchanges will fuck up sooner or later.",

Exchanges are actually more free to take your funds, because to get them back you've to do complicated things at a cost that isn't worth it.QuoteIf exchangers lose then they need to have insurance If no insurance then get out of the business.FTX doesn't behave transparently about insurance, that's why the service is on the verge of collapse and leaves almost all of their users worried.",

Even just in a business sense — it doesn't make sense for an insurance company to want to cover all crypto holdings of an exchange. It's pretty much suicide for the insurance company.",

Those who leave their funds on exchanges are accepting an even higher risk.Note that this doesn't change the fact that exchanges are still responsible but it means that you can't really do anything about it since they never gave you any legally binding promise about the security of your funds!!!",

Incidents like this happen repeatedly on some of the major exchanges and the returns are even very long and some just disappear.I don't know whether to believe it or not, but assets on the exchange run the risk of being lost because the user doesn't have full control. Exchange is not entirely the cause of the death of crypto, there will be many other factors that can revive crypto more than now.Quoted from reuters.com, according to several people who know the FTX problem, the company's slump was caused by its own founder Sam Bankman-Fried, reportedly the last few months have been busy saving other crypto companies. and in the end the company itself went bankrupt and didn't even get help from anyone after Binance canceled to acquire FTX.https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-behind-ftxs-fall-battling-billionaires-failed-bid-save-crypto-2022-11-10/",
