The metaverse hype will come back again once bitcoin will able to go to the around 35k - 40k range. I meant we will see that happen anyone would be interested to join in the metaverse.

I think that it's too late to buy it but if you are using it for long term and sandbox was good token for that purpose.",

Do you believe that metaverse hype is still very well alive? If you believe that these metaverses around are really around in the future then yeah. From all this sort of gamified metaverses around i root for sandbox. It's well done and imho way more appealing then decentraland. It's really hard to predict if these platforms stick as i think they are pretty much duct tape solutions for fast as possible metaverse adoption. I think that there will be better tech ahead and these get left far behind like some bulky and weird tv and radio combinations in the past.Just be aware that a whale might Be dumping it soon",

I know not all coins that are cheap is a must to avail since many of them are just scams but I think this SAND coin is different from them. I know this was one of the early Metaverse/NFT projects that have been created.It was one of the top NFT/Metaverse projects during their peak but I think even until now, if we check on the rankings of that category. Once the bull market returns, legit projects like this can surely recover. Whales dumping the coin can be normal and they are only doing it for manipulating purposes but there is no need to panic as long as the main project itself isn't experiencing a major issue.",

I am quite certain there is more chance of this to be dumped after that date. However, traders can join the pump before the vesting unlock and dump hours before this hehehe. There will certainly be good announcements that will be published to hype this project, pump the token and make it ready for an exit dump.This is one of these types announcements. They will be vague without real details shared. If you are a trader, it might be profitable to have an unlock calendar on projects and trade the unlock exit pumps hehehehee.Metaverse gaming platform The Sandbox and Saudi Arabia have come to an understanding of some sort. Details were not provided.Sandbox co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget took to LinkedIn to announce the news. “It was a true honor to sign our [memorandum of understanding] partnership … between The Sandbox and the Saudi Arabia Digital Government Authority,” he wrote. “We look forward to exploring, advising and supporting mutually each other in activations of the Metaverse!”Source https://www.theblock.co/post/209458/saudi-arabia-the-sandbox-agree-to-collaborate-on-metaverse-projects",

Lots of things had been dragged down on the time that bitcoins price plummets or dumps or simply we are on a bear state which is really that very common for whatever hypes earlier would really be greatly affectedwhether it would be Defi/metaverse or something that is currently in hype. When it comes to choosing on coins or projects then it would really be that varying on each person because not all would really be that confident on choosing some potential projects.You wont gain up something if you wont really take up some risks which is really the primary rule on investment world.Its up to yourself on which one you would be choosing and since its your money then it would be your right on which one you would be choosing.",

Companies has started to make their own metaverse and some projects has already have one and they are making the public experience it, same with the experience you have on sandbox. Sandbox got a huge support from the community and it will depend on their future releases if the project they are doing is what the community is expecting since there are projects that launched their metaverse that turned into disappointment.

There is very much of a chance that this news about Saudi Arabia is nothing but to hype Sandbox and cause a pump on Sand tokens before the vesting unlock on February 14. It might only be an exit pump for those new tokens taken into circulation to dump. The other projects with token unlocks might also start doing something similar to this hehehe.",

Unlike other types of coins I believe that metaverse coins are going to be part of this market for a very long time, what you need to ask yourself is if you think sandbox is going to be around at least until 2024 or 2025 when the bull market will begin to materialize, if this is the case then it could be a good idea to invest some money in it, but if this period of time is too long and you think another metaverse project could captivate the community then maybe this is the time to wait and see how things move.",
