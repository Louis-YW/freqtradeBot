I don't know if PSL lines will only open on Feb. 13.If you are following cricket, then you may know about this league too. We have IPL (Indian Premier league), BBL (Big Bash League) , PSL (Pakistan Super league) and few more which are played every year and players from all around the world take part in this entertaining T20 tournament. PSL is one of the famous league although no league is better than IPL.As far as your question for betting on PSL is concerned, you may keep track at https://stake.com/sports/upcoming/cricket, the odds will surely open before the tournament first match that is to be played on 13th February.",

They are moving the league to February-March window, which will avoid clashes with other leagues such as the BBL, BPL, ILT20 and the SA20.

The last edition witnessed massive upsurge in terms of viewership (PSL 7 or the 2022 edition). It was estimated that 73% of the Pakistanis with a TV set at home watched the PSL last year (144 million people).  According to Rameez Raja, for PSL7 the profits were 71% higher compared to the previous edition, and each of the franchises earned around PKR 900 million as average revues.

Pakistan has population of 220 million who are crazy for cricket. So it was very much expected that PSL will be a super hit in there own country. There is no major change in PSL 8 as we have still 6 teams playing. It will be too early to say how much profit PSL 8 will generate but my rough guess is it will earn atleast what they earned last year. In India, Sony Pictures (SPNI) has got media and OTT rights for PSL broadcast till 2023.",

Because there are so many regulations and content sharing requisites. I assume that a large share of the revenue comes from countries such as the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom, as they have very large Pakistani diaspora communities. But the momentum that was gained from last edition (PSL 2022) should be maintained. I am concerned because of two factors - 1. economic situation in Pakistan is not good 2. security situation has worsened over the last few months.",
