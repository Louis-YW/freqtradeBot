  "content": "Greetings to all bitcoin fans!I have something interesting for you today!We have been working on Bitcoin Asics based heating systems for a while now and now I think we have something to share with you!The first thing I would like to mention is that we are staunch supporters of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies! Many call cryptocurrencies on POW unecological, destructive to the economy, for this reason many states ban mining, and cryptocurrencies in general. But we can't give up on POW, if only because bitcoin is based on POW! After connecting asics for mining instead of heating devices that use electricity, in this case no one can say that Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly. In terms of economic benefits, this direction also promises great prospects, because if we install bitcoin heating systems on objects that consume electricity for heating, we can conditionally assume that the cost of electricity for mining is zero, that is free. Our mission is to popularize the use of asics in heating systems and make it technically possible. What we realized is that at the moment there are very few offers on the market that allow you to use asics for heating and heating systems in most of the available objects. Yes, there are many offers on Chinese marketplaces for conversion to liquid cooling, as well as hydro asics from the well-known Antminer, Whatsminer, but it is not suitable for heating in widespread use. Many technical problems arise during the actual connection, they are mainly related to the hydraulic part, it due to small internal dimensions can quickly clog, collapse under the influence of pressure or electrolysis, may not pass enough liquid that leads to overheating. All this requires the addition of intermediate devices - heat exchangers, special heat transfer fluids, pumps, and other equipment, and all this becomes too complex and expensive to become a reality.  Therefore, we have developed and established the production of special heat exchangers for asics, which we call water blocks. Thanks to bimetallic construction and special technology of water blocks production we have achieved the following results:- now we can connect the asic to any hydraulic system directly, we do not care what coolant is used, the stainless tube is not subject to corrosion and electrolysis processes. - We also have a huge internal size for the flow of the coolant, which also corresponds to the standard of half inch, and can be connected to any pipeline- we have a fully monolithic, one-piece water block that can withstand any pressure possible in heating systems, we don't have to worry about the hash board being damaged.- We can connect the asics directly to swimming pools, we don't have to worry about the water block breaking down from corrosion and electrolysis, as it happens with water blocks that are made of 100% aluminum.- our units can be made 95% using recycled materials, which can bring additional savings and tax advantages in some cases. - we can say with certainty about high reliability of the hydraulic part, expected service life is more than 50 years, stainless steel is not subject to corrosion and chemical attack.Example of water block for Watsminer M 30 C modelhttps://i.postimg.cc/QNp3QZhk/M50S.jpg Thanks to special water blocks, as well as properly selected software, and other solutions, we can confidently say that it is now possible to implement asics on most objects that need heating, and we can maintain the temperature of the coolant from 30 to 70 degrees. But the most preferred temperatures are 30-50 degrees. In our opinion this brings the general acceptance of bitcoin closer to the general acceptance of bitcoin worldwide and makes bitcoin more environmentally friendly.At the moment we can connect such asics to any heating systems:All air-cooled Whatsminer modelsAll air-cooled Antminer models.   We can also install our waterblocks on liquid cooled models such as Antminer S19 Hydro, Whatsminer M53 and others I wouldn't want to give a lot of information in one post, so if the topic attracts attention, I can talk about technical details and answer questions.",
