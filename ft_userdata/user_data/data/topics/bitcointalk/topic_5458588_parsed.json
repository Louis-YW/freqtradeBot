Still, many are trying hard about making new meme coins but its era is about to be done.And btw, this is the keyword on what this project is.Quote from: MEMEenthusiastic on July 04, 2023, 03:06:55 PMa joke",

It's always the same things, one month hype and then the rest are gonna to be down for the price until is 0. There is no development, only want to keep the hype as long they can.Once, the price is dead (they are leaving).",

Someone needs to manage, someone needs to convey to them how interesting this project is, and I think it can be categorized as influenser.And maybe you need to explain your project in more detail to make it even more interesting to be discussed, please make a threat here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0",

      "body": "You want crypto investors to put their money into a memecoin that was produced as a joke, right? Like investors enjoy taking risks with their money, not to mention memecoins whose value does eventually vanish into thin air. OP Is this how you hype up a project without giving away all the elaborate details of its tokenomics? However, given that the NeverGibUpFren token was made as a joke, I won't be surprised if it doesn't have any. A joke will it end",

      "body": "I have been buying and holding shitcoins since early 2021 and made few hundre thousand on shitcoins I found early on 4chan. I know that most of the shitcoins are scams and p&d and more now in 2023 where everbody just copy paste and not make something original with fun utility. The tokenomics is good and original with new features like the cooldown strategy where nobody can move more than 1000 tokens at the time and 5 minute cooldown that prevents mev-bots like jaredfromsubway and make it fair for new investor. There is also a frenpaper (whitepaper) on the website with all of the information u need. Do ur research and join the tg if u have any question and be ready for memecoin season soon. Tokenomics: - No blacklist, whitelist, or entitled owner.- No tax, no burn, and a capped total supply of 100,000 tokens.- Initial LP burned.- The Anti-Whale strategy blocks any transfer larger than 1% of the total supply. This meansnobody can move more than 1000 tokens in a single transaction.Additionally there is a cooldown strategy that allows an address to only make 1 transactionevery 5 minutes. This prevents bots from frontrunning, sandwiching, etc. and supports theAnti-Whale strategy.- Keep in mind you can only buy, sell, or transfer a max. of 1000 tokens every 5 minutes!",

We seen a lot of experimental gone viral before and mades tons of profits. Any objective or narrative isnt the importance on trading these memecoins but the hype around it. Dozens of shills from CT and even good liquidity and trading volume, thats all it needs to become a top tier memecoin.",

But i don't see how capping transactions would protect from whale dumping.Even if i used only one wallet. And let's say i own whale amount of coins. For now it has a micro marketcap of $31k making the coin worth $0.31. Let's pretend that this coin has a goal to rise to 300:th in coinmarketcap and be one of the small caps. Currently it would need $72M marketcap. If i had those 1000 tokens with that marketcap one user could dump $720,000 worth of tokens with 5 minutes intervals. Or i could just buy tokens to several wallets and cap them to 1000 tokens per wallet and dump them instantly",

      "body": "The memecoins that tend to pump hard in memecoin season are the one that starts new trend with a great motto like pepe had \"make memecoins great again\". Nguf use a apu meme not pepe it is different between the pepe and apu meme but normies do not know that and thinks is the same meme.I am betting on NGUF because it have a community that will literally never give up because that is what the coin is about. Some community members are also working on a game called “frenverse” which will be the metaverse for frens and $nguf will be the in-game currency check out previews on the telegram group and twitter. Here is the roadmap: Frenstone 1:- Launch of v2 ✔️- Getting listed on coinmarketcap (CMC) ✔️- Setting up social media accounts ✔️- Creating a website ✔️- 100+ frens ✔️- Getting listed on moontok ✔️Frenstone 2:- YouTube channel ✔️- Whitepaper- OpenAI powered Twitter bot ✔️ [You can tag @LiftUsUpFrenly on Twitter]- Manifesto- Getting listed on coingecko- 500+ frens- more competitions and more activities (movie nights, gaming)Frenstone 3:- video game frenverse release- NFT drop- 1000+ frensFrenstone 4:- SEC destroyed, Gary and other traitors jailed - world dominance",

      "body": "Their website doesn't look convincing though. Actually I've never been impressed by memecoins really and I hardly buy them but somehow i decided to try Pepe after much persuasion from my pal and I made a little profit even though I was a bit late. If you must buy any memecoin it pays to DYOR, and invest what you can afford to lose as they pose more risk. I've been researching $L since I learnt it will list on Bitget this week and it looks like it is worth the short especially with Elon's support looming since it is driven by his supporters and a twitter airdrop token.",

The confidence to pump massive funds into it usually stems from their substantial holdings. I acknowledge that the forum discourages discussions about market manipulation, but comprehending it can potentially contribute to riding the wave of a pump.",

We have seen soooooo many meme coins thst borned this year and majority of those are doesn't even last a month before being abandoned because of the low traction of investors. It's s money milking type of token that people are tired off and I don't really see anysense of creating one with very small goals. Yep, I care about newbies who invest in meme coins that was usually the victims of it. There's no real goal or use case that people would really want it. I don't hate all meme coins but meme coins that label them self as the next big thing or somekind really iritates me.",

How will such technology be applied   ? Will there be a stock limit for each wallet? If so, isn't it just a matter of making lots of wallets? I have also opened the link you provided and yes it is just a blank website. And lastly, I've had enough of meme coins and wouldn't be interested in meme coins ( Except DOGE )",
