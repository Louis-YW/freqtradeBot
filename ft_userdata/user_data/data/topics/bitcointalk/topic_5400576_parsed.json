  "content": "Hi,Is it possible to build an escrow wallet on Bitcoin Core, with my own unique interface on top, allowing buyers and sellers to transact?Will I also be able to charge a personal fee for the users using my escrow wallet? I'm thinking something along the lines of localbitcoins escrow wallet. Im planning on not having it centralized, that is bitcoins not being stored on company addresses. Just connecting buyers and sellers from their non custodial wallets.Thank you.",

      "body": "If the bitcoin is not stored in your own address, how will you moderate any disputes between the buyer and seller? Do you plan on using a multi-sig setup, in which the buyer and seller must agree to release the coin, and if there is a dispute, you will intervene with the 3rd signing key? If this is your proposed setup, you will not be able to force the various parties to pay you a fee when there is no dispute. To employ this setup, you would simply need to generate multi-sig addresses upon receipt of the public keys from each party involved in the transaction.",

Idea is seller just uses the site address for selling Bitcoin.If you have full custody of the coins even for a second, that introduces centralization. Also what you want doesn't need anything special like multi-sig since you have full custody you use the simplest form of address (P2WPKH) to receive the funds.

Instead of all that, just introduce a 3-of-4 multisig as the escrow.One key for the buyer, one for the seller, and one for your automated fee collector (the seller and buyer will have to pass through an agreement text saying they acknowledge they have to send percentage fee to address \"1blablabla...\").Then, the buyer and seller can each chose to sign (which waives their right to start a dispute) or open a dispute with the other party. In which case he 4th key that is controlled by a human (you) will intervene and sign with your key if seller or buyer is trying to bail out, or the tx can be abandoned until the disputing party signs [signifying their acceptance of] it.",

It does not have to be in my site address. My understanding is that LBC does keep sole custody of customer deposits. There is a lot of automation involved, so the seller telling LBC that the coin can be released to the buyer will often have the effect of the buyer instantly receiving the coin, but LBC may delay any withdrawals from the buyer's account for various reasons.
