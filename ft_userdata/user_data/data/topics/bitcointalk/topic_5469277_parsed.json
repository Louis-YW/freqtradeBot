      "body": "Thank you OP for this insightful post. E get somethings wey I go like add about hardware wallet wey you talk about. Though, hardware wallet na the safest wallet so far but that one no mean say you no fit lose your funds. The major threat to hardware wallet na clipboard malware. How this malware dey operate be say e dey replace de copied address with the hacker own address, so when you copy the receiver address, always crosscheck if the address wey you paste for the wallet match with copied address. Also, when you want purchase any hardware wallet, make sure to buy only from the manufacturer or from a verified reseller.Some third party keyboard apps dey infected with keyloggers especially those fancy keyboards, so make we no install them on phones wia our wallets dey, make wey dey use the android stock keyboard only. When we install this third party keyboard, come grant them permission to access our device. As we dey type naso them go steal our important information like seed phrase, private keys, credit card details etc.",

I say make I still add am for this thread because this wan na common habit for some person. when ever we hear airdrop, we way rush go link wallet. some of these airdrop or faucet fit be scam.So in regards to this reason, I go like to talk say if you no say you are that type that loves hunting airdrops, and can't do without it, it's advisable & better to keep your Bitcoin on a separate wallet (i.e Electrum) while you use other general wallet such as (Trust wallet & Metamask) for linking up your faucets. But on the contrary, if na me, I for advise make una avoid anything faucets/bounty, as those things are always a total waste of time and effect.Quote3.storing you seed phrase the wrong way. we all know say our keys na one most important matter wey as a Bitcoiner or cryptocurrency person we no suppose use am take play at all. some people go just dey lazy to the extent of storing their keeps put for Gmail or online cloud apps. I still no know watin dem dey think Sha say Dem no fit hack Gmail or something.In regards to this, I will like to say that where you store your Seed Phrase doesn't matter but how you store your seed phrase is what matters most, because it's very possible that a seed phrase can be placed in front of someone but yet of not been told they can never know, simply because the word \"Seed Phrase\" is not written on it, hence, the more better we stop writing the word \"Seed Phrase\" while storing it, the better for us",

Wetin I dey try talk be say, dat time airdrop been dey pay well but this days many no worth am and no be all wey dey ask you to connect wallet to wey you supposed participate in. If you come see better one and you wan connect wallet, no use your wallet wey be your personal wallet, just create another wallets specifically for claiming airdrop and make I say you get the tokens, you fit come transfer am go your personal wallet. Even when you wan trade for all this decentralized exchange dem, get a specifically wallet for that purpose as well. You no dey buy online wallet so no fear to create multiple for various activities and get a personal wallet for your Hodling. Quote3.storing you seed phrase the wrong way. we all know say our keys na one most important matter wey as a Bitcoiner or cryptocurrency person we no suppose use am take play at all. some people go just dey lazy to the extent of storing their keeps put for Gmail or online cloud apps. I no go blame anybody because we all grew up depending on people for our security and banks for your money so we too dey used to centralization already and others protecting us and na wetin make us easily dey trust those emails and other online ways wey we dey store our private keys and other sensitive information but make we try change because although we never too hear stories of them been comprised and Nigerians been affected but time go come and e go reach this side so make we dey avoid them and use method wey dey safe and easy for this side. Alot of recommended ways dey to store our private keys but the one wey dey too easy for us na writing them down on a piece of paper and that paper been protected like locking in a safe after laminating the paper or using an encrypted USD device that also has another secured backups like the paper go make sense.",

And in addition to that, one of the mistake I have been able to noticed about Bitcoin investment is the fact about some, leaving or hodling large sum of money on an exchange wallet for a long term, which on a normal case, ought not to be like that due to how we tend to lack full control over our funds on a centralized exchanges. And also for security reasons, that is if eventually the exchange happens to go bankrupt just as in the case of FTX, you won't be affected by those who will lose there funds due to bankruptcy of that exchange. Quotescammers them always dey want make person trust them because nah the only easiest wey wen them go take scam person, trust nah very dangerous thing wey somebody go supposed to avoid especially for insider Internet.

On love my country people   Thank you for all that elaborated Op, I believe this piece of article will save lot of  beginners who'd adhere to this information.While I haven't participated in any of the airdrop projects before, I'm wondering why investors would even associate their wallet containing crypto assets bought with their hard eaned money with a social public service as airdrops just to earn free funds. That's a big risk of loosing everything and it doesn't seem unhealthy to such investors asset.However, with all that being outlined, having your Crypto assets stored in the centralized exchange while considering greedily to omit transaction fees is also an exposure where Investors assets can be trapped by scammers.",
