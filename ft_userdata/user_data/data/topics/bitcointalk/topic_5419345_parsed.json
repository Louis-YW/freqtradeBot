      "body": "Sad but true. When the price is down, few people are interested in buying bitcoins. But in a hype and with high prices, people suddenly become interested in bitcoin and buy him dearly.  I've experienced this again and again in the last few years in my circle of acquaintances and it hasn't changed to this day. I wonder when will people finally learn it?",

The people who understand the history and cycle are those that have made their research on it, and afterwards experienced it with the knowledge they have, this kind of knowledge is what get rich quick investors do not have, that's why they invest only when it is fomo time.",

A lot of missed opportunity indeed. It is true that a lot of people could say \"buy low and sell high\", but it turns out to be a hard thing to do lol.",

Instead of taking profits or enjoying an increase in the value of their assets, they start buying. They buy at the top of the market, and then they say that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme and a scam. Now I am talking to some people IRL, who are also interested in cryptocurrencies.I ask: Have you already bought bitcoin?Answer: No. I'll wait until he recovers. The best time to build wealth in the market is definitely not on a bullish season but it’s always on a market being bearish. As they’ve said, this is the best entry so you can maximize your expected profits when the market turns already into bullish. But this is what newbies are thinking. Instead, they come in the market when everything is good and profitable expecting that the price of bitcoin will eventually go further. And when the price suddenly crash, they end up panic selling and blame bitcoin for their huge losses. If that will always be the mindset of new investors, they cannot expect to get rich with bitcoin.",

I can definitely say since im guilty on this one. haha",

Unfortunately, newbies want instant profits when they think of investments. The reason why they always prefer to invest when prices are high and profitable. So they enter the market and buy coins at their highest peak, and maybe earn slight profits after that. But since their goal is never for long term but for only short term, so they started losing after months and quit after that. That is the most scenario with newbies right now as they don’t create long term goals, but we’re only good for short term goals.",

Unless we get another random influencers mentioning Bitcoin a lot at these moments, non-crypto users would just look at the price as just another investment that is not worth investing at.Surely after the 69k, people would now believe that Bitcoin is reaaaaally not those shitcoins that you usually encounter in the market.The consistent 5 digit in USD price surely brings a lot attention already to a lot of investor. $200 is already a lot when converted here in my local currency, what more if it is five?",

They actually don't see the price but they focus on whether the trend/hype is good or not. It is the same as Dogecoin, many people buy Dogecoin when Elon Musk makes the hype. They don't care what the price is, but they are following others during the hype. Sadly, whenever the hype happens, the price should increase drastically and people will buy at a high price. Many of them don't realize that after the hype there will be a huge drop.In the Bitcoin case, many people probably will buy when the price gradually increases after the next halving (in 2024). They should buy when they hear much good news about Bitcoin, especially when they hear again that Bitcoin to reach $100k in the next bullrun.This happens because the news/issue has a big role to influence people's interest to buy.",

Many of these people bought at 60k, it fell, they bought at 50, it fell lower, they thought ok I'm gonna be smart here, I won't buy at 40 if it falls there, I'll wait for 30 because it was the bottom mid 2020, it fell lower. So the last straw was: I'll buy at 20! Bitcoin never went below previous cycle's ATH. And it fell lower...So now these people either hold coins bought at 20 before we fell to 18 or bought higher and sold it when they went into a loss. Now they need the price to fall much lower so they can make up all the money they lost buying above 30k and selling it on the way down.",

But when it rebounds it gives them a sense of security and thinking it will go even higher, they can buy from there and wait to take profits. Unfortunately, things don't go as they planned and they will panic sell when the price drops afterwards.This is very normal, if everyone is like us, just waiting to buy bitcoin at low price, who will buy at high price and how will we sell if no one buys.

I don't know how long this bear market will last, but I do know that it's not worth trying to time it out. It's better to stay consistent and buy at good prices rather than trying to guess when things will turn around. I can't speak for everyone, but I know many people who are scared to buy because they don't understand the Bitcoin cycles and think it's just a bubble waiting to pop.
