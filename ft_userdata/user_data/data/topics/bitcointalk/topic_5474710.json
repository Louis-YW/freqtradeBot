  "content": "The market is gaining momentum and as usual, the interest of the public about bitcoin halving is on the rise, like we can see it already from the green candles of many coins and through the trend in Google search as how people are asking questions about bitcoin halving.Normally, the crypto market use to pump after every halving which use to increased price of bitcoin because the miners block reward use to half. Then, after that other coins in th  market start shooting different candles as everyone get excited for this historical celebration.While this call celebration of bull run, there are many ways people lose money and these mistakes are common which can be avoided but the excitement take away everyone attention to focus much on the new trend of crypto price discovery. I was having a group discussion and learn some things I want to share some of these traps and how to avoid when bull run comes. Come with Me;1.Invest in what you can afford to lose: I have read this line many times inside this forum and outside this forum that are crypto related discussion and what they tell you about crypto investment is to invest with the amount you can afford to lose to avoid had I know and regrets that later. In the last bull run, some people commit suicide when they loss their funds and when some of them where victim of scams. It's advisable to invest in the amount you know it will not hurt you if anything should happen in the end, always consider this before you take that money to any coin.2.Don't keep your coin on any centralized platforms: Whatever coin you is your favorite, buy them in any quantity that to want but a centralized platform is not the best place to do this. Even staking, don't stake your coins on any centralized platforms, let it be in a decentralized platforms to reduce the risk of the companies folding up. Many of this happened in the last bull run, FTX was on one of the biggest centralized exchanges that crypto history will never forget. MtGox happened on the 24th of February 2014 and  after some years, FTX repeated the same pattern. Who knows the one next but you can avoid them by not keeping your coins on the exchange, remember not your keys not your coins.3.Don't entertain any form of scam: Scam increases when bull run is around but how to you avoid them is simple, just reduce your greed and don't buy into unreleastic ideas. When you see staking reward of 100%, kindly run away, when you doubling schemes, avoid them and don't invest in shitty ideas because you are so passionate to make money, they will make you hate crypto and ignore the good side of it.4.Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best: Be prepared for anything that comes later, the coin you are having in mind to pump may do that and might not do that. If you are lucky and have profit, enjoy the profits and if you don't make anything, he happy that you were part of the bull cycle, there is nothing guarantee in crypto because you don't know tomorrow. People that are saying bitcoin will go to $1M are all speculators and are just hoping it happens, nothing is guaranteed here, just be prepared and hope for the best.",

It is also good to avoid scam and also hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But if you are a bitcoin holder, buy now at $36900 is still a good price. I do not think someone should just buy an amount that he can afford to lose but should be seen as an investment, I mean to invest in bitcoin and buy more at good time. If it is other coins, then you can consider it as gambling, trading or something far more risky and use the amount of money that you can afford to lose.",

In these times, the media is super hyped about Bitcoin, crypto “experts” and analyst come up with some price prediction to trigger more people into buying. It’s becomes even worse when newbies buy random altcoins in hopes of making x10 their investment.",

Exchanges should be treated as exchanges and not as a storage place for your coin, as soon as you’re done with your activities on your exchange make sure you withdraw your coin to your wallet if you know you won’t be using it for a while (although the current network congestion might make some don’t want to move it to their non-custodial wallet, but if you have other coins with lower fees make sure you keep them safe in your wallet.).Quote3.Don't entertain any form of scam: 4.Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best:If you’re new to the crypto space and you find a project that’s offering anything that sounds too good to be true, just stay away from them because there’s a 99.9% chance that they are scammer and only want your money. Don’t foolishly try out anything that isn’t good logically just for the sake of FOMO.",

Come with Me;We have often heard some of the points you listed, so there isn't any special to avoid the traps. Maybe some legendary here was bored and too tired to give advice to the beginner because is rare to be heard by newbie, they bypass it, and go in one ear and out the other. So just let be, let that lose be their experience, because when someone got the lesson by experience, he will get real knowledge and would not do the same again like past. I know that because I've experience it on last halving, I am lose, and I won't get it again this time. By that lose i just think how to avoid it to myself and analyzing new strategies how to to get profit and avoid the traps.",

Therefore, many crypto users are preparing bitcoin assets and other crypto assets to sell in the bull run market. Apart from that, what the OP said is very relevant to what always happens when a bull market comes. Because when a bullish market comes, what is important is not just the potential profit that you can get. However, there is also the potential for big losses that could come your way. Because it has become a cycle, where there are those who profit, there are also those who experience losses. Therefore, the suggestions given by the OP are very good and relevant to implement. And if I summarize, the main points conveyed by the OP are Knowledge, experience, mentality and also emotional control. All of this must be implemented optimally by all of us as crypto users in order to avoid losses.",

I think we should invest what we can afford to live without or bear if the investment turns unfavourable. People who harm themselves because of loss of funds might have used loans or credit to invest. Quote2.Don't keep your coin on any centralized platforms: Experience has shown that these centralised exchanges cannot be trusted. Coins should be kept in an open-sourced decentralized wallet. You don't need to be a victim to learn from other people's experiences.Quote3.Don't entertain any form of scam: Scam increases when bull run is around but how to you avoid them is simple, just reduce your greed and don't buy into unreleastic ideas.

Any project that offers even if it is as low as ten per cent profit within a short period should be suspected. I am also careful when dealing with over-hyped projects that offer profit that is too good to be real. Quote4.Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best: This advice should be applied to all forms of investment, don't have to expect too much from them. Nothing is certain in life so we are projecting to make a profit it is also important to expect the worst.",

This is a cliche in the crypto world but when we look at it critically it is just something that everyone says so that they will not be taken to the court of public opinion and tried for giving out financial advice. In reality, not everyone abides by this. We all follow our discretion, intuition and instinct when investing in bitcoin and we do this based on the level of research and knowledge which we already have or know about it. An individual with intermediate knowledge of bitcoin will most like sell off one of his cars and invest all of it in bitcoin while an individual with expert knowledge of bitcoin will mostly likely sell off his stocks and invest all of it in bitcoin. These people are bitcoin maximalist. They have ascended past the realm of investing what you can afford to lose because they believe that with bitcoin there is nothing that can be lost.",

But they don't know on when this price to be reach since as stated they are just guessing that it will happen that's why we shouldn't believe on the words they say since we might not see a good position if everything fall for hoping that price to come. That's why we need to avoid being greedy and just think about more realistic or to the nearest price it would possibly reach so we would not fall on wrong settings that bitcoin will not fall and it continue to go up since if dump happen maybe we will get in panic then do dumb decision between the volume we hold.",

They want to be on time in taking their share of the profits but unfortunately, they don't know that the pump isn't there forever. This makes them have to bear a lot of losses.Not storing coins on any exchange is the best step to avoid bad things. It's better if you keep the coins in a separate wallet. Fortunately, many wallets can store Bitcoin and altcoins at the same time. They can keep it in that wallet while waiting for the price to rise. Remember, not your keys, not your coins.Don't put too much faith in investment programs that offer high returns. Along with the halving time, there will be many such programs so we have to be careful. And yes, the last one is true. We must prepare ourselves for all possibilities. We cannot expect all the coins we own to get a pump. Only good coins can get pumps and everything else is just pump plays from groups we don't know about.",

First of all thanks OP for bringing such a useful advice for newbie in this bull market. Actually many people misguided by Youtubers and Twitter influencers. They generally told the success stories and doesn't tell about risk crypto posses. People thinking that there is only profit in the investment and due to this reason some newbies take loan or sell their property for investing. The most worst scene is when newbies use these fund in Future or meme coins where chances of fund drops to zero is much high. Everyone should properly invest according to own money management and don't follow influencers blindly.

Who knows the one next but you can avoid them by not keeping your coins on the exchange, remember not your keys not your coins.  Staking in decentralized platform also is risky where you cannot withdraw instantly anytime. When Luna collapse, people staked luna and ustc in large number and when they tried to withdraw the token locked for 15 days so we should also be careful when we stake in dex or cex.",
