It's HIGH INFLATION, HIGH FUEL PRICES, HIGH FOOD PRICES, HIGH COSTS OF LIVING, AND LOW MINIMUM WAGE.That's what happens if a non-elected cabal is made to have control over the money supply. Look at this list. Start researching about your country's central bank policies, read the news, and know if your country is about to have, or is currently having high inflation. Because your country could be next for a mass protest.ALBANIA, https://twitter.com/the_real_fly/status/1545878203419484161ECUADOR, https://twitter.com/mikehudema/status/1545913723143049217PAKISTAN, https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1542993951816200192ITALY, https://twitter.com/_janey_j/status/1544711333421240322BULGARIA, https://twitter.com/thevoicealexa/status/1545799463029116931GHANA, https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1545558353916489728MACEDONIA, https://twitter.com/berniespofforth/status/1545065945139494915NETHERLANDS, https://twitter.com/_janey_j/status/1544711986340052992INDIA, https://twitter.com/puritan_777/status/1544832499800543233SPAIN, https://twitter.com/radiogenova/status/1542913033772703745CANADA, https://twitter.com/radiogenova/status/1542751499406680064PANAMA, https://twitter.com/buperac/status/1545880489331855360POLAND, https://twitter.com/dalefourtrump/status/1545915976117624833ARGENTINA, https://twitter.com/americanladyj/status/1546011015388598272IRELAND, https://twitter.com/kurdsatenglish/status/1538452248124170241SOUTH KOREA, https://twitter.com/spriteer_774400/status/1543665339510177792CHINA, https://twitter.com/investmentshulk/status/1546222694756122625",

Quote from: Husires on July 18, 2022, 09:22:34 AMThe bottom line is that mismanagement is what makes the state corrupt, and it is what leads to political turmoil.Sometimes, inflation is beyond corruption, some leaders are not just capable. I can see my country always depending on the whites, they do not want to come up with something of their own and they are failing. They always value the white countries than their own.See phones, computers, their OS and other modern technologies not beyond USA, China and few other developed countries. The reason I always pity the next generations of my country. The present generation do not even have believe in themselves, the leaders completely worsen the situation because they are the ones living the luxurious lives of foreign products while not even having the initiative to make their country be like that.",

There is no question at all that people are dissatisfied with the development of events, but even with the best will of all governments, the hole we have fallen into is too deep to get out of it just like that.What will stop the protests to a greater extent are very likely epidemiological measures which, given the increase in the number of infected people, will probably be in force again in 1-2 months. Let's remember the big protests in Hong Kong or the yellow vest protests in France, which are still going on as of 2018 - little has changed for the better.I'm not saying that people shouldn't protest, but apart from the violent overthrow of the government, which rarely happens, the real power can be shown in the parliamentary elections when they can elect some other new people and give them a chance to try to make a better society for everyone. There is a saying that bad governments are elected by people who stay at home during elections, and this is unfortunately true in many countries.",

We had 10 years of relative stability before Covid struck and we really took it for granted, after the global pandemic shut down massive supply chains (and continues to do so) it caused all sorts of problems that lead to this inflation. On top of that Putin declared war on Ukraine for no reason and brought war back to Europe for the first time in over 70 years. All these major disruptions have trickled down and affected the poorest countries the hardest, while even very developed countries are struggling to make sense of it. However we have yet to see a true recession hit and it seems politicians are intent on pushing it back as long as possible, which might just end up making it larger and more dangerous.",
