I'm seriously not sure how this will ever pass even rudimentary scrutiny. It is hard to expect any serious development on a project that has a website that looks like it was made by a six-year-old child. Whatever the case may be, they're clearly not serious about this project and are just looking to extract money from people.@jagoanpilot, if you want people to take you seriously, your website needs to reflect that. You are supposed to be the pros here - act like one. If you are incapable of building a professional-looking website, pay someone else to build it for you.",
