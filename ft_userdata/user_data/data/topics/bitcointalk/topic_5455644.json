You can find many crypto moving the direct opposite direction than Bitcoin. I think that is enough proof to justify my statement. Try to research more and expand your knowledge.There are currently thousands of altcoins or non Bitcoin cryptocurrencies. Generally altcoin prices follow that of Bitcoin. This is because altcoin buyers usually buy Bitcoin with fiat currency to exchange it for their chosen altcoin. But Bitcoin does not cover all cryptocurrencies and also many different altcoins have different uses. Most of the time though altcoin prices are closely tied to Bitcoin price and closely follow bitcoin. BTC owns more than half of the entire cryptocurrency market. This dominance gives Bitcoin a lot of influence and control. As a result the value of an altcoin is often measured against the price of Bitcoin so if Bitcoin falls, the price of altcoins may fall and conversely if Bitcoin rises the price of altcoins may rise.",

They both compete to be the top BTC and USD.",

Bitcoin is the only true decentralized among all blockchain available because itâ€™s founder is completely anonymous that is proven for more than a decade while other shitcoins that copy Bitcoin footprints is made by developers that trying to replicate Bitcoin just to gain money on it. Even tokens with DAO is still centralized since the team controls the majority of the token that can affect the outcome of the decision made by the team.Bitcoin is the only coin that is worthy for long term investment and itâ€™s my favorite coin.",

All they know is, they own an account with the exchange they bought from and so, its safe for them.Remember the phrase \"Not your keys, not your coins\"At that point, it applies. Your not immune to seizure when it ain't your keys. Your account and coins could ve frozen or seized.Bitcoin provides anonymityAnonymous yes, since you can't know the person behind an address.

The market reacts to bitcoin movement because it is not just the first cryptocurrency but it is also the most secured one and as such many investors have this believe that if bitcoin is affected then other coins cannot survive the dump. The only few coins that oppose this are either newly launched coins with much hype and after the hype they also follow suit like the other top Alticoins and follow bitcoin. Actually where I feel bitcoin is kind of connected to other cryptocurrencies because almost all the Alticoins except NFTs created after it are just after addressing one or two issues they feel that bitcoin is lagging. From transaction fee to block size to the mining methods used and none has been able to actual make any significant change without creating a problem too.
