  "content": "This new series of coins and pours I've been discussing for a little while here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439641.msg62170730#msg62170730 is getting a little closer to becoming a reality. Here is an update with the project:I have decided to start off with a coin that is a bit more modest than a 1 or 2 ounce silver pour and so instead i'll first release a limited run of exactly 21 .999 Fine Copper \"CC\" Pennies! The CC stands for Crypto Currency. The overall design is exactly that of the Large Cent likeness from the 1800s featuring the same elements \"The United States of America\" also featuring an \"S\" mint mark for San Francisco (which is known for its Proof Coins), and of course the wreath hugging the \"CC\" in the middle. I'll add a pic on here soon. Don't you worry, the silver pours will be next in the 1 and 2 ozt varieties but first I want to get this ball rolling off with something I think every collector can appreciate: A good old fashioned copper penny. Hopefully sooner than later I will be launching this very limited collection! Again only 21 of these \"CC\" copper pennies have been stamped and minted by me on specially treated/polished pure copper planchets. In fact they are actually considered Proof Planchets, although the die that I used to stamp this was NOT polished, thus it cannot be classified as a \"proof coin\" exactly, so I guess that leaves them somewhere in between Proofs and Mint State coins. Unfortunately, there were a few errors in the minting process where some of the coins didn't strike perfectly.... Including 6 of the coins that were struck 10% off center, the 3 of them that were double stamped by mistake, a few of them have a mysterious golden hew to it which i'm not exactly sure how it happened as I did nothing to achieve this but I would consider them \"toned\". Only 11 of these coins struck near perfect! If you buy one, you may get an \"error\" coin, or you could get a \"Mint State Proof\" Penny. Thats right, I just coined MSPs or Mint State Proofs haha. Genius. The final product, presentation, and packaging, as well as shipment/distribution will only be made possible with the help of some the most influential people i've had the pleasure of meeting on and off of this forum including, Mopar Mining (Key Generation/3D Printing custom packaging), Polymerbit (Hologram & COA Design), MinerJones aka MJ!!! (ESCROW Services/good vibes).  ***Below was copied from the old post, I will give the status update/cross out any completed tasks.**I am going to need to do these things first before I can make this project a reality: 1. I need to hire some graphic design expertise to create a new bitcoin centric design in the form of a vector image file. Vendor/Design TBD.  complete2. I need to send this vector image file to steel stamp creation company for the physical piece of metal I am going to be slamming my hammer into against these silver 1ozt or 2ozt rounds! Pretty crucial! Vendor is vetted just need to finalize on the design. Vendor Chosen. complete 3. I am going to need to come up with the actual sales post/ pre order which I will have paid in advance to fund the project. (damn I probably should have made this one #1 haha.  To be posted/completed. 4. I need to follow up with Mopar (who has agreed to help w/ the key generation / holo ordering) So need to finalize the holo selection / style on that as well and work - still pending/ TBD.  Update: Polymerbit will be designing the holos and coordinating w/ Mopar on this piece. 5. Once all of this leg work is done it'll be off to the forge to smelt/ pour silver into rounds, polish, anneal (heat silver w/ torch to soften and immediately stamp), Quench, apply an antique finish (potentially), and then create divot/ hole on the back for the PK / holo covering on the back. Final polishings. Stamping the serial number on the side of the round. I will be conducting this tedious process myself. TBD Update: This has now been changed to the .999 Fine CU planchets that I have completed stamping (Pics to come shortly)  6. I will also need to then perhaps 3D print a custom casing for this. That means i'll need to make some tweaks to the old 3D printer and find an expert to help design a custom fit case w/ magnets as well. This will be a whole project in itself. 3D print designer expertise TBD Mopar is assisting with this  7. Stickers- man stickers are just a must have!!!! If you don't have a super awesome cool sticker are you even flipping legit?! lmao. Vendor TBD- Update: Still working on this one, maybe Polymerbit can help with this one too I need to ask. Pending. 8. Almost forgot about the COAs. Wow that would have been a shame if I put in all this work and never made these lol. COA design / material and format TBD. (open to any suggestion on what you think looks best).   Update: Polymerbit has agreed to not only help me design the COAs but the hologram stickers as well As of right now there is no TBD date on the completion of this project, but here is the update with everything that needs to be done to make it a reality and we're making progress! Its going to be a lot of fun. I just can't wait to bring them to life. Just be patient with me & I will do my best to bring something new and fun for our crypto collectors here on BTALK  I'm not sure why the pictures aren't working",

Yes, I am very excited to reveal some of these examples! I will share a picture of each type minted. I plan to set up the light box I have back up and bust out my canon and take a few shots of them soon with a 100mm lens. I'll share those before the week is over with you all.",

You may already know all this, but I thought that I'd share the knowledge. We (The Bitcoin Penny Company / One Cent Mint) have been living in and exploring this self-minting rabbit hole for almost a year now, especially with the various tempering grades of copper, and it can be quite a lot of knowledge to take in. (By the way, you'll want to buy planchets that were tempered in the higher \"O\" range, if you're not tempering them yourself. They'll be softer and better for stamping.) But you'll get there.

A small 20 ton press isn't expensive and it should be possible to make the coins look similar to each other.If you are into alloying & precious metals i highly recommend to try a Shibuichi alloy. It's an old Japanese technique that makes your material softer. One hit with the stamp should be good if you do a 75% copper/25% silver alloy.I wish all of you a relaxed Sunday🍀...greets Humble",

I did anneal these before stamping, unfortunately I don't have a hydraulic press but have looked into this and eventually will. In the meantime I've had to stamp them by hand which is where all the errors really stem from, boy is it hard to line those puppies up to get it perfect. I think these errors only add character though, really makes your appreciate a perfectly struck coin. I picked up these planchetts from the regency mint I think, got an amazing deal on them a while back I wish I had only gotten more, they gave me a special bulk rate on a test lot, I'll be ordering some more of them soon. What I love about them is that they're the exact same size as a penny and of course pure Cu. These will progress overtime I'm hoping!",
