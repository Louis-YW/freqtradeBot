I could change my mind if I see significant developments in the project and not just for talk or hype.What's the point of this post and why it's even posted in the beginner's section? Did you happen to get lucky and just want to brag or get back to those people who doubted and laughed at your decision to buy Shiba?",

So many coins are like that I have been invited a hundred times to invest in so many coins/tokens but based on my research it's not worth it and only thrives on hype, I expect these kinds of coins/tokens to do well in the bull market but we're talking about long term price and long term existence in the community, some coins get a lot of hype then go down the drain, some coins/tokens take time to mature and the price stabilizes, I prefer the latter than the formeralways believe in your research, so many investors are blinded by hype and influencers.",

In such market, you will read many articles, watch many videos about many 'potential' projects. Believe me, you will know how 'potential' they are in bear market.QuoteI know that many people don't like meme coins when they were new in past years, how do you feel seeing your friends you call stupid for investing in shiba does very well than all your so called high-quality projects? With me, after few years here, only Bitcoin is a high-quality project.If I have to pick altcoins, I will pick only Ethereum, BNB and Dogecoin but my majority of capital will be for Bitcoin like 80%, 10% for ETH, 8% for BNB and 1% for Dogecoin. Last 1% is for risky bet with 'potential' altcoins and I afford to lose money with them.",

Question is how do you become updated on that particular project if you don’t like. You are just tormenting yourself on watching it’s progress despite you don’t have anything to gain by watching it. It only means that you have a poor judgement if the project that you didn’t like is performing in the bull market.I will feel a bit regretful if ever this will happened to me and I will adjust my trading strategy to consider again that kind of project welcome to mu portfolio because having a good performance means the project is worthy of investment.",

I can't get mad or angry for seeing a project I never liked doing better in the market, because for the fact that I didn't like it doesn't mean they ought not to have done well in the market. So if by mistake I happens to come across a friend of mine who invested in a meme coin an now has massive profit, the best thing I can do is celebrate with them, wish them good luck and more money. Because for the fact that I didn't like a particular set of coins due to the level of it's volatility, I will only wished I had grab such opportunity, but since it's already late, best option for will be to just move on with my life.",

I have never told my friends not to invest in any coin. I have advised my older friends to invest in various good projects. Of course they also got success by investing. But I never regretted it, never felt stupid. Rather, I felt very blessed. I always want a person to be benefited by me and never harmed. I always consider myself happy for this confidence.",

Surely I will somehow regret my actions especially if I had the opportunity to invest in it. Everybody wants to maximize opportunities to make more money, hence missing such privilege can be painful. But the truth is that I must not invest in everything or coins that comes my way. I don't have so much money to do trial and error investment that is why I choose my investment careful.My expectations is to see my friends succeed in their own business. When your friends are make money it will reduce envy and borrowing. I will celebrate with them so that they will also join me in my own celebration when my own Bitcoin investment grows.",

I do not invest in such projects because of the high risks. With the first price increase of 200-300%, I withdraw my investment, and then I can be a hodler for a long time and wait for x100.I am not sure that most of the investors will earn on such projects, so I don’t have envy and negative thoughts from the fact that I didn’t buy meme coins.",
