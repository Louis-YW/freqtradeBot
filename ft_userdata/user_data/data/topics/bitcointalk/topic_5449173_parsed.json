I would like to test and send them such transactions (possibly 0 fees) that don't need to be confirmed urgently.I might be wrong but I don’t think it is done manually to specifically select a node for mining. The transaction is sent to memory pool and the nodes/miner picks it up automatically based on the highest transaction fee or if the memory pool gets less congested it could takes up everything in his data block. But just like Charles-Tim said the memory pool is a bit congested now and even if you might try to test it after 72 hours if the memory pool doesn’t comes below the 1sat/vbytes then your transaction won’t be mined could be reversed",

There is no rule saying a transaction would be dropped from the mempool after 72 hours. Note that a transaction with the fee rate of less than 1 sat/vbyte is considered as a non-standard transaction and would be rejected by the nodes. Therefore, if you make such a transaction, it can't enter the mempool of nodes at all.",

My node has been running with the configuration that allows 0 tx fees. The other 8-10 nodes (random ones) have different configuration and don't accept the transaction with a fee < 1 sat/vbyte.Quote from: BitMaxz on April 17, 2023, 04:53:12 PMDo you mind sharing what is your purpose?The purpose is not to lose sats on transactions.

Unless you are a miner (or you own a mining pool), there's no way to make such a transaction. Correct. Generally this type of thing is done for accounting purposes to move around funds from one internal address you own to another related address you own. Perfect example is the rather large sums moved around by exchanges & pools.AFAIK, you have to use your own node to broadcast a 'real' tx to mainnet that has a usable fee attached to it and include your zero-fee tx with it to be sent to another address you own. For that matter, the 0-fee part can be payouts to multiple addresses - it's how most pools handle user payouts. The tx with fee does not have to be a big one, 0.0001 with appropriate fee attached would do it.As for Quote from: Greg Tonoski on April 17, 2023, 07:37:13 PMsnipQuote from: BitMaxz on April 17, 2023, 04:53:12 PMAre you planning to scam someone?

It's a cold, factual and possibly valid assumption given that you have yet to give a reason for doing what you are asking about. It is highly unusual for a person to do. Many of us have been here for a decade or more and seen it all when it comes to scam plans...",

Allow people to create and fund and account so they can manually submit 0 fee transactions, and then charge them separately under 1 sat / vb so they can transmit them the next time the mempool is empty. So instead of empty space, they put out a block with a bunch of transactions that have ultra low fees that they had been paid for a while ago.-Dave",

Normal Range is between ~10 sat.and the other things fee is making the mining profitable for now they get block reward but when the cap 21 million btc is out transaction need a fee to attract approver/miner",
