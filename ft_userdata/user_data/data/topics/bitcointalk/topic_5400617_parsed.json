They also have simplistic models of ai for detecting new threats (such as using heuristics to try to work out what a program does/functions to see if it's malicious).They'll likely either take a while to spot innovative threats or they'll overclean your pc (and they'll also find ways to do both of those things too at once).If you're doing something you don't trust, it'd be better practice to use a VM as a secure VM won't be able to interact with your main system unless you allow it to.",

The safest option is probably to have an air-gapped machine that is only used to sign transactions, and that's the thing I'd do if I were you. Do you have any computers or laptops left over? Make them air-gapped. If you can't or don't want to, then the second best option is to buy a hardware wallet, although you might have to submit some personal data. Ultimately, I think a good quote from Electrum's downloads page is needed here;Quote from: electrum.orgFinally, if you are really concerned about malware, you should not use an operating system that relies on anti-virus software.",

It would be recommended to you and  to anyone to download antivirus on your pc because it could help you to avoid some malwares that can affect your pc if some of it penetrates. But what most important thing there is how you secure your own hardware so better also not to click any random link and if you cannot avoid to do this better grab your smartphone and check the link first before opening it to your pc so that you may know that the link you are curious with is safe and not stuffed with any harmful things.",

Perhaps, you can't just expect that Antivirus will keep your PC 100% safe, especially if you are using a free app. You'd rather acquire paid Antivirus system to enhance your protection but as I said, this won't guarantee that you are totally safe, it still needs your help like being careful in clicking links from strangers. And I don't advise using multiple AV as sometimes it contradicts each other that causing lags in the computer system. And I also advise you to move your other wallet to the other computer for security reasons and in the case that hack comes, they can take everything from you.",

Antivirus or Internet security softwares can not protect you completely from all threats on the Internet. You should be responsible to protect yourself first with your healthy web-surfing behavior.It's bad idea to store your coins in wallets on a device that is used daily and with daily exposure to the Internet. Your coins, wallets should be store offline, air-gapped if possible. The best practice is only connect your wallet to the Internet when you have to broadcast transactions.Remember, even after installing a wallet, when you create seed for a specific wallet, you should do it offline.[Guide] Secure air-gapped crypto wallet storage method",

For most people, the odds of downloading malware on Windows computers have greatly reduced over the years as a result of a variety of different methods that were developed to help make PC users' lives safer.Most modern anti-virus products are now very good at recognising malicious code and blocking it. Even default Microsoft Defender Antivirus can spot most threats in Windows. It's not perfect, of course, and there are still a few strains of malware that are not detected, but no antivirus product is perfect. You can never be sure that the product is 100% effective, so it's important to remember that it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to viruses and malware. Update your software regularly and make sure you do regular security updates. Think twice before clicking a link or downloading anything, and be on the lookout for suspicious emails and other messages. Be careful when opening attachments or images from email. And keep in mind that these threats can show up on your mobile devices, too.Quote from: MetaMii on May 29, 2022, 03:15:44 PMI want to start working on my PC online but I don't have any Antivirus or security on the system since it's been year's since I work on PC last, also I have two to three crypto wallets on my PC. Many security-conscious people choose to use separate systems for work and everyday use. It is up to you to decide what you want to use and how you wish to work. Personally, I like to separate my personal life and work life. By segregating them , I find it easier to protect my data and I'm keeping my digital life as safe and secure as possible. There are some very good reasons why you might want to consider using a Virtual Machine (VM) to keep your main operating system secure and malware-free while you're working on your PC. This is not just a form of housekeeping; it's an effective way to prevent the spread of viruses and other malware by keeping the virus-infected part of your PC isolated from everything else.",

Stuff that's been well reported and around for a while is picked up quite well by antivirus. This is a rather strange explanation given that the AV database is updated at least once every 24 hours with the latest antivirus definitions, although these intervals may be more frequent. Of course, here I am talking about those AVs that have the best reputation and are not free software. Anyone using Windows OS should have good AV, firewall, and antimalware, especially if your computer has crypto wallets or you trade cryptocurrencies. A good AV/antimalware will protect you (in most cases) from downloading a fake wallet or any malicious file, and a firewall is also a very important part of security for any personal computer. The problem is that most people don't want to pay for premium security solutions that aren't really expensive, and they think that such security solutions will slow down their computers. If you use an old computer with 2 or 4 GB of RAM, everything will be slow anyway, so without at least 8 GB of RAM we can't talk about comfortable work on the computer.",
