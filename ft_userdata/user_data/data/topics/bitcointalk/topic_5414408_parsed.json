Do you think backlash received from influencers is enough reason for Twitch to ban gambling streaming on their platform? According to https://www.thegamer.com/twitch-ban-gambling-sites-october-18/ the reason why influencers are instigating the ban is due to the fact that scammers have taken hold of the streaming platform. I know its a recent online streaming platform, unlike most other existent platforms, and with a rather porous security system, it is a sure haven for scammers to grab their bite off those unsuspecting of their ploy. This however, is a scare notice for online users to be wary of the modus operandi of how online scammers operate and also to those who use unlicensed gaming sites.",

But why not sport betting and poker which I don't understand? Because winnings are not so instant in those games IMO. You need to think, you have to use your brain in order to win in those games, you can't win x1000 (for the slots) or x36 for the roulette in few seconds by just clicking one button.I don't really understand why they have banned dice games and not Blackjack, Baccarat, Andar Bahar, Teen Patti and any casino card games but gambling streamers will maybe turn themselves toward these games to continue their gambling streams.",

Do you think backlash received from influencers is enough reason for Twitch to ban gambling streaming on their platform? That is a pretty big development from them and it did seem like the gambling section had exploded lately with these activities. It makes sense really because there is no skill involved in these type of platforms and the outcomes are all predefined statistically speaking. Twitch was also opening itself up to all sorts of pressure from regulators in various countries because they have such a young viewership and could potentially have been the subject of fines or more. You could tell that all of those casinos were constantly pushing the limits of what would be allowed and it's rare to find streamers who will actively admit to their privately orchestrated advertising deals.",

There are games where you decapitate other people, zombies, monsters, blood, murder, and 10 year olds could still watch it. Gambling is a bit older stuff, kids at 13-14 or a bit higher could watch it and could actually get their hands on some money or even their parents money and end up gambling because their favorite streamer does, and thats very risky.",

Do you think backlash received from influencers is enough reason for Twitch to ban gambling streaming on their platform? I am skeptical that is the real reason, to me what it is really happening is that they are afraid they are going to get sued by the people that are losing money when they gamble, after all we have talked about this in the forum before and at least to me it seemed as if some or even the majority of those streaming about their gambling journeys were lying to their viewers by making it seem as if it was really easy to become profitable, something we know it is not possible in the majority of the gambling games.",

I think Twitch is starting some kind of weird crusade against gambling websites, but I was never really a fun of twitch anyway so I don't care about this.There are probably alternatives for Twitch maybe even blockchain based, but gambling websites could be affected by this cutting of promotional stream.Maybe DLive could be alternative for Twitch, it's blockchain based and used by gamers and gamblers, I think I saw Stake giveaways there.https://dlive.tv/",

Probably because streamers only care for the affiliate program to make money and not the content and probably that could be the reason for banning those gambling platforms there. I know it hurts anyone who relies on that platform, there are a lot of people who will get hurt especially those streamers, and also gambling casinos may reduce their target audience.",
