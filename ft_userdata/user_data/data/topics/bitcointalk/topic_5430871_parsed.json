Microsoft has shed roughly $700 billion in market cap. Meta’s market cap has contracted by over 70% from its highs, wiping out over $600 billion in value this year.In total, investors have lost roughly $7.4 trillion, based on the 12-month drop in the Nasdaq.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/25/techs-reality-check-how-the-industry-lost-7point4-trillion-in-one-year.htmlA case could be made for crypto currently outperforming stocks.I think most look exclusively at crypto's losses and do not realize stocks and other assets are losing value at a faster rate.If it wasn't for the FTX crash and the havoc it wreaked on the industry, bitcoin would 100% definitely be outperforming the stock market atm.",

      "body": "Cryptocurrency continues to spread rapidly in western societies and there are different opinions about the use of cryptocurrencies. However, as cryptocurrencies are used as payment methods and traded in financial markets, it is thought that they may become even more common in the future. On the other hand, due to the volatility and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, there are also concerns about their use. Therefore, there are different opinions about cryptocurrencies and uncertainties about how it will be used in the future. Currently, the dominant monetary system in the world is based on the dollar. The dollar prices almost everything. I think there is only one thing that will change the Bretton Woods system. Correct guess crypto!",

Most intelligent people put their money into the stock market, but they do it consistently with big companies that return them small and steady returns. They put more money in on a regular basis, week after week or month after month. They buy (sensibly) when the market is high and they buy when the market is low. Good companies will weather the storms that are recessions and depressions. Some companies out there pay out their profits in the form of dividends, those dividends have increased year after year for many decades in some cases - like getting a raise on your investment each year.",
