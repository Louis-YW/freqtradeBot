I personally do not support the idea of ATMs since they charge excessive fee which you can easily bypass by having a teeny tiny application in your mobile making very easy to withdraw the cash as well. Therefore if you have to exchange money i would advise you to use mobile applications most of them also have instant withdrawals which is extremely convenient.",

We don't even know if or when global economic recession will happen, nor how big it will be and what will be the effects on bitcoin ATMs.What I know is that Bitcoin ATMs tend to have a bit big fees and the KYC laws will - sooner or later - affect them all. For now the big premium may be OK because of anonymity. Later.. no use.Back to recession: in such cases many liquidate all the investments, including bitcoin. So an even worse crypto winter may happen. In such moments the extra fees do hurt. So the impact may be negative. But again, we don't know, it's just cheap speculation.",

I do not see any connection or impact of recession to usage of Bitcoin ATMs. It will have an impact on bitcoin but then, do you really need an ATM specifically just for bitcoin/crypto? If ever, there are tons of mobile apps that you can use to service your needs in any crypto transactions. And its ease of use, availability and portability surpasses any ATMs.",

      "body": "I think the major downside, and what has been the major reason why the ATMs are not that frequently used, and still, the usage won't grow as much as we expect in the future is due to its usage fees, which I believe are currently expensive, Bitcoin ATMs are still very few, and as such, there is no competition amongst them, the ATM owners will need money to keep maintaining the ATMs, as for this reason, will charge a certain amount of fees which might not be cheap for many users, most especially, the bitcoin small players.So this is why I believe the usage of Bitcoin ATMs have not skyrocketed, and won't Skyrocket as much as we will expect, except centralized exchanges adopt the idea, this I would explain in a thread am creating on this topic.",

The number of such devices is also quite good in some EU countries, where Spain is at the top with 212, followed by countries such as Poland, Austria, Romania and Italy. The fact that Portugal has only 6 such devices surprised me, considering that country is often mentioned as one of the most desirable when it comes to cryptocurrencies - but it seems that this is not a decisive factor affecting the interest in this type of service.Inflation and recession may slow down the number of newly installed devices, but unless some anti-crypto law appears in the US and Canada, I don't see their number decreasing in the future.",

Instead a small routing fee is paid to route the payment thru the Lightning Network until it reaches the recipient. To send Lightning payments is much cheaper, typically less than a single cent.At this moment it is only useful in hotels, airports,malls, and hospitals.Read about LN ATMs: https://www.bullfrag.com/this-bitcoin-atm-supports-lightning-and-you-can-put-it-together-yourself/",

That’s the problem, sure there could be some increase because people like to use crypto and it’s a growing industry right now, but bitcoin ATM is not the biggest part of it, it’s really not needed. We have exchanges that we could move our money from banks to exchanges and then exchanges to banks, then we could use banks for that. I believe that we should not be expecting this deal to go higher too much, it’s going to be something serious, but for a while, then it will go lower and lower and lower. This is why we can't expect too much from them, it’s going to be like 1-2k max amounts all around the world for how little people like it.",

It sounds to me that in the USA they all require identification, as is increasingly happening in Europe, and I do not understand how people use it because of the above, unless they are people who see the machine and buy Bitcoin like someone who buys a lottery ticket.",

Am I remembering this wrong? Maybe that’s the reason.I don’t like ATM’s too. They charge huge fees but they do this for a reason. Even though you can’t hack a bitcoin address, you can steal the physical banknotes inside the ATM and this happens from time to time. They simply charge you higher because of the risk they bear.  In the end it is the consumer that pays for the stolen money from the ATM’s.",

We don't know if the global recession would ever happen and if it will really occur, the impact will vary from one place to another. So, saying the number of bitcoin ATM will increase or decrease will be futile because there's also nothing to back up such claims. Increase of usage of bitcoin ATMs could possess various reasons. Perhaps the fees might be a little lower compared to exchangers in some areas or maybe it is convenient for them. While there is a reason for people to use it, they definitely will. Although here in our country, I hardly hear there is one nor ever seen one on my own eyes. Lucky for those areas that have numerous bitcoin ATMs to cater them because it's a great alternative if you don't want or there's no available exchanger.",

This can go even higher with an increase in the volume of transactions.  Source :  Profits  So there are ways by which they are making huge profits but users are facing many difficulties so it's better to find some other ways like localbitcoins or P2P ways to buy/sell your coins with less fees.",
