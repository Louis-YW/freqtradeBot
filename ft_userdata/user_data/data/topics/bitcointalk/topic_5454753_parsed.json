  "content": "In this post I will explain how adding certain factors to our culture can improve our country's economy. Same important factor to consider is the lack of awareness and education both technical and fundamental.First point: Financial EducationMaking moneyMoney managementGrowing moneyThere is a problem in the ecosystem or culture in Asian countries where children are taught to save their money while in European countries children are taught how to invest their money. This creates a complete culture shock.For instance in our culture people tend to save their money by depositing it in fixed deposits (FD) where it will grow slowly over 10 years. Still if we educate people about investing in crypto trading or the stock market they can aim for higher returns in a month three months, or even a year. This change in culture will have a significant impact.It's  important to note that the problem is not stress but rather mental health. People lack awareness and are afraid of taking risks which leads to the perception of stress. Stress occurs when people blindly follow tips or calls for trading which sets a fear in their minds making them believe that trading should be avoided altogether.To tackle this issue we need to focus on the fundamentals of trading. Fundamental analysisinvolves assessing various factors such as the company ManagementEnvironmentmarketTeamLeadership Additionally,  Technical analysis which uses ChartsGraphs  Technical analysis has become superior to fundamental analysis. Companies that were once prominent may no longer hold their value in the market.  For example Tesla which is only 10 years old has surpassed the value of  Ford, a company that has been around for 100 years. This shift in dynamics has made technical analysis a full-time profession.Though anyone can perform technical analysis regardless of their profession. Whether you're a doctor, engineer, businessperson, or housewife, anyone can learn technical analysis. Trading involves  Two concepts:  fire and grid. If the market is going up, grid comes into play and if it's going down fire comes into play. Technical analysis helps in understanding these concepts but it's important to remember that trading is heavily influenced by psychology.  Success in any endeavor is 80% psychology and 20% skills.Emotional control is crucial as excessive emotions can lower your intelligence. Technical analysis helps systematize the entire trading process, reducing emotional influences.NoteThese were the analysis points and factors that we can add to our culture to improve our economy. Please let me know if there are any mistakes or if you would like to add any ideas or analysis to it.",

The enhancement of education and training is the core issue. In order to develop the economy, it is necessary to have skilled and skilled human resources to meet the needs of the market. Education and training is one of the effective ways to meet this need and will help improve the culture. Then I want to look at the potential problems of existing countries, such as environmental issues, natural resources, etc. to be able to build development directions according to the strengths of each country family. These ideas can help improve a nation's economy through culture or ecology. However, to be successful, coordination between stakeholders and long-term commitment is required.",

However, it is important to note the ways in which collective culture is formed, since any people necessarily consists of different components that are combined by the culture that has been formed over generations. Religious culture, the mode of production, the extent to which art is affected, and many other elements (it is difficult to enumerate) that constitute the collective agitation of any society. It is noted that the possibility of change is never easy in those cultural elements because change takes a long time to take place.Establishing legislation to change the collective culture can only be done through the education sector in the early stages of study, which will also take a long time, since coaches must be trained before activating these legislations.",

In some cultures, people prioritize saving money, while in others, they focus on investing. Promoting a balanced approach can have a positive impact. It's crucial to provide education about investing in areas like the stock market and crypto trading, but also emphasize the risks involved. Understanding both fundamental and technical analysis is valuable, as they serve different purposes in investment decision-making. Emotional control is essential in trading, and it can be developed through education and practice. Overall, a comprehensive approach that considers cultural differences, risk management, and psychological factors is necessary for economic improvement.",

As for what is related to your discussion, this is more about how to survive and balance it with the global market economy. Meanwhile, the cultural fabric of each country is still much smaller than the culture as a whole. Placement of sentences that are more in line with the habits of certain individuals or groups.Every country has life principles or habits that are in accordance with their respective customs. In Europe, maybe the culture of managing finances can invest in big companies, with various environmental influences. Meanwhile, in Asia, most of them tend to focus on growth because as a developing country, their educational goals will be different from those of developed countries.So it will be very difficult if it has to be equated with a principle that only applies in one particular country but is not necessarily suitable for implementation in other countries.",

This creates a complete culture shock.Well, about that, right from the primary level in school, pupils are taught \"Home Economics,\" where they learn about  financial management, home management, office, and many other important things that can help in their lives to creat an impact in the society they found themselves in the future. Also, I know there was this class I had in my primary school, which I don't usually forget. The topic was \"budgeting,\" which entails the importance of budgeting and many things about budgeting. It always tips me in mind any time I get stranded about money that budgeting is what can only save my ass. Also at the secondary level, students learned about \"economics.\" Still, there was a lot of life-helpful education in those subjects that were taught then. Teaching us those subjects then was really not for formality's sake or for some unjust purpose, but for the purpose of growing our future as well. But people learn and take it for a joke; some learn and don't practice, rather feeling less concerned. According to the philosophy of life, \"a lot of the problems man is facing are caused by himself.\" I know that most people in society were not able to go to a university, so I can say they did not learn most of those things, but there was enough knowledge gotten from primary and secondary levels in school, just that some people think it was not necessarily. In some situations, only one can help himself or herself.",

Like what I've always been seeing from these literate people in finances, it's not how much you're earning but it's how much you're saving. On the other hand, it's also how much you're able to take risk and how much you're able to invest.

Please let me know if there are any mistakes or if you would like to add any ideas or analysis to it.Some of your points are valid, especially in teaching people about investing and not just saving. This investment education is very important because of the high inflation rate that has led to a consistent decrease in the value of most currencies. Money kept in the bank will gradually lose value and become worthless. But I want to state that everybody must not be a crypto or forex trader to succeed. Students should be taught financial education so that they can be able to manage their income and if possible invest it in some profitable areas. Some might want to start up a business, while others may decide to invest in real estate and some might have an interest in the crypto space. Let everyone have the opportunity of choosing the investment platform he has an interest in.You also mentioned that people can make money from the crypto industry in three months. This is possible but making such an assertion can make people see the crypto space as a get-rich-quick industry which might propel them to invest in shitcoins and other scam schemes. People need to be given a balanced cryptocurrency education and not just about telling them to invest and make money immediately. The pros and cons of investing in the sector should be discussed and people should be given a chance to decide if they are interested or not.",

But at any given moment you have to be able to generate money so you can buy other assets that are unlikely to lose their value and will always have value in society. And in this case I will also give a few examples for assets that may not lose value in the future, those assets are land that is located close enough to an environment where there are more people living there to live a decent life, as well as gold which is still a precious metal in the eyes of the public so that the demand for it is still there and does not decrease every year.
