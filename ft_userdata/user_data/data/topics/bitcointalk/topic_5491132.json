Thank you for replying. Only a few people have financially supported my work. I have made the 2008 to 2016 period freely available for the community in order for some to gain an insight into what the complete book will look like. The Bitcoin community has become more selfish, unfortunately, over the last several years. I hope some prove me wrong, and support great projects in the community. Life is about making things a reality.I have 5-6 months to complete the book.",
