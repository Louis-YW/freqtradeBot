  "content": "Yesterday was my first time with such a big multiplier and is hard to explain how good it feels.The bad part of the story is that it takes 20,632 bets. The good part is that I was incrementing the bet so when it comes I made some profit.I found a way to roll bets really fast, between 6 and 7 bets/second, that's how this multiplier was possible with the right patience.-----------------UPDATE x99,000---------------------Today I get the x99,000 Multiplier.https://just-dice.com/roll/5542558435I take 100 clams to roll with 0.001 bets... after 50815 bets I hit the x99,0000 ending with something close to 150 clams in the balance, I stop after that.It was just for the record, maybe someday I will go for the x990,000 just because the site allows it",

I never know what CLAM it is, are you playing with this CLAM? If true, unfortunatelly, their market only at Yobit and FreiExchange, and no volume there. are you sure CLAM is exchangeable?",

      "body": "Making over 20,000 bets does require a lot of money honestly, I do not think that I would be able to bet or invest that much money not knowing the outcome. Isn't it like hit and trial method in mathematics and making 6-7 bets per second would need a good strong bot as well, it's not humanely possible, but then again if it stays true in the future as well you can make awful lot of profit. Then again you should more or so play for the experience but what are the odds of finding a new way to earn some extra bucks, congratulations, do share your initial bet amount and the profit you made in USD, ofc if you are comfortable with it ! Am sure people would wanna know. P.S searched a bit apparently 1 CLAM is 0.5$ therefore even then the profit was good considering the initial wagering amount wasn't much. To be honest I didn't hear about the clam crypto before your post.",

But here is the link https://freebitcoins.com/xchange/market/Clamcoin, this one is the fast one and with instant withdrawals.I'm 100% sure Clam is exchangeable mate, and that's why I like to gamble with it.Quote from: fiulpro on June 29, 2022, 04:41:28 PM--Isn't it like hit and trial method in mathematics and making 6-7 bets per second would need a good strong bot as well, it's not humanely possible, but then again if it stays true in the future as well you can make awful lot of profit. I started with 30 clams/10,000 bets, then 100 clams for the next 10,000 bets. and after those 20,000 bets I double up to 200 clams / 10,000. But the shot came in the next 632 bets, I had the luck to get the win after double up. and for the 6-7 bets per second, just look and that timestamp",

Do you mind going in to a little more detail about all of this? If I’m understanding this at least a little, no, I’ve never had a 10,000 x bet pay off, I sure wish lol. I’m also a bit confused by what you mean in regards to 20,632 bets. Also I’ve heard of clams in regards to coins before, but can you expand on that too please?",

This is quite interesting but it should be simulate multiple times and see if you can hit the x10000 multiplier while you are still in profit. This kind of strategy surely requires a huge bank roll but since you are using clam, You can use small unit per bet.Good thing you are here i'm really bad at math and understanding with numbers lol. And yeah, this kind of strategy is so risky and needs a huge capital to execute this number of bets and claim huge profit in the end This might be one of the reasons why gamblers get addictive coz of fun winning from such probability while some are unfortunate and get rekt.",

I'm sure it's not just a matter of profit, you are willing to make bets like that, because if play chance 00.00.99 it it's very risky. Using the auto/bot method is also less likely to profit, seeing screenshots its familiar as the Jxxt-Dice platform if I'm not mistaken. By the way, congratulations on your victory, but not everyone can do it because it requires a fast internet connection too.",

I haven't tried winning on that kind of level or even tried thinking about doing it honestly. x500 is my best multiplier win as far as I remember and I'm pretty nervous that time since I'm manual betting. I'm sure that the experience you get is pretty good even though its an automatic bet. Seeing the data's, your technique is somehow profitable. I hope someone came from this thread do this challenge.

Coupled with I would guess lower minimum wager.If you could find a sports betting platform with a lower minimum bet. It would be possible to make accumulator bets on every possible outcome, of a combination of sporting events. Which would be consistently profitable.20,000 wagers to hit a single 10,000x are interesting stats. If those numbers remained consistent. It could be possible to make 19,000 wagers at low amounts. Then increase the last 1,000 wagers to a higher bet amount to turn it into a profitable ratio.",

For those who are not aware of that Clam-based gambling site, it was one of the popular dice sites before, even much early I think before the famous Directbet.eu, Nitrogensports.eu, and Cloudbet.com. There's also an investment part where users can put their Clams in the site's bankroll.Back to topic, never in my entire dice game experience or slots to hit that kind of multipliers. Regardless of the amount involved, it's so rare to hit that multiplier.Because of this post, I remember having a bankroll investment on that site way back several years ago.
