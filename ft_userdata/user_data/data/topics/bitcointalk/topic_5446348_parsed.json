  "content": "Elon Musk has been in various complications since purchasing the popular social media Twitter. After purchasing the social media he imposed various restrictions on the intention of the users. Since becoming the owner of Twitter, by eliminating employer he tried to reduce the company's costs. No one including the users could accept his various thoughts regarding on twitter. As a result, today he has to announce the sale of his Twitter at half of the buy price. $44 billion Twitter is now $20 billion. Elon Musk has made such an offer to sell shares to Twitter employees.Elon Musk cofounded and his four popular companies are Electric car maker Tesla, Rocket producer SpaceX, Tunneling startup Boring Company andTwitterHe may be a big businessman but nothing can be imposed ignoring the sentiments of common people. Since Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter, 14 of the 30 companies that have served as advertisers they have stopped promoting in twitter. Naturally, Twitter's revenue has declined and is likely to further decline in the coming days.Although he is financially one of the richest businessmen in the world, it is also worth noting that the share prices of his other companies could fall through losses on his Twitter purchase. In my opinion his main mistake was disregarding public sentiment. What is your concern?",

I think it's a good call to buy twitter since many traders and investor are active at twitter. Its like when he mentioned the dogecoin and it pumped so hard. He could easily make calls for him to decide to manipulate the market and values. And it's true that maybe his other companies could get affected by his decisions still it will be the reason of the rise of other companies.",

However, his frequent use of Twitter to make controversial news and his decision to acquire Twitter could devalue the shares of his other companies. This can make investors and the public worried about the future of those companies.Elon Musk's failure to properly appreciate the impact of his actions and words on the public and the market. Disregard for public sentiment can lead to a loss of investor and customer confidence, damaging the reputation and value of his companies.",

Well, the Twitter purchase has put him on the wrong note, even the Tesla shares dropped so significantly. You see, if someone is touching almost everything and such things become successful, they see themselves as one demigod.But not in all cases, social media is a different space entirely, especially when you are doing things that are anti-social media itself. He thought he can monetize everything better, but it boomerangs.",

I could clearly remember when the sale of Twitter was like the only trending news since it was being purchased by business tycoon and dogecoin crusader, Elon Musk but now, I've kinda forgotten he purchased the app, hehe.  Also, according to  companies market Cap , it's being ranked 399th amomgst valuable companies and price value dropped to $41.09bn. Let's just say his magical flair for saving businesses didn't hit Twitter right.",

Also, this is a fact is not every business does its best in profit-making. Also, I am a little bit confused about how you are calculating the Twitter capital value because I can't see any changes in the share price there are minor drops and the capital value is also $41B+.",

Well, no doubt that he's a great businessman but sometimes we don't see where he is coming from and his visions. If it's for real that he's trying to sell the entire holdings he's got for Twitter for less than the amount he's paid for it, maybe that's his way of admitting that he's tired of this company. But as a businessman, I don't think that he's doing that just to cut loss and before purchasing it, he has thought of it a hundred times. That's why if he ever says that he's willing to sell all of it, I doubt it. He even said that he's willing to step down as CEO but did he?",

His problems started when he sack those staff and i believe they are the bed rock of twitter and they knows how to manage it properly unlike those he employed now coupled with those restrictions he sets to limits people. As for me I never thought he could so such a thing without him sourcing to know the secret behind twitter before sacking any of the workers.You can't used the knowledge of a banker to go become a Doctor talk less of wanting to carry out a surgical operation without enrolling back to studying those things over the years before implementing new rules.",

I second your observation.  From the graph, it looks like Twitter revenue is still uptrending, the graph shows not a decline but a slowing down of profit growth.  It is due to the reached audiences.  Since the majority of the population had been reached in its earlier years and the competition got tighter in the recent year, the revenue growth somehow slows down. Or some done deals that haven't been renewed or replaced yet.  That flow is normal especially when Twitter already reached its peak the trend will surely slow down.Those company that stops promoting on Twitter will surely be replaced by other company.  I still think twitter's influence and marketing power is still on its peak.  These companies that stop promoting on Twitter are probably fueled by some propaganda or their contract is finished.Quote from: coupable on March 26, 2023, 09:09:07 PMQuote from: bitmover on March 26, 2023, 11:43:04 AMQuote from: Rabata on March 26, 2023, 10:00:35 AMAlthough he is financially one of the richest businessmen in the world, it is also worth noting that the share prices of his other companies could fall through losses on his Twitter purchase.
