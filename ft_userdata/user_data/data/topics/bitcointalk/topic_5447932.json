There is a lag between your merit stat on your profile page and your merit history page (for received and sent merit history).The first place (profile page) usually has a lag of seconds or up to 1 minute to update. I am sure it won't take up to 10 minutes to update.The second place (merit history page) is updated nearly instantly.",

In my case it only took 1-2 minutes, no more.But what's the point of paying attention to this one after you've send merit to someone?

You shouldn't worry your self about sure things, I'm pretty sure you you have other more important things to worry about than the merit stats taking more time to update. As long as the user recipient of the merit will receive it then it does not really matter even if takes up to a day to update.",

In my experience, Mozila is slightly heavier than Crhome.My guess is the same as OmegaStarScream. You see a list of sending, not a list of receiving merit, the account you sent merit.Take a look at my process of sending it to OmegaStarScream.The process runs as usual and doesn't take more than 10 minutes.",

(a kids thought just experimenting)LOL, you don't need confirmation time to receive merit and send it. Maybe because the browser cache or something else can still slow down the process of accumulating in calculation. Ignore and simply ignore, done.Now close your thread and look for something else interesting. This is not bug.",
