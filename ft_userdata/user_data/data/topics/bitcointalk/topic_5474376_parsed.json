Could mean limiting what the AI developers can do or asking them to follow certain rules, which I think is ok as long as the rules prevent them from developing things that can be harmful to people/society.One of the worst things you can give an AI is freewill with no boundaries/rules and effective kill-switch if it crosses the boundary or goes rogue. So, I think they need to figure out how to solve this.",

But my point is - there is no they.   It's an absolute certainty that some agency is working on AI privately.   Unless every single group working on AI is working together, restricting a group means they will lose the race.For example, China has agreed to restrictions.  If China suddenly announces they have a working AGI system, they will not need to fear political backlash. They won't need to fear anything anymore, except for the AI.I appreciate the response; I don't think this is proper audience for this type of discussion.",

The use of AI is a welcome development but abusive use of it might be the reason for such action. According to research AI has a high risk to human because the know nothing about founda mental human rights. And leave a lawless life and can be a threat to human. They has no human intelligence but act according to human command and can become a hazard in some context. Emagine some weeks ago I was watching a video on Facebook where a packaging industrial robot mistakenly crushed a human being while packaging things. Since it doesn't feel like human if not it would have noticed that it's crunching on human. Sometimes if a virus attacks a robot it can malfunction and be disastrous to human. So AI poss as a threat to human race.",

While China is a surveillance state and may censor to keep Western influences from its citizens, the U.S. might need to restrict content to prevent illegal activities that could cause harm. (also all other countries should make sure of it). In the EU, it is a double - edged sword, the DMCA, if not carefully implemented, could quickly slide into censorship,since it could restrict legitimate expression under the guise of copyright protection and hate speech.
