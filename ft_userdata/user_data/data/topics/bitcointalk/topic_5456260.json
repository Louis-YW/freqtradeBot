Quote from: https://www.gcash.com/services/gcrypto/learning-hub/how-to-set-up-and-fund-your-metamask-and-phantom-wallet-using-gcryptoGCash has just launched a new feature allowing GCash users to buy, sell, and store crypto using their GCash account. Powered by Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX), GCrypto now allows users to create a separate wallet for buying and selling cryptocurrencies in just a few clicks.Good thing our country is crypto-friendly not like other countries.",

      "body": "There are actually a number of licensed Bitcoin-related platforms in the country. I remember I used to have an account on BuyBitcoin.ph. There was another one I cannot recall anymore. Those where the good old days when Coins.ph and Abra were the main players. Today, there are many of them. The mainstream GCash and PayMaya already integrated crypto on their platforms. Pouch and Strike are also here offering Lightning payments. There is also a new platform here which offers OTC crypto transactions. My bad, I also cannot remember the name. But they have numerous partners all over the country. Banks are also gradually opening their doors. Overall, it seems we're doing good.

It could mean that there is a market significant enough to be exploited, worth risking for, despite the challenges. I'm not necessarily speaking of my country, though.QuoteThe real measure and people's acceptance of bitcoin as a currency in buying and selling commodities is to consider it an acceptable financial intermediary where you can buy several things in your country without the need to convert bitcoin to cash or there is an option to pay in bitcoin.On this basis, the growth is at least considerable. As a matter of fact, there is an ongoing effort to continue building what is named as the Bitcoin Island. It's an effort to drive the adoption of Bitcoin as a currency. So far, the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin, even through the Lightning network, is growing.",

I won't be surprised if some of us do pay with crypto for services like game currency top-ups or something similar. Personally, I don't think it will change soon but it is good enough for me. There are dozens of exchanges and events about crypto, which is quite healthy. There was an event started by the government just a few months ago iirc that discussed about crypto regulation in the near future. I can definitely see this as a friendly gesture, but who knows if things will change in the near future.I guess popular business like Indodax, Pintu, or Tokocrypto is the one with the biggest presence in the local market due to either being early, doing a ton of marketing, or getting an investment from big players like Binance, and so on.",

There's no way he can registered the site because it's against the law.I'm a bit curious about your country's crypto stand. It has banned Bitcoin. It was more or less a blanket ban, right? It doesn't only cover banks and other financial institutions, it includes all businesses. And not only businesses, it even also includes individuals. So Bitcoin transactions are prohibited for everyone. The government even threated jail time to offenders to show how strict they are.And yet Bitcoin can be accessed easily. I even heard of businesses like a coffee shop and a clothing store accepting Bitcoin payments. And here you are also saying a friend is operating a crypto platform. I wonder whether the ban was merely pure talk and there was really no effort to crack down on violators.",

And here you are also saying a friend is operating a crypto platform. I wonder whether the ban was merely pure talk and there was really no effort to crack down on violators. You have heard it wrong. There's no businesses like coffee shop or clothing store accepts Bitcoin. There's no way anyone can accept Bitcoin here legally. You may have heard about \"Bitcoin Cafe\"  It's just a name of a restaurant, nothing else. They don't accept Bitcoin. I have visited the restaurant and offered them to pay with Bitcoin. They didn't take my word seriously. Simply said they don't accept Bitcoin with a smile lol. To be honest, I was prepared to pay with Bitcoin there, no matter what. I had my mobile Electrum wallet and there was enough Bitcoin to cover my bill.Bitcoin is still illegal here. Nothing has changed. Govt is monitoring even more closely than previous. It is expected that a huge amount of remittance is coming through cryptocurrency which is a big loss for the Govt. That's why they are being serious. A few days ago, Bangladesh Bank have stated that any kind of involvement in cryptocurrency is illegal including trading, promoting etc. But the previous statement was a bit different. It was something like pointing to crime. But now, everything is in restrictions and has become more strict.Regarding my friend's website- well, there's nothing wrong in running a crypto blog. The website is focusing on publishing guidelines, tutorial, informative article and cryptocurrency news is a bonus there although the focus was/is to build a cryptocurrency news site. I don't think there's anything wrong with the blog. Learning about technology isn't bad of course.",

I think the risk is related to bankruptcy and so on. If you use oversea service then it might take more effort to judge them accountable if they fuck something up. But even if you use your local exchange, it doesn't really remove the effort needed to ensure you get your money back when something happens. CMIIW.Does this mean your government doesn't limit access to oversea business? My country used to be like that, but they started blocking domains from exchanges and other services if they didn't register locally. Some people use DNS or VPN to bypass that, but it adds another risk of being banned.",
