Personally, this picture has given me a good advice OP. It's fun to see and read such promotion material as a bitcoin investor.",

Especially if they are actively investing their money.You go on Bloomberg or cnbc and you can see the crypto prices on there. It’s always on the news, especially if something bad happens. The Ftx scandal gave it almost daily news reports.Back in 2013 was different. Back then nobody knew what it was.

If this kind of sticker is produced and posted in public places like school hallway, train-stations, airports, supermarkets and other places where there are usually a lot of people or where people go through, It will be very effective to make people be interested in bitcoin especially when made with a very attractive design.",

Even though it's considered littering, somebody took a shot and still put it on some walls or poles.Found a striped paper with basically exactly the same about 5 years ago, just saying \"by bitcoin, if you want to know how, call me\" in Japanese with a phone number.And some stripes wer gone on the one paper.",

As the lic seems to be a type of meme and if you wanted more pics like the one you have posted you should run the query of btc meme + any cartoon you want in it. If there is any will be shown otherwise not. I hope that's what you are talking about. Because flayer is another thing and it has nothing to do with the pic you just shared. If you talking about pics in which such statements are written then you should search for funny BTC quotes or statements. I hope you will find something helpful. If still not, then please try to elaborate it a little bit more.",

What do you mean innovative bro this kind of advertisement has been up and running way before I was alive, there's nothing innovative about this. The only thing remotely innovative about this whole stuff is that they outrightly said bitcoin instead of beating around the bush.",

The one thing I noticed about this  is that it arouses one ability to being curious about something. In this case we are talking about Bitcoin and Bitcoin is a new technology which is still gaining attraction. If one sees the flyer and reading it, one would be curious to ask around or quietly do their due diligence to learn more about Bitcoin.I think this would work in some places not everywhere. Like in my country, this type doesn't work here. They would think it is misleading and try their possible best to avoid such.",
