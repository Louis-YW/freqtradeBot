  "content": "QuoteMore than half of all residents in the Big Tech hub of Silicon Valley are planning to ditch the region due to spiraling costs and quality-of-life issues, according to the results of a poll released this week.A whopping 64% of residents in Silicon Valley, home to corporate heavyweights such as Google, Meta and Apple, say they are concerned the region is on the wrong track, according to the 2022 Silicon Valley poll conducted by Joint Venture and the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies.Meanwhile, 56% of respondents said they were likely to move out of the Bay Area “in the next few years.” The figure is even higher for working-age residents, with 59% of adults aged 18 to 64 indicating they were likely to seek greener pastures.Among individuals who plan to leave, 67% cited housing costs, while 47% pointed to a falling quality of life and 43% were sick of the area’s high taxes.“There’s a mood out there – the mood is gloomy. The mood is darkening,” Russell Hancock, the CEO of Joint Venture and president of the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies, said during a briefing on the poll’s findings.“The folks that are working in Silicon Valley think that despite their work, the overall region is losing ground,” Hancock added.The poll results surfaced during a period in which several prominent businesses, including some based in the Bay Area, have opted to leave California for other states. Firms that have relocated include Tesla, Oracle, Hewlett Packard and Charles Schwab.Silicon Valley’s high cost of housing was a top concern for residents, with 76% of respondents identifying steep rent and home costs as an “extremely serious problem.”Other “extremely serious problems” flagged by locals included cost of living, with 72% of respondents using that description, homelessness at 71% and the region’s propensity for droughts at 58%.Taking into account all factors, 36% of Silicon Valley dwellers who responded to the poll said the Bay Area’s quality of life has gotten worse over the last five years.https://nypost.com/2022/10/05/more-than-half-of-silicon-valley-residents-want-to-leave-the-mood-is-darkening/....This should be concerning to americans. Silicon Valley and its tech sector being backbones of the US economy. One central pillar supporting american freedom, rights and living standards would appear to be compromised. California by itself was rated the 5th largest economy in the world. If california's GDP is indeed shrinking and \"losing ground\" as some claim. It could represent a significant loss of american wealth.While this by itself wouldn't represent a death knell for the US economy. It is possible that silicon valley could relocate to another US state that is more friendly towards innovation and business. To an extent we may have witnessed this trend with Elon Musk choosing to build new tesla factories in texas, rather than california, as may have been the initial impulse for new tech start ups for many years.Its so strange to see some americans cheer on and support these trends. In the belief that it somehow won't affect them. If it does someday affect us, I hope people remember how confident they were to support everything that led to that eventuality.",

      "body": "I wonder if this is news because it's a problem for the bay area or if it's news because anyone who leaves california for other states likely makes the US more democratic (especially if they leave for somewhere like texas). I was reading earlier that 15 states have the same population as california but a lot more representation in the electoral college system (I assume it's 15x but I'm not certain).I think this is a good thing but I'm not sure where they'd move to. As long as they can be accommodated in another city then there's probably good reason for them to keep moving to let the US prosper better economically.California has about 1/7th of the US population too, relocating a lot of these people while keeping the economy as stable as possible will probably help the environment around them recover and for people to feel less condensed. For a place that's reported high homelessness rates, it's better than what Hong Kong have to put up with too. I doubt the people who've bought property in Silicon Valley will be happy to sell up for a lower cost too and they might reap the rewards of staying there after paying high taxes (that money will still be in the system to help with improvements).",

To an extent we may have witnessed this trend with Elon Musk choosing to build new tesla factories in texas, rather than california, as may have been the initial impulse for new tech start ups for many years.Although relocating from Silicon Valley to other favorable parts of the US might be quite challenging for most companies but if these strict government regulations and excessive increases in housing costs and taxes continue, companies would have no other option than to leave. From  reports , the most convenient part of the US they are targeting to move to is Austin Texas. According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, about 35 companies relocated to open new facilities in the Austin area in 2020 alone. Austin has lower taxes, an affordable cost of living, and wonderful weather. Florida also has the same qualities as Texas and some companies are also moving to the state.This movement has both negative and positive effects. The state of California would lose a major part of its income from tax if these companies leave, But it would also lead to a decrease in population and crime rate and lead to a cleaner environment. It could also lead to a transfer of knowledge, technology, and income to other parts of America. As long as these firms are not leaving the US, I think there is no much cause for alarm.",

CA can't really handle their debt anymore either, while Texas and Florida have a balanced economy.https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/debt-by-stateTexas and Florida have the least debt out of all states. And if I'm not mistaken, both states do not collect income taxes either. Lower tax burden than California, and it's safer.California will continually blame corporate greed for their horrid economic policy of high taxes and high regulations, and it'll drive even more companies out to relocate.",

I am wondering why this is happening opposite way since tech giants should be calling for bigger employment in the area and thus the city should keep growing at higher rates and thus should give larger areas to spread and develop. One more reason could be that Texas is calling High tech peeps as Elon Musk calls for mega employment drive. In addition to all, the cost of living needs to be brought down so that bigger families can sustain freely and live good life. May be Silicon Valley is slowly missing the charm of the same.",

Why burden your exployees with a high cost of living if they can have a better life elsewhere?I just looked around on Streetview in Silicon Valley, and I love the place! The weather is great, houses are big, lots of space and lots of nice coastal areas. But those overhead cables look poorer than Belgium, and real estate prices are terrible. If enough people leave the place, prices will drop again.

But I expected lower prices outside the cities. I often see comparisons with 50 years ago, when one salary was enough to buy a house in the US. Or everywhere in the West for that matter. How did we all move from affordable houses to expensive houses in 2 generations? I think that's a much bigger threat that leads to the destruction of middle class than a few large corporations that move to cheaper areas.",

One central pillar supporting american freedom, rights and living standards would appear to be compromised. Nah, I don't see this as anything all that serious.  After all, it's just a poll about how a bunch of people, who are most likely wealthy, feel about one relatively small area of California.  If the Silicon Valley region was so bad, real estate prices wouldn't be so high that these people would be complaining.And if it gets too lousy to live there and the corporations realize it's becoming a problem, I'd be willing to bet they'd start letting employees work from home.  You'd think in the tech industry it'd be relatively easy for workers to not have to commute or even live near the company they work for.I haven't seen what houses and apartments are going for in the San Jose area lately, but everything around there and in California in general is and always has been super, super expensive.  I've been to CA before, and I remember gas prices being so much higher than in my state, which has always had above-average gas prices.  I'd love to live there, but there's no way I could ever afford it.Edit:Quote from: Husires on October 08, 2022, 02:18:50 PMMonthly Rental Prices in Silicon Valley    1 bedroom flat (apartment) in City Centre: $2,200+    1 bedroom flat outside the City Centre: $1,800+    3 bedroom flat in City Centre: $3,362.50+    3 bedroom flat outside the City Centre: $2,900+Whoops!  I didn't read your post until after I'd written mine.  Wow!  I really wonder what kind of jobs those people have who rent the one bedroom apartments, either within or outside the city center.  They might be places to crash (like second-dwellings) for highly-paid tech employees, but I can't imagine all of them are.  That blows my mind it's that expensive to live in the SV area!",
