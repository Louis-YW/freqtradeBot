  "content": "You've got to hand it to State Senator of Wendy Rodgers, who introduced a few bills focusing on making BTC legal tender in Arizona, making BTC the same status of USD in the state and becoming accepted as a real currency. Wendy also introduced a bill to make crypto a tax-exempt property in the state. I'd say Senator Wendy is kicking ass! Salute Senator Wendy! She is really striving for growth and innovation for Arizona, which if she is successful could spread to all other states. Any thoughts on this?
