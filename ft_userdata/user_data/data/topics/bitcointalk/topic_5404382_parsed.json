  "content": "It doesn't matter what stage of development the Child in the womb is just as it doesn't matter if a 2 year old or adult Human should be considered more human or a living being. It's even more important to protect the human in its vulnerable and weak stage of life, and the worst is killing it deliberately at the stage it can't defend itself.The unborn children are innocent living humans who do not deserve to be killed no matter what. The CREATOR is highly displeased with those who murder the innocent.When faced with the challenge of whether to save the Mother or the child first, for whatever reason, the answer should be to first save the one who needs it most. Do not sacrifice one for the other unless with their consent. Let's put an end to Child Sacrifice aka Abortion",

If you would have gone to school you would have had some kind of teaching how a child is developed. A child is not from day one a final human that just sits there 9 month and just waits to come out of the women. It is for example at day one a sperm that would be as goos/bad to abort like it is good/bad to masturbate. So while it is bad to abort in the last weeks/month of pregnancy it is not the same as abortion at the beginning of pregnancy.",

That is GOD's power in action in this period of awakening of mankind. It's spreading because people are being given the last chance by our CREATOR to change their evil practices.Â I Pray HE will be merciful & give you too the last chance to apologize to HIM. You don't need to apologize to me.",
