If you are a newbie and wanted to stay long in crypto, at least better invest first on Bitcoin (BTC) and see how it goes.At least in my case, this is how I started, and when I gain some knowledge, that's where I started to venture and experiment on other projects and hypes at that time. But still pointed me though to have majority of my portfolio to BTC. As others would have said, you can never go wrong with purchasing your first Bitcoin.",

Kindly stay away from Bitcoin if you're looking for short-term again there is no two ways about it. But if you're looking for a friendly advice invest and hold Bitcoin or rather still learn how to trade. Trading will make you a lot of money not immediately but eventually you will.",

My recommendation is that they do as much hodl as possible, because the benefits later on will be great.",

I don't advice you what to do but if you are going in NFT game, at least study it a lot before going. I have been defending NFT markets but when someone asks a question like this i just know they are going to lose everything. I can't underline enough how much risk you are taking compared to mid level marketcap altcoins, or even low caps.There are some apps that can help you like:https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?tags=NFTshttps://app.traitsniper.com/But once again you would need to know how to use that for your leverage. Start by reading and joining communities, listening podcasts and leaders of the scene who are building.",

NFT based games have been a failure and NFT arts are not real art are now fake and plagiarized. The only place I see them is on established games but that won't carry a good monetary prospective.",

Lower price NFT was garbage NFT. NFT is not the same as token that can be pumped anytime. NFT has its price floor and it totally depends on the buyer's interest. The floor price may able be pumped but you can't expect your NFT can be sold instantly like when you were selling token in the exchange site. You will be so dumb if you were buying such low priced NFT. Low price NFT means its NFT has no demand in the market. that's why the price floor was also very low. think about that.",

There are some NFTs that is cheap but you can't guarantee if they are scam or legit, and I believe it is not based on the price of NFT if they are legit or scam.There are also some NFT that started with their floor price being high but later on, they dumped and became cheap, so it looks like some altcoins dumped.",

I reckon there are some rare instances where they would increase in price but that would be difficult to find, you'd probably be better off investing in altcoins or something. If you really really want to buy NFTs, make sure your reason is that it's you yourself want it maybe for personal enjoyment, or anything else really as long as its not as an investment. I reckon I'd buy NFTs if I were to see some really good ones tbh.",

I know why you invest in NFT because you want to increase your meager amount, but that is not the way for you to start investing or survive in this market. If you don't have too much money, work hard instead of daydreaming that you can make quick money investing in NFT.

In fact, people who have been in the crypto world for a long time are also currently avoiding NFTs as a place to invest. Before starting an investment, first, understand what you are going to invest in. Especially if you have a small budget. Don't make the mistake of choosing the wrong investment when you start your career in the crypto world.What I can suggest for now is to learn more about bitcoin and altcoins. After that, it might be better if you invest in a popular altcoin that still has a low price and fits the budget you have. it might be better than choosing NFT as an initial investment in the crypto world with a limited budget.",

So, if you want profits, probably the best thing to do is get in early and mint one rather than purchasing it on a secondary market like Opensea. Though that's just the tip of the iceberg for the things you have to be on the lookout when getting into NFTs.You can check out this blog about it: https://geekflare.com/nft-tracking-tools/https://geekflare.com/nfts-challenges-and-risks/",

It means the creator itself buys it for higher price and then re-sell for 50% discount. So, by creating a fake-hype, they are cashing out hence do not fall into them. For a beginner, I humbly like to suggest to invest only into bitcoin for the budget that you will never think about cashing out for next 10 to 20 years.When you are planning up for long term like 20 years, you can slowly go for DCA with monthly $50 or even lower to that but in the end, you will find yourself millionaire without any doubts. Keep patiently with highly reliable asset like bitcoin will definitely change your life for sure.",
