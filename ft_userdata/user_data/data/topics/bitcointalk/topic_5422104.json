You can check the balances here https://www.coinglass.com/Balance.We went from 2.1 million BTC all the way down to 1.9 million BTC.Until yesterday Binance was one of the biggest looser with over 80k BTC withdrawn over the last 30 days. Coinbase was ranked first, but also with massive loses. Nearly all exchanges lost huge amounts, fitting perfectly in the narrative of people withdrawing their bitcoin.But suddenly in the last 24 hours Binance added and incredible 92,000 Bitcoin to their exchange an amount never seen before on the exchange (according to coinglass, and if you check the last 12 months). I found very little info about that, and all nearly other exchanges are still getting their balance reduces.Do we have some info about that or any idea whats going on?",

For those that do understand it makes them look weak since they had to move all those coins to prove they did have the funds.It also makes them look incompetent since they should have been doing this all along when the mempool was empty and fees were low. Now it's costing them more and taking longer to do.-Dave",

We also are going towards this weekend which should reduce mempool a little bit more.In the past, spamming mempool and cause more expensive transaction fee on newbie users is one of ways to make they get panic.

Binance is by far the biggest here with more than 50% of total bitcoin volume. It is very likely that FTX clients moved to binance here in Brazil, and in other places as well.https://cointelegraph.com.br/news/binance-now-dominates-49-of-bitcoin-trading-in-brazil (this is old news, binance is bigger now)",

OR deposit btc to fiat exit/... just 1 event per month25m events per month(25m/4032)=6200 tx a block.. JUST FOR BINANCEdo you really think that bitcoin by looking at average TX a block for last few years(~2000) is actually scaled onchain to handle actually doing what it suppose to do EG not using exchanges as banks/custodians but converting and withdrawing to independent walletbit coin (the network not the crappy sub/side serves/network brand stealing) needs to scaletrying to remain in denial while thinking everything is ok because custodians and altnets take usage away to avoid congestion.. is not the solution",

In Indonesia, crypto users still strongly believe that Binance is one of the best exchanges compared to many local exchanges, this is a positive thing for Binance and the crypto economy in general.But people should realize that Binance is just an exchange that should not be a long term investment asset wallet. Use the exchange as is, and withdraw funds from it after we trade your assets. It's simple, but they have a choice whether to trust a centralized exchange like Binance or not. About the possibility of manipulation, and yes I think it's one of Binance's efforts to appear safe for its customers. But it seems a lot of people are starting to realize that.",

This is because these people don't know better than that, and by that I mean that they are not able to download and install a regular desktop/mobile wallet, and they probably don't even know that there is such a thing as a hardware wallet. Even those who would very much like to withdraw their funds (BTC) are often discouraged by the fact that CEX charges them expensive fees, which makes them live in the belief that BTC transactions are too expensive and should be done as rarely as possible.CEX are playing their dirty game because they know they can't keep liquidity any other way, and luckily for them there are millions who believe their stories.",

The people who got burnt on ftx probably got burnt on mt gox. I think in the next couple of months will be the battle of proof of reserves. I would not be surprised if the exchanges go into debt to buy more 'proof of reserves' and try to convince the people looking for another exchange coming from ftx to join their platform. If you have Binance that has $500,000 in reserves and Kraken that only has $300,000 in reserves (made up numbers as example) most people will see that and will go for the one that has more proof of funds and since they are looking for a exchange anyway it is good business to invest money into improving your proof of reserves even if it is only for a short time. This could lead to more exchanges fallen in the future if they have over invested trying to compete and do not get the return.",
