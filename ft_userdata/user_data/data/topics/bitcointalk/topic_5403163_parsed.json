Plz give your opinion.I will not possible but that maybe possible if you can be patience waiting for the next decade to see bitcoin to touch another ath again. Binance has no chance to go up if bitcoin is always going down like this time. I hope that if you can accept the fact that if we have started to enter to the long term journey of the bearish trend. Stock market, crypto and everything are going down right now. BNB is always possible to reach such rate after bitcoin already touched the highest rate again.",

And moreover, the general world economic situation is also very bleak. I think the $1000 round is not difficult, but it takes time for everything to recover and stabilize again. It will probably take a while. In the long run, be well prepared for a long-term plan with this market.",

Plz give your opinion.Well, what is soon? We have very likely a bear market now, bro! It's only possible when BTC goes towards 100k and Binance Coin will follow. A different question is if we really NEED Binance Coin? It's just a coin of a large exchange and some competitor coins are much more innovative from a technical perspective.",

Plz give your opinion.soon? means having a short definition of time and is in sight. Unfortunately, it didn't show up for BNB this year. If BNB had to force the price to $1000 then of course not to forget what this was based on when the bear market was just starting, then BNB opportunities would also be much deeper. At the time of writing, BNB is trading at $206 so it probably won't hit $1000 soon for whatever reason.",

But because of this unique relationship between BNB and Binance, it ties them together and when bad news happens, BNB will go down in terms of price. Take the recent SEC investigation on Binance for example. This bad news coming ahead of BTC's price fall so you see in cryptocurrency, more links isn't a good way to pump up.",

Plz give your opinion.IMO, yes that it will reach $1k but not to soon. You need to keep yourself patient while waiting for it because we're still in a bear market and notice how long it shall be there.No one can tell you if this is going to be a short bear market or we're about to see it end soon. Well, as the price of bitcoin goes up again which is a sign that the market is going up again. This could be a sign that we might see it up eventually but don't celebrate yet as we don't know if this is an actual recover or just another trap that will shake again the weak hands.",

Plz give your opinion.I think you definitely know how much BNB costs in today's market. Talking about the possibility of a BNB price of $1000 it's clearly still very possible, but at a price of $213 for BNB at the moment it feels like it requires a huge increase to reach the price of $1000 so that possibility will look very heavy for BNB although it can still happen gradually in the future.",

Plz give your opinion.What is this prediction based on? I see the general situation of the market. Everything is so bad and causing many people to panic. I don't think it will increase quickly again when the impetus for money flow into the market is not much. And now the price is around $200 to go up to $1000 having crossed the old ATH. That could happen in the future, but I think doubles is not the right period to think about that. It would rather be associated with long-term investment.",

We had a brutal fall and it will take years to fix this.What is worse is that inflation is still high and fed will keep rates high and it’s not good for the stock market. So crypto will follow and also fail to rally. We will top but not until things get better.",

Remember that if the fact we are in the bearish market that we didn't even know when and what will happen after the bearish trend end.

Plz give your opinion.Its possible but it might take longer than sooner. As of now the market is in bearish and the price of coins are moving downward. If you're patient and willing to wait even it takes long period then you can witness the price of BNB to reach $1k. But for now forget about that because the market is bloody, much better if you take this chance to buy so you have something to hold when the bearish market is over.",

Plz give your opinion.This is not possible and very unlikely to happen. Like many people, I see that the market is showing very bad signals and the price cannot rise as easily as it used to. And with BNB, I think it is also a top altcoin in the current market, but it will be difficult for it to grow rapidly during this period. And before talking about a new ATH, it is better to expect it to be able to revert to the old ATH.",

Plz give your opinion.It's not possible for me at the moment. BNB is also really cool at what it does and has the strongest community in this space, but as it stands, you are looking to achieve x5 returns to value. With the capitalization it has now, it's unlikely to happen quickly. Maybe I also think this will only be possible in the future when stability and recovery come back.
