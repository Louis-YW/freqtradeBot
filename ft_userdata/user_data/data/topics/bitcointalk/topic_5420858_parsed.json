  "content": "If within a world “identical” to the “original version” of your “birth”…Yet with “subtle”, “fabrications of information”, “discrepancies”… etc.How would you seek help to “Return” to your original world?What would you do, how would you react if the “police”, “authorities”, “organizations” of “the pseudo-fabricated world” simply “discredited you”, accused you of “mental disorder”, or attempted to “imprison”, “rehabilitate”, you until you were “broken mentally” or “psychologically conditioned” that what you know is “truth” is rejected in their “false world” that you are now trapped in and are only able to be “free” if you believe what you know to be their lie?Curious what would you do? Knowing that any “unlawful outburst” would definitely get you jailed… That any purpose of living is pointless due to the pointless existence itself…Oh and you were placed in false world with no money, no living expenses, and simply can not afford to live or find work?Plus the idea of finding work itself or communicating with anyone within said “false world” is basically you working. In a controlled surveillance system of which you can trust no one.What option left is there other than suicide?Seriously to all the “intellectuals” what is the solve to this problem?What are possible “positive focused” solutions when you live in an environment you know does not contain anyone you know any longer, and even their image and voices are just “falsified replications”?",

      "body": "You have to know what the Real World is like to be able to escape the false one. There is a strong possibility that the entity that controls the false world will implant people with false memories of the real world to deceive them further. I believe the only way to be free is to feed your mind only with the Word of the CREATOR of the real world. When you do this regularly and believe, you will be saved from your imprisonment in the false world.Real or false World is created by the information/things people consume and believe",
