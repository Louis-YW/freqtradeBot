Those people weh deh support sick Tinubu may all of their family members copy the character of Tinubu. As them see man weh deh obviously sick and dementia and them say na him them go vite for to rule them, may Tinubu bless them with his mental capacity.

Hey, mate, I think you are wrong to say everyone is choosing their tribe, because there are still a lot of people in the south-south and south-east who are fully supporting Tinubu. The Muslim religion happens to be more united in Nigeria than the Christians, which convinces me to believe that if all Christians are as united as Muslims and vote for the Pet Obi they so much desire, then the man may possibly win. If I were in Nigeria, I would vote for him because I see a lot of drama from the sick man Tinubu, who is so old and his leg are not even level on the ground. He reminds me of the former president of Zimbabwe (Robert Gabriel Mugabe). But honestly speaking, Tinubu is not the man for Nigeria, and yet not only the Hausas are in support of him; on the day of the election, the majority of his vote will still come from the south. If Tinubu succeeds in ruling Nigeria, then I wonder what the citizens will benefit from his government, but until then, I would not be too judgmental now. Because as it stands now, on the day of the election, I don't think you will see any Hausa men voting for Pet Obi, but why will the south vote for Tinubu?",

So in essence, what I am trying say is that we should monitor INEC very well before they would manipulate our votes and turn them to be void while they are all valid post.Talking of minding our words. Due to the much pressure and popularity of Obidient movement is cause a lot of threat to the opposite parties, which for me i would say you should desist from talking about politics rather have it in mind to whom you want to vote in, this season there are lot of threat and pressure. Vote wisely because your PVC your Power.",

Do we still want to continue the current state of the nation for the next 4 years, if yes or no it is up to you to decide.

This one na good advice, but I think say by now Nigerian youths don wise up pass that level, as we all don know wetting de do us.To some extent, these politicians have d same mindset, dem de deceive us wey no know anything, especially those once wey don rule before, I mean Atiku and Tinubu. Nothing wey dem go do wey we never know, unless if them decide to come with different strategy this time, because we know say all of them de together for the same party before, so make we wise up.Irrespective of the outcome of the Election make we try sha make d result no affect our unity because na d main issue be that.Them go gather for Abuja they enjoy and we will be left on one side fighting for them.
