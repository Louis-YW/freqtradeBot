  "content": "QuoteThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has pegged maximum over the counter (OTC) cash withdrawal per week for individuals at N100,000 and N500,000 for corporate organisations....The circular read: “Further to the launch of the redesigned Naira notes by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on Wednesday, November 23, 2022 and in line with the Cashless policy of the CBN, all deposit money banks (DMBs) and other financial institutions (OFls) are hereby directed to note and comply with the following:\"The maximum cash withdrawal over the counter (OTC) by individuals and corporate organizations per week shall henceforth be N100,000 and N500,OOO respectively. Withdrawals above these limits shall attract processing fees of 5% and 10%, respectively.“Third party cheques above N50,OOO shall not be eligible for payment over the counter, while extant limits of N10,000,000 on clearing cheques still subsist.”...The circular further stated that, the maximum cash withdrawal per week via Automated Teller Machine (ATM) shall be N100,000 subject to a maximum of N20,000 cash withdrawal per day.”Also “only denominations of N200 and below shall be loaded into the ATMs.”The maximum cash withdrawal via point of sale (POS) terminal shall be N20,000 daily, the circular further stated.The circular further stated that in “compelling circumstances, not exceeding once a month, where cash withdrawals above the prescribed limits is required for legitimate purposes, such cash withdrawals shall not exceed and for individuals and corporate organisations, respectively, and shall be subject to the referenced processing fees in (I) above, in addition to enhanced due diligence and further information requirements.”The central bank of Nigeria is changing up the entire system to try to boost the economy and the dwindling naira.I personally do not fancy the idea of limiting how much cash withdrawals one can make within certain periods of time and putting a low cap on that.This would adversely affect SMEs around the country and while it would push more people to exchange digitally through cashless means, it would have lots of negative sides How the policy would impact the economy and more importantly the citizens would be seen next month.",

I don't know, they seem to want to go for it very fast even faster than other countries with economies which are way more stable.is there any chance there is some deal between the Nigerian government and the company which is behind their banking technology to push their CBDC there for testing purposes?

But if this is a way for them to wean people away from using cash, then it might work. This update is really inconvenient as it is costly, so people will have to find ways. Many might indeed end up opting for cards or digital wallets, but this could also result into people deciding to keep their money away from the banks, because money in the banks could mean less, difficult, and costly access. So this could either be successful or like shooting oneself in the foot.",

Governments have controlled us for thousands of years, which is nothing new, and it's no surprise they want more. But it is a harsh truth that we will not be able to stop depending on them, but now we have the solution, and now we just need to limit our dependence on them, we will be fine.",

I get it there are a lot of downsides to this but let's also consider the upside which has always been reducing corruption, a functional cashless economy as most Nigerians would look towards doing cashless transactions in addition the value of the naira would increase.This policy has some benefits which include;1. Promote the use of online or internet banking platforms: Many people would now be forced to use alternative banking platforms instead of depending solely on cash transactions.2. Reduce to a large extent cash ransom payment to kidnappers: The strict process and cost of withdrawing cash might make payments of ransom through cash very difficult and cumbersome which might affect or limit this crime.3. Reduce the cost of maintaining the physical note: The cost of replacing mutilated money sometimes is very high but this policy would make society cashless thereby reducing the cost of maintaining the newly printed currency.4. Expose Nigerians to computer education: Some citizens are not willing to embrace technology because they have the physical fiat options but this new rule might force them to learn and embrace computer education.5. This policy could also serve as a good background for a gradual introduction of Bitcoin awareness programs by Bitcoin believers because Bitcoin is also not physical money. It would be easier to teach or introduce someone that have used online banking channels to Bitcoin than a person that has zero knowledge of internet banking.Some drawbacks are;1. These rules would affect mostly the masses because politicians are always given access to physical fiat to assist them in the electioneering processes. Also, most people would be able to afford the penalty to exceed the withdrawal limits.2. Most banking channels in Nigeria are not reliable. There are always issues with online banking ranging from network and power problems. The government has failed to address these issues before this directive.3. Most banks have poor security systems which make hacking of accounts very easy.4. The government has failed to tackle the issue of kidnapping and they want to make access to cash difficult. I have read about cases where top government officials pay ransom for the release of their relatives while other citizens are advised not to pay the ransom.5. This policy would have negative consequences in rural areas where most people are not well educated to use these online banking services. Also, most rural areas have no access to power or internet service.",

Withdrawals above these limits shall attract processing fees of 5% and 10%, respectively.“Third party cheques above N50,OOO shall not be eligible for payment over the counter, while extant limits of N10,000,000 on clearing cheques still subsist.”...The circular further stated that, the maximum cash withdrawal per week via Automated Teller Machine (ATM) shall be N100,000 subject to a maximum of N20,000 cash withdrawal per day.”Also “only denominations of N200 and below shall be loaded into the ATMs.”The maximum cash withdrawal via point of sale (POS) terminal shall be N20,000 daily, the circular further stated.The circular further stated that in “compelling circumstances, not exceeding once a month, where cash withdrawals above the prescribed limits is required for legitimate purposes, such cash withdrawals shall not exceed and for individuals and corporate organisations, respectively, and shall be subject to the referenced processing fees in (I) above, in addition to enhanced due diligence and further information requirements.”The central bank of Nigeria is changing up the entire system to try to boost the economy and the dwindling naira.I personally do not fancy the idea of limiting how much cash withdrawals one can make within certain periods of time and putting a low cap on that.This would adversely affect SMEs around the country and while it would push more people to exchange digitally through cashless means, it would have lots of negative sides How the policy would impact the economy and more importantly the citizens would be seen next month.I'm all for cashless policies, be it card, wire transfers and many more but I feel these policies they just made would not be favorable to the the ordinary people.This might even discourage people from putting their money in banks and other financial institutions. Going digital is a very good decision but there are ways to go about it. First, lets look at it from the businessman perspective. Most market women go to market with cash. SMEs mainly do cash and even the business owners that are technologically advanced have customers that are not. There are lots of businesses that involves the movement of cash daily. In as much as I do not like people moving around with cash, this would really hinder their business. There is a high level of illiteracy in Nigeria, hence high poverty rate. Most of these people don't even know how to carry out an online transaction. These people need to first be brought out ignorance an illiteracy so the can at least find a way to come out of poverty. This should be the goal. And what better way to this than informing and educating them.Another problem with this is the fact that the online platforms and card transactions of Nigeria is not in anyway reliable. It gets interrupted due to bad network from the network providers or the bank sometimes. Imagine making a huge transfer and it hangs (you've been debited but the account you're transferring to has not been credited). Worst still, this issue doesn't get fix urgently by the banks. They'll tell you \"we will get it revered in 7 working days\". The online banking sector of Nigeria is not trusted by the people. When some student want to pay their school fee they prefer going to the bank, not because they enjoy the stress of going to the bank but because its safer that way. They can easily pay their fees from their phone but they don't want any complication with bad network and the rest then you start hearing stories later.Now Politically:Look at the timing of the so called \"redesigned currency\" where they just changed the color of the currency. A redesigned naira will be in circulation from the !5th of December, 2022 and the old notes will not be accepted from 31st January, 2023. Just in time for their general elections. This strategy will make it difficult for the opposing party to have a lot of cash to push around for their election. Meanwhile, they have probably printed a lot of cash that they can use to buy voters.Now due to his new naira notes, the opposition parties will send their cash to bank accounts so they can get the new naira notes for their own buying of voters and that's where the new policy of not withdrawing more that 100k naira for individuals and 500k for corporation organizations comes in. This will make it difficult for opposition parties to have the right amount of money they need for the elections. In conclusion, ill say the government had no plans of Nigerians or the economy when they made this policy, its just another piece being moved on the chessboard to win the election.",
