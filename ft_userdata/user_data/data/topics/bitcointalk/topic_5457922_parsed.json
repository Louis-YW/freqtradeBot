Most cruise ships give and offer various activities to ensure that the trip is enjoyed by passengers onboard, and for gamblers, there could be a casino operating onboard. Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 28, 2023, 06:54:50 PMOperating Hours: Do cruise ship casinos operate 24/7 like their land-based counterparts?It is a cruise ship, and your journey starts from when you get onboard to when you get down from the ship, if Ship casino's will operate and be open 24/7 for gamblers (it will depend on the cruise ship), but if they operate 24/7, not every game will be available everytime of the day. Table games that require the presence of a casino worker may have a time in the day when it can be played. Games like slots that can be played on slot machine can be open 24/7 for gamblers to play on. Quote from: Davidvictorson on June 28, 2023, 06:54:50 PMGame Variety: Can I find the same range of games offered in land-based casinos on cruise ships?Because interests are different, there will be a range of games in these casino's to meet the interest of every gambler onboard.",

The reason why I didn't bet there is because I was busy with other things and I'm sad that I missed the chance because the cruise was very luxurious and I saw many gamblers in the casino already playing! I wish I had time for it. I think it would have been a good experience gambling at sea. The payout rates are kind of the same as land based casinos and I believe that most large/big cruise ships have a casino and there are probably rewards such as earning a free cruise at some point. That's what I know so far.",

They would probably work similar hours, or at least with a skeleton amount of staff overnight, because that's often when people hit them up after a nice evening of entertainment elsewhere on the ship. The payouts and buyins will cover a broad range but they tend to avoid anything that falls below a dollar on table games and would likely have the full range of slot games. In reality most land based casinos don't have a huge amount of variety, the slot machines can have many games built in though and it's easy to keep adding more.",

But i cannot be compared to land based since we can imagine the space and only the amount of people can a cruiseship casino can accomodate. So I think you can still find some of the games that you may see in land based casinos but about betting limits I don't have an idea to that.",

They did not have a 24h service there, but it was open during the day and most of the night. As far as I remember it was closed down late at night, maybe at 2 or 3 a.m. I had other better things to do at the time and I remember the bets were high. Basically all my pocket money would be enough for 1 or 2 bets. The casino wasn't big. It had a roulette and a card table that's what I remember, and the rest of it was slots. A ton of slot machines, basically 10 slots fore every other game. It was a cruise from on the South coast of Europe from Greece to France.",

I've seen a video of him touring around the ship and of course there's a place for gambling (I know it's a casino), it's not that much there are only a couple tables available for card games and majority are slot machines. So, i think it's not something really similar to a land base casino since a cruise ship offers a lot of amenities and gambling are most likely not the passengers priority, rather it's just something they put there if someone wants to have a little fun gambling. Though it's a luxury ship but I think people in there may not engage with massive bets compared to the land base casinos.",

The games are the same, the payouts are the same, although the number of machines and live tables will surely be lesser to take into account the operating cost of the said casino in the cruise ship. It will be a really unique experience though, but certainly not one that I'm looking to experience in the near future since land-based casinos are already providing the experience in gambling that I'm looking for.",

Paying the workers to abandon all they have on their hands and their cost of accommodation would also raise the cost of operation which has to be accounted for one way or the other.- Jay -",

Once a cruiseship does have those kind of venue then expect thatthis is something that it is really that huge one.Making out some assumptions and i dont know if this one would really be that accurate but with some common sense then its not had to answer up these questions.1. 24/7? Possible because passengers could really be that awake on certain period of time and might be playing on a casino, staffs would really be having those shifts.2. Payout? For sure it would really be just the same, because if theres some increase then it might be a bonus, neither of the two.3. Similar or not, most of the time it would be always identical4.

Grand voyages are more possible to have one, though I still have no experience about the cruise ship but you can easily see a casino on every Vlog about their cruise experience, and I think they also follow the standard of a regular casino, same probability to win as well.

I haven't had the opportunity to visit one just yet but I've had friends more successful than me talk about their cruise ship stories, and it includes leisure. Most of these cruise ships will have a dedicated place for gambling and games, billiards, chess, even table tennis for some ships. But let's talk about the gambling part. Pay-rates are so-so as I told, some hold sizable treasuries capable of supplying prizes for jackpot winners, some are not. Like most establishments within the ship, they operate on a schedule, no later than the evening, so crews can clean up and prepare for next date. I wasn't able to ask how much the betting entry is, but for sure there's one. As for game variety, you'll have what they can only provide. Staples such as roulette, poker, and sometimes even slots are readily available, games like billiards where you can create personal bets with opponents are available too. That's about it I guess. Again I'm using information referred to me by my friends, so I can't really vouch for the authenticity, but for what it's worth, After conducting some research myself I think it all adds up.",
