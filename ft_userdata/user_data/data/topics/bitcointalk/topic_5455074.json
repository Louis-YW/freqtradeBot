L-BTC a sidechain and afaik Electrum doesn't support it. You may want to use Blockstream Green wallet for L-BTC, since both are Blockstream \"products\". But I don't know if it supports LN.Or use an actual Bitcoin wallet that supports LN and forget about L-BTC.PS. Imho there are for LN easier options than Electrum if you are not a tech head.",

Imho there are for LN easier options than Electrum if you are not a tech head.i thoguht L-BTC or lequid btc is same as sending btc via lightning networkhowerver it seem that lightning network is only worth it when sending btc from excchage to exchange since wallets like electrum has high fees when opening and closing lightning channel youwill end up paying more then normal btc network just as this user mentionedhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452384.0+ im just looking for a way to withdraw my btc earnings from binance to electrum with low fees",

So if the solution is interesting if you have to use LN for other transactions or if you are wiling to make other withdrawals through LN in the coming weeks or months before closing your channel. Once you have open a channel you will need to send funds to the exchange or elsewhere in order to get some receiving capacity, after that you will just need to generate a LN invoice in Electrum with the amount you want to receive(smaller than the receiving capacity of your channel) and paste it on the exchange.",
