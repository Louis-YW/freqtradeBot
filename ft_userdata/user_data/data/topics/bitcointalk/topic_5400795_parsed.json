  "content": "Hello, I'm the person who started this project with a developer. At first I had no idea what I would do, I just wanted to make a decentralized currency with low cost in commissions 1% buy 1% sell. Talking to the developer first wanted to make a delivery app with their own decentralized wallet so that people could make constant use of discounts and so on. The idea of a game arose to be able to make constant use of the coin. I am looking for interested people who are willing to help me to have an excellent team. They can request any type of information, verify the purchase and sell of the contract already renounced with a supply of 15 million.",
