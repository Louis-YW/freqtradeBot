  "content": "Project Icarus: The forum redemption story          the situation with Coldkey shook this group down to the core. the financial loss incurred was bad enough. worse however, was the dark shadow cast on users and makers. the future looks bleak.however, such turmoil can be seen as an opportunity to evolve. Polymerbit reached out to me about an idea. what if we took everything that was good about coldkey - and saved it, while fixing the bad. main problems found in Coldkey: 1) don’t trust, verify. now proven for all members.2) collectors’ premiums can be destroyed overnight with malpractice3) general unreliability leads to a snowball effect with this post, we’d like to introduce you all to project Icarus. together with Xprim777 (original founder), polymerbit (advisor & designer), owlcatz (distributor) and myself (CEO), we want to create something better from the ashes of the old. each of us were involved with Coldkey to some degree and have strong connections with the forum. project Icarus is based on the greek mythology of ‘flying too close to the sun’. by inherently trusting the keys, we all got burnt. Icarus will focus on bringing back cards at an affordable price point, while ditching traditional keys. this will have a fundamental impact on the risk to users. stage 1: introduction of keyless cards under $15 stage 2: development and incorporation of BIP38 options initially, the cards will not be used as cold storage wallets but as a kind of canvas - the quality of the cards will be as high as the old ones! in any case, the editions (which would’ve been released by Coldkey in the future) will now be released under Icarus ... a new logo is also already in development. this announcement should also serve as an info for those who loved Coldkey and cared a lot about the cards. those who were directly affected by the crash will have initial priority on the lower serial numbers and will receive additional goodies.past or current Icarus sales/auction threads:[SALE] Icarus Sticker Edition Cards 🔐[AUCTION -

Valambi Icarus has a nice ring to it doesn't it! Gold and silver grams also hold value and could be a great way to bring crypto and precious metals together under one card, maybe down the road could add in DIY key generation somehow or maybe have another solution for the loading of any crypto value to this new card venture. Any who I thought it would be fun to chime in with that. Can get creative with it, even get some metals exchanges involved?!",
