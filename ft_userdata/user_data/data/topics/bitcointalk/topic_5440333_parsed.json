      "body": "That is right but you have to know what you are doing for that collection of the old note,in the other hand making the old note comfortable within ourselves is really not a good idea in the sense that what if they stop using it and you have alot of it in your hand what are you going to do then.Remember in life what is right also have it wrong side and what is wrong also have it's right side of too. So think wisely before making any step of yours.",

If you are accepting the old note and you are opportuned to deposit it into your bank account it can only be done ones and after that you won't be allowed to deposit another old note using your account again, what will happen to the ones that you will hold after then.",

Big man, you no be CBN and no get any right to go against government law to avoid u causing depression or problem to yourself. Change is constant in life,therefore, make we let old things pass away and look for a way forward to coupe with the new change for Naija.",
