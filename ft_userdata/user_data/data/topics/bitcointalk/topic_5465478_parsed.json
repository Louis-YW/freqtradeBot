  "content": "Is this possible to do or not?  For example say you want to find the exact price of a coin such as dash or maker to make it simple and say on January 3, 2022. But you want to know the price at say 8am West Coast USA time.  Or say at 5pm.  How would you do this?  Coinmarketcap allows you to go back and click on all in the graph but when you move your mouse slowly, you could sort of check daily but you can't even get the price at a certain time?  Say you want to know what the price of btc or dash was at 8am on that day.  Also what time zone does coinmarketcap use?  Example if you scroll through the graph and it show 5pm... what time is it in USA West Coast Time?Is there a way to do this for altcoins?  And how?  I know coinmarketcap you can check the history and what the high, low and closing price is for each coin for many years ago but what if you want to know the price of that coin at say 8am West Coast USA time?  Or say 5pm West Coast USA time?  Is there a way to do that or not before it is too long ago?  Now if it is recent, obviously you can check this.",

This is different than CMC which takes the data from multiple exchanges. So I checked the Binance ones:- https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/binance/And it looks like it has the data by the minute  (you need to create a free account in order to see it apparently)The CSV files have the Unix timestamp, so I would imagine you could use that to convert the time to whatever timezone you want using Excel.",

So, where does the price come from? You will get the most precise data from the source itself. Find the exchange with the highest volume for each particular coin and check the price there for any specific date and time. Many large exchanges also offer an API that allows you to automate the process with a little bit of scripting. Here's an example:How do I get all the prices history with binance API for a crypto using Python?Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2023, 09:24:22 AMCan someone who has an account post a screenshot of how it looks?  Example you want to know the price of dash on January 3, 2022 at say 8am and 5pm USA West coast time.Here is an excerpt from an example of the DASH-USDT trading pair on January 1, 2022. You can view the entire CSV on pastebin.https://pastebin.com/XksE5JN0Quote from: jerry0 on September 03, 2023, 09:24:22 AMAlso it only gives hour by hour right?  You can't know the exact price at say 8:27am USA West Coast time?   No. It gives you a price per minute.

You can use the closing column if you want to know the price. There's no chart, I would imagine you can make one with the data on that CSV but you would need some technical knowledge for that.Same thing with the time, and as I mentioned above, you probably need to convert the Unix timestamp on the first column to USA West coast time, that way it's easier for you to browse or... You can just look what's the equivalent of that in GMT+1 (I think) and then look for it on the CSV file.",

Well I had gone through what you wrote this is funny and weird, my suggestion never to ask your queries in that way from next time to get efficient feedbacks.Quote from: Text on September 04, 2023, 02:36:24 AMThe time zone that CoinMarketCap uses is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) if I'm not mistaken.

We know the market have been really a big mess with whole coupling down of buy and sell trigger order, what really matters is OP getting his answers which he will get at desirable time.Suggestions have been made but OP have final decision, either ti look into it or allow it. You can go into deep research about seeking answers to your concerning questions and thoughts. As far I'm concerned, the market is been named and label to become one with volatility.
