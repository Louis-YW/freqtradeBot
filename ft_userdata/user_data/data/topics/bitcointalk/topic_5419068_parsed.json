Purchased 100 rs worth usdc on polygon, it went smooth, no kyc, just email address. There is video of same in above article. I couldn't find anything related to 'selling' as mentioned in article however. Regarding prices, I paid 90 rs/usdc while on coindcx it's 85 rs/usdc. https://sequence.app/wallet/add-funds",
