It seems that a gambler has loss this massive amount (1.4 million USD) playing a bet with an odds lower than 1.01! (exactly 1.008)I think there are several lessons here: - there is not easy bet! even lower odds there is always a risk.- it's really risky playing an huge amount. This not helps gambler because the risk is much much higher then rewards!- gambling is not easy at all! it's really hard achieve a profit even for easy games!what your opinion about this gambling issue? did you had experience similar experience? how a good gambler should avoid such mistakes?",

It is a means of getting addicted too.I have won 1.25 to 2 odds before very well, if I take higher odd with lower amount of money and lose, it is better than going for lower odds with high amount of money.",

      "body": "Hello, dear friends,It is possible that the gambler made a large number of bets at very low odds, such as 1.008, which would have resulted in a large loss. The odds of 1.008 indicate that the chance of winning the bet is very low and the potential payout is also very small. In order to win 1.4 million USD, the gambler would have had to place a large number of bets and hope that they all win. However, the chances of winning that many bets at such low odds are extremely low, which is why it is likely that the gambler ended up losing a large amount of money.Another possibility is that the gambler may have been using a betting system or strategy that was not based on sound mathematical principles, and that ultimately led to the large loss. It's also possible that the gambler may have had a problem with gambling addiction, which led them to make impulsive and irrational decisions when placing bets.Regardless of the reason, losing such a large amount of money can be a very difficult experience. It is important for anyone who is struggling with gambling addiction to seek help and support, whether through counseling or support groups.In general, it's important to remember that gambling is a form of entertainment, and that it's important to set a budget and stick to it, and also to be aware of the odds and the risks involved in any bet.Good luck for everybody.",

Your answer is barely relevant, other than the emotional spiel at the end. The bold part is also incorrect. These odds indicate that the chance of losing the bet is very low, therefor the potential payout is very small.",

What I do when I bet is I don't really care much about the odds as it is what makes like a multiplier when you bet huge money in low odds then you won't get the amount you bet if you won or the same amount you bet and when betting on higher odds then you will get x2 the amount or more. That's how I see about the odds and you guys are free to correct me but that's how I see about the odds thing. I also think that even though it is low odds doesn't mean you will surely win the bet.",

The lowest odds I think that is still worth the bet is 1.3, and anything past that is just 'dangerous' territory or simply not worth it to bet at all. What more a 1.008 chance? Imagine just trying to collect $11k+ dollars for a bet, only to lose $1.4 million instead. Dude thought that it was an easy 11 grand to sweep, just goes to show that there is no such thing as easy money in sports betting.I personally would have just used a few thousands and bet live and get more or less the same result. Props to the Chargers for making that epic comeback, must have been sweet collecting the tears of the fans and the bets of the gamblers",

I often do sportsbetting and sometimes it feels like some matches are one sided, so in order to yield maximum profits from it, I often place large amount of bets. But once for this type of bet, I lost huge amount of money and still I regret from it. So from next time onwards, I always calculates the risk and place appropriate bets on necessary events. Yes Gambling is not easy, and I admit that but still it can be achieved fluently if we can manage the risk involved in it.",

The shocking and crazy thing is that for only 11,200$ in winnings, you will sacrifice 1.4M$ in exchange for that winning. I'm also a gambler but I'm not stupid enough to do that, maybe the bettor who made it is so rich that it's just for Him it a bit of coins only. And even if I'm a rich person I still won't do that as a gambler.",

Playing safely would help players to avoid such things. But to somehow see the player's end, I guess such thing is not new to him; it seems that he's used to such situations of betting huge amount. So we may assume he also won big time before. It would be more unfortunate if he bet all that he has and turned into a huge loss. Think of how huge jackpot became a huge learned lesson. So to those who are planning to do the same thing, please know your limits as a player. Always use an amount you can afford to lose because anything could happen even the impossible, in gambling industry.",
