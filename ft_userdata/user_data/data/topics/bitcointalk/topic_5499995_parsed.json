I've read the story, and sorry to say, but this doesn't clearly have anything to do with us holding crypto currencies as our investments.It's important to read and properly comprehend before making any attempt to jump into conclusion and giving advice that is not well thought out.The woman in question was involved in exchanging bitcoin for luxury properties which are; but not limited to houses, expensive jewelries and other expensive belongings, that is, she was involved on trading bitcoin for this things, and also trading those for bitcoin, and from the story, she along the line got involved in laundering money, which is a very serious crime in most countries.So, her bitcoin asset being seized and she being jailed is justified as long as she was proven guilty of the crime.This has nothing to do with the most of us who hold unto our bitcoin as investment for our future.",

Of course. But is it wrong according to the norm? No.",

Let me write down here for other \"A former takeaway worker found with Bitcoin worth more than Â£2bn was jailed for six years and eight months for a crime linked to money laundering on Friday.Jian Wen, 42, from Hendon, in north London, was involved in converting the currency into assets including multi-million-pound houses and jewellery.At Southwark Crown court in March, she was convicted of entering into or becoming concerned in a money laundering arrangement.The Metropolitan Police said at the time of the conviction the seizure was the largest of its kind in the UK.\"So a former worker found Bitcoin that linked with money laundry and she used it but I do believe this is not regular found maybe she get order from her employee to converting the asset, because if you found a wallet there still a password and etc",

However let's not forget that although decentralization is beneficial, it comes with some level of transparency and exposure which can pose negative effects. Take for example, a person's wallet can be monitored via any block chain explorer from transaction to transaction making it possible for some hackers to even pose common threats like dust attacks.Personally I think a Bitcoin holder should keep not only his wallet keys and seed private, be he should also make sure his address isn't too exposed. Most of the time some person's link their holding wallet to an exchange and personally I think it isn't very safe. One of the reasons why Satoshi remains anonymous is because all the wallets he saved his mined Bitcoins in are anonymous and not linked to any exchange.",

This is a piece of old news in my view a couple of weeks ago there was a similar kind of news, hmm is it the same one? TBH here in my country Bitcoin accumulation and investment are not prohibited, so there's nothing wrong if I do hold Bitcoins. Also, this was not an accumulation case, it seems like it was some sort of money laundering activity because I have heard of anyone revealing his/her identity after owning an amount of Bitcoin.",

A group of criminals who were using Bitcoin to hide their shady deals were caught and OP is starting a topic on hodling Bitcoin legally. We should praise these law enforcement agencies for tracking and uncovering these criminal activities. These sets of persons give the Bitcoin space a bad reputation because of these criminal activities. I read that Jian Wen was living a luxurious life with the proceeds of crime which led to suspicion.

News like this are usually overblown to gain more publicity. But in this case that OP mentioned it was proved that it was a proceed from crime. Some persons were duped in China Jian Wen helped the masterminders to launder the criminal proceeds.",

Anyways I just see this post as a reminder for Bitcoin hodlers to maintain maximum security of their holding wallets in any way possible. One of the easiest ways people can be traced via their wallet, is through a connection with their wallet to an exchange where they have previously done a KYC registration.Things like this are the reason why people are adviced to understand certain important things , especially security before venturing the crypto space.It's so sad that people in countries where crypto is viewed as illegal have to carry out crypto transactions hidden.",

So, this topic is already discussed, so I would like to ask one question.Why is the emphasis on crypto here?So we shouldn't do anything illegal using cryptocurrency, but it's perfectly ok to do such things and get cash for it. This kind of dramatization gives the impression that crypto is exclusively used for fraud, illegal trade and the like, and in fact, it is up to the person and the use of cryptocurrency is just a tool.It's like pointing out that the bank robber used Bridgestone tyres on the getaway vehicle. Finally, to make a point, be careful how you drive a car with Bridgestone tyres.",
