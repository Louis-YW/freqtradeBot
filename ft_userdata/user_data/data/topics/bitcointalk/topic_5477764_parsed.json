  "content": "If you live in a place, the rest of the house does not really care what temperature it is. In fact, some objects (like cryptocurrency farming machines) like the temperature to be a bit on the cooler side. It is more efficient (and healthy) to just heat up yourself instead of heating up the entire @#$%ing house just to keep yourself warm. If you live in apartment complex or condominium, the heat from your neighbors will conduct through the walls and keep your unit cool. Some ways to keep yourself warm without spending so much energy heating up the rest of the @#$%ing house include running, going up and down the stair, squats, lunges, going on a bicycle ride, riding a stationary bicycle, lifting weights, or even doing math problems to get your brain to burn more calories. You can even wear a coat and multiple layers, but if you are doing enough squats, you will not even need the coat. And you do not need to take a warm shower. Taking a warm shower does not make you healthy. It just makes you a wussy.So you may be asking what to do to stay warm when sleeping. The solution is to stop sleeping alone. You can either sleep with a human, dog, cat, cheetah, wolf, pig, or even a capybara to keep yourself warm. It is more efficient that way.If these tricks do not keep you warm during the winter, you should try consuming more calories so that you can stay warm more easily. Ice cream is a great source of calories to help keep you warm in the winter, and in the winter your ice cream will not melt and get all gross.If you are still cold, then you can use a cryptocurrency mining machine to stay warm, but make sure that the machine is being used to most efficiently solve the problem of reversible computation because if it isn't, then that is wasteful.I solved the problems of obesity, climate change, and reversible computation at the same time because I am smart, and I am even staying warm in the winter by thinking about how to solve these problems. -Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

      "body": "I am agree heat heaters which use electric resistances can be wasteful and unnecessary when compared to heat pumps. Heat pumps use work in the form of electricity to pump energy in the form of heat from a cold environment to a hot one, which also converting the electricity used to power the machine into heat as well. Also, I am a bit confused about the use of mining and reversible computation though. I thought that since reversible processes like those were supposed to generate pretty much less waste in the form of heat, actually almost zero. It would not make sense to run a mining machine on that, would it?Â  It kind of reminds me the concept of reversible machines and thermodynamic processes, which are supposed to be frictionless and perfect, even though in the reality they are not, they are only used to evaluate what the best scenarios in the development of machines are, not much beyond it. I assume you are taken a look at the theorems of Carnot and their influence on the development of the second law of thermodynamics.",

      "body": "There is a giant gap between the state of reversible computation right now where reversible hardware cannot outperform irreversible hardware and where the reversible hardware will be so efficient that it will not give off enough heat. If reversible hardware is used for cryptocurrency mining, we will simply use that better hardware to increase the 'hash' rate instead of decreasing the total power consumption.Quote from: jrrsparkles on December 14, 2023, 08:12:23 AMQuote from: jvanname on December 13, 2023, 07:19:58 PMSo you may be asking what to do to stay warm when sleeping.

This guy at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3waAOcJkps sleeps and cuddles with cheetahs and I do not think the cheetahs have eaten him yet. And cheetahs are like house cats but bigger. Cheetahs don't roar. Cheetahs are cute. They meou. But I understand that cuddling with cheetahs for warmth is not a sensible option for most people. But at least some of us need to prepare for extreme survival situations because we need survivors in case WWIII breaks out, and those survivors need to be located in both warm environments and cold environments, so people in cold environments need to be able to bear the harsh winters. After WWIII, some of you may need to @#$% people who are related to you. Have you prepared for that? No. That is because it takes many generations of inbreeding to prepare for WWIII. Humans have used their evolution points to make themselves not so attracted to their relatives, but they should have instead been using those evolution points to practice genetic purging to get rid of harmful recessive genes through inbreeding. Yes. I know. If people inbred in the past, they would have had a bunch of @#$%ed up offspring. I realize that that is terrible. But it is better to have those @#$%ed up offspring when it was safe rather than when there was nobody else to breed with. Right now, I don't even think the people of Alabama, Pakistan, and West Virginia have bred with their relatives long enough to purge themselves of that harmful genetic material. -Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

Cheetahs are predators. So are dogs. And cheetahs are cute. But WWIII is only one of the disasters that could befall us. Other lesser disasters include solar flares, famine, political turmoil, more pandemics (which will probably happen again since nobody has supported my efforts to ensure that biological laboratories implement proper safety protocols), and other things that I did not mention. Some of us will be more prepared than others. But the ability to withstand a little bit of cold weather can't hurt most people. It will prevent climate change, and it will keep people fit. Climate change and obesity are two problems that we need to work on a bit more (at least here in the USA).",
