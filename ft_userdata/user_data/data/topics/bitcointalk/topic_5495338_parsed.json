      "body": "you do know these are not solo pools...the miners do act together to create the strong hash, so not solothe only difference is the pay out scheme..EGCKPOOL runs its own bitcoin node with its mempool list of transactionshttps://solo.ckpool.org/pool.txnsckpool collates its chosen transactions and forms block templates at the pools server end..  and then sets a nonce range (using miners payoutaddress for slight randomness) but they all work on a certain template at the same time. thus its still a pool.but the winning miner of the pool gets majority of the win rather than a small share of the winso the security of difficult hash and working on the same template is still all pool managed. but the only main difference is just the reward shareall other pools work the same way in regards to pooling their resources on a template. but the only difference is the share of the rewardthus its not true solo. its still pool mining but just the payout is differenttrue solo MINING is about solo MINING of independently collated block templates.. solo mining is not about just solo rewarding",

All the pool operators get is a tiny % of that. They (the miner) and they alone provided all of the hash power used. Now did said miners actually *own* the hardware - no. They were very large rentals pointed at the pools.That fits my definition of Solo perfectly.",

      "body": "mining is the activity not the paymentthe work not the wagethe job not the salarythe work, activity, job is POOL miningthe type of payment is separate variable unrelated to pool miningas you even suggest there is many payment options, but all pool. so you suggesting your solo mining even though all your changing is the payment splits.. does not mean its solo mining its solo payingif i was in the wild west mining in my own pit of my own land im a solo minerif i am mining someone else plot of land along with other people its no longer solo.. even if i get paid 0.001% or 99% of what the mine findsif you own your own car and advertise it to sell it and keep the sale value thats a solo salebut when you work with other sales people for a car dealership working under their work conditions using their cars you are not a sole trader. you are pooled team of the dealership, whether you are on shared salary or commissioni could list other analogies, but..do you even know the difference between real life things like being a worker of a manager vs being self employed running your own independent businessdo you understand that an asic does not have a hard drive to do its own mempool transaction selectionbut i do love how you admitQuote from: kano on May 05, 2024, 01:38:01 AMIn the case of my pool, it is indeed free of such transaction bias.The point of using my resources for mining, PPLNS or SOLO, is to have one of the best, worldwide, block distribution networks around, to minimse the chance of losing your block due to being orphaned.now if they truly were solo mining they would have solo control to be able to not paybc1q28kkr5hk4gnqe3evma6runjrd2pvqyp8fpwfzu   ‎0.06992436 BTCaka not need to pay you kanobut you would reject their block if they were to solo 'f**k around', 'be stupid' , 'modify',  decide to make their own template without you",

I know Via BTC and a couple of other pools offer solo mining, do we know if they put anything different in the coinbase tag or does it just show as any other block? Does not really matter in the long run, but if it just shows as any of their other tags like the ones shown here:https://mempool.space/mining/pool/viabtcThen for all we know 1/2 of those blocks are solo blocks....-Dave",

      "body": "Now that^^ is a good point.Considering the payout most (non-solo) folks get from those pools it is highly unlikely that solo users make up a significant portion of their block finds. That said, yes it would be interesting to be able to know how many they get.On the obverse side of he coin, what about OCEAN? They distribute the rewards. But, since they use Stratum V2 and each miner can decide what work their block contains does that mean that they are solo mining if said miners hardware cracks their block of unique work? By most definitions, because the rewards are still distributed amongst the pool users - no.",

But if for privacy reasons (or other reasons) when mining solo their coinbase tag looks like one of the tags here:https://mempool.space/mining/pool/unknownProbably not, but there is no way to say 100% not.<shrug> Outside of academic interest does it really matter?-Dave",
