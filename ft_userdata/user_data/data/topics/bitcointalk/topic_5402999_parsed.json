      "body": "The hype of meme tokens is gone, there is no hope of investing in meme tokens anymore. We can see the real evidence from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). If the question is \"is investing in Floki Inu a good investment?\" the answer is NO. It's better to look for potential tokens or coins that are currently in the hype, for example Move-to-Earn (M2E) tokens.Next \"Can Floki Inu be listed on Binance?\", again the answer is NO. Don't ask again why, you can see my first statement.",

The first and also most important reason why i would never put money into Floki Inu is that it is just another meme-coin that has no real use case and is also providing no utility to it's users. It is just a sh*it-coin that was created once it become public that Elon Musks new dog is named Floki, that is literally all what that token is about and that is just not enough to survive in the crypto world in the longterm.The second reason is, that i generally think that the time of meme-coins is over. During the peak of the meme-coin hype a few months ago there were literally hundreds created each and every day and 99% of them were already dead again in a few days. Floki Inu was one of the most successful ones but nevertheless i think the long term direction of it's price is still downwards.",

Shit coin exactly. With the rank that is still over 2k, low market cap and trading volume, not really clear enough profit development and utility. Absolutely I personally will not choose this coin for investment.

I wonder why so many people keep on investing in this meme coin although frequently it just results in loss at the end of the day.you better off investing in something like avalanche and matic because they have real underlying innovation instead of just random memecoins like floki that you mentioned.So basically avoid memecoins investment at all costs, they will just results in investment loss.",
