My brother this your talk about too much freedom causing chaos is actually the logic here because humans can make use of the decentralised nature of bitcoin to actually do many issues for the world like fraudulent activity.Already many cases don surface already about how the use of crypto dey cause problems and this is one of the reasons also why many government dey go against am but  the truth be say nothing can be a 100% good.",

Na this thing make them deh take frustrate anything weh go liberate the masses be that and bitcoin na one of those things.So far as as Nigeria is concerned, our leaders doesn't want everyone to benefit in government as any opportunity that comes they rather give it to their loyalist or their cohorts knowing too well that these people will not be able to caution or probe them if they involve in any fowl play.They want everything to be at their mercy like before anything is done or any decision is taken it must first pass their table. Employing close allies or cartel is not a bad idea but a situation whereby because they are under you may make them not to open up and condemn your wrong doings, so in making choices of governance, sentiment should be set aside and one should not be bias when hiring individuals for jobs and employment.Our leaders should remove the thought of not allowing people to be higher than them as they will not live forever thereby they need someone that will replace them when they're no more so if they continue with this mindset of not allowing people to be up to their standards it is really gonna be difficult after there demise.This is a reason why the westerners are doing great because any knowledge one has they will transfer it to the next person incase if they are no more someone will be there to take over and continue",

I can't help bug think though, can the government ever give total support to a scheme it cannot control or influence?, I think no. As soon as the government perceived that they're being held in the dark concerning its operations, they look for legal or illegal ways to bring that  scheme down, look at what's happened to Samurai wallets. They seized their website, arrested their mixers developers and even went as far as using seizure request to google play for their mobile app simply because they observed unlawful funds transfers and money laundering through them.Truth be told, such crimes have been existing in conventional banks, wired funds platforms and other financial institutions, they neither seized the platforms nor arrested the developers, they only arrested the perpetrators of the crime and brought them to justice.taking a look at this story for example https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/crime/nigerian-arrested-in-hcmc-for-laundering-foreign-criminal-money-4739755.html the funds that were trafficked here were transferred multiple times before withdrawal, but we never heard that the government seized the platforms or banks, neither did they disclose them nor arrest anybody apart from the criminals.These are direct attacks on cryptocurrency and not just fight for justice, government can fight justice without attacking crypto organization physically and knowing they cannot control the decentralized monetary system makes them more combat ready and brutal when dealing with any crypto related shortcomings. The wait for government to adapt to crypto and its privacy inclination is valid, but for me, it seems eternal. We need more smart moves to convince them cos they're not loosening their grip anytime soon.",

Instead they're only concerned about themselves that's is why they'd never cease to exercise that habitations of monopolies.Without giving it a doubt, the governments are aware that bitcoin is a technological financial freedom which has the potentials to bring the global economy inflations that's projected by the governments in subject to discipline the masses indirectly as wickedness where people would have to struggle for survival.And because they're aware that bicoin is a decentralized and non custodian financial system, they fears that it the digital financial system is allowed in used by the masses, the so fiats under their control would be ruined if bitcoin is inducted.Don't be surprised that if bitcoin and other crypto blockchains could be reprogrammed to had over authorities of the cryptocurrencies to the government, they would anchor to give unlimited accesses to bitcoin. So the government is just concerned about what they could have authority upon so that they can always manipulate it to their favour at same time claiming that they cares about the people under their governances.They literally fears the potentials of bitcoin that the woord can practically rely on it and just move on with While leaving limited attentions on the governments infrastructures.While noted all that, believe it that the government doesn't care about the people else there wouldn't be the logics of monopolies even when they knows that the restricted inventory is far better and comfortable for the masses than that which they adopted to exist. That's one of the bone of contention of why they're against bitcoin because it's the peoples choice but not under their control.",
