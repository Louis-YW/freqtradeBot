You are the one that is thinking that he is not thinking about it. If you can see his mind, you will see how he will feel that it is not that good but hoping that he will make it from gambling and having different strategies to win the house more in mind. His addiction will end when gambling takes more from him and if he he seeing that he is not moving forward because he is wasting money that he supposed to use to move forward on gambling. But if he is moving forward, that means he is spending small amount on gambling.",

I don't think there's something weird with this guy, he is as you have describe, a addicted gambler, so he will obviously doesn't care what's going on around him, as long as he has the money or produce it whatever way he can, he will continue to gamble. Doesn't matter how much he is losing every night.I know someone who has this kind of addictions and how much money him and her wife are losing every night. I'm not telling it to others though that I know because they will not believed me. But I meet this guy and he has business that generates millions, legally, but he just go and gamble it away.",

Legal businesses perhaps? Or some shady business in the background? I can only speculate.Quote from: Outhue on November 28, 2023, 09:41:55 AMI've get to know that not all gamblers need to be a responsible gambler, some knows, they are not hypnotized by gambling, they are fully awake and they still choose to be a reckless gambler. For average joe gamblers, yeah, we learn it the hard way. Maybe for us $100-$1000 is already huge and so we will not go that route and lose that kind of money in a single night. Although it's hard to control, however, maybe some of us here has the experience already and at the last minute, learn how to control our emotions.",

Do you know the money you might be thinking is too big might actually be peanut for him? Do you qualify gambling addiction by hoe much one loses? Do you feel someone have overcome addiction when they win often? These are the basic questions you need to ask to be able to understand the situation of your friend. From your explanation, he might not actually be addicted but just following his plans. Winning does not just come easily, it takes time and its possible that few of his wins will cover all he has lost. If you have access to him, the best thing to do is to engage him in a discussion to be to understand what he is doing better and if he really needs help.",

Is he a very rich person so he doesn't care about the losses he experiences and can still continue his gambling activities? If he has other income that is greater than what he spends on gambling then this is not a problem and he will not go bankrupt because of the gambling he does even though he never wins. However most people will reach a point where they run out of money and cannot continue gambling. If someone is too crazy about gambling and too addicted then just let it go until he has no more money, so he can't gamble anymore.",

And if he don't accept any advice given again let him do what he want since at the end of the day maybe he's actually enjoying what he currently do and its just you people give a wrong impression about what he do.As long as he didn't came to the point where he stole some money from everyone then I think he's still fine and he maybe just ignore those losses its because that money is the one he can afford to lose. If he gives you a weird vibes then try to see how capable he is for doing that and also how much he earn since from that maybe you can understand his attitude on gambling. But for sure he's not a bad person so try to understand him as a gambler.",

The truth is that such gamblers don't care about what advice you give to them because they are always after chasing their loss.Such gamblers will never stop gambling until they have ruined everything around them and learn a hard lesson, that is when they can consider quitting but for now to believe that they are doing the right thing even though they see that it is not favoring them. One funny thing is that these gamblers might have won big and that is why they keep on gambling, even after bug losses. See gambling as fun and not a means to make profit.",

If he continues gambling and wasting a lot of money without even thinking about it then I think you are also a gambling addict in a different form. The difference is that he has the means to gamble, and he has the money while other gambling addicts are too obvious because they don't have money and so they engage in bank loans, borrowing from a friend or relatives, and other ways to provide for their addiction. I guess he can be reckless because someone is still providing for his habit, not all have the same perks as those people who don't even need to work hard just to make money. I think that's where a person becomes a responsible gambler when he realizes that he is wasting his own hard-earned cash in a game that he cannot even win.",

Had co-workers gamble away their last €20–€50 because, f*ck it, I'm getting paid in less than a week; this was their mindset. I'm not sure if it's a \"different breed\" of people, but I know for a fact that some don't give a damn about managing their money; their motto is that money is to be spent, and while this statement isn't entirely false, they misinterpret it and go ahead and waste everything without caring at all. I can't understand why and how they do it.From my point of view, it's a combination of poor financial skills, poor management, irresponsibility, and underlying mental health issues, such as depression. Unless someone has so much money that they don't give a damn, I don't know how else to explain such behaviors.",
