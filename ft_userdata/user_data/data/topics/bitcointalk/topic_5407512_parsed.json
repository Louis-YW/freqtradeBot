Thanks everyone!It can be overwhelming sometimes, so just take it a step at a time.Get understanding of the forum, and then the basics of cryptocurrencies.You can then use your basic knowledge as a directory to search for what topics interests you.",

      "body": "Hola, welcome. You'd love it here if you keep to the rules. One of the suggestions I like to give to newbies to go to this thread- Report plagiarism (copy/paste) here. Mods: please give temp or permban as needed and read thoroughly. One of the reasons is because very soon there will be subtle pressure to get merits and rank up ASAP. And this often leads newbies to flout the forum rules. Plagiarism is one of the \"deadliest sins\". Beware and be aware. Please, always, always reference any idea which you post that is not originally yours.",
