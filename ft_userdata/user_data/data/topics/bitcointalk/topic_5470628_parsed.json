  "content": "A few days ago, I was part of the team that embarked on a mission to introduce newcomers to bitcoin in Cameroon. The experience was both exhilarating and enlightening, as we engaged with the curious and passionate young Africans eager to understand the intricacies of Bitcoin. It was a profound moment of introspection, witnessing their genuine interest and profound questions about bitcoin. We did our best to impart knowledge, covering essential aspects such as the fundamentals of Bitcoin, its role as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, the inner workings of the Bitcoin network, and concepts like proof of work. We delved into the realm of Bitcoin creation and mining, explaining the significance of Bitcoin wallets and how to secure them effectively, among other topics.I have always known that Bitcoin represents power and freedom, and for many of these young individuals, the notion of taking control of their finances without intermediaries was a revelation they had never considered before. To conclude our educational effort, our team guided them in creating their own Bitcoin wallets and even welcomed them to the bitcoin family with a small gift of $1 worth of satoshis. However, our journey doesn't stop here. We remain committed to furthering their understanding of Bitcoin, which is why we established a dedicated closed social media group where they can seek answers to their questions and continue their learning journey.Here is a video of us welcoming the newcomers to the bitcoin family with $1 worth of satoshis sent to their wallet using lightning network  posted on my team leaders' twitter. - https://twitter.com/BitcoinSophist/status/1711751847768129634",

Otherwise you should open a channel to send that $1 to each person. In general everything that involves a popularization of Bitcoin seems to me a good idea even if it does not fit perfectly into Satoshi's initial idea of P2P.",

      "body": "You did great work there, my friend because sharing knowledge with others will always result in adding knowledge to your own. I really liked the idea, and I might be doing the same, but I will not giveaway $1 from my pocket because I am not rich, and I don't want to fetch people by giving them the treat of $1. I am not saying you did wrong by giving them $1, because $1 is not that much money, and people would become greedy and follow you down a path in a place where crypto is not legal yet, even though it is not illegal either. That's a relevant point.I think it will be wise to hide the faces of the users before sharing their videos on social media because once you tell them that BTC provides anonymity and etc., they might question you about why you guys shared our video on social media using the BTC LN.Well, I might be being extra careful here, but it is what it is. If you respect privacy and anonymity, then you should hide their faces, otherwise, it is not that much of a problem. All I am afraid of is that governments can take action against such acts because some actors don't want you to grow.Beside all that, I really like the idea and keep it up and keep growing.",

This question comes in naturally and you will have to face it. Also how they can spend this small amount of money as well.It is possible for them to visit this forum and look for job opportunities from the forum too.

Passion is sometimes confused for understanding. Africa is a complex mix of civilizations, and while Bitcoin promises emancipation, it requires deep understanding to exploit. Your great trip is just the beginning.Continuing education is important, but do you provide them the tools to navigate Bitcoin's volatility? Managing funds without intermediaries is appealing, but it has drawbacks. They must appreciate the importance of Bitcoin wallet security and its value fluidity. Your restricted social media group is a start, but constant interaction is essential. Introspect, reassess, and reinforce.",

I am sure they will have further questions on these topics so there is a need to create a platform for feedback. Your team should create an avenue where they can ask questions and get further teachings. Thank you for this great work.

Nigeria has a high population of Bitcoiners but the interest of neighboring countries such as Niger, Cameroon, and Benin has been very low. Bitcoin awareness needs to be spread in these Francophone nations and it is good news to see people like OP taking this bold step. Cameroon just like Nigeria is suffering from high inflation which has made many Nigerians buy bitcoin to serve as a hedge against the fall of the value of money. So these trainees can derive some benefit from the knowledge of bitcoin they have acquired from this awareness program.",

The area that you said you guys taught them, I believe that they understood it because it is not easy to understand them in just a week. Seeing bitcoin awareness moving from Nigeria to Cameroon and Maybe later it will spread to Benin is something that will lead to more people adopting and using bitcoin, which is what this community was created for. I am very impress for sacrificing your time and resources for bitcoin. West Africa countries need bitcoin to survive the high rate of inflation in the country.Kudos",

Because the government is deliberately creating poverty to to the people and when bitcoin came, it removed that poverty mindset from people so anyone who comes it, have the freedom to finance. It is a nice work done by you by bringing people to the cryptocurrency (bitcoin). As you are orienting them on this journey please also tell the risk (volatile) nature of bitcoin so that when they into it and in the bear market, they will know what to do. The Cameronians in your locality will be very happy with you. Keep up the good work. The Lord is your strength.",

So I'm very much happy to see cameroonian showing interest in the forum & Bitcoin generally, which I just can't wait to see a Ghanaian, Togolese and Beninese also present here on this forum. Hence, introducing these people about Bitcoin was a very good idea you just did, as it offers the ability to have control over their funds and prevent against future inflation, far better than saving funds in fiat currency.",

The rate of adoption is almost the same with Nigeria. We buy Bitcoin through P2P services like on Bisq, Binance, Yellowcard and others. There has been call by the government to regulate it which is understandable because bad agents are using it as a means to dupe people through elaborate profits promised from crypto ponzi schemes. That's why we are working hard on educating our citizens about Bitcoin. What is lacking is proper Bitcoin education and we are working round the clock through radio, TV, Books, videos, physical meetings to get the people educated on Bitcoin.",
