So what happens if a project is not listed on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko within 24 hours?",

Doesn't make sense to hurry things while its bear market anyway. Its a waste of money when you can list your project in a week or two for free. But I'm might be considering it if I'm a developer and would like it timely listed to good news that's coming while also in the bull market. I have been approached in linkedin if I can list a tokens on CMC, not sure why the employer asked me about it but this is a good service to outsource if someone approaches and will just get a cut.Â  I wonder if OP is open for this. May I ask which coins have you listed there since?",
