It is a great time to buy more by the way and it is much better if bitcoin users can get good information from better sources than skewed information from twitter users and anti-bitcoin people.",

Bitcoin has never fallen below the peak price of the previous halvening cycle.those quoting stupidly low amounts (outside the logical. fundamental value window) are those hoping to get the price down lower then $20k to then buy back at the $17k-$15k by using speculation of FUD, scare tactics.of a possible $11kim assuming he sold out at $20k+ and is looking to buy back in (most probably a short loan order) at a much less amount. of a real possibly $17k or at worse $15kits mainly shorter influencers(opposite of pumpers) that shout $11k or less. hoping it inspires other naive shorts to sell coin(lowering the price(opposite of a pump)) to set a buy in at that stupidly low amount .. to actually cause a sell off 'bank run' down but where the naive shorter sheep dont buy back in at $17k-$15k to stop the bank runin most cases those shouting $11k know it wont get to $11k  and are ready to buy in at the actual \"bottom\" of ~$15k worse case right now... while they cause the other naive shorters they inspire to start a 'sell off' down to $15k for the influencer to buy back a little above $15k.. .. to then leave the shorters of $17k$15k to lose out by the price never reaching the $11k amount they were influenced rebuy at",

We are in a sideways market, despite some signs of momentum but since $25k resistance was not broken we didn't turn sideways into bull market. Similarly since $20k could not be broken it also couldn't turn into a bear market either. Sideways it is for more weeks probably.P.S.

Thank you.I'm not that affected with some random tweets though, market is very volatile, that's why we won't see the price stabilizing. Maybe some sideway patterns with no movement, but still it won't last that long and it will eventually have to make a break out run, whether  going up (good), or down (bad).And you still have to factor that we are still in the bear market so the price will definitely go down. We have hit the lowest low of $17,500 already. But if my chance the price still go go below that price then as a long term hodler, then take that opporunity.",

Thank you.We know the price of Bitcoin is greatly affected by supply and demand and this supply and demand is very sensitive to economic events.  I was, too, very positive that Bitcoin will stay in the range of $24k when the relief rally happens and another good news was released that one huge company will cater to BTC service. I even thought that it might recover way past $30k  but then there are lots of events that push the BTC down.  One of which is the recent speech of FED, which triggers bear break out.I also think we will see another lower low before the Bitcoin market transitions to bullish sentiment.  But no matter what, this is a good time to do cost averaging.",

See the dip as more of an opportunity to gather more bitcoins to add up to your portfolio but still you must refuse the urge to be tempted to invest more now than you can afford to loose because the market is presenting an opportunity.",
