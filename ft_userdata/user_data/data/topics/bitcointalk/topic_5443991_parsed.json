This will help building a community as you have said but I am curious as to your claims when you have not really shown us any past track records of you doing such. However, I expected you to have listed the possible casinos where you possibly play and as well list the casinos to do play the parlays you are mentioning here. You claimed to have 10 years of experience doing this and we would need you to show us some proof. Nevertheless,  you said you have a thread in the past where you initially started this activity, why not continue with that thread rather than starting a new one. Atleast that could help you out with proofs that you have truly done this before and have the knowledge and experience as you have claimed.",
