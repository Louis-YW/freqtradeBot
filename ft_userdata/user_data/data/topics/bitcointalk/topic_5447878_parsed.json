Thx!Your choice of P2P will depend on your location because almost all P2P right now is on a centralized platform, which means they will need you to verify your account before it can be used on their platform for any form of exchange. If not, I will also recommend https://hodlhodl.com/https://localcoinswap.com/ (KYC required) I haven't used them before, but I have read about them as a decentralized P2P marketplace where you won't be required to use any form of ID verification. But if you need a place where you need to pass KYC, then I can recommend Binance for you, but you need to be careful when using any centralized exchange. Buy and withdraw to your private wallet. Don't store crypto on exchanges.",

Yea Hodlhodl is still working perfectly right now just used it few days back, the only challenge I experience their was the delay with the Marchant to confirm payment so that my BTC purchase can go straight to my wallet, and the withdrawal fee are always deducted from my end, although I know every Marchant have their own terms.
