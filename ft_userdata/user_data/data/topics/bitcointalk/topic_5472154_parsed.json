  "content": "Money is often defined as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. But that definition is generic. It says nothing about the most important thing - the value of money. How do we actually know the worth of money? That is, how can we, as market participants, determine how many units of something are worth accepting for goods or services? Let's say you're selling a bicycle, and in return, a person offers you 100 units of something they call a 'medium of exchange'. Can that generic term tell you whether the exchange is worth it or not? Well, apparently not. On the one hand, you know that a bicycle is used for transportation, recreation, and sport and that its value depends on how well it serves those purposes. On the other hand, you have no idea what purpose is served by what was offered for your bike. Therefore, for something to be money, it is not enough that it can be exchanged on the market, that it can be used as a medium of exchange. The precondition is that it can fullfil a purpose. The fulfilment generates a specific amount of benefit. The higher the benefit the higher the value. That value is then used as a reference to estimate how many units of that thing are worth accepting for goods and services.Let's therefore assume that those 100 units are 100 apples. Apples can fulfill the purpose of nutrion. By knowing that purpose, you can evaluate whether it is worth giving your bike for those 100 units. The same is true for other products that have historically been money - livestock, grain, wine, fur, metals, etc. All these products were able to fulfill purposes beyond serving as a medium of exchange. That was then used for estimating how many other products to give for them.Today, the dominant type of money is the one created by banks, i.e. fiat money. Unlike the above-mentioned types of money, it has no value in itself, i.e. it has no intrinsic value. However, as we have shown above, it is the purpose, not the form, what gives value to something. If an item can fulfill a purpose besides being exchanged on the market it has value. With fiat currencies, the purpose is the return to the banks. Namely, the units of these currencies are created as claims of commercial banks based on approved loans to individuals and companies, and as claims of central banks based on the purchase of government bonds. When they are created as such, the units are put on the market where they are used as a medium of exchange. However, since banks demand them from debtors, the units are regularly withdrawn from the market to be returned to the banks for satisfying loan and bond debt. By fulfilling this purpose, they are no longer exchanged on the market, just like apples that are eaten. And they come back to the market with new debt.As the return of fiat units is protected by collaterals, we can easily determine the value of these units. Namely, if debtors fail to return them, the banks themselves will return them after they get them on the market by selling foreclosed property of the debtors. So, if banks protect the return of 10 thousand units of some currency with low-end cars, then the value of these units is somewhere in the range of the value of these cars - the market will get such cars at the withdrawal of 10 thousand units. If banks use high-end cars as protection, the units are worth more. If they use houses, the value of the units is much higher.Now we finally come to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is said to be money. But is that true? Given the above, we can determine this quite easily. All we need to do is answer the following question: can Bitcoin fulfill a purpose besides being traded? And here the answer is resolutely - no. Namely, the way Bitcoin was created, is that its author came up with a protocol that assigns virtual points (bitcoins) to online address. The points are stored in a peer-to-peer database called blockchain. However, whichever owner of an address holds the points, cannot use them for anything except send them to another online address. They can only exchange them on the market, i.e. use them as a means of exchange. Therefore, there is no purpose that Bitcoin could fullfil to generate a specific amount of benefit to its holders. Consequently, there is no value to estimate. Due to the absence of a value as a reference for how many bitcoins is worth accepting for goods or services, market participants do that blindly. For example, they used to give two pizzas for 10 thousand bitcoins, and today they give the equivalent of a whooping 1,000 houses for the same number of bitcoins. This is a nice practical confirmation of the fact that Bitcoin is not money. It creates the illusion of money because it is exchanged but is not money because it lacks value reference.If Bitcoin is not money, then what is it? Some would now say: \"asset\", \"commodity\", \"coin\", token\", etc. Yet, all these terms refer to purposeful items that have value references. Tokens, for example, can be redeemed by the issuer for a predetermined amount of money, goods, services, etc. This amount is a value reference for estimating how many other things are worth giving for these tokens. So what exactly is Bitcoin? Well, it is a system for recording members of a decentralized and self-governing pyramid scheme. Unlike traditional pyramids, this one has no central operator that collects purposeful items. Instead, individuals pay such items into the scheme by giving them directly to existing members. Then the system records them as members by attributing a certain number of points to their online addresses. Finally, members wait for new contributors to exit the scheme. Without them, the return of purposeful items is not possible. And this is how all pyramid schemes operate. Since the Bitcoin scheme is online and thus global, early members made huge profits. This caused great public interest and created a considerable membership base. It is estimated that today the scheme has more than 200 million members. How long will that modern-day investment pyramid last is yet to be seen.",

I taught maybe you had a good idea of what you were trying to tell the community. It's pretty simple: purposeless is something that, when bought, can never be used for anything - which is why it ultimately must be sold - dumped on someone else.Money must be purposeful because only via the fulfilment of a purpose you get benefit that you then compare with the benefit that goods and services provide. Without having a purpose as a pivot for estimating how many goods or services to give for something it is impossible to make a rational trade. That's after all the reason why Bitcoin price is fluctuating so much. There's no pivot and people trade bitcoins blindly -  today a pizza for 5 thousand bitcoins, tomorrow a car for 1 bitcoin. Bitcoin is not money. It's simply a means to inform you that you invested purposeful items in the scheme where you need new investors to get out and return purposeful items.",

Even if you introduce someone to buy Bitcoin, there's no guarantee you'll make money just because your friend becomes a Bitcoin investor. This is purely because it's an open market where anyone can buy and sell Bitcoin.The number of investors may increase, and prices may rise, then offering profits by this moments...  but blockchain technology is irreplaceable, and Bitcoin is a strong example of a cryptocurrency with a large community that's part of Bitcoin.If a Bitcoin ETF gets approved by the SEC, would you still call Bitcoin a pyramid scheme?? After all, something with a limited supply and increasing demand tends to see price increases, right? Take, for instance, land and real estate in Singapore. Limited supply and booming districts certainly drive their prices sharply upward over time.",

I do believe that Bitcoin can function as money since I can use it to buy some things in some places where it is accepted. Now, for people who are hoarding as many BTC as they can in preparation for the next bull run in 2024, BTC can be an investment or an speculative asset.

This doesn't make any sense to me. Banks created a system, governments legalized that system and now the citizens are forced to use that system. This system was at a time backed by gold which has real value, but that was ditched and now it has no intrinsic value.Trying to draw a connection between collateral and value is a high reach. For there to be a transfer of value then every unit is backed by the other asset which is not the case in fiat. And with the concept of credit which makes it possible to spend money you don't have to pay in the future, there will be a huge deficit using your argumentI would not have bothered replying if I had jumped to the end and read the gibberish about pyramid scheme.

Bitcoin does all that.  People use Bitcoin to get goods and services, they invest in it as a store of value, and even use it to measure the value of other assets.  It's traded like any currency.  The Bitcoin market sets prices for other cryptocoins too. so Bitcoin works as money because people find it useful and are willing to exchange goods, services, or other assets for it. If people are willing to sell real goods for digital tokens, those tokens take on value.but Bitcoin is different than old-fashioned money though.  It doesn't have physical intrinsic value like gold.  But it's valuable because crypto users trust it.  They trust Bitcoin, so it works as digital money.  The whole decentralized network backs it up. So it works like money because people use it like money.",

Meaning, when bitcoins are bought they can never be used for anything, and whoever holds them must ultimately sold them - dump them on someone else.Due to the lack of a purpose whose fulfilment would generate a specific amount of benefit, there's no pivot for estimating how many bitcoins to accept for goods or services and is, thus, impossible to perform a rational trade.B) Why is Bitcoin a pyramid-style scheme?Because whoever invested purposeful items in it cannot get such items back without new investors. So, it's not about definitions. It's about reality. In reality Bitcoin is purposeless and existing investors need new investors to get out. Definitions cannot change reality.",

You can purchase your shoe and other products and properties with gold or other products and properties, which makes your definition faulty.Currency is rather a LEGAL TENDER (fiat) note and others backed by the central bank of a country.currency is a broad term...then within the term there are different types of currencythere are many types of currency. money is the \"legal tender\" subcategory of currency.. not the other way roundbitcoin does have its own community and association that xBTC is worth $yyyyy bitcoin is not the money of US central bank. the US central bank just sees bitcoin as an asset currencybitcoin is OUR money",
