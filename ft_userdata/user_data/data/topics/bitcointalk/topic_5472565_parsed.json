We gotta keep in mind that even if these people have the cajones to carry their cause no matter how much threat is put under their head, it doesn't erase the fact that them going out there spewing truth about certain issues puts them at a definite risk, maybe even to their families. Perhaps a more comprehensive way of figuring out whether certain people or entities are liable of the crimes they committed could be made where the government doesn't need to endanger people who have little to do with the situation. I guess it's good that we're paying them but the thing is their lives are at stake despite the fact.",

Binance has just been fined $4.3 billion, which means more money for the CFTC and greater pay for whistleblowers. Quote from: zasad@ on November 16, 2023, 11:48:49 AMIt turns out to be profitable to keep Whistleblowers!I totally support the effort of these government agencies to purge the crypto space from criminals and scammers. The crypto sector will attract more investors if these evil players are pushed out of the industry. But the CFTC shouldn't use its powers to witchhunt genuine crypto businesses.",

I hope the identity of these whistleblowers will not be leaked to the public someday which might put their lives in danger because there might also be moles in CFTC.  I believe that these whistleblowers will mostly be from within the institutions or companies targeted by the CFTC, these are mostly employees within these institutions and may be in good positions within these institutions and privy to a lot of sensitive information.Of course, their main goal is to obtain money through reporting, and they may also be exempted from all legal or criminal charges and responsibilities due to their cooperation with the CFTC.But they are playing a dangerous game, and the CFTC is unable to fully protect them if they are targeted as a result of the significant damage they inflict on these companies. We are accustomed to the US government abandoning its agents at the first opportunity.",
