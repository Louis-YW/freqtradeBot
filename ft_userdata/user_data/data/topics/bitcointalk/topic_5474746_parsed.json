  "content": "I've hoped that I didn't need to post this topic but due to the fact that mikeywith keeps his accusations and dort campaign against me going, I’ve decided to post this topic finally. I know, this shouldn't be controversial at all but after mikeywith brought up a strange accusation against me, I believe it's helpful to clarify a few things. I’m not someone who likes to create unnecessary drama, so I’m having a very simple approach but more about that later. The accusation of mikeywith against me boils down to a recent disagreement between us, where mikeywith pushed islamist propaganda but got very angry when this was called out by me. After a very heated interaction, I thought we would agree to disagree and avoid each other to prevent both of us wasting time for this. I’ve put mikeywith on my distrust list due to this incident until further evaluation. Of course, mikeywith continued to spread his bullshit propaganda but I’ve ignored that because that’s his issue and I’m not the one to seek drama. Then, few weeks later, mikeywith starts slapping in my face with his shit-stirring topic „Is 1miau fit for DT?“, where he accuses me of being „incompetent for DT“, while mikeywith seems to be the one who’s not getting over my distrust list entry due to that incident we had back then. It’s new to me that we have to explain our distrust list entries. There are tons of beef on the forum and everyone is well advised to grow a thicker skin if someone doesn’t like certain trust exclusions. Imagine the drama we would have here if everyone reacted like mikeywith did. I’m deeply disappointed by mikeywith with his poor attempt now to damage my reputation due to our disagreement. The recent accusation of mikeywith against me is just another approval that I did the right choice by adding him on my distrust list, which I can recommend in general. Creating drama dirt campaign with misleading accusations is what I would expect from our anti DT forum trolls. This can also be a helpful advice: when it comes to DT, who's including / excluding you on their trust list, growing a thicker skin can be helpful instead of shady attempts to damage one’s reputation. After all, misleading accusations will come back to the ones spreading them.",

In theory with a correct use of the trust system you should not include or exclude someone for their political views, but for their ability to write correct feedbacks, and for their trusts lists. Although as I said in the other thread, I doubt very much that because of this one incident people will start to massively distrust you.I am of capitalist ideology, more right-wing if you will, and I have on my trust list known leftists on the forum.",

We can agree or disagree to anything, DT will change based on the viewpoints of each community member. Of course DT will also have a look at possible abuses but there has to be valid proof not just speculation. There have been controversies all day. Sometimes justified, sometimes not justified. What I don't like are smear campaigns where mostly speculations or personal feelings are the whole issue. That's helping no one but as usual DT will also sort out these issues. If someone doesn't like my DT or forum activity or the DT activity or forum activity of mikeywith, distrusting is an easy thing to to and that's how DT reaches consensus. If someone doesn't like the DT system don't participate but I think everyone should participate in DT to make it more decentralized. Of course we will have forum trolls as well, who will pour oil in the fire but DT will survive ans sort this out, too.",

After a very heated interaction, I thought we would agree to disagree and avoid each other to prevent both of us wasting time for this. 1miau you made a mistake, and instead of fixing it you are now adding more lies to your story, it's like you are digging a bigger whole for no reason, I was not angry,  you were, my posts and so are yours are still there, people can judge for themselves, you started the insults publically, you sent me a PM full of hate, keep in mind that up to this point, I have not insulted you even once, and I am still not mad at you.QuoteI’ve put mikeywith on my distrust list due to this incident until further evaluation. Yes, so a DT member like yourself decides his trust list and feedback based on political opinions? QuoteThe recent accusation of mikeywith against meBut you did not deny any of my accusations against you, did you? You edited your trust list based on political reasons, you removed positive feedback you left due to political reasons, you tagged another forum member (right after he showed disagreement to your post in P&S), you even saidQuote5. I'm allowed to tag any troll and I already gave digaran a pass way back in 2022 when I came over him but didn't bother to \"poke\" the troll digaran.This means if it was not for the political disagreement, you would have not tagged him.Anyway, this old tactic of attacking someone who exposed you just to discredit them so that their claims become less important is just silly, you keep losing credibility, and you are better off defending yourself than attacking me, unless, of course, you have nothing to defend yourself with.QuoteOf course DT will also have a look at possible abuses but there has to be valid proof If using the trust system to punish those who disagree with your political point of view is not abuse -- I don't know what is. and as for valid proof, everything you did was mentioned in the main topic",

You already did in the original topic, so what is the point of starting a new topic for the same thing? Since you keep your smear topic going against me, I'm well allowed to point out your misleading topic, where you are trying to \"punish\" me (that's how you call this) for simply distrusting your judgement due to our disagreement in P&S board. I've so many idiots in my DT list and there have been very little complaints about it, that I've excluded them from my trust list.  Seems to be that you are afraid about my topic otherwise there wouldn't be any need for you to ask me such strange questions, where even you know the answer. Bring up accusations against me = expect that I'll address them. What else...Quote from: mikeywith on November 20, 2023, 09:42:33 AM1miau you made a mistake, and instead of fixing it you are now adding more lies to your storyI didn't make any mistake, mikeywith. I can customize my trust list inclusions and exclusions as I like, for certain reasons like attitude, sort of arguments etc. for pushing fraudulent shitcoins, opposing my educational topics, doing bad translations, opposing privacy, shilling CSW, plagiarism and also their attitude in political discussions and that's none of your business. If I include any proven abusers in my trust list, present the proof here but you can't because your accusations against me are empty.Now, you are trying like a weasel to discredit me with your topic but no surprise, nobody cares. I don't need anything from you anymore. We will go different ways and that's completely fine for me. Deal with it and grow a thicker skin.",

      "body": "Why would someone gets angry for detrusting them in his or her list. If anyone get detrusted it shows that such user is no longer comfortable trusting them anymore so it shows that they aren't trusted to be their Trustlist anymore. Again for us to be as one family we have to avoid some sensitive political and religious discussion or argument because it easily leads to conflicts which I know too well that is the number one thing that stirred up conflicts between two religious group and, someone like me that is learning to grow a thicker skin have learnt to take most of the things we puts into heart as jokes. Why would anyone harbor a case for someone in his heart over a community we are as one family despite we are of different countries and religious that doesn't portrays the mission of this forum and bitcoin at large, what happened is whenever you have a little case with anyone just let them go provided you are free from any accusations they tried to label on you.You both are a reputable members which if I am not mistakenly there may be other users you are their secret role model and, come to think of this if they are following you both and noticed something like this what messages or what roles are you trying to play in their lives. To learn how to harbor case, keep malice or speak against religious beliefs? Before I was thinking DT's are people who don't make case or people who are well understandable and can handle case amicably no matter how hard and difficulty it's they would settle without any extension of it. Whatever case I have here ends here immediately I am out of here and I don't come back to start digging on same case because I let it go. Over the time as I keep growing overhere the more I grow up the more I also grow a  thicker skin and strong mind not to be affected by anyone because I believe here is community and we don't expect here to be free sweet and smooth without any disagreement or whatever we do. As educated individual there should be some things we takes as common since no user here takes care of you or your household there's nothing anyone else should do to affect you or harm you provided we don't violate the forum.Side note: My write up doesn't goes to anyone directly rather I am giving my general overview about this case so this shouldn't mean anyone to put me in their mind as an enemy or someone who doesn't support them with their argument. Let love leads and DT members should stop fighting themselves be a good leader to others and newbies.",

Mikey’s thread is not self-moderated which means you can air your opinion there without the fear of you being censored so why this thread? It looks like both of you just want attention from others.It's a habit of his and other similar to him...When things aren't going his way in the original thread, he'll create a new one that suits him better to sway the opinion forming in the other thread, then he'll bank on his buddies to illegitimize the original reasoned opinion and legitimize the new one that works for him with their help. Then, when the other party involved is worn out from his endless (mostly useless) discussions, he'll claim victory.It's sad that members have not noticed this from him and others, or at least commented on it. Maybe it's just not of importance to them, maybe these members are feared...or something more...it's too hard to officially comment on it - but it is clear to see it by this point I believe.Mikeywith is an exemplary member, yet, his reasonable voice could not be heard over the loud noise of 1miau and his circle. Replace mikeywith with any other non dt1 circle member and it will always go the same way, no matter what evidence is presented of wrong doing that, if any other member committed, they would be tarnished for.I have tried to have non biased discussions after the kicks and rants of 1miau's voice, I too had a new thread with a changed opinion, flooded with mostly garbage and backtracking from 1miau and JollyGood. I am still yet to post my last response after roughly 2 weeks, simply because it takes too much energy to converse with these clowns....and if I'm going to make a final post, it has to drop not just the mic but the hammer too.But all of that aside, I think the best takeaway is:If you converse with people like 1miau, you best create a case that is air tight and irrefutable before posting. Otherwise, prepare for tiresome energy consumption on trying to respond to the shit storm that almost always ensues.Quote from: JollyGood on November 21, 2023, 11:48:23 AMAnd you decided to take the opportunity to wake up your Saheedu account after 5 months of inactivity in the forum, just to make your post instead of using any of your more prominent accounts?

My views aren't the same but similar except if I shared them, I know it would lead to weeks of battling and defending from people like you, who will do or say anything (truthful and not truthful) in order to win an internet debate...and ultimately, because of how tight knit the DT circle is, it will be tireless effort for no cause for the party that is on the other end.",
