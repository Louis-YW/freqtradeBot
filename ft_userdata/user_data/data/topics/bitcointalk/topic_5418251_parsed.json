If a person dies while having an active loan with someone in the forum, that should be the end of it because there is no way an heir or next of kin is going to pay back the loan, except the loanee is a kind of person that communicates to his family about any loan taken even from a forum like ours, and directs them to always pay back should anything happen to him, in that case if the member is that kind of person and his family have the password to his forum account, then the loan can be repaid.",

To verify death cases, it requires more information, more contact in person and mostly we don't have it.After a forum member passed away, if the member has great net-effect and contributions, the head admin (theymos/ Cyrus) can give some special treatments as followA special badge like In MemoriamLock that account permanently for security reason like what were done for accounts of satoshi and LaudaInvestigate further like case of paraipanCommunity members can keep investigation going with scammers who suddenly passed away or faked their deaths as well as flow of scam money.Bitcointalk's Hall of fame",

Example is someone that is travelling and had a car accident and instantly died. It could be in a way he had no friend or family that will pay back the loan. Family is even what we can consider more because friends can know about it and do not do anything because only family can be concerned if they are capable of paying the loan. Even the deceased family may not know anything about bitcointalk, not to talk of knowing anything about the deceased having loan to pay back.",

Furthermore, it is up to the heirs or relatives of the deceased whether they believe the loan was ever made (this is a pseudo-anonymous forum) or even care about it. In this case the lender has only a glimmer of hope, but according to our belief, the dead should not leave debt unless the lender give it up.",

Here, if someone died they can't login to anymore so obviously the red tag will be under their name forever.",

The settlement will occur between the lender and the borrower. if the borrower has died, and still leaves an active loan. no one can solve it. If the family finds out, I think it can still be resolved.in the case of Pandukelana2712, he has already given a will to his friends or relatives. it can be solved although it turns out to take quite a while to figure it all out.",

Since nobody else will use it (nor know) it doesn't matter much.So imho for the lender there's not much of a difference whether the \"customer\" runs with the money or dies.The amounts of money are usually small and the expense of getting after his family would be greater.However, this kind of stuff doesn't happen much, so imho you're worrying for no use.",

It's different case if that person wish to keep asset which isn't fully paid yet or cosigned a loan with the deceased one.Any debt is usually passed on spouse or other family members, but I have no idea how this would apply for coins someone borrowed in bitcointalk forum.Legality of this is not cleat in many jurisdictions, and people could also remain private, not connecting bitcointalk account with their real identity.Quote from: yahoo62278 on October 25, 2022, 02:00:48 PMIs this person's real full name known? Do we know 100% this isn't a scam where someone is trying to dodge repaying a debt? Can a death certificate be produced?

All loans here in the forum is not legally binded by the law since the contract is just between the lender and the borrower. This is the risk that lender willing to risk by providing loans on anonymous borrower. Only trust is the one connecting both parties to this loan agreement.The loan will die here if the user didn't respond for a long time or forfeit. Many user already defaulted on there loan and none of them is put on jail or being pursue by the law. This is loan default is same when the user passed away.",

He was actually responsible at the end of his life, by entrusting money to his relative/colleague to pay debts in this forum (because at that time he was seriously ill and given the mandate). However, for several logical reasons, this fact can only be conveyed several days ago, when 1000 days after his death.Hopefully, with this, his good name will be clean again and there will be no more misunderstandings regarding the debt. And currently, the loan repayment seems to be in process.Quote from: vv181 on October 20, 2022, 12:14:52 AMThe repayment will be handled by Pandu's friends, dewo_sat, and with the help of Roycilik. He will send the IDR amount of 0.064 BTC, and then Roycilik will send the bitcoin repayment to DarkStar_.At least that is the current plan, he still needed a few days to collect the money.In my opinion, because pandukelana has entrusted money to his friend to pay his debt to Darkstar_ then I think now his friend must be responsible for paying it off to the lender. But either way Darkstar_ may have an answer to your question and I don't think we ever know how it will be decided.",

From my understanding I thought the guy had left some money with someone to repay the debt? Maybe I misunderstood?The loan has been over 2 years now, clearly the user is a loan defaulter who had no intention of paying, and his account is already useless as we speak, so I don't understand why he would fake his own death over a loan he had no intention of paying.Nobody is going to submit a death certificate because we don't have any leverage to demand it, and death announcements aren't something we should politicize. If his local community declares him dead, he is dead. Perhaps a good samaritan will pay off his forum debt and release his soul from the bonds of the other world.",

I don't know for sure if someone has ever written off a loan and forgotten it when someone out there had gotten the money to pay off the loan to the lender before death. In the pandukelana case, he had asked his friend to pay off the loan (in progress) so maybe it would be different from other cases.",
