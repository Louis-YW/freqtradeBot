  "content": "Hello everyone, I'd like to introduce you to a foreign BNB faucet site that I've been using for about a month now. They have businesses in Mexico, and you can see the details on Google Maps. They provide services in four languages, but they only respond to emails in English.I've received payments three times, albeit in small amounts. However, I no longer request payments because there are extra earning opportunities if you don't immediately withdraw the earnings from your account.The site is reliable and absolutely requires no investment. On average, I earn around 0.50 - 1$ daily just from the faucet, thanks to my referrals.However, if you complete Surveys and Offer Walls, you can earn up to 20$ a day. Of course, surveys are not always available, and some surveys can be canceled due to incorrect or contradictory answers. But when you look at the overall outcome, you always end up profitable.My recommendation is to complete tasks from the companies in the Timewall and Monlix menus. Because these tasks are approved instantly and are usually not canceled.Surveys in the CPX menu can be very lucrative, but they can be canceled in some cases. I've received payments from there before.This site is an intermediary site, and your earnings depend on how many surveys and offer tasks you complete. They take a certain percentage for themselves and provide us with instant payments.I've been earning from similar sites for a long time, but this one is not even a year old yet, and they organize some really great events. Truly impressive earnings are possible. I'm quite fond of this site.If you use my referral, I will earn a commission of 10% to 20% from all your earnings, but you will still earn the same amount; I'll just earn extra.You can check the statistics page for payment proofs. Since the platform is blockchain-based, all transfers are transparently listed.Note: The site is not an investment platform! In fact, it doesn't even have a page for depositing money; you only earn through advertisements and tasks.Minimum Withdraw: 0.50$ I have copied the Frequently Asked Questions section here for you.It's Free?Registering in the system and earning is completely free, it does not require any investment, you can only earn passive earning in the long term with the time you allocate daily.How to register?We only ask you to enter your Binance Smart Chain(BEP20) address, which consists of 42 characters, required to register and create a withdrawal request. Your winnings will only be sent to the address you entered.In this way, forget password etc. There is no need to worry about the security of your personal information. After the address you entered, you can create a registration by clicking the Connect button and then log in in the same way.When are payments sent?You must reach the minimum amount to withdraw the Binance Coins you have earned.When you reach the minimum amount, it will be sent to your account instantly without requiring confirmation in some cases.However, in some cases, if you are considered to have made suspicious transactions, your withdrawal request will wait during the approval process.For Referral Membership:https://freebnbco.in/en/ref/1690992133For Non-Referral Membership:https://freebnbco.in/en/",
