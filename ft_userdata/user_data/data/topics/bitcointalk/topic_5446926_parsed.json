This does not mean that they will be familiar with digital currencies and blockchain applications. Traffic should be more specific.As for earn from referral links, It all depends on the content you provide on your website or blog where you will persuade visitors to click on the link. There are many free online tutorials and YouTube videos that explain how a successful referral program works.In general, referral programs in the crypto field are not very profitable due to the limited number of users in this field. If you are a beginner, I advise you to focus on an easier niche.",

Sometimes we just wake up and notice the sites are no more. Some will end up telling you to make a first deposit to their platform to prove that you are human and not a robot or a scammer, or whatever they will twist the story to look like. I have actually not received any reasonable referral reward from any crypto platform, so I gave up before I became the victim of another time-wasting scam.",

Once you done it it will just continue to on giving tasks until you haven't notice you've done a lot and still not getting the money. Sometimes referrals will give you money for each invited but its not a full money its like 1/4 of the mentioned prizes. For you to get it in whole you'll have to follow it. Influencers mostly benefits from this since a lot of follower would try to earn from their idols. When the site like rugpulled they will just alibi that they are paid to advertise it.",

And I did some very light advertising, people who spent more time on it, like making a dedicated blog, earned much more. Referral programs can be very lucrative if you have a large audience.

These firms will keep giving you more conditions before you might be paid. They might say you should refer three people but after that, you will be told that until they make deposits you will not get your referral bonus. Getting people to register was very challenging and convincing them to make a deposit was not easy so I gave up the task of bringing people. I have heard about people making a few bucks from referrals, maybe they met the right people and crypto firm at the right time. But you need a large followership on social media for you to make money from social media adverts.",

But some people who like this kind of thing always use the method by displaying a very attractive appearance in front of everyone and showing a little asset to everyone who wants to be made their referral so that more people are interested in following in his footsteps through it.",

For example, very early on I only had a couple of referrals on the cex.io platform and I converted all the profit from that into Dogecoin. at some point, I had about 95k Doge from it. I leave it to you to think at what moment I sold them.  QuoteI had tried by running ptc ads on PTC site (no google adsense or facebook ads) I didn't got results(which is obvious why someone invest in nexo if he is trying to earn through PTC sites)the worst way to do it is because PTC programs are only for building website traffic, they are often served by bots that are completely useless for affiliates. No leads from there.Quotehow you refer what do you do to convince anyone to make account on sites. like you have blog, website, etc.i heard on this forum, some people said i had over 100 referral. i also want that much referral, can you suggest some ideas?blog, email, social media etc.. are probably the best channels for promotions. you can also use some platforms like Medium, Steemit, Quora and similar. also, keep in mind that you must not advertise in related categories. Some platforms do not allow leaving referral links, like this forum.You will not offer Binance referral links to cooking and recipe pages. today it is very difficult to reach a new Binance user who will be active, certainly not on a PTC site.",

Somehow I was convinced to sign up for a referral link upon reading a detailed trading strategy to make money. I think this is very timely because people today are trying to find ways to make money.It worked on me, I guess it should also work for some. How-tos or articles that is providing procedures on how to do things made me sign up.   The only hinder to this is finding people that will read your article which I guess you still need to market/promote the article.",
