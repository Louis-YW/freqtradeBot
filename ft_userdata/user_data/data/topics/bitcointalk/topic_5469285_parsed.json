On the contrary, if you find a wife who helps you in your financial affairs, this means doubling the money that flows to you and thus achieving wealth quickly.The solution is always to start your financial life early and financial education. If you start your financial life early, before the age of thirty you will reach the financial well-being that enables you to get married and do everything you love in your life.Choosing the wrong wife may lead to the complete opposite and will be a failed project. Therefore, choosing the wife is what will determine whether a project is successful or unsuccessful.",

A lot of people would like to settle down in life live a family life. Not everything is done for money. Having passive income is important though. It can be achieved through rental income, business investments etc. More passive income you have, the better. That's obviously true! But different people have different ways.

Both parties must consider their compatibility level and of course their tolerance level. It will be too bad to end up with a partner you cannot tolerate their excesses or the partner cannot tolerate yours.My partner should have some traits that will be able to sustain the union. Everyman definitely needs a woman that can stand in for him during meetings and other functions when he is unavoidably unavailable  and not some queens who have only beauty and curves to offer.A man does not need to double his passive income as you said in OP because of marriage, rather you can make your friend to start getting a passive income to help the family.",

Finance is part of life, and with most of the marriages money used to be a problem. Mutual respect unlike the earning ability increase the love for each other. Marrying a person for financial benefits is not good. The right way is to make plans and succeed financially.Every human agonize for some appreciation and moral support whenever we feel low. Marrying the right person makes it happen, and growing together is very enjoyable. Hardships can be shared and solutions can be got. As suggested starting the financial life at the earliest helps you better when you're looking for a person to share the rest of your life and there is no need of looking passive income out of marriage.",

I can however say that rental doesn't really have to mean a house, not like you can't buy a house, but you do not \"have to\" buy a house, you could always end up buying something else and you could make that profit some other way as well.For example, if you have a huge storage that you could rent out, not a warehouse but like a big size storage then you could end up doing that too and you could make a profit that way. I get that it may not be all that great or anything like that but you could always end up with anything that benefits you that way. You could rent anything really, I know a friend of my dad that rented construction equipment for example, he didn't even used them, he had a parking lot deal with someone and just put all those machinery there and then rented it every month to someone.",

Families have saved men in times of trouble. And bounce them back to a financial free life condition. Its not completely a bad decision to marry. At first, it'll look too expensive, but soon the whole thing will be less stressful, when the body adapts to the new lifestyle. They've been situation where the man would depend on the extended family for business ideas and money allocation. Marrying rich for both parties is favorable to the different families in unique ways. If a man finds refuge and kindness from her woman's family, he can go ahead and marry her. Riches come differently, that's why people make money through abstract ways. Every good thing also appears with a disadvantage. Other may be making or fixing a stress free financial ideas through their family, while another will lose what they've worked all their life, because of a bad family. So, whatever you feel works for you, may be wrong for the next person. I do not agree to a good percentage, your advise or idea. Doing our research is also in marriages. The western world introduced courtship, for discovering the details of your to be wife. Any woman that think Sugar dafdy will enrich them, they're doing to themselves no favor. The trauma of having multiple sugar daddies can affect the woman in future. Whether they luckily and finally fell into a rich family. They will be bad progress on the life of the woman in the family. Which may affect the entire family. One bad egg spoils the rest of the other eggs. Hence, ideas as that, belong to the ones I say no to. It's not a good idea. The woman may develop a PTSD.",

Not actually one should be financially rich before getting married, but let it be that the person can be able to cater for themselves and the person they are marrying. Marriage is not something to walk into not mentally or financially ready to go about what's inside it. As it is in marriage, money is not the focus before getting married but it plays a big role in the peace and unity of the home. That's how we also say that love is not enough but the financial capabilities of both parties that want to be husband and wife. For both to succeed in the marriage they can learn to join hands together without placing the responsibility to provide for the family on one person.
