I personally also use Binance for trading and I haven't found any problem with that exchange so far, but I must tell you that Binance is a centralized exchange and that's why they will ask you for KYC information especially if you want to trade via P2P trading method. If you have any queries regarding Binance trading then feel free to ask, I will try my best to guide you as much as I possibly can.",

Regarding the question, yes a lot of members on the local board are using Binance. I am pretty confident that most of us are trading on it as I do. I am not sure whether they are using any other services. Please don't use Binance P2P trade if you are based in India. The reason behind most Merchants operating there are scammers. If you use P2P then there is a possibility that your bank account might get frozen.",
