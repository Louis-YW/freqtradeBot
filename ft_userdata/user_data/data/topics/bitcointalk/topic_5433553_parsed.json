Many times when I go to post, I feel very annoyed to see such a warning, so it is necessary to turn it off.  So I am sharing this topic with everyone. Hope this post will be helpful especially for new users who are new and don't know about this . And now those who do bounties. they know that the bounties are limited which makes it a barrier to post POA quickly. so this will be very important for them. But if I have done any mistake by posting this then I apologize to everyone. So let's see the  screenshots below .how to turn it off.1. -First enter Look and Layout Preferences as shown in the screenshotThen enable  don't warn on new replies made while posting. and Save it . simple",

So let's see the  screenshots below .how to turn it off.Well, that's useful   Everyone for sure is annoyed by this notification, especially when you finish your post then all of a sudden when you clicked the post button it will not go through, then you need to click the post button again. I remember there are times that I lost my post since I thought my post go through then I need to retype it again which is annoying.But thinking about the notification it reminds you that there was a new message posted in a thread and you could base your post or maybe reply to that new post, I think it's actually useful and I will not disable that notification.Quote from: Helena Yu on January 09, 2023, 04:46:20 AMThanks @OP I'm not aware if this forum has such feature, also hide user's avatar and signature too.For me, turn off the new replies isn't good because posting in this forum isn't a competition to create the fastest post, you're need to create a high quality post and if there's user who beat you above, it mean you need to review his post and if he wrote something wrong, you can correct it.I think if there's above member who have same opinion with your post, you're shouldn't to post it since it just make spam in this forum.You're absolutely right.

It must have been very annoying to OP to have search it out. I don't find it any annoying at all and as such, it's not a necessity to be turned off. Maybe you don't realise it's usefulness as it alerts you to review current response which might carry same judgement or suggestion as you are about to make to avoid repetition or spreading same exact ideas or could invalidate a response as it could be the announcement of the closure of a thread.There could be a lot of other reasons that validates it so, it ain't a bad feature.",

Like WTF?Theymos is really a genius to have made something like that as an option to synchronize; cus sometimes, I really see it as a bug or something... But on the other hand, it's helpful cus it makes me realize (when I'm already done typing) that someone else made a post/ review....so I'll be like -- I need to Check out for what the person said -- just so I don't repeat the same thing....Just like when I was typing this one, it happened.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

Personal opinion:If you feel annoyed by such warning then you are trying to post AFAP and not trying to add new value to the topic you are trying to respond to.Reading above comment, which was posted while you are writing a response, will help you improve the quality of the responses, and therefore disabling this feature is not a good thing.",

By default it really doesn't matter to me, and so far I've never disabled it even after almost 7 years. But maybe, it just depends on the habits of each user and the forum provides that feature for them.Instead of thinking about this feature, I tend to think how to ask the admin to enable email notification when one topic is deleted. In the last week, 2 of my posts were also deleted in one topic that probably has more than 1 page, of course not an issue with the deletion, but I just wanted to get notification that the topic and all posts were deleted.",
