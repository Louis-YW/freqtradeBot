A question by the way, is the crash game licensed by the Bustabit?There's a lot of information that we needed to know first before joining any airdrop, so I think Weed Daddy team should focus on this first by educating the gamblers and introducing the site properly instead of this airdrop. Though owning that NFT can be a big thing for a small time gambler but how can we trust the site without any proper introduction? My concern is also about their license and of course more details about their KYC policy.",

Plus, the NFT scene is declining like a ticking time bomb. Just an honest opinion though..I was skeptical to make a comment about this since I can not find any link about the casino website however I just realized that this is just a startup project casino that early selling there NFT. I agree that this project should focus first on the casino since this where will the NFT be used for. There NFT will be useless without except staking feature which very common in NFT industry.The topic too should be move out of the gambling section and place to project development or altcoin announcement section since this an NFT announcement and not a casino itself. The theme of the project is indeed dope but it's relevancy as casino is none.",

This could attract more attention from people around the forum maybe also outsides from the forum as well. So i will say take your time and build your project around the bear market then in bull you can make whatever promotion you feel like making to get you a stability.Good luck with your project.",
