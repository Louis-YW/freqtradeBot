I have never tried it before.@FadedV1rtue If you can't find what you are looking for, you can create a new thread in the Services section and ask if someone is willing to make the purchase for you with fiat, while you pay the person in Bitcoin. Be careful not to run into a scammer. Doing it that way would reveal your identity if you ship the item to your house.",

Here was your mistake. Adding 4,000$ to a brand new acount on  Amazon. It's a well know flag to see Amazon locking your account.Bitrefill, for exemple, display a message to avoid adding a huge amount.I know in such case Amazon asks for document much more than the police. I've been in the same situation during 9 months, and finally got my account back by playing the idiot village card Quote from: FadedV1rtue on February 27, 2023, 07:33:29 PMDoes this site require kyc on more expensive purchases, or is it no kyc across the board?It has been years since I used the website but if I remember correctly there is no KYC verification for \"Shoppers\" but only for \"Earners\"",

Such warning is about the restrictions I mentioned.That is something that has stopped me from buying them in the past.",

Looks like you need to make a scam accusation against them and provide proofs. Services who confiscated funds just because it was flagged by their system without fully using the service should not be tolerated, they could at least refund your money.",
