  "content": "This story is truly heartbreaking, knowing that a 72-year-old woman lost her entire life savings and inheritance, totaling $224,000, to crypto scammers. They used a deepfake video of Christopher Luxon, the New Zealand Prime Minister, to lure her in. She got interested and responded, which is where things took a dark turn. A scammer, pretending to be Adam Manolas, who claimed to be an expert investment adviser, convinced her to open accounts with Easy Crypto and Binance. She thought her Bitcoin was safe in her Binance wallet, but instead, it was sent to an account controlled by the scammers. Once they emptied her savings, they even took funds that were meant for her grandchildren. In one of their last calls, she overheard him say, \"This woman has no money.\"It's painful to see how these scammers target older people, especially those who aren't tech-savvy and are more vulnerable to these tricks. I can't even begin to imagine how our granny feels after losing everything she worked for and inherited. Some might find it too much to handle and could even consider taking their own lives because of it. These scammers are truly cruel, and they deserve to rot in hell.Her message really shows the deep pain she's endured with her experience.Quote‘Evil will come to you’In an email this week, Creasy castigated the scammers who stole her life savings, warning that “evil will come to you”.“You told me you are known as ‘Money Manolas’,” she wrote. “Are you a thief?”“If you entrusted me with your money I would pay you back when you asked for it.“I hope your 74-year-old mother is safe from predators like you.”Creasy told the Herald Luxon’s apparent endorsement was “the fishhook” for her investing. She’d believed her money was “safe and secure”.It was devastating to learn she’d been tricked by criminals and that her retirement nest egg was gone.“First of all I felt angry and then I felt foolish, then I felt really ashamed.”source : https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/pensioner-loses-224k-after-being-tricked-by-ai-deepfake-christopher-luxon-cryptocurrency-investment-scam/",

This indicate how dangerous the technology now for adults and maybe there relatives will educate them on those crazy activities happening in internet so that they would be aware on online scams.For us who know this scheme this is pretty basic, but for those who join late they are the one who's prone to experience such scams like this.",

Still though, crypto is indeed making the scammers’ job easier nobody can deny that because the transactions are irreversible. Old people should steer clear of crypto unless they are very well informed and know exactly what they are doing. One missclick and all gone. It is that easy to lose money in crypto.

It's unfortunate that some people still have a better taste for people's hard earn money, rather than working for theirs. The 72 year old grandma never saw this coming, and I believe most 72 year old will likely fall for such scams, because it's a very common scam that I think mainly targets those that are far older. Though, I'm still surprise that scammers still uses deepfake video technic to scam people these days.The damage has already been done, but if it's possible to track those funds back to any cex, then I really hope those criminals are arrested and brought to justice. I believe this news might probably get to the ears of someone in authority that can help the granny take up the matter, if only it's still very much traceable back to a cex.",

Actually a lot of victims of similar circumstances has lost their lives because of that, so preferably creating awareness to the public will be very nice because since older people has become the target of such crypto scammers so if the media is able to pass such information across it will be helpful, Though what made the woman to be very confident was the Christopher Luxon she saw on the picture because she believes that she was directly dealing with their Prime Minister.",

Having inherited funds and saving them again for a generational inheritance and then get them all lost to scammer? That is sorry.The tricks used by these scammers are highily neutralizing to their weak targets and making them vulnerables. I will always say that the tactics of scammers can not be whole revealed because these people are too smart than we may think and they are always developing new strategies in thrive of luring their victims on targets.There is this video tool I know you to be Webcam, it is a front camera in the PC which when you plays anyone's video in the system and then switches over to video call, the people on the video call with you is automatically assumed who he/she is seeing on the video call is reall but it is a scam.They would mute the video background voices and while the video plays, the scammers takes over the vocal and as the scammers speaks, you would quite believe the people you sees in the video is real so when you realistically believe on the person whom the scammer claims to be such as the Christopher Luxon of the New Zealand Prime Minister, they then uses the medium to instruct you convinceably to lure you and steal your funds.I believe such was a medium used to fraud this old woman.Please let us always watch out and resist to trust online instructors but if need be, always consult for verification and staying updated on what legitimate or illegitimate possibilities it could be.",
