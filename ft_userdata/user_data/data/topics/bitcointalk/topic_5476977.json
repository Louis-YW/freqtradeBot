I use all of them to buy bitcoin because I can use father's credit card for expenses such as food, clothes. I can buy Bitcoin on a satoshi basis every month, but when I see people buying Bitcoin basis on the internet, I feel like I'm too behind myself. Maybe they have a much higher income than me because they have a job. I think I can only invest $100 a month for the next year or two, would that be enough?

      "body": "I just replied to your other post if I am not mistaken. Like I said, buying $100 every month is very okay. You must not buy with thousands or millions. What matters is that you buy, you’re consistent at it (you don’t miss any month), and you do not ever touch the Bitcoin for any reason. Do the math for a couple of years and you’d see that it’s a lot of money. Selling your computer may not be necessary because like you said, it’s like $600. But I think a computer is something the average person needs.",

      "body": "It all depends on your income. If 100$ is something you can comfortably spend, go for it. It is enough only if you can afford it. It can be too much also. Don't spend what you can't afford to lose in buying Bitcoin, because it can spend extensive amounts of time below your entry price. And maybe one day you will need some emergency funds. Ask yourself, it you as a college student spend 100$ each month on investing will you be able to also spend on an emergency fund separately? Will you live comfortably even then? If so, ok. But I fear that it would be be so comfortable. For now maybe focus in the studies?",

Then the simple answer is \"Yes\" it will definitely be enough, because investing in Bitcoin is not a competition, whereby you drag who its gonna take first or not, but it is an investment you start with the mindset it's gonna be kept for future use, hence it's not something that you rush into it because it's not a get rich quick scheme",

I am worried about missing big bull market with halving and etf approval.Enough for what? To get rich quick? Buy a house? Most likely not. The previous bull run had around x10 growth between the bear market and peak of the bull run, and around x6 growth if you take averages, And there's a strong decreasing trend of this relative growth with each bull run. So this next bull run might have only x5 or x3 growth, and your $100 will turn into $300. That's a great result if you compare it with bank deposits or some stocks, but this isn't the crazy profits that the early Bitcoin investors saw. But this doesn't mean that you should look for altcoins, because altcoins lack fundamentals and are just pump and dump schemes that crash to the ground without any chance of recovery.",

You are about to get into college and you are already fortunate enough to be having $100 per month to invest in bitcoin, just imagine how much you would have save up to till you graduate. For me you should be Thankful to God about it because there are alot of college student and graduate who are unable get monthly $100 for investing in bitcoin.",

I am worried about missing big bull market with halving and etf approval.I think it's enough if you invest $100 every month. with a note that it is for long-term investment, it can be more than 2 years and you never sell because of a momentary bulish. because it is human nature, if you see bulish and feel that you have made a profit, there will definitely be a sense of selling at that time, and never think that it is a momentary bulish that will make the price soar even higher.",

      "body": "Yes, that's enough. Every amount is enough. You are doing DCA, so any amount will do as long as you know what you are doing and you know the risk. You see, you can't just buy and buy bitcoin anytime you want; there is a right timing, position, and price because if, for example, you bring satoshi at this price but it goes down, then it's a down trade. You will see red in your portfolio even if you can recover it by waiting for it to go up again. It's still scary because, for the inexperienced, you will have anxiety waiting and waiting, so it's also advisable to not look at your holdings so you will not make decisions based on emotions. If you don't want to just hold your assets, you can try trading, but yeah, it's a lot risky and dangerous. Anyway goodluck on your investment journey anytime you could ask here on forum.",

We all have different entry points and different income resource so that you must feel satisfied with best you can do for your portfolio.Make sure you have a safe risk management for both your life expense, emergency and investment portfolio. Basically with human instinct, we never feel enough so your question is wrong.The good news is if you already did research and had belief in Bitcoin, you can start your investment and can maintain it a long time. One of good investment strategies is Dollar Cost Averaging. Because you are only at beginning, you can use two DCA websites to imagine how this strategy will help your investment after like 1 or 2 years.https://costavg.com/https://dcabtc.com/The first website is more useful because it has information for profit, loss of each DCA round.If you are still vague about DCA effect, see how it helps both MicroStragegy and Nayib Bukele (on behalf of El Salvador) to get profit with their Bitcoin investments.https://saylortracker.com/https://nayibtracker.com/",
