  "content": "WHAT IS P2P DUSTING ATTACK?P2P dusting attack is a cryptocurrency scam where the scammer sends small amount of cryptocurrency to a large amount of people, potential victims actually.the amount of cryptocurrency they send to their potential victims is usually so small that sometimes, its hard to notice, but the main goal or purpose of the scammer sending this is to try to trick as many that will notice the transaction, into revealing their private keys, or trick them into visiting a malicious website.WHY ITS IMPORTANT TO AVOID BEING A VICTIM TO P2P DUSTING ATTACK.The main or major reason why scammers engage in p2p dusting attack is for two reasons..To get their victims to reveal their private key or seed phrase through visiting a clone fake site, which phishes the victim's wallets private information while the victim unsuspectingly tries to connect his or her wallet to the site.To get the victims to visit a malicious website where they can try to trick the victim into clicking links that could download software that is infected with malware into the victims computer.The two mentioned reason both lead to one purpose, and that is to steal the victims cryptocurrencies, and maybe other valuable information that could be stored on the victims computer that the scammer have infected.HOW TO AVOID BEING A VICTIM TO P2P DUSTING ATTACKThe first and major way to avoid being a victim to such attack is to completely ignore such transaction when they appear on your wallet, no need even search for where it came from, don't even try sending it back or selling the token on a decentralized exchange, no matter the worth, the attacker might drain your wallet during such process, just allow the token to sit there, and if you are not comfortable having them in your wallet, simply move your main crypto assets to another wallet and abandon that wallet - thank goodness wallet creation is free, you can create as many as you want.Secondly, avoid visiting site that you are familiar with, but even when you find your self on a site you are not very sure of its reputation, then be very careful with clicking on links or downloading any file from such site.I came across this information on Binance feed, i found it very educative, and i decided to share it here, I hope we all stay safe out here or there.",

      "body": "Most of these attacks are generally common, not just on P2P but on altcoins, and they're found on networks with low transaction fees like BSC and Polygon. This is where I have seen them very common, as you can see many worthless tokens that can't be exchanged or traded in any open market, but most of them have value and a price attached to them, which makes it appear tempting for those who are unaware to try looking for a way to sell them. Another thing I learned from these scam tokens is that they usually have a specific exchange that they use; some are their own built-in dex, which they can use to extract the user's wallet information (phrase or private key) immediately after they grant their wallet access to it. It's just advisable that we avoid such tokens as much as we can. But just doing research about such coins can't make someone lose their wallet access. As you are researching to get information about them and not clicking on links that have been provided by them, it's only when one connects their wallet and grants them access that they can take control over their wallet, not just when the person tries to run research about them.",

      "body": "This attack is same as the address poisoning attack by Pmalek, I will advice you to go through that thread to have more insight in the topic. This attack is not a thing to be concerned about just that immediately you notice it, the thing to do is move your funds to another wallet but this doesn’t have any harm yet. One of the things this does is something similar to clipboard malware where you got a slightly different address from the one you copy. So when you’re face with attacks like this do well to always check and check the receiving addresses so you don’t send the scammer funds",

      "body": "Any time you make an address publicly known you are open to the possibility of getting dusted. The purpose of these types of attacks, on Bitcoin at least, is to try and deanonymize you. Since the amount of dust you receive is too small to spend as a single UTXO you will have to add more inputs to your transaction. If additional inputs are from a coinjoin and the dust is from an address linked to your identity, then your coinjoined UTXOs are no longer anonymous.Dusting attacks can also be used to taint your coins by sending you small payments from an address associated with illegal activity. If you were to send coins from and address which has received tainted coins to an AML compliant exchange you could get flagged for suspicious activity.You can mitigate the risks from dust attacks by using a wallet that allows coin control.",

Try not to click on these links that you seem are malicious, most new users clicked these links and they think that this will be a link the P2P user provided, but the scammers scammed these persons and stole their money, which is a big loss for the user. So, it would be better to change the password or they should make sure that they have transferred their funds, and the user can also use the wallet which can easily control the coins.",

But another thing that is possible is for the bad actor to try to trace a victim to his real identity. Maybe the victim will create an ad on a decentralized exchange or sell the coin to the bad actor in a way that the victim real name can be known while the bad actor is sending money to the victim's bank account. If it is bitcoin, this is known as dust attack. All you need to do is to use coin control to freeze the coin, or move your coins out of the wallet with coin control and not use the wallet ever again.If you are dealing with altcoins like USDT, you may think that it is P2P attack that you called it, but it may not be it. Even if you send to your exchange account or send from your exchange account, you may notice dust amount like 0.000005 USDT sent to your noncustodial wallet by bad actors with an address similar to your exchange account or wallet address. They want you to think that it is your exchange account address or an address that belongs to you so that if you want to send altcoin next time, you can mistakenly copy the bad actor address because it is similar to yours.",

Posting addresses publicly or applying to airdrops or giveaways with previously used addresses are some ways you can make yourself a target, but you don't have to do any of that. Most cryptocurrencies have public ledgers. Your addresses are already public knowledge if you have received or sent coins with them. A fraudster only needs the information from blockchain explorers to find new potential victims.

It's not an attack, and receiving such coins or tokens is harmless. They can't do anything while in your wallet. Only the user can make mistakes trying to engage with them, or like the OP says, visit scam websites and reveal sensitive information. Leave them where they are and continue living your life.",

This way you can automatically ignore all these attacks.The most dangerous attack is to send you a token with a large value, for example $10,000 and $20,000, but it can only be withdrawn from a specific platform. That platform may be fraudulent, or it may request your private keys or send them certain amounts so that you can withdraw $20,000.Using a good wallet and block explorer that hides these attacks will help you a lot.",

The attack occurs where the fraudster performs a dust attack and expects the user to copy his address, especially since some people copy the address of their last transaction instead of going and requesting the address again.",
