Any suggestions and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. If you are looking for non-custodial solutions to obfuscate bitcoin transactions, consider Bitcoin-Monero atomic swaps [1]. Atomic swaps are basically a decentralized method to exchange coins between different blockchains without participants' necessity to rely on or trust a third party. When you swap your bitcoin for Monero, you break the link between past and future transactions, because what happens inside the monero blockchain remains untraceable and unknown to an outside observer or chain analysis company. Once you no longer feel the need for anonymity provided by the monero blockchain, you swap your monero back to bitcoin. It is arguably a perfect approach to mixing coins because it is impossible to figure out what happens between your initial and final bitcoin transactions. Another solution would be using on-chain mixing algorithms such as the recently proposed DMix, a.k.a. decentralized mixer for unlinkability [2]. QuoteAbstract—We present a protocol that lets participants operate a decentralized mixer to exchange coins in the Bitcoin blockchain. DMix does not need the election of any leader and respects both the unlinkability and the atomicity properties, so that there is no possibility to correlate addresses or lose funds using the protocol. We leverage the MuSig aggregate signatures. This aggregation scheme is based on the Schnorr signature scheme, a recent proposal for a ECDSA alternative, the current Bitcoin signature scheme. We also present an analysis of the method and mitigation of attacks.[1] https://www.getmonero.org/2021/08/20/atomic-swaps.html[2] https://twitter.com/nobsbitcoin/status/1528701408341540865",

You've given me the answer right here with XMR-BTC atomic swaps. Sometime ago, I've heard that the new technology (atomic swaps) is experimental. If that's still the case, then it wouldn't be ideal to exchange large amounts of BTC for XMR. Once perfected, atomic swaps will be a true game changer not only for privacy but for trading as well. Monero is quite a hidden gem that's often overlooked by the general public. At least, both XMR and BTC have been going strong after all these years. Who needs centralized mixing services (no offense) when we already have decentralized solutions? Just my opinion",

What platforms (with reasonable liquidity) exist for making trustless BTC to XMR swaps?You can also trade BTC for XMR via cross-chain atomic swaps. There's no need to use a separate platform like Bisq to trade coins. Everything is done directly in a P2P manner. You simply send your BTC to the protocol and receive XMR to your address almost instantly. I've tried it and it works like a charm. However, the technology is quite experimental (as far as I'm aware) so it's not recommended for exchanging large amounts between blockchains. I've been a little paranoid about my privacy lately, so I use a combination of TOR + VPN and XMR to keep my transactions as private as possible.

It's just that they care about lining their own pockets much more than they care about privacy, their users, or doing the right thing.That's the problem. When there's money involved, developers often sacrifice Blockchain's core values (which are privacy and decentralization) in order to fill their pockets with money. You can bet that if developers opposed government's requirements, crypto wouldn't have been as widely adopted worldwide as it is right now. It's all about making governments happy in order to keep crypto afloat. At least, we're not stuck with a single privacy solution. As long as everything remains open sourced and decentralized, people will always have a choice to preserve their privacy in the crypto/Blockchain space.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on June 28, 2022, 09:42:11 AMI would choose ChipMixer over Wasabi 100% of the time, since Wasabi spy on their users, cooperate with blockchain analysis, and are anti-privacy and anti-bitcoin.Isn't ChipMixer a centralized mixing service?

If there is a platform, there needs to be an owner, but only the mere fact that the owner exists makes a platform centralized. Networks, however, can be decentralized provided that they consist of interconnected peers that talk to each other using different communication protocols while not relying on a central server or any other biased decision-maker. The biggest advantage of such networks is that they are permissionless, meaning that everyone can join the network and become a peer by simply downloading a compatible client. Just like in the case of Bitcoin and Bisq, which are both decentralized networks, not platforms, you can download an XMR-BTC atomic swap client (https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap for example) and join a decentralized network of users also running compatible clients.",
