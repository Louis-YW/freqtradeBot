I become motivated to accumulate satoshi on multiple faucets such as moonbitcoin and freebitcoin just to invest on ponzi doubler scam which I didn’t know that they are scam way back then. It’s funny that I'm very motivated before to claim faucets every hour just to waste it on ponzi scheme revshare, doubler and mlm that only waste my time and Bitcoin that I earned patiently.",

Curiosity after all of my misconception about it during my teenager years.Back in 2017 I got few Bitcoins, and it was the same year as I registered in here since I was trying to get along with people that are also holding Bitcoin like me. Started a little bit as a lurker guest on a side note.But yeah, I learned some few more skills since I was trying to test the waters on doing more in crypto like trading. It all turned out to be just dogshit newbie experience for me since I ended up in a loss in the first try. I know I was still a newbie, but it was horrible experience.Good thing I was not blinded to altcoins out there.

I even tried to resubmit my valid ID, and they did not respond back to me.",

You just spoke the truth, and you never would have known this if you never came across this forum, or search this question at the right place with experience users, because this forum indeed has all the information you could ever need in your crypto/Bitcoin journey, which is why it's the right place for all Bitcoiners. Moreover, Bitcoin has always proven to be a best choice for long term investment, due to the fact that it's volatility is not of all risk compared to altcoins",

I had signed up on plenty of PTC sites, from which I only managed to earn a few dollars at most. Then, I came across BTCClicks, a PTC website paying in bitcoin, along with an abundance of BTC faucets that were available back then. I didn't understand much, but the faucets intrigued me, and I ended up spending a decent amount of time on them. Despite earning only a few dollars' worth of bitcoin, the whole concept fascinated me, and I ended up signing up on the forum.",

I then realized how important having a decentralized currency is.I have very similar story. PayPal wasn't working in my country back then in 2012, and I wanted to sell some in-game items for real world money, so I had to do some manipulations with electronic payment systems and that led me to finding Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I disregarded it and just claimed 0.005 BTC from a faucet and forgot about it. But still I think it's cool that way back when Bitcoin was only 3 years old it was already known as electronic currency that people could discover by just looking for electronic payment systems.",

Since I didn't have money to invest back then, that was my opportunity to start collecting and saving btc for the future. And thanks to God it has been working so far. You should purchase bitcoin because it's the main and most reputable cryptocurrency. It's the crypto with best long term chances, while guaranteeing safety to your investment. When you invest in btc you don't have to worry if the coin will be still demanded after several years, because we have the assurance bitcoin is king and will remain on top of crypto market.",

I think you are one of the lucky ones. You have a long time ago heard about Bitcoin and have been able to buy Bitcoin at a low price. So did you buy bitcoin and hold it for a few years? If you have hold then you have earned a lot of money today. If I had known about btc or understood the importance of Bitcoin at that time, I would have definitely bought BTC so that I could profit now.",
