I found this out after following the $EMC project developed by @lightlord. at that point I saw that $EMC was easily listed there. Maybe you can try the steps taken by @lightlord.Quote from: ryzaadit on June 09, 2022, 06:55:15 PM-snip-Isn't he talking about coins with their own network? and it seems the answer should be about CEX, I think it is very difficult to get into Binance, they will do a thorough research on what and how the project will be listed.",

You can never be 100% sure that such decentralized exchanges will always work or will never do a rugpull or something like that but with this 3 Dexes i think the chances for a bad experience are the slimmest.That coins are launching on one of these swaps does not mean though that those coins are automatically promising and not a scam because everyone can list his own token on any Dex without being audited or something like that. So you still need to do your research on those tokens even if they list on the big Dexes.",

For example, like Binance, they have their own funding agency to fund potential projects running on their own network, for example, like Terra (LUNA) which recently collapsed.FYI, Have you ever heard of 5irechain? they are one of the blockchain projects that are currently in the development stage. Even their coins are not yet circulating in the market.

Different from other exchanges in general, Uniswap's ability is very good in facilitating trade, including large trades, namely through the use of liquidity providers and liquidity pools and many coins born on the erc20 network mostly have good long-term potential.",

I meant it's not the new coins were always using the blockchain from the exchange sites. The fact that if mostly of developers are using the blockchain that created by another party that didn't have affiliation with the exchange site ecosystem. So, this is a hard question to answer caused by i rarely seen exchange site that develop their own blockchain but i remember huobi with its heco chain has so many new tokens build on heco",

If i were you I'll see first the volume of CEX/DEX, normally new coins will have promising if the volume is step by step growing every day. but it also can not be used as a standard because all coins have to be paired with bitcoin, which follow the mother price.",

Usually they will build their own DEX ecosystem later, for example like Oasis Network (ROSE) which is the first layer blockchain, at first they don't have DEX until finally they have Yuzuswap as their first and official DEX.",

As far as my experience goes, when a coin is listed on both exchanges, the price will go up. it proves that the two CEXs are very reliable in all aspects.",

For example, Ripple which has a CEX blockchain system, but also gains the trust of the public to invest even though it has had problems recently. Likewise with the DEX concept. Many projects are currently making DEX blockchain systems, but they add the number of coins in a different form, namely by developing coins in different blockchain systems, so the number of coins also increases even though on the initial blockchain they are fixed.",
