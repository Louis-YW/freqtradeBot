So now a question arasie in my mind that how this proccess manupulate  the market. I wanna know some details from you guys. Thank youLet me make you understand in a simple manner, bro. Unlike any other asset, bitcoin follows the law of supply and demand. You might also be aware that bitcoins are limited in number. Hence, this makes bitcoin very rare. When you hear bulk buying the coins, it simply means the demand to acquire the bitcoins has increased, and in order to fulfil the demand, the price also goes up due to the limited supply of bitcoins. Similarly, when there is a huge \"selling\" order, the price goes down. This is a general overview of how buying and selling affect the price of bitcoins.",

Thank you----- ~speedx~The Bitcoin market is also controlled by forces of demand and supply, the higher the demand the greater the price, and the lesser the demand the lower the price. When the government makes such an announcement that it is selling a large chunk of bitcoin it also gives rise to FUD. Some investors will begin to dump their coins because of fear of the unknown. But in recent times these news or dumps is having less impact on the market price. Most times the market recovers in a few days. The bitcoin sector is gradually becoming immune to the impact caused by these sales which usually caused the market to nosedive in time past.",

Coins with low marketcap are the ones that can easily be manipulated.I think he was too hasty to say it or motivated from the news he read then asked the forum, we already understand how the market mechanism, selling and buying is a definite factor in the market, and demand will increase the scarcity that affects the price to be higher, and selling is an action that makes goods become more abundant in the market, and that makes the price lower or lower, the mechanism is simple and it is common knowledge.Regarding sales made by the US government, of course, this is not a strange thing anymore, because they have also done that before, and they do not manipulate the market from selling bitcoins, and also no one can manipulate that, as you said, the marketcap is very large so it is difficult to manipulate.",

Thank you----- ~speedx~It's not really manipulation if you are selling or buying on the open market without any bad intentions, but very much possible to manipulate the price if you hodl a good stash of some crypto and you want to influence price in some way and trigger the herd mentality of which users will try follow what a whale is doing!As of the question on how sells and buys influence the market value, well think of this being a tag of war...whoever comes out the Victor after the war decides the direction of the market on that particular day and in this case the US government selling a huge chunk of coins means putting selling pressure on the market such that if you were looking at the charts you could see a huge red candle for this transaction as it fills all buying orders at market value going down from highest to lowest order till all coins are sold.",

Thank you----- ~speedx~It is only a manipulation if you have something to benefit other than the value of the traded assets. - Say someone wants to buy Bitcoins at a cheaper, they can start selling their bitcoins faster than the market can buy at that moment, this often creates a cascading effect that prompts other trades to open sell positions as well. This way, the price goes down and they canbget it lower, at a discount. This is a common practice in the crypto market especially with altcoin projects with small to medium marketcap. For Bitcoin, it's much difficult since you to spend a lot more in other to tilt the direction of the market in your favor.",

If things they were exchange for are bad/evil, they will have little to no sufficient power to move the price of Bitcoin ... Only clean money can move the price of Bitcoin.Bitcoin price was recalculated such that low supply & high demand for clean bitcoins can move price up while high supply moves price down. That also means if someone or people are buying clean bitcoins price would go up. If they are selling price goes down. Clean bitcoins have more powers to move Bitcoin price. Price could also be moved by people with enough power in form of contributions to the development of Bitcoin. The logic here is that good contribution from such people is thesame as  good/clean Bitcoin... good contribution = clean bitcoin = power. Your good contributions, depending on how quality/powerful they are help Bitcoin grow. If you contribute good ideas it grows, if you contribute clean bitcoins it grows",

Thank youIf I am understanding you correctly, you are interested in understanding the concept of manipulation in all markets including Bitcoin. It is a common  belief that entities or individuals often referred as \"Whales) with significant amount of funds can dictate or change the direction of market by making substantial buying and selling. The  primary motive behind such  actions is to make quick gains. This artificial movement of market is known as manipulation.However, It is important to note that all significant buying or selling is not manipulation. There are many mega institutions who make huge buying for legit reasons, despite the fact that such buying can also potentially impact the market price of assets.",

For Bitcoin, the price can also be influenced by the level of purchase; if a huge amount of Bitcoin is being bought by different institutions, then the price can take a spike, and when a huge amount is also sold out by different whales, then the market takes a brief downturn that doesn't really last for a very long time. The bitcoin market is not just like altcoins, where there's always price manipulation or some huge pump and dump.

Thank you----- ~speedx~What ?Buying Pressure raises the price and in reverse order, the Selling pressure brings the market down what's the point of the manipulation here.. Manupaltion actually an act done by the big market players where they feed the particular emotion in traders and retailers to make high gains as if they want to buy in cheap simply they will put the selling pressure in the market by their pre holdings so it will create a fearful and fuddy situations dn weak hands will sell their assets in cheap to avoid losses but their act brings them towards a real loss and the manipulators Buy with joy. Hope so you've got the answer to what is manipulation..I can give a more explanatory example from the current circumstances. As the market is feeling a highly tight range of flow and selling pressure this is the actual manipulation where the retailers are trying to fill up the bags, Why I am so sure because the on-chain activity is presenting a fully Bullish accumulation process but the market is not performing in that swing. Sec is putting pressure on statements but at the same time, the giants are using their statements to cover up their late fillings. Seems like they are playing Statement Statement and using them against the weak hand's regular fearful traders.",
