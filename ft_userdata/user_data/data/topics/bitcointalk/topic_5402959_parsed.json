If for example I create a 24 Word BIP39 Wallet in Sparrow Wallet and I sent some Satoshis to each one of the first 200 addresses. Then I decide to send the complete funds of all 200 addresses to address number 201. If I want to recover the wallet later on another computer using my 24 words is this a problem concerning gap limit?",

If you configure the gap limit in Settings -> Advanced, you will be fine, transactions will be shown properly, until the address of that limit. But, if your problem is privacy, gap limit is irrelevant. If you connect to your private Electrum server, make sure that the gap limit you've submitted allows you to query that much information from your server. Otherwise, your Electrum server won't return you anything.",

      "body": "No. To be specific, most wallet usually check whether the address has transaction history (rather than check it has balance). Since first 201 address has transaction history, most wallet would generate/show 201 address plus additional 20-30 address (based on wallet default gap limit). But in rare case where wallet use non-default derivation path, you might want to write down derivation path generated by Sparrow.Source: https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/quick-start.html",

If I want to recover the wallet later on another computer using my 24 words is this a problem concerning gap limit? The gap limit tells the wallet how many unused addresses to skip before assuming that none of the following addresses have been used. In your case, a wallet would see all 201 addresses in the block chain and not have to skip any at all.There might be a problem if you sent funds to only the 201st address because the wallet would have to know that it might have to skip 200 addresses before finding a used address. You would need to set the gap limit to at least 200 in this case.",
