But I definitely don't think every reports are genuine since such places are a lot more easier to abuse. Quick look and I'm already seeing recovery scammers placing fake reports...",

Someone can abuse the site too for posting someone Bitcoin address and report it as a scam address.Totally agree how did the admin verify a report I don't see a file uploader for the evidence, this tool can be subject to abuse and used to threaten and scam people.I understand the admin's intention but he needs to further explain how to weed out fake and true reports because I keep looking there's no explanation or parameters to qualify one's address to be a scam.And scammers are good at hiding their transactions I doubt if this platform will achieve a lot, scammers do not use one address and they know that will be tracked once they have a victim. They are not only good at scamming they are also good at moving the coins they've scammed.",
