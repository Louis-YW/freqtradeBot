      "body": "If it were to be a wallet checker, it would be understandable that the software was designed with  a clean and clear function to keep track of assets and notify holders of any activities involving the owners wallet but you designed a software for some one to out in his or her seed phrase just to monitor wallet activities, who does that at this current time. Are you a hacker? Or do you want to do away with people's funds and assets? OP this inovation of yours does not augur well as nobody would look into your software because it is against the blockchain ethics and if one inputs their seed phrase, automatically it means that their wallets is actually at risk and therefore would not dare using that software. Come to talk of it, there are many trackers software designed to keep track and notify owners of their wallet activities without requesting for seed phrase. I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE USING THIS SOFTWARE IS AT HIS OR HER OWN RISKSCAM!!",

      "body": "I could not have phrased it better.After the manner in which you have articulated the main point about it being wise to not trust any website that required or asked for seed phrases it would be a huge mistake if anybody reading your post went on to enter private details in this or any other so-called seed checker website. Anybody entering their seed phrases in any website are most likely going to see their disappear, it is not worth the risk and there is no real reason to enter seed phrases anywhere.Quote from: Stalker22 on March 09, 2023, 07:17:41 PMQuote from: SeedChecker on March 09, 2023, 05:45:42 PMSeedChecker is a browser-based software for checking and 24/7 monitoring of Seed-phrase balances.~Warning - This is most likely a scam!It is important for everyone to be extra cautious with this type of software, as it is clearly designed to trick users into handing over their seed phrases and private keys.

Our software does not make sense to work with 1-2 Seed phrases.Why don't you work with master public keys instead of seed words?If you want to sell your product, you're going to have to make sure you can't scam people. Asking for seed words is a big no-go. An easy workaround would be to instruct the user to run your software offline. Nobody should ever enter their seed words in an online computer anyway. For the $300 you're asking, you could easily let the user download a couple hundred GB containing all possible addresses on those chains, and the user could check his 500 seed phrases offline, and shred the computer afterwards.But that's only needed if you want to be legit. If you want to steal seed phrases, you're right on track.",

In fact, it's very easy to understand so pay attention.1. You download this beautiful piece of software.2. You enter your seed phrase.3. The OP empties your wallet and takes your coins. 4. You no longer have to worry about the BTC price, how long to hold, when to see, how to pay your taxes. 5. You are stress and worry-free for the rest of your life. A win-win situation.",
