They would really be able to realize thats not how simple as it looks and sounds.",

Yes, holding is something be called a skill specially if you are tending to hold for 5-10 years or something because if we do look around on which there are lots of ways or factors that could affect someones mindset and target in mind whenever they do able to encounter not so good looking things or situations which it might be affecting out on what you had molded up plans earlier. It is really that a very common approach on which you are really that optimistic towards your investing capabilities and ending up on minding about getting that positive result but as i said that once you do have that experience on this field then you are aware on possibleevery events which you might be able to face head on.Just dont make yourself that close minded and would be sticking into something which we know that everything could changed and its always ideal on sticking into projects which had been tested outby time.",

We invest for a chance to be successful in growing our money, but we should always be ready to accept losses. That's why experts always advise to invest only what we can afford. We have to be smart. Although crypto gives us an opportunity to create wealth, we cannot be unrealistic and ignore the possibility of losing money. We should take it slow, invest now, be optimistic, but always be prepared if things are not in our favor.The reason why investors panic when the market dumps or is in a bullish mode is due to a lack of knowledge.",

HahaI don't tjink about this. I know that there are so many people who are still expexting about being rich sooner overnight by investing in Bitcoin But nowadays, many people have been aware not really easy to do this. That is why I am not sure that it is almost 99%. From where you got the percentage? But, whats you said is actually true that investing in Bitcoin doesn't mean that you may be rich sooner or even in one night. Many newbies may expect this because of what they heard previously or they heard from scammers who want to steal their money from fake Bitcoin investment that they offer. That is why commonly newbies become the victims of the scammers and this always happening. Bitcoin needs time to increase much, moreover during this bearish era, there will be very high volatility so that the rate will be up and down very easily.

For a purchased long investment, it is the difference between the current price and the purchase price.For a sold or short investment, it is the difference between the price when sold short and the current price. Paper profits or losses only become realized, or actual money profits or losses, when the investment position is closed. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paperprofitorloss.aspSo it's not necessarily a loss on our end if we are not going to sell when the price goes down or what we call panic sell. The important thing here is just invest what you can afford to lose. And then go for long term, at least experience one full cycle and see how it goes for you. I know it's going to be a mental battle, but it's part of the game, you really need to be psychologically prepared because you will be tested many times to sell during the HODLing cycle of yours. And if you learn how to get over it, then most likely you might end up rich someday.",

I think you should refrain from telling him about the risks involved in doing these things because if they fail, they will likely blame you, the person who gave them the advice. Giving them information rather than giving them advice is, in my opinion, the greatest way to help people accept bitcoin. You should let them decide if they want to take the risk or not.",
