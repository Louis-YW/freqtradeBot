  "content": "Most newbies make post because of their anxiousness to get merit. Out of this anxiousness, irrelevant posts are often made. Although I'm once like this. My first merit was like I won a jaspot of over a million dollar. I was so excited. But today I see merit as something to be gain as one contribute towards the forum. Newbies should be aware that is better to work towards contributing to the forum than running to build merit. Making post because of getting merit make one get discouraged after making several posts which you think will merited but not merited.CONCLUSION: Don't search for merit, let merit come for you through your meaningful post. Never make post because you want to get merit but because you want to help others and the community through your post.",

      "body": "From my perspective, it depends on how we look at it. People posts for all sorts of reasons, and as such, some make no effort in their posts, whilst other give it ample thought. Merits are, for many, a kind of incentive, so trying to upper one’s posting ability in order to earn Merits is not a bad thing. In a sense, having Merits in the back of the mind can trigger a person to create better content, and that’s a win-win.The issue may arise, nevertheless, when someone posts with an overly focus on earning Merits. That often leads to outcomes such as cutting corners (i.e. plagiarising), an excessive amount of topic creation with less focus than a lesser amount would achieve (possibly creating a negative impression) or clearly sucking up to others in hope for Merits (that is not the intent for Merits).",

They cannot be far fetched from that because merits sources and some higher members merits these posts base on the efforts the writer puts into it (some could even be old posts rewritten). The main thing is to just have an ample of what you're writing about. Not some individuals sharing post they do not have an basic knowledge about.So it's not entirely bad creating post for merit sake but make it something educative and a content from you not a plagiarized content.",

It now depends if;• The merit system steers a desire to learn and contribute to the forum constructively with the hopes of getting noticed and merited, or• It's a desperate desire to rank up, without any interest whatsoever to contribute positively to discussions or to learn from them.The former is healthy and the reason for the merit system; the latter is detrimental to discussions and leads to spam posts.",

Some people come to the forum to rank up their accounts in order to participate in campaigns, others come for status, and still others come to learn how to secure their Bitcoin investments. As a result, I believe that 95% of those who attend Forum need this merit boost their moral. I  don't think that individuals will always work hard for things that don't pay off, so I don't believe that posting for merit is bad as long as the post is quality and once you follow the rules the forum.

That should not be a problem. The problem will be when they beg for merit and that is what this forum is against. Meriting posts means the posts have quality. And if anyone is running after merit by making posts for that, it is a plus to the forum. Everyone here will post to get merit if they are not up to Legendary rank because we all need to move up in rank. Even with being legendary members, there are some of them who still post to get more merit.",

The irrelevant posts are not always made because of anxiousness trying to get merit, it can also be because the newbie lacks organization in writing, don't know how convey their thought or questions well enough to make a relevant contribution, and also that they don't know what a relevant post here should look like etc. there are many reasons for some unnecessary irrelevant posts made by newbies.

Some people are in the forum and they don't create thread, the only thing they do is to make comments and they are receiving merits more than some people creating thread, most of those people getting merit from comments are really making meaningful contribution to the forum that's why they are getting the merit. If you want to get merit you don't have to create thread before you receive merit, just make sure you are making quality comments and you will also be receiving merits. If you notice most of the high rank members in the forum don't really create thread anyhow, they only make comments and they are getting merits from that, you can't be a shit poster and you think you will get to legendary rank.",

One can search for merit and actually do that by trying to make very good posts.Even high rank users are chasing merits sometimes. Some want to get to the highest rank there is (since it may bring more money from signature campaigns), some probably want to prove something (I don't know what though).As long as this brings really good and useful posts, it's not really harm in that. The problems start when dirty tactics are used in an attempt to \"rush\" the achievements.And one important thing that imho can be also mentioned even in this context is that reputation is important and it's very easy to lose it (and very hard, sometimes impossible to recover).So even if one may be chasing merits, all he can do is to do his best in post quality and information quality. Any shortcuts can easily backfire.",
