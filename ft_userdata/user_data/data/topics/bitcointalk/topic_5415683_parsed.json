Before completing the purchase, it was open source and had an announcement thread on the forum. I forgot where i saved the link to that thread and searched for it, but found nothing. I also never recommend using it as a main wallet but it may be useful for Binance users who can link their accounts on the platform to that wallet.",

While you hope to never be in a crash, you should obviously take reasonable precautions to protect yourself just in case. And while you hope your coins are never lost or stolen, you should obviously take reasonable precautions to protect yourself just in case. And these precautions include not using a closed source wallet which could be doing absolutely anything behind the scenes.Everyone who has lost coins via an exchange being hacked or a platform going bankrupt thought those platforms were very safe right up to the minute they weren't. Everyone who was trading on Mt Gox thought they were highly reputable until they lost everything. Everyone with coins in Celsius thought everything was fine until their accounts were frozen. And everyone who uses a closed source wallet will be happy with it right up until some vulnerability is discovered and they lose everything.",

I am not sure if I agree with their argument, and I know that other wallet software has had similar problems with malicious clones. Electrum is one example. Unlike electrum, I understand that Trust Wallet is a mobile wallet, that must be downloaded via an app store.
