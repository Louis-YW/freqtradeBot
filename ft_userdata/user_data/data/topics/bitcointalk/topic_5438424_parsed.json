After all, it has been reported that these Chinese balloons can cause dangerous EMP activity.Explosion reported in Montana skies hours after Chinese spy balloon was reportedhttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-06-explosion-in-montana-skies-after-chinese-spy-balloon-reported.htmlAn explosion was seen in the skies over Montana just hours after news reports noted that a Chinese spy balloon was spotted over the state’s sensitive military installations on Friday.According to reports, the explosion was filmed by residents near the city of Billings, but it’s not clear what the object was since the spy balloon had already left the region and had been spotted in other states, including Missouri, where the country’s only B-2 bomber base is located.One person who shared a video of the incident, Dolly Moore, said she “saw a jet go by so fast and then explosion in the sky.”“Ok, so here’s what I just caught I few minutes ago out my window. I saw a jet go by so fast and then explosion in the sky. Holy crap! Billings MT,” she noted on Twitter in a post along with the video clip.----------Dolly Moore@MMtTreasures·FollowOk, so here’s what I just caught I few minutes ago out my window. I saw a jet go by so fast and then explosion in the sky. Holy crap! Billings MT.----------Again, there is no indication that this was the Chinese spy balloon, but it is certainly odd that something like this occurred in the same vicinity as where the balloon was spotted earlier. It’s possible, even, that this was a second balloon, though we have no information on that.Earlier on Friday, China insisted that the balloon merely got off course and could not be guided, but the Pentagon said that was incorrect.“The balloon is maneuverable,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters. “It violated the law. We communicated that to China.”He said that shooting down the balloon “was taken into consideration,” but “because we assessed that currently, it does not pose a psychical or military risk to people on the ground, for now, we are continuing to monitor and review options.”...",

China would have brought down that balloon immediately it was sighted regardless of the casualties it might cause. For me if the balloon was to spy on the American nation, then it has achieved its goals because important information might have been transferred to China especially if the US systems are not well protected.",

      "body": "We know that there have been more than one balloon. And, they have been reported over different countries, as well. And there might have been sightings for many years, now.There is quite a lot of land around the world. If China is doing anything with these balloons, what can it be? If there were more than just a few, they would have been spotted long ago. Of course, it takes a while to figure out what something like this is. Citizens might just pass it off as nothing if they even see one.There is a possibility that these balloons don't mean anything. Has anybody reported radio signals coming from one of them?",

When we see that military recruiting has been down for a bunch of years, the military needs advertising. They don't get that by being smart. They get it by being dramatic.Besides, they probably learned everything they needed to know using communications lasers on the balloon.",

Not wanting to be embarrassed, Biden was forced to send in fighter jets to take it out. Then the administration makes baseless claims that the Trump administration also had spy balloons floating in U.S. air space and never took action. They're making excuses because this is a giant blunder.",
