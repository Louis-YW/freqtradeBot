  "content": "Hello everyone,I've been involved with Bitcoin since around 2017, initially buying Bitcoin on exchanges. As my understanding deepened, and I learned about the principle of \"not your keys, not your coins,\" I started looking for a wallet to securely store my Bitcoin. I chose BRD from the bitcoin.org official website due to its simplicity and clarity, making it an ideal choice for my cold wallet. Around 2018, I installed BRD on my old iPhone 6 and generated a 12-word recovery phrase, which I diligently wrote down and kept on paper. Subsequently, I gradually transferred my Bitcoin to this wallet, never spending any of it. During this time, I occasionally logged into the wallet, reassuringly seeing my coins and transaction records.I can guarantee that my recovery phrase is correct, as I successfully imported it and recovered my Bitcoin on my other old iPhone X using the BRD wallet. Additionally, I have recommended this wallet to numerous friends.Last year, I heard about BRD being acquired by Coinbase, but I didn't pay much attention, thinking that I could restore my funds anywhere with the 12-word recovery phrase. However, just last week, a friend mentioned that he was unsuccessful in restoring his funds using the BRD recovery phrase in another wallet. This caught my attention, and when I tried to log into the BRD wallet, I encountered a login failure, prompting a mandatory upgrade.I started using other wallets such as Bither, Coinbase, Unstoppable, Coinomi, Coin Wallet, Electrum, etc., to recover my Bitcoin, but all attempts were unsuccessful. I realized the gravity of the situation.I have explored almost all the methods mentioned online, indicating that BRD uses the BIP032 m/0H derivation path to generate addresses. I even used wallets supporting modification of the derivation path, but to no avail. I can confirm that my wallet addresses are legacy addresses. I checked the most recent two transactions on the exchange, and I can see my coins associated with the addresses on Blockchair (I can provide details if needed). Unfortunately, I have been unable to recover my addresses using the recovery phrase, and my friend is facing the same issue.I attempted different derivation paths such as m/0H/1, m/0H/0/, m/0H/0H/, m/44H/0H/0H, etc. I even examined BRD's source code and found that the code also uses m/0H as the derivation path, but all efforts to recover were unsuccessful.I am under immense stress, and my mental state is deteriorating. My entire wealth is in there. As a HODLer, I have always held onto my Bitcoin, never spending any. However, now it seems that it has all vanished into thin air. Even as a cryptocurrency enthusiast preaching the virtues of decentralization, my faith is shaken. I used to evangelize Bitcoin to others, and now I find myself in this unfortunate situation.I am reaching out to all of you for help. Please, if there's any method or suggestion to recover my Bitcoin, I would be extremely grateful. Thank you all in advance for your assistance.",

Was Electrum definitely synced when you did this (green circle in the bottom right)?BRD wallet uses m/0' for both legacy and sewgit addresses. Import your seed to Electrum, select BIP39, choose legacy, and enter m/0' as the derivation path. In the wallet it creates for you, make sure it is synced as above. If the wallet is empty, go to the console and enter the following two commands separately:Code:wallet.create_new_address(False) for i in range(200)wallet.create_new_address(True) for i in range(200)This will generate more receiving and change addresses.

      "body": "Thank goodness! After several days of effort, researching, studying documentation, and reading code, I finally managed to recover all of my bitcoins. The core issue was indeed related to the mnemonic phrase. Let me recap the key points.Mnemonic phrases in different languages cannot be directly converted. I had mistakenly believed that I could convert mnemonic phrases between different languages using the word list index provided by https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b1791c24aa163eb6578d0bfaadcf44997484eeaf/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md.This turned out to be the crux of the matter. Since most wallets only support English mnemonic phrases, and mine was in Chinese, my attempts to replace it with English words using the index and trying different derivation paths were unsuccessful. Upon revisiting the https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b1791c24aa163eb6578d0bfaadcf44997484eeaf/bip-0039.mediawiki mnemonic specification, I realized that the index was only meant for checksum verification. The actual seed calculation involves treating the original mnemonic phrase as a string. Identifying this core issue, I used the https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39 (offline) tool to convert my Chinese mnemonic phrase into the BIP032 standard with a custom derivation path (m/0'/0). I saw my addresses were there, and I knew success was just one step away.Using the Electrum wallet, I imported the master public key address generated by https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39. However, I still couldn't see the balance, which was puzzling. After examining Electrum's source code (https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/586d3a4361f5dbb9ce9ffdfdfeb276664b5bbfaa/electrum/bip39_recovery.py#L51), I discovered that it automatically adds /0 to the derivation path. Understanding this, all I needed to do was fill in the derivation path as m/0' in https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39, enter the corresponding public key (xpubxxx) into Electrum, and finally, I could see the transaction history. With this, I've successfully recovered the bitcoins I lost.I believe there are probably many others like me who think that mnemonic phrases in different languages can be converted. Moreover, most wallets on the market only support English mnemonic phrases, and this is the core issue.Here, I express my gratitude for all the help provided. By sharing my experience, I hope to assist more people who might encounter similar challenges.",

So at first you replaced each Chinese word with the english word, line by line?I'll probably have to re-visit the BIP39 spec to see how exactly it handles different language wordlists.I am quite surprised in particular at how the Chinese mnemonic only converted correctly to english after using the m/0'/0 path, I mean before using it as an Electrum mnemonic.",
