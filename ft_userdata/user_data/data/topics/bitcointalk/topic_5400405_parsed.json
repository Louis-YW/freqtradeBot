  "content": "It's quite amazing what power can do to some countries. With the war between Russia and Ukraine still going on, it seems an alliance of some kind is budding between Russia and China.  Seeing as these two when combined can be a deadly frce to reckon with, don't we think the US and NATO should be bothered? Now it could be that their alliance is suspicious, because no two countries who are power hungry and love to dominate can Co exist. China has decided to \"help\" Russia fight against NATO. They believe that they(Russia), a transcontinental country spanning across Eastern Europe and Northern Asia will be in deep shit should the NATO choose to expand eastward.  NATO's chief backer, the US have all it takes in terms of military might to take over Russia, but will they be willing to risk a war with China?.  China has a military might of over 2.8 million soldiers and are ranked 2nd after the US. Reports have it that they have been spotted testing PLA weapons and troops modernisation together in the East of Asia. https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dailyadvent.com/news/6409d95dfbcea4e76b2d285ffc60ac8b-ChinaRussia-military-exercise-tests-PLA-weapons-troop-modernization&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjgn_u12f_3AhX7g_0HHcEsAlAQFnoECAcQAg&usg=AOvVaw3nDk-6aoce4TI_-zM7jTk2 If it comes down to becoming a duel, will pairing with China help them stand a chance of winning against NATO? https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60257080",

      "body": "It's beginning to look like a question of world power and the a stretch on how far America or Nato is willing to go. Most Importantly, the US hopes to avoid a world war and with much interference that goes beyond sanction, a world was is likely going go be the inevitable here. As it is, the Chinese and Russia government looks to strengthening an alliance still and that would be very much used in effect depending on Nato and the US responses to the threats they level against other sovereign nations although, Taiwan is hardly one at the moment.They might have democratically elected leaders but there independence remains in doubt. China isn't sure they are ready for any sanction yet and answering this could be the go they need to invade Taiwan.",
