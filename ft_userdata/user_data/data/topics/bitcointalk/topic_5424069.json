Can you open electrum's console and execute command <ismine(\"1JvyQDQwdWvnC2m417TxwALT5a5o9knxiz\")> (remove the  brackets).It's possible you have malware on your pc. There's malware going around for many years that monitors your clipboard, and if it detects a bitcoin address it replaces said address with the address of the generator of the malware.A second possibility: did you download electrum from the official source AND verify the signature?",

If the address is generated on your Electrum wallet, it would return 'true' after you click on 'enter', if not, it would return false. Check also if you have more than one wallet on the Electrum. But Electrum generates bc1 addresses by default.",

Note that when you deposit fund into an exchange, they move the fund to their hot wallet. That's normal and that's why the address is now empty. Also, the address hasn't received all the 0.44 BTC you are talking about recently. It has received 0.41 BTC of that 0.44 BTC around 1 year and half ago.",

Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and there is nothing you can do if you send to the wrong address/wrong amount once the transaction is confirmed.Fortunately, hosseinimr93 is right. You sent only 0.036597 BTC to that address. 0.44 BTC is the total received by that address not the amount you recently sent.Since you said the address is whitelisted on your account then I assume it was you who sent it the 0.41 BTC on the 07/10/2021. Check your transactions history and you will likely figure out to whom it belongs.",
