      "body": "seems like they are asking you to do KYC and the only way to proceed here if you want to get your deposit/winnings is to do their KYC. I've seen a similar case in the past where stake.com put the account of a gambler into \"withdraw only mode\" ask them to undergo a KYC procedure. Quote from: https://stake.com/policies/terms4. Know your Customer (\"KYC\")Stake reserves the right, at any time, to ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine the identity and location of a User. Stake reserves the right to restrict the Service, payment or withdrawal until identity is sufficiently determined, or for any other reason in Stake's sole discretion. Stake also reserves the right to disclose a User's information as appropriate to comply with legal process or as otherwise permitted by the privacy policy of Stake (owner and operator of Stake), and by using the Service, you acknowledge and consent to the possibility of such disclosure.",

      "body": "You've already posted this on their thread, just wait until they give you a response before you make another thread, especially in the scam accusations board. Their support is quite active so I doubt you need to wait that long. If that doesn't solve your problem and they did something that looks like a scammy move, you can bump this thread and post more details about it.",

But you can not withdraw as the fund is on hold by the site due to the KYC process. To withdraw funds you have to pass their KYC to avoid money laundering and abuse or something like that.",

I don't think whatever they offered to help is within the realm of acceptable by Stake. Like noorman0 said, Stunna's help will be more credible. Try to reach them.",

I think this user is a probable scammer who may take info and try to scam you. Cause stake.com will not allow third parties to interfere with you. And also this person has only a single post which is regarding helping you. It seems to me that this person has an alternative account and this account has been created to scam people.",
