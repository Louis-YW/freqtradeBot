I knew it before that this year will be more favourable than last year that made many people to hold their coins not to experience  losses in their trading than to keep watching till the bear market will leave before they can supply to the market to make incomes.Many investors are very ready to feel bull season so that they will start selling their coins to earn well from their long term investments and to look for another opportunity to buy and hold again for another bright future.",

Living in a dream that the price will continue to rise is what makes you greedy, and then you will miss the opportunity to buy bitcoin.Just be greedy when others are panicking, when negative news is coming from every direction and everyone wants to sell on the first rally.As for waiting to reach ATH, it is betting on a novice driver in Formula 2 races.",

From the graph or charts this downtime normal takes six months plus because unfriendly attitude of government and individuals on bitcoin but let's observe towards November and see what will come of the price. Observing after buying, it's much nicer I think. But if those who haven't bought yet are still observing until the end of the year, I don't think that's a very good option because they won't get anything from that observation either. So make your beautiful dream come true by continuing to buy Bitcoin when the price falls or before the price becomes more expensive because if you just say an illusion, you will not feel any results from it.QuoteDon't get shock when its start pumping non stop for a year interval, I guess you will be happy or don't have any capital like again.

Hope for better days aheadI will never be surprised if it is Bitcoin that is being pumped, because as many people know that the pump on Bitcoin is a very normal thing because it happens based on demand and supply and also because the enthusiasts are increasing so that the pump is always more it's easy to happen although the correction also doesn't just disappear when there is bad news for the crypto space.",

It will make many people look like they don't believe in the power of bitcoin and start considering using bitcoin as their choice besides continuing to use fiat.And we can still invest in bitcoin today because the price of bitcoin is also not very high and even though the price got a pump yesterday, it is not a real pump. Bitcoin still has a long way to go and so does its price. So if you try to buy bitcoins now, you will see an increase in the value of your asset later and it will surely surprise you.",

However, after that, the price seems to subside already, so for now, let's say it's good while it lasted.And hopefully we can maintain that $25k label because that is the biggest resistance so far. Every time we try to break into that price, we can't seems to maintain it. As if there are forces pulling it down.",

You probably get high on the recent FOMO that makes you wet on the dream but Bitcoin won’t pump that much if the economy is in the verge of collapsing. I know that people might speculate that whales will move their fiat to crypto to avoid the impact of financial crisis but the real concern is people still needs to convert Bitcoin to fiat in able to use it to purchase since Bitcoin is not yet a legal tender. I don’t expect a non stop while there’s a lot of uncertainty in the global economy.",

Well, you know it's not that how it works because there's always a resistance which means it will stop somehow but will continue depending on the hype/fomo of the market. If there are no buyers you won't be able to see Bitcoin price continuously pumping, right?You should understand how the market works and not just assume that things will works this way magically. There's always a reason on why it's happening despite of what you are thinking/dreaming. Well, apparently it will happen after the halving next year but the real pump will likely going to happen at Q4 next year IMO.",

I still think a lot of people are still hesitant to hold their bitcoins long term so they are very keen to sell them when small pump occur like the last few days. But strong support at $24K can be expected and continued upside should become a reality.I didn't believe bitcoin would reach $25K in March, but I was wrong. But it may be true that it is still difficult to get bitcoin to stay above $25K today. Investing now is the best option, and once again the long term optimism about bitcoin's potential should have increased.",

So can't expect a bull run without big money flowing into the market. The world economy is currently not fully improved, but that does not mean that everyone can predict the condition of the world economy at the end of this year now. Because it is possible that before the end of this year the world economy can improve and there will be more people who will enter several markets including the crypto market to make purchases on Bitcoin which of course is already known as an excellent investment asset. I'd be more than happy to see that Bitcoin can get an improvement to go to the moon again even if not in a short time this year, because every price increase definitely takes time even though it doesn't always take a long time to increase in price, but in general it always takes time in every increase.",
