Only had Top/Bottom 30 before as made sense for DT1 charts but not for these.Have also updated the Total no.1 of DT members chart to include DT, DT>0, DT>1 and DT>2 combined*. Thought it was interesting to note the difference between DT and DT>0 is very minor.Quote from: dragonvslinux on September 06, 2023, 04:09:04 PM* DT>0 means DT(+1) or more.",
