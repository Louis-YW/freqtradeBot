  "content": "QuoteArgentine Company YPF Luz Takes Bitcoin Mining to the Oil WellsCryptocurrency miners are always looking for new forms of getting cheap and convenient power sources to run mining operations. YPF Luz, a subsidiary of the state-owned YPF in Argentina, is running a pilot project to take advantage of flare or residual gas to power bitcoin mining operations. This project, which has been running for three months in Vaca Muerta, a large oil field in the country, seeks to take advantage of this gas, which would be otherwise be burned.The gas in these oil fields cannot be taken to other sites to be used, so the only way is to bring interested parties to the zone. YPF Luz already has a series of customers that pay for this kind of power, which is being produced on-site with generators installed during the oil well drilling phase.Martin Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz, stated:This first pilot, which is already operating, operates with 1 [megawatt] of generation and a second project is being developed simultaneously to start operating before the end of the year, with about 8 MW, in the Bajo del Toro area.Customers and Modus OperandiMandarano also referred to the relationship the company has with these customers, and how they pay for this generated power. The payment varies, and is sometimes tied to the price of the asset mined on international markets, and sometimes the price is fixed by the company. However, he did not specify the conditions in which a company would pay in one way or the other.Given the nature of the operations, the equipment must be moved to new locations when the drilling of the well in which the generator is installed is finished. However, this is no problem, because the equipment is designed to be portable and modular to be able to be carried to other locations quickly.Mandarano clarified that this new focus is part of an atypical solution to the power problem. He stated:We are taking the demand to where the supply is, in this case in Vaca Muerta, when normally the supply is elsewhere, hundreds or thousands of kilometers away, for which it is necessary to build transmission, which is precisely one of the infrastructure problems.Other big mining companies have already established a presence in Argentina, like Bitfarms, which recently started operations in a facility located in Rio Cuarto.SourceJust an amazing news article I was reading earlier this noon. I am impressed the way this subsidiary is working to generate the business using the very natural fuel and instead of considering it challenging to get this fuel piped somewhere else due to unfavourable conditions / far off location they literally managed mining operations to bring in the area and supplying them electricity right from their burners. This is like creating mining hub near to energy source to reduce the costs like building up huge gas processing station, pipes carrying them thousands of miles away into the city, extra labour to work on maintenance and much more!This has surely brought down the cost of electricity since it’s being produced right at location and supplied to just handful distance. Overall this seems to me intelligent way to push the mining operations. Do you feel this Argentine based Subsidiary could start revolutionary way for miners and bring up Hub like structured all over the globe where feasible natural energy sources are available?",

I don't remember which country. Such electricity production is really small (1 megawatt is close to nothing), so it couldn't make a difference.However, I appreciate engineers, who find ways to utilize energy that otherwise would have been just wasted away. Congratulations to this Argentinian company. I really hope that more crypto miners from Argentina will join this project and use the energy to mine crypto. The national currency of Argentina wasn't really strong, if I remember this correctly. Perhaps Argentina could embrace cryptocurrencies and make Bitcoin a legal tender.",

Similar to this Kenyan energy company KenGen called bitcoin miners to operate close to the location of geothermal energy production, so that the excess energy can be used for mining purpose. This will drastically cut the huge amounts spend on electricity for bitcoin mining. However no bitcoin miner have shown interest on the announcement of using the excess energy.Kenyan energy company entices Bitcoin miners with geothermal power",

Thanks for this share and hope in other way? there will be best outcome from what had happened in that country you mentioned.and Indeed that adopting will make it more better than residual gas using.",

      "body": "So if I understand this correctly.... residual \"Gas\" can only be burnt whilst a new hole is drilled.... right? So my question is this...1. What happens if no new holes are drilled?2. How long are the residual \"Gas\" burnt for energy, until they shut it down?We all know mining require a very constant and stable energy supply, so how effective will this be ...if they constantly have to switch off for hours or days to relocate to a new drilling site?",

And I salute the idea that instead of burning gas for nothing, they use it better, mining bitcoin, reducing pollution, and yes, making some profit too on the way. It's one of the rare cases everybody is winning.",
