I don't think you understood it right. Bitcoin is a very volatile asset, I don't say it is a most volatile asset of course. If you want to accept it for your business to escape the volatile, that is not correct. I guess you implied about escape inflation or hyper inflation from governments and central banks with their fiat currencies.Is it what you meant?QuoteI wanna know that is there any platform where after depositing BitcoinBTC it can be automatically converted to on others currency (specially in stable coin).

Thank you all You wanna start accepting BTC but then you wanted to turn it into stablecoin after, that seems pointless. Why not just accept stablecoin directly? The volatility can be an advantage but also a disadvantage. It is more of an advantage if you can hold BTC for a long time which is what you wanna do for higher rewards. I think you are at the right time to accept BTC and the price will be going up. Its a double profit for your business.",

Additionally, there is BitPay that, if I'm not mistaken, does have that option too. If you consider accepting bitcoin, and converting it manually to another currency, check out BTC Pay server, which is an open-source, self-custodial alternative.

Thank you all Well, for me personally, i think your best bet is to make use of an exchange like binance, Remitano etc, any exchange that offer P2P trading, on exchanges like this, you can easily convert your bitcoin to any stable coin of such or better still, convert to your local currency which you can instantly withdraw to your local bank account..But another question I have in my mind right now is, what is the essence of accepting bitcoin for your goods and services if you don't plan on holding it for a while at least ?",

Thank you all Very simple question and this is a very reasonable question too from a beginner here. If you need direct conversion from Bitcoin to other stable coins, you can use some well-known exchanges because you can send it directly from the wallet you received the Bitcoin directly to the exchange. But if you want a p2p conversion, you can use a wallet that has a direct swap feature, like the trustwallet example. But I prefer if you want to keep your Bitcoins in the safest wallet because it is for your convenience in running your own business and making conversions to exchanges directly when you need or it's time to convert to other stable coins.",

Some members here run a business accepting Bitcoin as well but he is urged to stop because it was not legal in their country. However, you can't escape from the volatility, in fact, you are already facing it when accepting Bitcoin. I know some people are already successful in doing this but the question is if you can manage to deal with the situation. Because I was sure that it won't hit instantly, especially if crypto is not popular in your place.",

Thank you all If you want to convert bitcoins immediately upon receipt into stablecoins, then choosing a centralized exchange is what you are looking for. Many people will say that using centralized trading is very risky but not all exchanges are as risky as FTX or Mt.gox. Try using binance, I think it meets your requirement.",

Thank you all When you are ready, you will not exchange anymore. You will discover how much valuable keeping those coins is, and pay others with it. And you will save from exchange or payment processor fees. This is what some communities are discovering worldwide, especially those who have been traditionally away from \"the system\" of banks etc.The transition to this is tricky, and can lead to an unfair dependency path. There may be a solution that works today that fails tomorrow, and that's not Bitcoin's fault. It is incorrect to think of Bitcoin as some fancy alternative payment method, its true value lies within itself. Think of offering to pay wages with it, for example... Then you'll exchange less and less of it until you break chains and become free.Do not trust \"stable\" coins, they are as worth as the gov fiat they claim to be pegged to, actually even worse than that. They are pegged with fractional reserve (ie: 30%), time bombs. The bolivar (VEB) was pegged by decree in 2003 to the USD for 1 600, today you would need 2 400 000 000 000 000 of those for 1 USD. A peg is but an empty promise that can be broken at anytime. The market price of bitcoin is honest, just look at it in the long term its still worth more than 2 years ago... USDT has been caught more than once failing to fulfill their own promises, and its not the only one...So you don't want to convert it, you want to keep it as it is. And for that, many true Bitcoin wallets exist. Only exchange what you must and hold the rest in your own wallet. Do you think it may value twice in the next two years? Its quite possible you know, and more importantly you will get ahead than the rest of the people failing to realize this yet.Repeat after me: Fiat is trash and \"stable\" is worse. You want fluctuation, fluctuation means freedom; market price is honest, a fictional \"stable\" price is a lie that will burst sooner or later, exactly like the distortion created by the State meddling with the economy. The more they intervene, the worst it will be later... Keep as many bitcoins as you can and only spend whats absolutely necessary, and the less exchanging, the better.",

You can't just wake up in a day and you will decide to start accepting bitcoin as your payment method when you don't know basic things about bitcoin, if you hear people discussing about bitcoin and you also decided to start accepting bitcoin then you are wrong, you should have idea what bitcoin is all about, how to secure your bitcoin, the appropriate wallet to secure your bitcoin, how to backup and secure your private key, how to be safe from scammers.
