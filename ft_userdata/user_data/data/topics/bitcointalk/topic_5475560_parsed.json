It is clear that you need to try to get used to the forum if you want to communicate on it, because you are joining an already existing community with its own rules. \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"But here you are talking about opening up the earning opportunities that Bitcoin offers. But in this, too, haste can lead to the fact that you may not earn, but lose. It is important to understand everything and only then begin to act actively.So the call to take your time is good in almost any undertaking.",

      "body": "A major fact that applies to life in general that most people have refused to adhere to is \"Everything has time\" this does not only work here but in life generally, but in the case of Bitcointalk forum newbies are mostly found rushing to meet up with some who have been here for a long time. Maybe it could a caused by the circumstances in which they heard about forum, like someone introducing the forum as a place they can earn instead of learn thereby omitting the L, Hence they start trying to rank up in order to start earning. Undermining the fact that people who are ranked up spent a very long time to learn and as a result of lessons learnt they ranked up. For the purpose of rushing to rank up has led to different negative results some could be positive if they took corrections but some negative due too spamming and other fact like plagiarism etc.To any newbie who might be reading, stay positive and use the search button regularly and find answers to what you wish to learn. The forum have lasted over a decade and more so almost everything you which to talk about has been talk about so to avoid things like plagiarism search if it has been treated and grow gradually.",

The first advice should be treat it as free place where you need to learn and maybe later help others on some difficulties. Just has you said almost everything has been treated before but still you will see some threads still getting merits because of the efforts newbies put out to that thread. The thing that gets most newbie either finding it hard to rank up or not later got caught for plagiarism is by teaching what they don’t know. Ranking up doesn’t mean you need to create threads everyday, your posts can get you the merits you need ti rank once you learn properly first.",

This explains the reason for the rush. They want to quickly catch up with the reason they joined the forum in the first place. This can be risky as they may end up going against the forum rules and of course we know this comes with consequences. A newbie is supposed to be a novice,  someone who has very little or no knowledge about a particular field they've just entered. The right thing to do at this point is to learn first. What ever notion you joined the forum with needs to kept aside first for you to give way for self development. Open your mind to learning then merits and ranks will come naturally.",

It is impossible for you to start rushing in school, for instance because you want to become a nurse, and you know that after you have graduated, there is job sown awaiting you and you decided to only attend the first semester without proper seriousness and you don't care about attending the second semester and you want to jump to year three. It will be impossible.This is impossible because learning and promotion is a gradual process or else you will have nothing to show that you went to school. The forum is a place for one to grow gradually and your growth is based on what you have learnt, because when you don't dedicate some of your time to learn, you will not grow. Newbies should put making money first in their mind because this will be a big distraction to them and they wouldn't want to stay focus to learn but rather they will be looking for every means to get merits without improving themselves so that the merits can start flowing in.",

The knowledge one can gain in this forum cannot be overstated; it is a school full of knowledge and reliable information to help you become a better bitcoin enthusiast.

But I think what he's trying to say is that if they can invest some money in it, they'll be able to reap a bigger profit later than they would have gotten from a signature campaign altogether their stay there. If they have another source of money and can invest as little as possible in bitcoin, ranking up should be their secondary goal while first learning how to keep their bitcoin investments safe while learning that from exploring the forum.",
