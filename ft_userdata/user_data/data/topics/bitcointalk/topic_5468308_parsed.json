Thank you boss CryptopreneurBrainboss. Ur talk just be like when people say... \"Check on ur brother (s) cuz u non know wetin them dey go through and wetin dey go through them\", \"A word a hug can just be a great healing\".Na so e just be. The courage now go be say.... \"No let an unbeliever actions destroy ur faith with God for you \" cuz like this eehh my faith don run low well well after I witnessed all that with those churches. ¬†Maybe na my fault self seeking for Sharp Sharp wondereous miracles of breakthroughs way make me go there just as them dey echo for the churches say ... \"E dey play, e dey show\" like say na film oh.Na to just cut that Mental believe and reasoning off and hope on Gods time. Impatient dey really make people reason magical worlds but I pray we smuggles out.I go try ur church, ¬†\"7th day Adventist church\" bcuz eehh na ¬†pegan be the next choice after the sheges I don see from others. I also pray God be there make me win souls for am the way u CryptopreneurBrainboss want win my soul for God on that church",

It is very sad how our religious institution have been turned into a business platform. More especially the Christian religion a lot of individuals now open churches just because of financial gain rather that preach the gospel of salvation to the Christians.Even there are pastors that God ordained to take care of the church but because of their quest to make money through it they lose the spiritual gifts from God. Already a servant of God deserve to be taken care of by the church but it shouldn't be a kind of mandatory as Christians are being moved by the holy spirit to do so.Sometimes you see some people that don't even have fun to eat going to borrow money and even get things on credit just to satisfy their pastors while they're dying in silent. And again since our faith is very little we always look out for people to offer solutions to our problems thereby making it easier for us to fall to these set of people that call themselves men of God.",

God no say make dem dey collect money even if you heal person let the person go testify and if it pleases the person to do thanksgiving so be it and no be this craz for wealth wey don enter church.
