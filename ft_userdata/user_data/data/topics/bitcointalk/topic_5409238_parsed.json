For me this is quite important because without you telling us, we will be a little confused if the post is deleted while the post is of sufficient quality. Moderating his thread to delete comments of people he doesn't like is not a great way. It doesn't matter if it's not in the reputation section, because not everyone who is active in gambling discussions always gets into the reputation section. Since it's about gambling and the thread he created in a dedicated section, it would be helpful to see this warning.",

Deleting a post without giving any reason is not a good practice because it could even affect the morale of the member negatively. But he/she should be given a fair hearing because he might have his reason for his actions. He needs to be corrected by the members of the forum if his intentions are not genuine. Please sir, give him the opportunity to air his views.",

Maybe he did that self-moderated thread for that reason so that if he doesn't like the opinion of other people he could just instantly delete it. It looks like he didn't like a lot of it.   What happened was he locked that thread and then deleted it one by one.  Thanks for the warning though, I won't be sharing any of my opinions in his self-moderated threads. Maybe if he comes up with a normal one then I might try one more time.",

At some point we need to set bans on scammers like him. Not just bans but IP bans. They might do nothing for someone with a VPN but it will clean up some of the trash thats scamming around on this forum. At some point leaving negative trust feedback really does nothing. And newbies still read his topics without understanding the kind of person he is.If not a ban, could we at least get global ignores for all user-posts or a mechanism for denying users with a certain amount of negative trust the freedom to create topics?",

It's been several months since any of my posts got deleted and having two get deleted on the same time made me curious. Both of the posts were in self moderated threads of him. After checking his profile I saw his many scam accusations, it's kind of sad that with so many scam reviews there was no warning when posting in his thread, I wouldn't have posted on the first place. He is the first person in 2 years I put on my ignore list to not make the same mistake again and post in his threads. Only after ignoring him I saw that he has many more threads here in the gambling section.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on August 09, 2022, 01:56:24 PMIf not a ban, could we at least get global ignores for all user-posts or a mechanism for denying users with a certain amount of negative trust the freedom to create topics?That would be a good idea, or atleast a big warning in red like you see with new users.",

Although it does not sound fair if he deleted some posts, but he has the right to do so as the creator of the self-moderated topic.Coming up to the red trust feedback due to his action, I think it is a bit too much as IMO the trust feedback is not for something like this. Lastly, what we need to do is to avoid any topic by him if we do not want to get our post deleted.",
