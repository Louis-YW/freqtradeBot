  "content": "As I told you guys earlier, I'm a newbie. I've actually been making lots of research based on topics I see on this forum and some or sites too and I've seen alot of confusing terminologies like:#bitcoin difficulty#coinbase #cold storage#DEFI#fork#Gas #hot wallet and so on.Â  Â  Â  Â  This hasn't been as easy as I thought it would.Starting with bitcoin difficulty, is it the same thing as bitcoin estimation? Cos I saw similar calculations while researching on both topics.Coinbase is an app yes? Does it have any other uses asides trading? Can someone have multiple accounts on coin base?, If yes why?. Finally what's the difference between coinbase and coinbase proÂ  Â  Â  Â I only picked these two for now cause I'm new and I'm just trying to take it slow don't want to end up confusing myself ðŸ˜‚Please anyone with knowledge about this especially bitcoin estimation and bitcoin difficulty should help me out, or you can drop links to sites that would explain them better thank you.",

      "body": "The first is mining difficulty, it is adjusted at every 2016 block mined. If mining hshrate increases, the difficulty would be increased, but if mining hash rate is reduced, the difficulty would be reduced in a way to achieve each block to be mined approximately 10 minutes on average.Coinbase is the mining reward for the block mined.Cold storage are bitcoin wallets that has their seed phrase and/or keys store offline and has never gone online before such as a paper wallet that is generated on an airgapped computer with its WiFi card, Bluetooth and other modules used to connect to external environment removed.Hot or online wallets are online wallets, they are not secure like cold or offline wallets. Web, mobile and desktop wallets are hot wallets.Fork can be an improvement to blockchain, which is called soft fork. But hard fork means the creation of another fork coin and its entirely different blockchain as some miners in the community supported the fork to the degree it will lead to the fork. Hard fork also means migrating from a blockchain to a new one entirely.Gas is the fee paid by some altcoins for transaction.DeFi is decentralized finance, a means third party is removed from financial institutions.You can just read more about them to know what they are.Coinbase wallet used the name from the Coinbase I explained above, just like blockchain wallet also use the name from the open ledger that bitcoin transactions are stored. Coinbase (Coinbase.com) is a wallet with exchange functionality, Coinbase Pro is an exchange belonging to Coinbase.com, while they also have a close source noncustodial wallet called Coinbase wallet. I can not recommend a close source wallet.",

He will encounter this terminology on the road to his research and thatâ€™s the best time to search for the meaning.Iâ€™m sharing base on how I study Bitcoin when Iâ€™m newbie. I was overwhelmed too on this terminology when I browse the forum so I make my research slow and focus first on Bitcoin definition and function. I encounter many difficult terminology when doing research but I use google to understand it as well as the context that Iâ€™m reading that contain that term. In this way, I can understand further the term and itâ€™s use compared on reading plain definition of terms of random crypto terms.FYI, My comment that you quoted doesnâ€™t relate on what you post, I didnâ€™t read the content of your post when I made my opinion since Iâ€™m already on my reply tab before you made your post. Iâ€™m just late to answer here because I saw other thread that I became more interested to reply. Iâ€™m sorry if my post looks like Iâ€™m not giving credits to your contribution above.",
