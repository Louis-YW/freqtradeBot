Only the kidnappers know what their plans were, but it might be any of those you mention, or it might also not be; their plans can't be to get what the wallet developer doesn't have, but getting crypto won't be far from the reason, as it's already a known fact that a tech person and a wallet developer's possibility of also owning some heavy amount of coin is on the high side.",

Reports are still sketchy by this time, not sure if they paid ransom or what.According to reports he was kidnapped on the 21st of January and the kidnappers demanded ramson on cryptocurrencies. He was released the next day through police intervention and according to the article no ransom was paid. Police usually report that ransom was not paid to discourage the kidnapping. In my area even when money is paid to the kidnappers the police will tell the public that it was an unconditional release through their efforts. Hope they didn't have access to some important Ledger data from David Belland.https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-co-founder-david-balland-freed-after-kidnapping-in-france",

I mean the people that are publicly known that they are into crypto. They need to physically protect themselves. Crypto require privacy but people like that do not have privacy because people know that they are into crypto. Maybe it is not true that he was kidnapped, but there are some ransom that will be paid but the person that paid it may not say anything. Or maybe police was able to find where the kidnappers hid him. If not true, people should still learn.",

So thanks for confirming as I assumed you are French.But I don't know, there are funny comments in other community that our Ledger might be compromised.I don't think that will be the case though, our wallet will still be safe as we have total control of it and not the co-founder.",

Just a few weeks ago someone on X was posting about how they lost 5+ BTC that was stored in a ledger. Of course though, no one deserves to be kidnapped and kidnapping is no way to profit (nor recover losses), and I hope David can recover, move on, and keep himself safe going forward.",

Maybe they are just being security conscious and trying not to reveal the kidnappers' tactics to the public so potential criminals don’t learn new methods. Whether there was a kidnapping case or not, this news should serve as a reminder to other crypto enthusiasts to be security conscious and avoid exposing too much about their financial lives to the public, especially when it involves crypto (Bitcoin).",

Kidnap someone is never a good action of any person or group of people.I do not think it is relevant to rate his platform in this case. Regardless whether his platform is good or bad for you, this is still alarming as he is a very well known personality in the crypto industry. People involved in crypto especially those with exposed personal details on the internet needs to put in extra safety measures.He needs to tighten his security because kidnapping is not an easy thing to do and must have taken weeks if not months to plan and perfectly execute.",
