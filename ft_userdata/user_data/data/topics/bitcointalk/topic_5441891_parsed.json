There was a brief period when the meter dropped down to just a few k, but it didn't last long. Never initiate a bitcoin transaction before you check mempool.space or Jochen Hoenicke's site.   Not really, as a matter of fact I make transactions regularly, 2-4 times a week and I was able to get away with 1sat/byte fee mostly. I also spotted that bech32 wallets need higher fees to send a tx than older \"legacy\" wallets. Identical transactions, almost same time and bech32 took longer and demanded higher fee. Just a coincidence? So, ordinals are to blame for this, exactly as I thought... can we (Bitcoin community) do something to get rid of them? Nodes can ignore them perhaps? This crap has to be stopped, it reminds me of 2017 and tx spam by big blockers, people paid thousands in fees...  Regarding this: Quote from: PmalekNever initiate a bitcoin transaction before you check mempool.space or Jochen Hoenicke's site.   I'm not sure why you're so ultimative.

I got used to 1sat/byte transactions and they always get through so I sent a couple of sats to myself Cheap fee rate and cheap transaction fee won't last forever. You learned a lesson this time so let's be prepared better for next times. When transaction fee is cheap (means you can get a confirmation with lowest fee rates like 1 sat/vbyte or 2 sat/vbyte, you should move your bitcoin or consolidate your small inputs.Take advantage of such time to consolidate small inputs that is helpful to reduce transaction size later when you need to send it to somewhere. It is very helpful and fee-saved when network and mempools are heavy and you have to use higher fee rate.See your Tx in mempool with Bitcoindata.science and impacts on transaction sizes by inputs and outputs.[Guide] Consolidate your small inputsQuoteyou can't imagine how surprised I was when I saw my tx is ~75mb from tip! My wallet suggested a fee of 10sat/bytes!Not surprised at all. Centralized exchanges and centralized platforms always proceed user withdrawals with very high fee rates but they charge very expensive withdrawal fee on users. As a user, you can not control it and another lesson is: if you want to control fee rate you use for your transaction, let's use self custody wallet and broadcast your transaction from it.QuoteSo, what's going on? Is this connected with that ordinals mumbo-jumbo?  Likely the cause is partially from Ordinals.However, more general, Bitcoin network usually has more demands when BTC price moves sharply upwards or falls down rapidly. It results in greed and panic that will cause more demand to move Bitcoin on the network as fastest as possible.",
