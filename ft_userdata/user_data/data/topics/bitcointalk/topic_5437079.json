      "body": "FOMC is a meeting to review and discuss about monetary policy, in the end usually they will create a decision either increase or decrease the fed interest rate, or just let it with the current rate if they need to see more progress.When the fed interest rate increase, it's become more expensive to borrow money from banks, it will increase inflation too and the whole economy will get impact. The reason why people correlating the fed interest rate increase and Bitcoin price is, they think not many people will invest in Bitcoin because they will have financial problem and only spend the money to buy food.But from my personal opinion, it's not actually affect Bitcoin, but it's more affect to stock since each company have debt and rely on financial.",

Last time when powell announced he will have to keep hiking rates the entire 2023, btc dropped from 18.3k to 16.3k continuously for the next few days.However, the effect goes away with time, but we have to prepare for 1-2k$ volatility on the times of fomc meetings.Im sure this time too when the fed announces its next decision, we will see either 25k or back to 20k-21k range pretty soon after it.",

If stocks react badly, Bitcoin merely follows. We can expect as people have responded above that any indication of interest going down (or rate of hikes slowing) and stocks should react positively.Effect is also temporary. Doubt Bitcoin prices maintain the purge or rally resulting from that.",

On the contrary, increasing the interest rate is one of the most common tools to combat inflation. Increasing the interest rate means reducing the money supply, which means reducing spending, which hopefully means falling down of the prices of goods and services. In the US, for example, the Fed was forced to raise the interest rate 7 times last year alone to try to tame the high inflation rate. They badly needed to lower down inflation that they even had to raise the interest rate by 75 basis points for 4 times. That high of an interest rate hike was never implemented for decades. The inflation rate was too high that the Fed raised the interest rate high enough to face the risk of recession.",

Everyone should try to research about Pearson Correlation Coefficients between different cryptocurrencies, then include Gold and Bitcoin. If the value is = 0.50 - 0.75, it's fairly correlated, and if the value is = 0.75 and above, it's definitely closely correlated. It changes from cycle to cycle or cycles within a longer cycle.My guess would be, its yearly value might be around some points above 0.50 because check the charts of Bitcoin and SPX Index. The peak during 2021, and the valley during 2022 were mere months different.",

There is usually a dot plot which traders look at and they can see how dovish or hawkish the fed is.Most likely nothing exciting will happen with this meeting. What is more important is the CPI and the unemployment numbers following. We don’t want to see high inflation and lower unemployment because that would be very bearish.",

Similar to a roller coaster, you have no idea where it will go. And that's perhaps why it has such a wide range of admirers. True, the dollar's strength may affect the cryptocurrency market, but it's not the sole element in determining Bitcoin's worth. World events, news, and investor mood are just a few of the many contributing variables. Therefore, pinpointing a cause for Bitcoin's volatility is challenging. Therefore, I put more stock in technical analysis than in fundamental research. So many news and events to watch. Lets the candles tell their story",

So soon businesses will need to lay off some people. Then there will be a recession and how will the fed fix it? By cutting rates and printing money again. And it’ll be a complete repeat.This is why many are predicting a repeat of 1970s where we got inflation waves and might hit double digit inflation this time around.",
