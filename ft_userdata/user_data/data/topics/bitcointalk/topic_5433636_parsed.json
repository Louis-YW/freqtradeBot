It was likely the lack of deleting previous bumps as stated above (it'll make your thread look neater too if you do that).If you post updates in your bump you can consolate them all into your first or second post (and can do it via copying what comes up when you click quote if you want too).",

I just learnt something new. Although I don't run services that is why I don't remember the rule of deleting older bumps after 24hrs.If I should ask, are there special reasons for that if not making the person's posting profile neat?What is the concern of the forum about a user personal profile?I ask because I have seen the post history of some bounty hunters filled with links upon links and they are neither deleted or temporarily banned.",

Definitely, here is what applies. I'm sure to have seen this rule before although, I was wondering how do one gets banned twice. You didn't state it to be a temporal ban or something but, yeah. Spamming could earn you some bans as, you end up giving moderators more job to do everyday with certain repeated behaviour like just bumping. This counts as spam, becomes annoying and attracts some punishments.Perhaps if you had other posts just after at other times, if would be less detasteful so, you could try doing that.",

Some users can boost their ANN thread with multiple bumps and it would give the impression that there is so much discussion going on it, while there isn't.It could also be to reduce activity boosting which used to be a thing when account farming was was to do without merits.Quote from: uchegod-21 on January 10, 2023, 08:49:55 PMI ask because I have seen the post history of some bounty hunters filled with links upon links and they are neither deleted or temporarily banned.Bounty spam is limited to certain boards and doesn't exactly break any forum rules.",
