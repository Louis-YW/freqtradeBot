Quote from: heartbit.offical on September 18, 2023, 06:38:42 AMI've created a solution for this, where I look for similar historical charts.No indicator is needed to manage risks in trading, everything needed can be done manually by a trader. For instance:You have $10000 in savings. Managing risk begins with to use the amount of money you can afford to lose to trade.Let us assume that you can afford to lose 5%That is $500 out if $10000 that you have. Does that require indicator? No. But people are lazy this days to use bots for something simple like that.The second thing that you need are on trading sites that you want to use. I have seen it in all the trading site that I have used before. If you do not see it, you will see it in the settings. A way that you will be able to see the take profit and stop loss before you will be able to open a position. You can also see trading calculator on exchanges that can be used to calculate before opening any position.",

I have no idea what you're telling us but it is for sure that any of us want to manage risk in trading. But it's not as easy as what you think when you've been losing all day long and even you try hard to manage the risk when it's just not enough. So, it's better if you tell us what solution you've invented, and let's see if it's going to work for the majority. There's a likelihood that you may change some results from other traders and it's gonna be good in your feeling when you've seen people that have tried your strategy or solution and then it worked for them. But it seems that most details aren't included and hopefully that there's no catch or some twist when you're about to reveal it and you won't ask people to join a group where you're going to deploy or reveal that.",

Before trading, we must get ideas from various exchanges with prior preparation. and must have market experience to implement ideas. I think the right way to use indicators in trading is to take ideas from the exchange.But I don't think it's easy to ensure risk acceptance in trading. Because no one can predict exactly where the market will go. OP you need to present exactly what you mean but this is appropriate in the current situation.",

If yes, that is not a solution but trading must be done carefully to avoid the risks. You must know how to analyze price movement trends to know when to enter and exit the market.For this reason, you have to learn from many sources and train your skills. Try to study the indicators needed in trading to know where the market will move. And it requires experience and continuous practice and don't forget to train your emotions because you can also lose self-control in trading.Don't chase big profits if market conditions are not good. And instead of chasing big profits, you can take existing profits and exit the market if your analysis says something will make the market reverse direction. That's so you can avoid the risks and use the moment for your benefit. There is a lot to learn in trading and a long journey to become a professional trader.",

I've created a solution for this, where I look for similar historical charts.Having something objective is crucial for us to make informed trading decisions. This allows us to effectively manage risks and enhance our trading strategies.Your title says another story while the post is about indicators, as I don't think risk management is based on indicators only. As many other important factors play a role in managing the risk factor, For example, doing DCA and keeping funds in reserves for emergency moments, etc. And that's an obvious thing to follow or do while we are in the trading field. I mean, if we do not make any technical analysis and blindly jump into the market, then we might not get the results we are expecting.The objective indicators that you are talking about come from TA, and I also know TA is not enough for one to make successful trades. As fundamental analysis (FA) is also important to get familiar with the situation of the whole industry overall, So we can make better predictions and succeed in our trades.The point is that making blind trades is not going to make anyone profit. Instead, those threads will be totally based on emotions and sentiments. And whenever a person hears the news from social media, he or she will quickly fall prey to all market sentiments like FOMO, FUD, etc. Therefore, you have pointed out a good topic, but I think you are unable to fulfill the meaning of it.",

You can increase or decrease risks based on what is suitable to your account size, some traders don't want much exposure to the market, So they do as low as 1% or 2% of their account size and that is the category I fall into.",

I am not trying to be rude here but that's an absolute thing that before making trades on any token. Traders learn about that coin first, They perform many types of analysis on those tokens. For example, Technical analysis is the first thing that traders perform before investing in some coin. I might take the meaning of objective indicators wrong here but I think you are referring to the technical analysis! I hope I am not wrong. But if you really are referring to that then that's already present and now something new that you have created and worth sharing here. And the term objectives, is totally right, as without any objective in mind one can not know how much he wants to earn and how much his investment can make him money. That's a necessary thing that we all should follow without it we can lose our money so easily.",

I don't really think that any other type of traders rely basically on impulsive trading because a patient trader would wait for the proper market scenario when he/she places his/her buy orders, and those traders mostly sell when they make some profits from the initial position where they have placed buy orders. Those traders basically aim for 0.5% to 2% per trade and sometimes they can get two to three such trades a day while at other times they may not get any trades in weeks.

The user is trying to promote heartbitintro platform and when I searched about that platform on Google I got no information about it. Seems like the platform is quite new and he's the creator of the platform and it isn't even listed on Google search engine. I also believe that he's trying to explain risk management and is someone relying on technical analysis based on historical charts. Let's see what the OP will say about his platform because to me it seems like a way of marketing and nothing else. However, if the platform is genuine then we'll learn more about it from OP.",
