I'm sure later after you withdraw some money from the exchange due to hack/bugs police will seize you.If I were you if you found bugs or holes that are vulnerable for attacks then since most exchanges have a bug bounty program reporting it is the best because they will also give you rewards.",

Do you think it would be a police case?The exchange will surely track you for this thing and may be freeze your account and threaten you.But would you withdraw the money at first place ? Would you be able to live with the fact that you stole someone's money.It is definitely similar to stealing someone's money and so may be yes there might be a police case as well.Does your morals support you for this action. There are things which we should avoid to live a peaceful life and this is definitely one of it.",

Do you think it would be a police case?You can't create infinite money for one obvious reason already mentioned earlier in this thread, and also because it usually does not take long before the exchange would detect what's going on and immediately lock your account.",

Indeed, in the past there have been some disappointing endings for unpaid bug hunters even at extreme vulnerability levels (for example). I think you should first withdraw a large amount as a \"collateral\" bounty before reporting it. lol",

Do you think it would be a police case?Regardless of what an exchange will do to recover their fund, why would someone take advantage? You are being dishonest here. Don't you think it's something unethical? You must return the sum back to the exchange by contacting their support.Coincidently, I got $50 worth of BDT today from a user of Binance P2P. I have sold $50 through Binance P2P today and the guy sent me a worth of BDT twice. I instantly called the number from which I have been sent the money but he didn't pick up the call. Later, I PMed him in the Binance P2P chat and got no response. I kept calling him and finally, he picked up the call. Note that he had nothing to do as according to the order, I have released the USDT. Also, for $50 worth of BDT, I think no one will sue you here because it requires valid proof. Well, cryptocurrency is illegal here and he can't claim the money legally because he will also face legal issues because of transacting cryptocurrency. Anyway, I asked him for his Binance pay id and paid him $50 one more time. It's ethics, you shouldn't be unethical.",
