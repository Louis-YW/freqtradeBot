  "content": "It’s been so many years we have seen bitcoin and altcoins melody of bear and bull trends. Every time I see bull run, peeps will be asking two questions: 1) What is the highest bitcoin price in this bull run?2) Is current price is perfect to sell my assets? The funny part comes later when bitcoin starts falling down and goes all bearish. This is current live situation. In this trend there will be another set of questions like:1) Why bitcoin is falling so harshly?2) Why altcoins fall when bitcoin is falling?3) I sold my bitcoins in loss, what should I do?4) When will bitcoin go bull again and when is the resistance for current market?Peeps, seriously everyone needs to pull their thoughts together when it comes to situation like this in the market. After all either market crashes or it goes up and all of us has to do is one god dam thing, you just hodl your crypto tight, either move them to stable coin economy to stop the losses. However, in crypto space you should remember; you are not at all in loss if you have not sold any of your portfolio. This is common logic everyone must apply to their trading methods.  Above questions are recurring, every time, every year. Pick the histograms, Check the cycles of bear-bull and stay relax!If you see market dipping, then it’s not loss but it’s market whose giving you opportunity. Just take it",

That's why I never waste my time again in those kind of people, that think they could make a lot of money in Bitcoin overnight, which knowledge is too shallow when it comes to cryptocurrency but don't want to know more about it yet wants profits.",

Just take it Great advice for open-minded traders that newbie traders will understand because they have a lot of time checking their wallets for the price of their crypto investment. I admit that I was this kind of trader before I definitely buying the dip but if the dip still continue and I already used all the capital that I got to scoop it. It is always a psychological effect that there's a possibility that a long bearish market will occur since if you view the history as you said, There are times that this scenario will happen besides the bull. It's good to keep buying the dip but make sure you are using chart and indicators to make sure that you are not buying a suicide dip and let you wait for more than a year just to have breakeven or minor profit.",

      "body": "Trading is related to time, volatility does not matter unless you sell, but sometimes you are forced to sell at a time when the price is not appropriate, so the more impact you have, try not to covet too much and buy when others sell (they don't want to buy) and sell when it happens The opposite.As for making profits, it is linked to the date of purchase more than the date of sale, meaning that you make profits when you buy at a low price, and thus determining entry points is much more important than exit/selling points.",

Investment, trading, gambling- Time: what is time you plan for your investment, trading, gamblingCapital should be from your own money, which you don't actually need in a long term. Because crypto market is very volatile and you can not enter at bull market and if you enter in start of a bear market, you won't get profit but only loss before bear market ends and recovers. So if you have to sell your coins in bear market, you have huge loss.Strategy should be investment, long term with your own money. Short term or mid term will be bad if you have to exit in bear market.Time, it should match with your capital and strategy. Own money and long term will help you have enough time to at least exit when bear market ends and if you don't have profit, you will still have opportunity to get capital back or at least reduce your loss.",

Before when I sell, I don't convert it to stable coins to retain the value of it and wait for the price dip because I'm using immediately the profit that I make from selling bitcoin.But this time, if ever we go again back to the bull run. That's what I'm going to do, I'll try to maximize the profit that I've got and stay it with a stable coin for quite a long time before I spend it so that I get back the sold bitcoins cheaper with the profit.",

And if we have been here for a long time, we should have understood this cycle and taken every opportunity of each era both in bearish and also is bullish. But Sadly, sometimes, not only beginners, feel panic when it's getting to head to the bearish era. When the price keeps falling at a certain rate and then keeps falling, again and again, many people panicked and say about the scam Bitcoin. And much more depression and FUD put in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. It's a little bit funny because sometimes, they say that too late to buy Bitcoin because the price has been high enough. But on the other hand, once the price is down and low enough, they are stressful.Whereas, we can utilize every time to seek profits. For long-term holders moreover especially, bearish era is the best way to collect more Bitcoin, keep it in the wallet and holding for long term until meeting with the next target price in certain bullish era.",

Everyone must be curious to know what the new ATH probably is. But if you aren't greedy and smart enough, you don't need to know it to sell your assets. Everyone should have a target, and the target won't be based on the ATH. The ideal target should be based on a realistic calculation about the possible raising of BTC price. The ideal time to sell is when the target has been achieved, no need to wait for the ATH.",

This is what most newbies would do, keep following the trend without even knowing what are they and it keeps happening.How long these people would learn to do some research first about Bitcoin and altcoins.

This is common logic everyone must apply to their trading methods.  This is a very important aspect in trading. Holding a crypto coin will let us participate from any future price increase, while losses in the meantime will only be realised if we actually sell our coins. That is why HODL investing is so attractive and profitable for many investors. Timing is the most important thing for day traders, only when they sell above their purchase price they are making profits. For day trading technical analysis is important and can predict trends to find the best timing to buy and sell. But when it comes to general trends there is a lot of politics involved. One good or bad news by a big government or investor can change the market. It's better not to try and find the lowest possible price, because if we wait too long we could miss out on the next rally. Once bitcoins reach a new ATH it doesn't matter so much if we bought our coins at 25, 30 or 35,000 USD.",
