Always learn how to secure your coins first and then go after mining or trading.Providing more details is also required to conclude what really went down, sorry to hear that you lost money, hope you recover from it.",

All virtual mining - such as cloud mining, purchasing hashrate etc. is a service and NOT bitcoin mining. Discussion regarding cloud mining, contracts, hosting services, renting hashrate etc. belong in the economic services subforum and not the mining subsection.Cloud mining is not real-mining, it is almost always only numbers on a UI of a website and nothing more, only a scam.If you put your public Bitcoin address in an explorer (mempool.space for example), what do you see? Incoming and outgoing transactions? Nothing at all?We don't have enough details to help you. But basically, excuse me for saying this, but there is a 99.9% chance that you just got scammed. There was probably never any Bitcoin on your address, but only you can find that out by checking your address on an explorer.",

I never asked them for their sign board or mining farm field pictures. Yet many people believed them.",

Most likely they never actually mined one satoshi as they never had any hardware in the first place.Quote from: Godlovesyou on March 22, 2023, 04:33:38 PMCould this be some fun of scam?If you mean \"form\" of scam, yeah, definitely!!I'm really concerned that you don't even know how things work yet in another thread you you claim you're teaching people about bitcoin.

      "body": "Cloud mining is an obvious scam and I hate to see people falling for it. If you want to mine, then I suggest you do real mining. Sure, you might need to buy (invest into) some expensive equipment and you might not see a return profit for a while but you will pay off your expenses in time and then you will be making profits. No middle man, no third parties and no shady deals. All it takes from you is some time, some self-research, dedication and some patience.Anything that seems to be too easy/cheap/good to be true, probably is. This goes especially when your wallet does not belong to you but rather to some third party. Not your keys, not your coins.",

I have seen many post about this, and they all are the same. They will give you a juicy offer to get involved, they will also show great progress on your mining. But when it comes to withdraw, you are asked to deposit certain amount of fee to do it. Or many other way in which they scam people. It is always the best to avoid such things and get a hardware mining rig to mine for yourself. If your coins were in their own wallet, then you got scammed. If not, then the wallet you were using to join the airdrop, got compromised by hackers.",

But that still depends on the cost of electricity you have.     Be careful with cloudmining and don't just put money in, I hope you learn to research these kinds of investments on the cloudmining platform one day because you really won't be able to open the account you made here.",
