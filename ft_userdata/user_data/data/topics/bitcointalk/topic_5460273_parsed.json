They don't pay extra fees to use the address.Also, vanity addresses are just like any other addresses, except for the special bunch of characters. It might have just been a coincidence with an address they generated, or they might have specifically generated that prefix.",

In the end it's all the same.For some reason there seems to have been a few more people asking about / discussing vanity addresses over the last couple of weeks.They are not and never really have been that big a deal. I have used them and still do at certain times but for the most part, they are something that most people don't just because the extra steps involved. -Dave",

That combination of Fee can be absolutely random, for example, I just found address: 1EAzDjBZwjxMDGHtUWrMK9Y1YuZcepKcfCThere is a someone called Dj BZ on soundcloud, does that mean that he created this address? Or maybe it belongs to AZ Dj?I think that address is a random address, why would a 'hacker' prefer to create a vanity address to make things more clear for everyone",
