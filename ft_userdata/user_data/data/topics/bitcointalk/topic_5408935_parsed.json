But you do not have the qualifications that can make anyone give you loan. If you know the OP, you'll probably know that he already this information and a quick check on his post history will let you know that he knows where the lending section is. Also, OP is more capable and qualified for loan based from his history and trust. Anyways, It would be great if OP will be able to provide more information for his suggestion about Lending Discussion board as I can only think of a few topic about loans. Also, there are only few activities on the Lending Section for another board to be added.",

That can fit into lending and reputation board. Isn't that right?",
