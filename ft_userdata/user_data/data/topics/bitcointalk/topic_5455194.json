  "content": "So I was reading a new surprising news about CZ getting SUED again, this time around it's about US securities rules, I can't say it's FUD or not, but CZ replied on his Twitter account that he never he such invitation yet, how did this get to the public first? Anyways..While I continue with my reading, I notice few people hailing CZ that he is cool and that they will always trust him no matter what, some are asking if they should remove their funds from the exchange.As you can see, too many people still entrust their Bitcoin with a guy like CZ, don't get me wrong, I am also a fan of CZ, but I will never entrust my Bitcoin or even my money in the hands on any CEX, sorry CZ if you are reading this. Humans will always be humans, we get emotional when we feel like, we hate and love when we want, this is how we are created, CZ doesn't care about money that much, he is very contented with what he has, I am saying this as per his interview some months ago but still, CZ is human. He can one day decide to go greedy, Bitcoin was created to be under no man's control or power, we should start using Bitcoin the right way.",

He is just using his follower as shield and probably he can fight the SEC all day long because of his huge capital when crypto market will remain calm for his exit liquidity.Self custody is really the best but it’s just very hard to preach this to all crypto holders because of their undying trust to CZ.",

Anyways.I read the news and SEC is taking Binance to court for thirteen charges. Some of the charges are that Binance mislead its customers that the company dictate crypto market manipulation and they also misused customer's funds. Another charge is that Binance carried out an unregistered crypto trading business in the US. I don't know the details of these charges and I am sure that SEC has evidence to back these claims. They might be true or false. But I am seeing this as a planned witchhunt of the company and its billionaire owner. Have SEC as a regulatory body issued a warning to Binance about the misuse of customers' funds and have any customer complained of not having access to their funds? Secondly, SEC has been aware that Binance has been offering trading services for some time now and they were not sanctioned, why now? I will not also trust these exchanges, maybe the SEC is trying to take proactive measures to ensure that the FTX saga will not happen again. To avoid all this drama, self-custody is the only option because nobody can be trusted. One of my friends will always say that he doesn't even trust himself, so how will he trust someone?",

It’s better to be very normal when we are socialising in this world. Fan following stuff is really old myth now and gone those days where a true follower used to get back as trust or closeness. You don’t find it these days. Better be ourselves and close some circles before they get breached and save something for ourselves.",

Seriously people don’t still get it, it is not entirely only about having trust for the exchanger owner or someone you entrust keys to. It is sometimes about how this people could be careless compared to how you will safe guard the keys personally. look for exchanges although most of the loss of funds are usually caused by the top official of the exchange, so when a top official gives an interview about how honest he is people believe he wouldn’t run with there funds. But most times this People truly don’t want to run away with the funds, but as an exchange they aren’t the only one working in the company, there others who also have access to this keys and could easily become greedy or they could also let lose and get compromised either through phishing or any hack at all. So trusting someone doesn’t mean that the person is save from numerous attack, more so some of these exchanges store some of there keys online which is somehow exposing it to hackers.",

Binance is obviously a monetary interest to CZ and I don’t think he ever even stated otherwise. He clearly said that his goal was to take crypto to the mainstream before. And I get what you’re trying to say, but let’s also give credits where it’s due. CZ has brought probably hundreds of millions of people to crypto.Unfortunately, they’re taking big hits now. It’s both good and bad if you ask me. Wasn’t US the reason Binance imposed mandatory KYC on their exchange? If they get out of US, won’t there be benefits too? But obviously, they want to ground CZ and destroy the biggest crypto business in existence as of today. Imagine Binance falls, there’d be thousands of coins dropping to the floor.What if I told you SEC is suing CZ to destroy his end goal of bringing crypto to the masses? (it’s for now just a thought)",

I completely agree with all you have said my friend, but if I may ask, what exactly is the right way to use bitcoin?We can, without any form of doubt all agree that bitcoin no longer operates the way Satoshi designed it to be, Bitcoin was supposed to be a medium of exchange, payment for goods and services, and all that, bitcoin did maintain its medium of exchange role, but have failed in the area of payment for goods and service, and this is not to say that bitcoin has performed poorly in any way, If I was to state my mind, I would say that bitcoin has performed far above what and how Satoshi designed it, and we all must understand that, there is no greatness without challenges, this is exactly one of those things that makes bitcoin great.We all here can decide to hold bitcoin on our own and not move them to the exchanges, but how exactly do we convince other holders out there to do the same?",
