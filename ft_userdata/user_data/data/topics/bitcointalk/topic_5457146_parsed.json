Don't start by condemning your words in front of others when you start doing things, so you give others enough reasons to completely ignore you or also consider everything you say trash. Not just here in this forum but even outside the forum. Words of condemnation are not a good way to start a statement.Quote if you were the president for a year in your country, how would you treat your country economic growth what will be your plans as the supervisor over the country and how would your economic budget look like. To me, one thing about a nation's economy is not just in the hands of the president alone to solve; it requires the president to work hand in hand with others for easy policy implementation on how to tackle the economic wellbeing of a nation.If I were to have presidential power (which I don't wish to), the first thing to do is to make sure all eligible policies that are already signed into law in the country but are not working based on some form of political interest start doing what they are meant to do. Another thing is to create employment opportunities where necessary, because increases in employment are associated with a corresponding reduction in a country's poverty rate. If a majority of a country's population has been moved out of poverty, there should be a higher tendency for a little positive economic change.",

If my dream for my country as a president is to strengthen its economy, I'll have to do a whole lot of tasks, even ones not directly related to economics but equally as important. For example, I'll have to make sure the business environment is friendly. That means removing red tape, eradicating corruption, providing tax incentives to investors, and so on. That would also mean building dependable infrastructures like roads, ports, airports, internet connection, and others. It also means preparing your labor force to be dependable and effective workers. It even means there's peace and order in your place.Jobs are basically created by the private sector, the investors. And no investor will come to a place where cars don't move because of heavy traffic, where criminals are robbing banks day and night, where the labor force are weak and lazy, where internet is extremely poor and communication signals are nonexistent, where access is difficult, where grease money is needed every step of the way, and so on and so forth.",

If a majority of a country's population has been moved out of poverty, there should be a higher tendency for a little positive economic change.Indeed it is not as easy as turning the palm of the hand. As the president of a country, shaping and managing the nation's economic growth will be a very important responsibility and the economic challenges in each country are unique. Here I try to outline some important points to consider in approaching economic growth and budget planning Admittedly or not economic policy requires careful analysis and consideration of various factors, and the following points should be seen as a starting point.Balancing economic growth with social welfare. Recognizing that economic growth is important, economic growth must not come at the expense of social welfare in terms of policies that prioritize income redistribution, poverty alleviation, and social safety nets to ensure that the benefits of growth are shared fairly among all segments of society.Encouraging international trade and investment and engaging in international trade and attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) can stimulate economic growth with a note that being able to manage external dependence means that not 100% dependence on foreign investment, trade or debt can make a country vulnerable to external influences. The government here must be able to advocate for policies that prioritize domestic industry, promote self-sufficiency, and develop resilience to global economic shocks and Increased fiscal responsibility and transparency where well-managed fiscal policy is essential for economic stability and growth.Yes. The government carries out the people's mandate starting from effective budget planning, and transparent governance so as to create an environment of trust, attract investment, and ensure optimal allocation of resources, for example seeking skills development with education and training where an educated and skilled workforce is an important asset for economic growth in a country.",

Where I come from, changing the economy for the better seems like a future impossible tense and instead of making policies that would better the nation, you wake to hear news that dampens the heart of the poor masses. Imagine increasing the minimum wage of the highly placed individuals while the common man is struggling with a miserly sum. If I were to find myself in a presidential role, I'd make sure I wipe my cabinet of the corrupt officials who are more invested in lining their pockets than the betterment of the nation.",

For that I would have to be prime minister, and in order to make some changes I would have to have a team of professional and honest people around me. I think one of the biggest problems that every government needs to solve is corruption and bribery within politics itself, and for that politics should cease to be a business, instead of working for the benefit of its own country. The first thing I would do is increase wages for those who work the hardest/most dangerous jobs and fight poverty by all means necessary. Then I would introduce mandatory education for all children in terms of all addictions (cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, gambling) which would have an effect on their health in the future and generally reduce health costs.Of course, there is a whole spectrum of measures that could be done to improve people's lives, and as I have already written I would start from the bottom up, because those who have a lot of money can take care of themselves anyway.",

And even though your country is developing, one year is not enough time to fix everything, especially if all government members are still corrupt.Maybe it's the corruption issue I'll tackle first because it's rooted for a long time and not easy to remove. And it needs more officers who are honest and clean at work so that I as president, can rely on them. And after arresting them, perhaps the judge could sentence them to life and take all their possessions until they have nothing left or leave little money for the family to survive.I'm not sure things will change in the next year, especially if there are still many irregularities within the government and corrupt officials. And one year would not be enough to fix a system full of corrupt officials. Maybe 5 years won't be enough as long as the corrupt officers are left alone and there are no heavy sanctions for those who commit corruption.",

Unfortunately they are so heavily centralized and embedded in the modern economy that it'd would be impossible to remove them outright, so you would need to start with limiting the power of central banks. Setting reserve requirements, controlling interest rates, banking regulations and such, would all need to be taken back to the legislature instead of appointing executives to handle these matters by the President which is how most countries handle central banks. Doing so would take fiscal matters and make them more controllable by the constituency. Second, limiting money printing and capping it at some proportion relative to nominal GDP.

Just so you know, when the private sector is more involved in the economy of a country, the more their influence gets bigger because they hold the infrastructures, look at Amazon, they can lay off people in a certain state that didn't do any favor for their growth, that's what's going to happen to a country that has close to no barriers with economy relations with a private sector. Another big example would be the Banana Republics back in the 50s or 60s, these countries were practically controlled by the private companies. Most people who have commented their insights didn't consider that the things they want to add or remove can be a catalyst for cataclysmic economic ruin, you can't just remove banks or do what the majority wants, there is a plan and it needs to be able to do the greatest good so if I became a president, I would just probably lobby to create more jobs, bully corporations to pay their fair share and suppress if not remove the ability of the 1% to avoid taxes.",
