  "content": "I have some Ipollo B1L with 60 Th/s they have 4  3.12A FANs with 7400 rpm. All hashboards never exceed 65C. So I want to know what do you think about replacing the four of my other S19jpro that came with 2.7A and 6000 RPM, cause when I have some hot days of around  temp 28/30C the Chiptemps rise to  around 80C. Besides Ipollos has different disipation config inside, do you think I will see an improvement of lowering the temp if I replace the 4 FANS from 2.7A to 3.12A ?? any possible current problem on circuits??? anyone has ever done this kind of replacement?? thanks a lot for the reply",

      "body": "If the fan from apollo is compatible to s19j pro with 7400 rpm then it should work but I do not know if the fan will run normally because I heard someone from Reddit replace the fan from other models into antminer units the result become abnormal RPM like 6000rpm it turns to 60,000rpm.There are two different fans the brushless and the ball-bearing one Bitmains recommends only brushless fans.If you want to cool down the miner a bit when hot days then I suggest run the miner at low power mode and make sure you have proper way to take the hot air out from the room like adding ventilation and exhaust so that the hot air on the room do not stuck.",
