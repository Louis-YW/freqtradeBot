Wait until there is a listing on the exchange and try to sell the coin with a good profit. But the coin may not live to see the listing, so the miner will pay the electricity bill. It is already unprofitable to sell immediately, the profit has fallen.",

I do not believe in similar coins, but we do not invest in them, but try to get more profit from mining. When a coin appears on the exchange, the mining profit will drop to the standard values â€‹â€‹on other coins.",

With offline mining, miners donâ€™t need to rely on centralized mining pools and internet connections. You can mine CAU from any place in the world with just your mining devices.https://canxium.medium.com/the-unique-mining-offline-2c61ffb11e6dThe article is interesting, but I did not understand the technical aspects of this mining.I donâ€™t see any big problems in this, but all miners are more interested in profit and energy consumption rather than technical aspects.",
