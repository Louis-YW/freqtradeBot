Not 100% sure, but I think this is just the default welcome message of Discourse forum software.But yea, OP at least create a decent description instead of just saying \"A new site has arrived!\" that links to an empty forum lmao.",

What to do next?You did the easier and simpler part of the job, registered the domain, installed two scripts and added the donation address.I am quite curious about the basic idea and what you want to achieve with this site. What exact problem did you recognize, and which will your service solve?",

Don't get me wrong, some folks might click just 'cause theyre curious.  But that curiosity ain't gonna turn into real interest or anything meaningful ya know? You're not doing yourself any favors with this kind of hard sell.  More likely to turn people off than get them excited about what you're offering.  Id rethink the strategy if I were you.",

Aside from that, since this is considered a project that hopefully will grow if you’re able to do the needful and make some necessary adjustments then you should consider moving this thread to “project development” board. Why is everything about the OP appearing all wrong, not necessarily the project but the presentation of itYou drop a link without explanations as to what it is, then someone visits the link, only to discover the platform requires a profile picture and a name in a world where anonymousity and pseudo-anonymousity is the order of the day.
