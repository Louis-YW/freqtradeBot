Bitcoin public key generates an address, but bitcoin private key will generate bitcoin public key. Bitcoin private key starts from 5, K or L, while bitcoin public key start from 02, 03, or 04. 5 (private key) and 04 (public key) for uncompressed bitcoin addresses.Master private key generates the master public key. The master public key generates bitcoin addresses. Master private key start from xprv for legacy addresses, yprv for nested segwit addresses while zprv for native segwit. The master public key start from xpub, xpub or zpub.",

If they know your Bitcoin public address, they can send bitcoin to it.But you receive bitcoin or not, it depends on whether you still have access to a wallet that contains the public address or its private key. If you lose it, you don't receive the bitcoins.A Bitcoin private key is like your signature or your house key. If you want to enter your house, you need the key. If you want to send your bitcoins, you need a Bitcoin private key to sign that transaction.With a Bitcoin private key, you can recover your wallet and the corresponding public key and public address.For technical clarification, read it on Learnmeabitcoin and Mastering Bitcoin book (Chapter 4).

Confirmation of Bitcoin transactions is not given priority based on their volumes, but rather on the fees paid. The higher they are, the greater their chance of being included in the next block. Sometimes the fee for sending a million dollars in Bitcoin is equal to $1, and sending $10 costs $2.QuoteFunds that haven’ to been authenticated by miner are known as unconfirmed transaction and goes back into the sender’s wallet.Generally, it doesn’t happen. It takes 10 minutes for authentication only. In some cases where there is extreme traffic, it has been reported to lasting even for 1 hr. This is not true. After signing the transaction, it is broadcast to mempool of the contract. This mempool is the place from which the miner takes the transactions to include them in the block after mining the block. As long as you continue broadcasting the transaction, it will be confirmed, but it will not return to your wallet after an hour.QuoteThey help to keep the security system clean and keep the brand from earning any dubious distinction. It also minimizes the chances of double-spending of Bitcoins.there is no relationship between Full Node and minimizes the chances of double-spendingAll answers require revision.",

Adding of a transaction to a block is not done after mining but before.There is also no guarantee that a transaction will be confirmed even if you keep broadcasting it, but you're right that it will take far longer than an hour for it to be dropped from majority mempools, the most universal time is 2 weeks. The Bitcoin does not have to be returned to the wallet cause the transaction was unconfirmed and they never left.",

Even with a restricted timeframe, there's no reason why someone couldn't prepare their answers in advance. Given the limited number of questions, they could simply access the registration multiple times, write down all the questions that come up, and then research and prepare all the answers at their peace. Once they have all the answers, there's no issue with creating numerous accounts one after the other.",

What is Bitcoin address?How do I receive a Bitcoin?What is Bitcoin trust?.................How to receive Bitcoin simply provide the sender with your Bitcoin address which you can find in your bitcoin wallet.What is your answer for first and second questions?You actually asked 4 questions then How can you say answer the first and second questions only? well, maybe I am interpreting your post wrong. But here is the answers to all of your simple questions. I hope they will help you to understand them easily. 1. Public key is visible to everyone else. For example, you wanted to send some money to another person but you need a public key, then you can use the PK (public key) to send money and you can also use PK for encryption and decryption purposes. But the Private Key (Pr K) if shared with others, then they could easily access your wallet and the assets it holds too. You have to understand one thing that;\"Not your key, not your coins\" If you tend to follow this rule then you will be safe from almost big scams. 2. Bitcoin address, is a alphanumeric address which consists of almost 35 letters maximum (varies according to the security level and network you are using). Well, the address is sued to identify one's wallet from other, Because two wallets can not have the same wallet address for BTC. And you do need a wallet address to send and receive the BTC from one wallet to another wallet. 3. You can receive BTC if someone sends you.  4. answer to this question, is better if you listen from others.",

But he made a topic here instead of doing his own research on such simple queries. I think he liked spoon-feeding. That's why he abruptly asked these questions here on BTT. Well, why don't we just give him the answers the way he likes? I hope he will learn something new that he might not learn from the articles or Google search engine. You have mentioned some good links to read, I hope OP will read these threads, and try to get some extra knowledge. Because many members, have already replies each question accordingly, and some members have mentioned some links and websites links from where the OP can learn but I doubt if OP would prefer or a reader because most of us are not good readers and don't really wanted to learn and read that much when we were at his stage.",
