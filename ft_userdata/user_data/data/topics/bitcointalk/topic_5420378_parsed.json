Though it is good news, it would be interesting to see the facts about it published by them. However, it seems that they have their own “financial cards” which can be used by the businesses and have 55 days of credits for their purchases with them. So it is possible that they might have launched crypto related payments.",

Not offering on-chain transactions seems odd too, idk how this could still be counted as adoption.yes user experience of custodial LN is nothing like the experience of actual bitcoin. it has none of the features or functions of bitcoin in any wayas for having a co partner even thats not bitcoin. having to ensure your partner is awake, has value and also his partners can bounce the payment along.. not what bitcoin was invented for.. then there is the lock/pegs.. LN wallets can be abused to show iffy msat values that do not correspond to the hidden commitments and close session amounts users dont see underneath the GUIsending msats is a vocal, visual and unit measure thats not even in the bitcoin languageand then thre are the flaws and bug and many methods co partners can steal value from you.. but hey. i shouldnt say more or the usual group will chime in to defend lightning like its better then bitcoini feel sorry for anyone that is falsely being told they are using bitcoin when they are handed a wallet that uses a different network brand stealing bitcoini do not mind people using other networks if it pleasures them. but just be honest about it.. if people want to play with subnetworks like ln and liquid or other sidechains  that are bridged to bitcoin network value, so be it. just be clear about the differences and the risks. el salvador learned the hard way..... though they are using a bitcoin custodian exchange as their backbone of the chivo wallet THIS YEAR. they too were over promised features of LN last year which ended up causing liquidity bottlenecks within days of launch when they first tried LN last year",

User A can pay with shitty fiat methods or lightning, but not Bitcoin. Lets assume User A wants to spend Bitcoin, but doesn’t have lightning yet. One option is to start a LN channel, which in turn means he spends more time and fees than just sending 1 regular on-chain transaction. The other option is to use custodians again either to use their channels or to convert back into fiat, which in turn means spending more time and fees than sending 1 regular on-chain transaction again. Idk if im missing something or they simply didn’t take this case into account.",

Well, bitcoin has always been there for people of all status and the idea of it being for the rich rich mighty is a mare delusion made up by those who think bitcoin has no smaller fractions like the Sat's and Mbtc. Currency are never class based but just some ears of acceptable exchange for goods and services rendered.

If these payment systems are implemented, they will certainly involve 3rd party payment gateway services. The official website (or social media) will not provide an official statement as long as crypto services are not clearly regulated in the country based on the latest news as of October 2022. It's a bit of a dilemma, but these signs are enough to pressure the government to immediately regulate crypto services in the country.",

If they do implement it, it's good news, even though I'm not a fan of the Lightning network. My only question is why the thread name says that Bitcoin is going to the lower class. I assumed it would be some sort of social project, like a community kitchen or something like that, but it seems that the company is just a business. Being in South Africa doesn't translate into being lower class, IMO, as any country has some wealthier and poorer people, even if the standards can differ a lot from one place to another.",
