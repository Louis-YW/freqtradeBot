  "content": "I had heard of Scarce City for awhile now but never really tried it out. Not sure why I was wary of that site, but I was always stuck with this place and ebay.         Well a few weeks back I did try it and was pleasantly surprised how easy and seamless everything went.         I registered and then placed a refundable bid deposit prior to bidding. I then also placed a max bid selection in the bid area  and they took care of the rest of the bidding process on my behalf while I was away from the PC to the maximum price I was willing to pay for the item.           Once I won the item....I was also asked to pay a shipping fee as well. The difference from what I paid and the actual shipping was refunded to me if shipping was lower than the actual paid fee.       Payment was easy as Chris reached out to me with payment instructions. Once this was confirmed, you have the option prior to shipping to also have your digital item insured as well, something ebay does not do for sure. This was a big welcome as my main concern it lost or stolen items in the mail...especially any crypto loaded items.        Also any refundable deposits on shipping or bidding were returned promptly as well for items that I did not win. Any questions I had Chris replied to promptly.         I guess I will be a regular customer if I see anymore items that are on my want list popping up on Scarce.City.",

      "body": "Honest feedback for Scarce, your website needs an overhaul. Very difficult to search, find live auctions, items for sale/sold, type of items etc. Many of interactions with other collectors have noted this. I get lost in the Pepe shit  Compare to Stack’s for example, and how much easier it is to search, navigate, and organize. I would be open to doing business if the website was improved.",
