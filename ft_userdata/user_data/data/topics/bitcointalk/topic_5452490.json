  "content": "Recently I was fiddling with Google Trends. I did a random trend search with the keyword crypto gambling and found out it was doing quite well. Then I thought about comparing it with USD gambling. The results make me realize that crypto gambling is more popular than fiat gambling online. For those who are not able to understand the above graph. The following image provides you with your answer.I know what the topic is about but my curiosity led me to ask myself which cryptocurrency is mainly used for online gambling. I found out that Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum are the most popular crypto for gambling. The next question that came to my mind was why users tend to ignore stablecoin (USDT). My reasoning was that they provide an absolute figure of your win/loss. I understand why Bitcoin is the most popular crypto on gambling platforms. What I did not understand is why to use Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum. Why not use crypto with a cheap transaction fee and instant transfer? Before I end I have another question for those who are constantly gambling. Which is your most preferred cryptocurrency for gambling?",

If I should compare, I think fiat is still leading.People are also using stable coins like USDT and other coins to gamble too. That is the reason those coins are listed among the coins you can use to gamble on crypto gambling sites.",

      "body": "Perhaps the issue here is that people who want to gamble with fiat probably won't use the phrase \"USD gambling\" because they just think of it as gambling, without reflecting upon the currency. Fiat gambling is the standard, so people would just be looking for gambling without specifying the currency, whereas those looking to gamble with cryptos might add the word 'crypto' into the search. So perhaps comparing 'online gambling' to 'crypto gambling' would be more accurate.Moreover, online gambling is banned in the US, and people from other countries who gamble with fiat probably do that with their local fiat.",

I don't use Ethereum because of the gas fee, but I do use USDT for gambling. I either deposit in Bitcoin or use USDT (Binance Smart Chain or Polygon), and if I have some other token like trons, I sometimes deposit with it.Op, there are people who have enough Ethereum at their disposal and believe Ethereum is better than other tokens, so you won't expect such a person to start using Bitcoin Cash for deposit; I'll always go with the idea of using what you have if you have Bitcoin Cash make your deposit with it, if you have Trons make your deposit with it, if you have a shitcoin that nobody has ever heard of and the casino accepts it you can continue with your deposit.",

However, with crypto, it may be easier since you may not need to go through certain verification processes. In addition to that, your chart only shows values in USD, but there are many other local currencies such as EUR and others. Therefore, I don't think that chart is entirely accurate if you're talking about gambling worldwideQuote from: Oshosondy on May 12, 2023, 01:33:51 PMPeople are also using stable coins like USDT and other coins to gamble too.

You may need to study it, there are many casinos that accept coins like Doge. I think providers opt for coins that have large communities to prioritize as payouts. along with user requests for the gambler's favorite provider, they will add payment methods regularly.",

Likewise with fiat based gambling sites wherein different currencies are being used. In my country, our main currency is the mode of payment but I still choose betting using cryptocurrencies; one reason is to avoid taxes especially to my winnings. Tax in my area in particular with gambling is I guess one of the biggest. But for sure it is more convenient given the number of platforms offering gambling games. In cryptogambling sites, I avoid using big tokens because of large gas fees. Alternatives are better in order to lessen the fees.",

As I am still newbie into crypto gambling, I assume it's all about getting the best returns considering the market conditions. A stablecoin will only give you the USD value. Wherein a Crypto gained might give anyone a higher return in a Bull market. Just HODL and you would get a positive outcome. If you lost still you gain if you hold. 🧐😀",
