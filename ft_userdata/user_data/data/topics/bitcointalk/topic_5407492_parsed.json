      "body": "Hi there. Just a heads up there is a known Tron Multisig Scam going on at the moment. If you purchase this wallet, you may get the keys, however, the moment you add TRX to the wallet, the funds will most likely disappear. Please be careful and don’t ever purchase a loaded wallet. Remember never share your keys with anyone (and anyone offering their private keys is probably out to steal from you). Stay safe out there.",

(it doesnt have any TRX)im looking for some bitcoin or ethereum since some guy is selling a rtx 3080 for 1.4k bitcoin or ethereum, i know him in real life and hes one of my best friendsWhy don't you give the wallet to your \"best friend\" in exchange for the GPU?  Oh, right, because he's your best friend and you don't want to scam anyone you actually know in real life.  This looks like a scam in the making, and I would urge anyone to steer clear.  This is just another example of what a clusterfuck Ethereum and all it's shittokens, and all it's derivative shitchains really are.",

Just quoting you here so that you read the replies.Quote from: ashx66 on July 25, 2022, 09:37:17 PMbecause he wants btc?  Stupid scammer.Here is your multisig address, and it keeps receiving TRX from people you probably lied too, but they can move out the USDT, so you steal the TRX and move the TRX into a new address to be sold.https://tronscan.org/#/address/TXaYFNopc8xsjJLtVzvAVQGProbCmsuXYr",
