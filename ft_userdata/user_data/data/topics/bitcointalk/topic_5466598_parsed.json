      "body": "This is an illustration of the value of hodling and the evil of inflation. We all know how Bitcoin's price has grown more than 2 billion percent over the years. 1BTC used to be just $0.001. Now it's $26,000. Between $0.001 and $26,000, many supporters and believers sold their coins thinking they have already made money out of it. Little did they know that the price would continue to rise. The primary reason is that Bitcoin is inflation-proof. With Bitcoin, nobody has the power of the printer. No one can indiscriminately inflate its supply. No president or central bank governor has the power to devalue the currency such that in the Bitcoin standard prices are falling rather than rising.",

Those bitcoins are now valued at $4 192 000 at todays price of $25 870 per bitcoin.  This is the reason why most people are hoarding their coins and using it as an investment option and not as a Currency.

You have discussed here how much btc to buy iphone 15. iPhone 15 pricing may vary by location. iPhone series phones are very expensive when they are first in the market, but after a few days of the same model in the market, its price comes down a lot. If you want to buy the iPhone 15 at the beginning, you will have to spend a lot more money to buy the iPhone 15, but if you want to buy the iPhone 15 a few months after the release of the iPhone 15, you can buy it for a lot less than the initial release price. I'm not telling you how much btc it might cost to buy an iphone fifteen because the price of btc fluctuates from time to time so the current estimate will not match the estimate at the time you buy it.",

Bitcoin is the solution.I can now see where the error is coming from with your explanation and the image attached therein. The truth is that people who are not truly trading, investing or practical with economics and data often mistake what they read from the media. I'm exempt since I've been fully involved in such for almost 20 years now. Besides, the only metric to know the true value of the USD is the \"USD index,\" nothing else, and you can quote me to a real economist on this. It has its own chart that reads the falling and the rising moments. You can get it online and study it yourself about how the power/strength of the USD has been playing out over the years.Do you know how you are making the mistake? Inflation is internal while the assets you cited are global. You are disregarding the fact that global commodities like gold and crude oil are being priced and influenced by many factors. This is why crude oil, for example, at times could be priced as low as $10 per barrel when there is nothing happening to the status of the USD at all (no inflation/deflation), and at times, the same crude oil could be priced at over $100 per barrel, also without anything happening to the purchasing power of the USD. By this, you are mistaking purchasing power for the dynamics of these assets in that they could have their bearish and bullish moments even when the USD is stable. Take gold for another example, it is an asset, an asset that appreciated in value significantly over the past years. You don't expect the same amount in USD that bought it years back to buy it today when the asset has appreciated. That is why they are investments, people make money from their appreciation, and the purchasing power of the USD is almost totally irrelevant here. The USD is a currency, whether it remains the same, decreases or rises, assets will surpass it as far as they do well. This is also the reason you can't price the same US stocks that have appreciated over the years with the same amount of dollars you bought it 20 years ago. The value has risen, but it doesn't mean the USD fell. That's the reason I said it's the value and not inflation.In other words, it's not the purchasing power of the USD that reduced but it's the said asset that appreciated significantly in value. The USD can't be appreciating that much as a currency, otherwise, it's a big problem for the USA's trade balance.",

The increase of value of an asset is due to inflation. If you can remember when we were young,you can use only one dollar to buy lunch but presently,it is impossible. This is because the cost of production is high now compared to then.When an iphone is first launched into the market, the value will be high and as time goes on,it will start depreciating. But these days, the cost of the phone will stay at that same price of launching or it will even increase in price due to inflation. The current price of those iphones is because of the current price of bitcoin and if the price of bitcoin increases significantly due to good news in the market, then the price of those phone wouldn't worth the amount, but lesser than the amount. As for gold that you stated, you should remember that it is a store of value and an investment that can't be eaten up by inflation and that is why the value increases.",

Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a brand, as it's not a company. It's all about quality, reliability, and trust that people place in the product. Bitcoin's surely a better investment than buying another iPhone.Also, add to that regional price differences for iPhone, accounting for local taxes.

However, I believe the people here have learned a great deal about making prudent financial decisions, to the extent that the calculations for the depreciation of such items may not align with the offered price.I'm confident that Apple products will continue to attract enthusiasts, but I don't count myself among them.
