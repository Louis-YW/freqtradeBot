  "content": "Hey BitcoinTalk fam,Been around here since the early days—Now, I’m part of a small team launching LearnBitcoin.com, a no-nonsense education hub to help newbies and hodlers alike take control of their BTC. We’re still in pre-launch, and I’d really value your feedback so we can build something the community genuinely supports.What’s Ready Now:Our first online course: “Be Your Own Bank”: Covers security basics, buying bitcoin, wallets, private keys, backups, and staying secure.Built for folks who want to ditch exchanges and own their BTC. Coming Soon:Bitcoin Glossary (in two weels™): Quick lookups for terms like “UTXO” or “HODL.”Bitcoin Units Deep Dive: Sats, milli-BTC, etc.—breaking it down clean.Hardware Wallet Comparison/Reviews: Side-by-side on Trezor, Ledger, Coldcard, etc.Our second course, “Run Your Own Node,” is being developed for the DIY crowd.Loads of other cool content ideas in the pipeline.What We’re After:Beta Feedback: Test the course/site and tell us what’s missing or off. Too basic? Too dense? You tell us.Partnerships: Run a Bitcoin blog, tool, or project? Let’s talk—guest posts, co-branded guides, or just spreading the word.Pre-Launch Hype: We’re launching soon and want BitcoinTalk’s input to get it right.Check it out at https://www.learnbitcoin.com and drop your thoughts below, PM me, or submit the contact form on the site. No ICOs, no tokens, totally free—just education for the Bitcoin faithful. We need your feedback!Cheers,WindPath & the LearnBitcoin.com TeamP.S. Been around here since 2014—excited to be contributing something back!",

Thank you for taking a look, this has been a topic of debate amongst our small dev team. When we add the second course, \"run your own node,\" we will split out the sign up process from the course customization questions. Then you will be able to \"join\" by providing the minimum info and then opt-in to individual courses by taking the survey. The survey is important because it cutomizes the course for your given situation, things like platform (iOS, Andriod, Desktop), investment ammonut (cold storage vs. mobile wallet), trading sophistication (live order book vs buy now screen) etc...We truly appreciate all the feedback and look forward to more!",

I understand your concern about data privacy. Protecting user data is a core principle behind “Being Your Own Bank,” and it’s equally important for us at LearnBitcoin.com. While we’re based in the US, we’ve taken extra steps to comply fully with GDPR, giving you complete control over the data we store about you and how it’s used.In a nutshell: we will never sell your data. Our Privacy Policy https://www.learnbitcoin.com/privacy-policy goes into more detail, but rest assured we only collect the minimal information needed for the site to function smoothly—like your first name and email—and securely store it. We won’t share it with third parties without your explicit permission. If you have any other questions about how we handle privacy, feel free to ask!Quote from: ABCbits on February 28, 2025, 08:49:57 AM... i feel weird article with title \"First On Chain Transaction\" located on the bottom....you may want to make few articles or few first parts of certain article can be seen without account to give them reason to create an account.Thank you for the feedback, @ABCbits! Our Be Your Own Bank course is designed to be a step-by-step guide for beginners—covering everything from security basics (2FA, password managers, privacy tips) to wallets, private keys, and backups. It ends with your first on-chain transaction from an exchange to your personal wallet, emphasizing “Not your keys, not your coins.”We do share a public outline for certain tutorials, like the Bitcoin Security Overview https://www.learnbitcoin.com/be-your-own-bank/bitcoin-security-overview so users can see exactly what’s covered. However, you’re right that offering a glimpse of the actual content can help entice new learners. We’ll keep refining that balance and appreciate your suggestion!For those who’ve signed up, we’d love to hear what you think of the full course. We have free quizzes, badges for milestones, and downloadable resources to make the learning journey more interactive. If you have any other ideas, let us know—we’re always looking to improve!",
