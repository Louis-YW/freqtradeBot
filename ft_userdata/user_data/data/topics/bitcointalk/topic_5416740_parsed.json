The delivery process (Merit) occurred in 2018, by the two accounts below.1. Sate Jamu2. Hotel_ProdeoIt happened 5 years ago.2. Judging from the profiles of the two accounts above regarding trust: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2544574.msg35010083#msg35010083, they are indeed detected to have the most Alt accounts in this forum, that's based on the Reference I saw made by: @The Pharmacist.So, the conclusion I can draw in a case like this.That: It is very likely that the @Ndasmu Njeblug account, was sold by the owner, considering that the Alt account above has been inactive since 2019, I suspect the account changed hands, that's a decision I can deduce.",

According to BPIP, Ndasmu Njeblug has received 6 merit from Hotel_Prodeo and 4 merit from Sate Jamu.Both of the merited posts have been deleted and didn't deserve to get merit at all. Below are Ndasmu Njeblug's merited posts.

I don't know what his orientation is for spamming POA on the bounty thread, and I see no other reason for him than wanting to increase his activity points or whatever. Recently a lot of accounts are waking up, changing emails, changing passwords and then submitting applications on signature campaign. Some verified accounts were sold, they couldn't prove account ownership and started looking for more or less the same reasons as others. But basically applying on a bounty thread is allowed even more than one thread, but when it's done blindly then someone will be suspicious about that activity pattern.",

He can explain that he wants to get all the shitcoins in the world. But having reached the rank of a member, his behavior may change, and then it will be a litmus test whether he is a plagiarist, a spammer, or someone else's alternative account. When I add these to my favorites, they usually quickly expose themselves. By the way, OP, I'll update my post. Look at the account. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=937571The registration date is the same as your account. Needless to say, this is a coincidence, right? Examine the speed with which this account is added to the bounty as well. exactly the same behavior. And then we see participation in a subscription company. I'm more than sure that your account example will work the same way. Most likely, some old farmer woke up.",
