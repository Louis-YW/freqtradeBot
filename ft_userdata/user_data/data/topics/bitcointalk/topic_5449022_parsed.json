Why sell this if the payback is less than 1 month?I don’t know if these are real ASICs or it’s a hoax, but this is minus one coin for mining on video cards!Do not think to buy, waiting for verification",

The hashrate of the KS3 ASIC miner is supposedly 8.3 TH/s with a 3188 Watts of power usage, meaning a 0.38 J/GHs power efficiency. As a comparison a single RTX 3070 GPU optimized does something like 600 MH/s at 90 Watts of power used, so a single KS3 ASIC miner is equal to around 14000 Nvidia RTX 3070 GPUs in terms of hashrate and is going to be way more power efficient. With the current total network hashrate of Kaspa (KAS) at around 1.16 PH/s at this very moment, doubling it with the Antminer KS3 ASIC miners would only take just like 140 devices and Bitmain should be producing way more than that for sure…https://cryptonews.net/news/mining/20993937/Profit about a million a year now.
