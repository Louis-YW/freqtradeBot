RISK FACTOR  ASSOCIATED WITH AI TEXT PREDICTION COMES VIA WHEN.Your phone is stolen by another crypto holder..You sell your phone to someone without erasing your data..You gifted your phone out to Loved one ,a friend or family member without flashing your entire phone.Therefore hackers could use this feature to drain a crypto user’s funds by just easily typing in the first word phrase and the text prediction will complete the wallet's seed phrase.  WHAT TO DO                             The solution to this is to ensure you clean up your AI predictive type catch so that those data is not stored in there,  in case a senario where your phone got stolen or gets into  a wrong hand.https://cointelegraph.com/news/warning-smartphone-text-prediction-guesses-crypto-hodler-s-seed-phrase￼",

This is a case to be armed for sure but, only for those that do input there seed phrases more regular than required. This is what makes me doubt the chances for which, these phrases could be reproduced. There are very few instances where one needs to use a seed phrases, * Wallet creation* Wallet recoveryAside from these two instances, there is virtually no reason as I see it, for one to be playing about with his or her seed phrase, making the instances of the AI program to clinge unto the phrases a task not to remember as, they aren't used regularly. Again, these AI programs focuses on words that are grammatical enough to make a sense and not  phrases that doesn't make a complete sense.",

However, Microsoft’s Swiftkey keyboard was able to predict the seed phrase right out of the box. The Samsung keyboard, too, can predict the words if “auto-replace” and “suggest text corrections” have been manually turned on. The article suggests clearing up the keyboard predictive cache, but I'm sure that wouldn't solve the problem either. It's better for people who use mobile wallets should choose an alternative keyboard app that they can fully control: Android Keyboard Alternatives That Respect Your Privacy.",

Its very difficult to remember all 12/24 words of that seed, so most people save it somewhere offline and only use it when we change phones or use a new wallet. we don't need to do so often, re-enter those phrases every time you open the wallet.No matter how much or how little our assets, as a crypto investor we should at least have a hardware wallet to ensure the safety of our assets.",

Probably someone might try it but its not an easy as you think mate. Fact is they are not only a lot of words, they are also random and unassociated we well for example you take Goat and Triangle 📐 the AI prediction feature lies upon essentially telling them the words that you are using a lot and even if you are selling your phone you are probably going to have a factory reset which means that this would essentially erase everything that there is to predict it. It's also something that you don't use everyday for me I do not know where did I write my seed phrase but I keep changing, installing uninstalling the wallets therefore it's always a new one there.",

(not all 12 just the particular word).. why you may ask? because thats how the seed word library is set up.. no 2 words seeds have the first 5 letters that are the same. the library excludes many words that appear too similar.it cant predict 12 completely random words, that do not make sense to each other (do not form a common sentence)yes it can predict a single seed word if you have only typed in 3 letters at ~33-50% accuracy. or 100% at 4 lettersAI text prediction is only good at multiple words.. if..  after you have wrote a few words of some popular sentences/quotes it will tell you how the popular saying ends. but hackers wont use text prediction as a tool for seed sniffing.. they will just use screenshot software to take pictures of your display every X seconds or use key loggers.",
