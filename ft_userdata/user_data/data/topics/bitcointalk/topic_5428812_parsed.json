It have decent traffic - one of the best but the problem with TRX investment is the USDT risk. Tether (cheap usdt transfers) is responsible for the majority of TRX traffic. So if tether FUD is true and Tether will go down ... i think it may take TRX down as well. At least majority of traffic and evaluation, which is enormous ($ 5B).",

Proof of stake protocol and true decentralization can't come in one sentence. It's a big lie, and you probably know it.Tron may never achieve what Ethereum achieved when it was still POW in terms of network usage and traffic. In fact, the only thing seemingly making people think TRON is a growing network is USDT TRC20. To Eliminate USDT the network will be as good as dead and abandoned.",

      "body": "I have been seeing some threads who have been talking almost the same thing like this. Nothing can be expected from tron other the price surge. No utilities and this blockchain is fully dominated by the CEO itself. I can say that tron blockchain was the worst blockchain. Hackathon meant nothing. The price speculation was actually non sense thing to be predict in the current movement of crypto market. It's always going up and down. Ethereum has greater utilities that developed in various platforms compared with tron. I guess if you were talking about the price discussion and why don't you move this thread to the speculation section? It's caused by your point was talking about future price of tron which is speculation.",

TRON has already a good name in crypto, and many people believe in the capability and of course, the profitability of this project long-term. However, if we think that this can be the next Ethereum, that sounded off from happening. I'd see XRP before surpassing ETH as 2nd place but never I see TRON got it. It was indeed a good project to hold for long-term as the price is growing but this can be changed when the ETH gas fee is back to low again.",

Anyway, TRX is a good coin with a great network but I don’t think its enough to replace ETH on top and of course we also have to consider BNB as they continue to grow more compare to other coins. TRX should be more innovative and introduce something new here, they should prove that they are not fully dependent to Tether.",

      "body": "It can be said that Tron no longer has any prospects, the Tron blockchain today is mainly used for trading USDT, if USDT collapses, Tron will disappear. It used to be seen as a rival and likely to replace ETH, but that is a thing of the past, Tron is now nothing more than a stablecoin without any updates or hype. People still use it because it simply has cheap and fast transaction fees, and more importantly used for USDT. Honestly, investing in Tron is a bad idea, while we still have other projects that can give better returns.",

TRX cannot be the next Ethereum because it's heavily centralized, and there aren't many dApps built on it. Developers are only interested in big projects that would leave them with a lot of money in return (mainly BNB, Polygon, and ETH), so don't count on TRX going to the moon anytime soon. I think the cryptocurrency will be driven out of pure speculation just like it's the case with Dogecoin these days. There are a lot of trading pairs for TRX, so it's highly unlikely it'll go away anytime soon. I'd only use TRX for quick and cheap transfers, but not as a store of value. With so many competitors out there, replacing ETH becomes a distant dream. Who knows how far TRX will go in the future? Just my thoughts",

Just my thoughts I also used to believe that it was good for HODL Tron because of its controversial developer, it's fast and cheap and but after three years without any improvement in the price I dump and trade it to Bitcoin and Eth, I only used it now for trading my coins to fiat, I trade my coins to Tron then transfer it to our local exchange and trade it to fiat it saved me 70% of the fee, as long as Tron is fast and cheap I'm still going to use but for storing for future profit I don't think it has potential.I'm still surprised that some people are still comparing Tron to ETH when it was settled long ago and that it can't ever replace Eth, those who believe in this are Tron's whales and die-hard supporters.",

TRX used to be a potential and appreciated coin but then turned out to be like other disappointing projects. Although I can't replace ETH, I also believed that TRX would achieve certain achievements, but then I had to sell this token because it was not profitable for a long time. Now TRX is no different than living under the guise of USDT, if USDT collapses I doubt TRX's existence. It is a forgettable coin, OP you should be careful when investing in TRX.",
