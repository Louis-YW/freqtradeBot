Investments in trailers and trailer parks, which were being propagated as \"successful\" by seminar teachers, were found to actually be barren pieces of land that no one was using.I think it's high time you come to grip with reality; you're never going to get a loan from this site.  And, it's no one's fault but your own.  If you had put as much effort into contributing to this forum as you've put into trolling it, maybe someone would have taken a chance on giving you a $100 loan.  But, it's pretty obvious that ship has sailed.",

Do you think it's true?I still hope that there are sane users on the forum who, after reading all these red and yellow flags, will suddenly understand that I was accused of a non-existent scam, even after I announced to everyone that the UST exchange is no longer available. But after reading the topics in the loan thread, alas, I fall into despair, because all the topics have died",
