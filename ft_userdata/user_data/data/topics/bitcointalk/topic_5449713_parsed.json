  "content": "After closing the Coinslotty Signature Design Competition at the start of this week, I'm now happy to introduce to you guys our second one. This time we are searching for a creative designer who can help us stand out with our Coinslotty ANN thread, with new colors, new USP's and an improved look. For those who missed the news before, Coinslotty.com will be rebranded starting from May, and we will be flying new colors. If you're not familiar with our brand, feel free to check it out here: https://www.coinslotty.com/Now let's go in to the details of the competition: APPLICATION PROCESS:•   Similar to my last competition, simply reply in this thread and introduce yourself, your design service, portfolio and BTC Wallet. Priority will be given to users who have experience designing ANN threads and can showcase some great examples. As last time, I will have some room for newbies as well. •   There are no member rank requirements, if you’re skilled you’ll get accepted, your posting habits are not important.•   Applications are open from today, the 21th of April, and I will close them next week, on Tuesday the 25th of April.  HOW DOES THE COMPETITION WORK:•   Latest on Wednesday, the 26th of April, I will pick out up to 5 applications that stood out the most. Each of the applicants will get $125 to their wallet, together with a design package that will contain the latest design assets for Coinslotty, together with the USP’s and the text blocks that we would like to see there. We will then chat a bit about my expectations and I'll give out a few examples that I saw on the forum and liked. You’ll get to keep the $125 regardless if you win or not.•   After the applicants deliver their take on the ANN thread design, latest on the 2nd of May, an internal vote will be carried out, and the winner of the competition will get an additional $75 to their account.After that, starting from May, your work will be displayed on the forum, on top of that, your profile and marketplace thread will be promoted in all our forum threads, as well as our upcoming Community page directly on our site.Open for all questions",

They are mostly alt coins and bounty threads.I do know how to design websites/landing pages and I have seen many threads here that has similar designs to how a landing page is designed.One reason as to why I want to take part in this contest is I want to be challenged and see if I can come up with something beautiful for Coinslotty. I have to admit that designing something completely from a scratch would be hard since you guys rebranded so it's a big responsibility to come up with something that will be perfect for the new branding.It'll also be fun to design this ANN since recently I've been into exploring gambling websites ( I only play free bets   ) and I have seen many different casino UIs out there.My BTC address: bc1qqha8dnvmsu736pc0jaq90hgz977lnkll83c9eh",

Jayce has a strong portfolio, Rat03gopoh won the last competition, so I’m curious to see how they’ll approach the task this time since we’re mostly working with established assets.Joining them will be Baoo, I found some of his examples quite interesting and would love to see what he’ll come up with.  The applications are now closed. After sending out all the assets and agreeing on the way forward the members will have 7 days to deliver their version of the ANN design. I’m currently finalizing the brand USP’s and packing up all the assets we have, expect more info via messages. Edit1: The money has gone out to the shortlisted applicants, screenshot attached: Edit2: The design brief together with all the assets has gone out as well, screenshot attached: For my own reference, it's the 27th of April, 5 AM. The competition will be closing on the 4th of May or earlier, depending on the TAT of everyone.",
