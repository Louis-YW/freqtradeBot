      "body": "With what I have experienced, while using less costly laptop and phones, their screen weakens the eyes faster. But as I upgraded to mid range phones and laptop with LED screen with black mode enabled and night mode when necessary, it has been helpful and can make me stayed longer without straining my eyes. I prefer dark mode, but funny enough that I changed to light mode on the present phone that I am using and it does not strain my eyes if compared to my old phones which are not expensive at all. You can as well get anti blue ray eyes glasses. Do not overwork, it can affect your health.",

Prolonged use of a computer causes migraines due to the light, images, and many of them. I will quote it for you.Quote from: Egii Nna on September 19, 2023, 06:20:00 AM2. Vision problem: Too much focus on a computer or screen is bad for the eyes. According to research, prolonged exposure to a computer, tablet, or smartphone causes computer vision problems. 3. Headache: Too much sitting on a computer can also cause headaches and migraines. Some reasons that can cause headaches when using a computer may include illumination,patterns , images, etc.  5. Radiation: most computer screens have cathode ray tubes (CRT), which emit X-ray radiation that is extremely bad for the health. Being exposed to radiation can increase one’s risk of cancer, migraines, and tumors. It can also lead to miscarriage or birth defects in pregnant women.With this quote, I know you will understand more about the effects of prolonged use of computers, laptops, and even smart phones because they’re all called computers.QuoteAs we try to work safely and rightly, I would love to get your opinion on what you do when you start feeling pains in your eyes while working.So solutions to this are: take a short break for sometime; frequently blink the eyes when you are focusing on the screen light; activate night mode (dark mode) at night; reduce the brightness of the phone that will fit the condition of the location and time (like if it’s in the day light, you increase the brightness, and if it's in the dark, you reduce it); Put a screen guide on your phone screen, computers, laptops, and others; it also helps.",
