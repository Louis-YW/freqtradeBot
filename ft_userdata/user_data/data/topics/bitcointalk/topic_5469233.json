  "content": "I heard about Bitcoin from a friend in the year 2013 when I just got admitted to college. I took  little interest in it, but I was unwilling to purchase it with my funds because it was not very popular then and I lacked much business mindset. I even got more discouraged owing to the fact that many ponzi schemes were present and I couldn't differentiate the bad from the good. To be honest, I  saw it as a liability, instead of an asset that it was. I later reluctantly purchased $230 worth of Bitcoin around May 2014 after much persuasion from my friend and seeing that the price was fast rising. The fall of 2015 shook me to my bones and I lost hope again because I lost so much funds. Depressed at the loss I've incurred and without much knowledge on HODLing my coins and the possibility of it experiencing an upward trend, I sold off all my coins, hated anything concerning crypto and swore never to get involved again. The bull run of 2019 -2020 happened under my watch, but I still kept my grudge which had then developed into fear that I will still loose my funds again. I have friends whom gained from the trend and became really wealthy while I was locked up in my pessimistic mindset. As I was introduced to this forum, I was able to see that Bitcoin held much more prospects then I ever thought and would ever believe. My convinctions are now positive and I'll be investing again. I wouldn't want to be left out for the third time. Bitcoin here I come!!!.",

You joined very early and obviously, you invested money that you could not afford to lose that was why you panicked and sold even at a loss. Going forward, I hope you are doing some refining to your approach such that you only invest what will not make you unease. I suggest you learn about DCA so you can better handle the emotional aspect of investing. Finally, I think it is not late now.... this is the best time to buy because there are several activities lined up for next year that might see Bitcoin experience som growth in price.",

I assume you already know a lot about Bitcoin and may have experienced reasons to question your past decisions. Although Bitcoin has faced some drawbacks due to its price instability, many of us remain optimistic and are eagerly awaiting the next market upswing. Many people missed their chance to invest in Bitcoin, but it's not too late to consider it now. The current price may be bearish, but this could change soon. So, consider seizing this opportunity while it lasts.",

At early stage of a new technology, there are always doubt about that innovation but only the few that believes in the course would stand firm to seeing the outcome of it all. Although if you had been patient enough then, you could have been smiling with your friends as they did hold till the bull run. Like they say, \"patience is a virtue\" It really pays to be patient enough to see to the end of a technology. I had similar experience too but I have learnt my lesson never to be in a haste to conclude or judge a book by its cover. I firmly believe bitcoin is still at its early stage so its never too late to start again. The price is currently low and next year halving too would further give the price a boost. So you can buy as you can and never leave your coin in the care of a third party exchange.",

As far as I know in May 2014 Bitcoin price was around $400-500. Think you bought 0.5 (approx) Bitcoins? However OP if you could have held bitcoin for a long time several years you could have made a lot of profit. In 2021 Bitcoin price was $69k, you could have made a lot of profit. You were disappointed with the price drop in Bitcoin and sold. OP you are willing to buy bitcoins again. You can buy bitcoins now if you want, prices are very low now.  OP you need to be aware bitcoin price can go down you can't be disappointed. Hold the investment for a long time. Hold till 2025-26 and hopefully you will be able to gain a lot of profit.",

Depressed at the loss I've incurred and without much knowledge on HODLing my coins and the possibility of it experiencing an upward trend, Imagine you never sold your Bitcion back then and still held it till today's current value of Bitcoin, that's approximately over $10,000+ by today, because I just made a little research right now, and just made to understand that in 2014, the value of 1BTC was $338, which means $230 should have given you approximately over 0.7BTC or roughly 0.5BTC, which is still quite a big sum of money in today's value. So in all the same, I wish you all the best as you kick-start your journey afresh back again. It's never too late to make good profit off your Bitcoin investment, if only you could leave it as an asset for long term.",

Sometimes I read at old threads from 2012 and older just to get the feeling of how people perceived bitcoin in that time. It would shock you that a good number of early investors did not hodl to see bitcoin reach $60k in 2021.

This isn't very good for making objective investment decision, although I doubt that there's any place on the Internet where you can get one, because there's 3 types of views - that Bitcoin is the future, that Bitcoin is worthless, and the third - \"balanced\" or \"neutral\" view that maybe Bitcoin is good, or maybe its not. And none of those opinions are backed with solid data and theory, it's all just a belief.",

But there are countless cases like the OP, who in that history sold at a loss. Indeed, the first time I heard about bitcoin I heard it linked to scams to buy drugs on the deep web, also about the Mt Gox scandal. So, at that time it was very easy to shit yourself in the face of a market downturn, to think that the price was going to 0 and sell to cut losses. Fortunately, it didn't happen to me, but unfortunately it did to the OP.Now I would recommend him to stop focusing on the past and start accumulating bitcoin little by little, being aware that future returns are probably not going to be nearly as good as in the past.",

Op hurriedly sell out of fear and the lack of knowledge about what he had invested his money into at the time. This is why knowledge is important.",

Yes, the best time to start accumulating sats was back in 2009; the second one is today.I also heard about Bitcoin for the first time in 2013; although it looked very interesting to me, I had no money and a little debt from my studies, so my position couldn't be worse in order to invest.

I'll still not want to get involved cos my past ordeal left a very big scar in meQuoteIn 2013, it is more possibly to know about Bitcointalk forum because in the past, there are less Bitcoin communities and Facebook, Twitter are not like now. You did not know about Bitcointalk in 2013 and in 2023, when more people know Bitcoin from Twitter, Facebook, television.You say this because possibly in your country, technology advanced faster. In mine, it was much slower and as at then 2013, the only thing myself and my peers do on Facebook, WhatsApp and then 2go was to catch cruise with friends and flirt. we never thought of anything else with social media back then.QuoteIn general, this topic is like another fiction that is less attractive with forum members and becomes useless to fish merit.Thank you for your compliment, if I were you, next time I'll inquire more about the cause of people's action and not  conclude ignorantly.

OP, now that you are in the forum and you have start to understand how bitcoin works, it is better you buy now and don't wait till when you have major knowledge about bitcoin here, because there is no need you start wasting time. When you buy, you should invest in a long term and don't bother about the price movement but have a price target that when bitcoin reaches, you can sell and take profit. Only use money that you can afford to lose, or money that you don't need for other important purpose to buy bitcoin.Quote from: DubemIfedigbo001 on October 05, 2023, 02:53:00 PMThanks everyone for your concern and contributions.

Most of the investors that got lucky back there surely had really gambled that time because at that time there was really no proof that Bitcoin or cryptocurrency could be something like an investment that could make you a profit since it is just a new thing most of the people would normally think that it is a big scam, at even this day probably there are still a lot of people that would think that way. Even though you probably do your research about it you wouldn't find a good reason to invest in cryptocurrency at that time because even to this day market price of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin just depends on supply and demand so it is all just speculation meaning the market price is just so volatile and we are not sure if that market is going to start as time passes. So after 10 years, it's not guaranteed that you are going to make a profit or is it still going to exist at the time right?As long as you know what you are doing and you know that you are only investing a small percentage of your money you can easily invest in Bitcoin with no problem since you could just invest and forget about I, so you could easily wait until Bullrun or something like that.",
