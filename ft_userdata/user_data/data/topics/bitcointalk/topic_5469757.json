  "content": "I have been reading trying to learn about bitcoin and  I read that the private key is a collection of letters and numbers that are specifically linked to a single individual and are used to verify transactions and prove ownership of a bitcoin address if i am not wrong So, in order to be able to spend the bitcoins received when a certain amount is transferred to a bitcoin address, the owner must use the private key linked to the address to validate the transaction and confirm he owns the address. However, I later discovered here that private keys are meant to be kept private and only known by the owner in order to prevent unauthorised access to your coins. So i have a few questions which i am not yet clear about please i need clarifications.So when verifying the transaction using your private key will the private key be known or seen by others on the network? If so then is it not risky letting others know our private keys.And also in a case where the owner loses his/her private key and is unable to verify the transaction what will happen to the coins. Are they gone forever? Or is there a way to recover the private key.",

If so then is it not risky letting others know our private keys.The private key is not visible during transaction verification because it is not basically what you sent with the transaction data to the nodes or miners. What you sent is a digital signature and a public key. This two prove ownership that the transaction belongs to you. The digital signature is created by signing or hashing a transaction data with your private key internally and then you proceed by sending this three item (transaction data, digital signature and public key) to the nodes to prove ownership QuoteAnd also in a case where the owner loses his/her private key and is unable to verify the transaction what will happen to the coins. Are they gone forever? Or is there a way to recover the private key. If you didn’t back up your seed phrase or private key and that wallet that contains it got deleted from the device or the device got lost then it cannot be recovered as the only way to recover your wallet is through private key or seed phrase But if you have your private key or seed phrase somewhere probably offline(which is the best place to save them) you can easily just import them into another wallet",

You're the only one that should know your private key and they should be stored offline.QuoteAnd also in a case where the owner loses his/her private key and is unable to verify the transaction what will happen to the coins. Are they gone forever? Or is there a way to recover the private key.They're gone forever and don't believe any service offering to recover your private key for you because they're scammers and in a situation they do recover the keys for you (very unlikely to happen) why do you think they'll send you back the coins?",

      "body": "Of course, the entire network will be able to see a transaction when it is being validated to ensure that the public key and the private key used to prove ownership match. However, as you pointed out, a private key is meant to be kept private since it acts more like a personal password required to access your coins. Therefore, when signing a transaction, you can use something called a \"Digital Signature\" rather than using your private key for everyone to see.The digital signature is derived from the private key and serves as a substitute to the private key when proving ownership so you don't reveal your private key to everyone on the network. Here is a post for you that best explains signing transaction and digital signature. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461728.msg62634095#msg62634095 for further details check  https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/digital_signaturesRegarding your second question, please be aware that there is no way to recover your private key once you have lost it, meaning you will never again be able to access your bitcoins.",

If so then is it not risky letting others know our private keys.The private key should remain secret and you should never share it with anyone.  That is an important part for safety of your cryptocurrency.  What you give out to people is your public address, which is derived from your private key and  when you use your private key to sign transaction on the blockchain, it lets the network know that you signed it with your private key without you having to show the actual private key to anyone.  That is a core thing of how asymmetric encryption works that makes cryptocurrency secure. So remember, keep that private key private and dont show it to anybody no matter what.Quote from: Abbatty on October 09, 2023, 02:00:57 PMAnd also in a case where the owner loses his/her private key and is unable to verify the transaction what will happen to the coins.

Without a private key, you will no longer be able to sign transactions, therefore you will not be able to spend coins from your address.",

You don't need to use your private keys every time to access your bitcoin, technically private keys associated with the address is indeed to verify the TX and proves the ownership.Private keys will not be visible to anyone other than you, so you are the one who should keep the keys secured and if you lost it then its impossible to access the funds but the funds in that address will always be there unless the private keys used.You don't need to keep the private keys of your address, just the recovery seeds is enough which can be used to recover all the funds associated with the seeds along with the private keys.",

If so then is it not risky letting others know our private keys.Transaction verification doesn't imply revealing or using one's private key, instead, it is only used during transaction signing. The signing process is an inextricable part of cryptocurrency transfer authorization: other participants of the network won't accept your transaction if it didn't get signed with the corresponding private key. To prove a transaction was signed correctly, you provide other participants with information consisting of the transaction, public key, and signature, which they use as inputs in a special formula.QuoteAnd also in a case where the owner loses his/her private key and is unable to verify the transaction what will happen to the coins.

Luckily modern hardware wallets  (like Passport or ColdCard MK 4) incorporate TRNGs that produce reliable 256-bit randomness  thus their owners, when making transactions, have not be worried about  brute-force of their priv keys .",
