Is the wallets' fault or is it users greed and stupidity?So yes, you may have some points, but pointing a finger to the wallets is incorrect / not fair. Some may want to improve in a way the users understand better what they do, but they cannot do miracles. Also keep in mind that the best bitcoin wallets are free / open source projects, hence the developers work for free there.",

I believe that one of the main reasons why wallets get hacked is connecting wallet to a platform for way too long, some users even forget to disconnect the connection after.It could be that people do not properly use crypto wallets to promote security.I do not know anyone that would connect their physical wallet to anything at all, they would keep it safe and secured, regularly patting their pockets to ensure it is there. This is the same for bank accounts, people are very cynical with handling their finances linked to fiat, but with crypto, that sense of security is not replicated.A solution is to use a wallet that gives you control of your keys, and use that wallet securely.Quote from: Z390 on September 19, 2022, 08:07:57 AM2. Not every crypto users are tech savvy and most don't even know how to keep their keys safe till date, writing recovery seed down or carving on a stainless steel or wood is still riskyWriting down your recovery seed phrase and keeping it in secure places, is a secure way to store it. No means of handling finances is risk free, but there are practices that would lessen the risk.- Jay -",

Keeping your keys safe has to do with majorly how conscious and knowledgeable of how important your keys are, and the security risk it can pose if it enters the wrong hands. It deals with your security/safety consciousness. If people know that keys are important, an extra effort to ensure its safety.",

Of course we only should connect to such platform that are totally safe and we must verify the legality first and make sure its not a fake one. Most users have been victimized with fake or copycat sites of those legits and thats why they are got scammed. Signing all the transactions they thought is legit. These are common modus on crypto so we must be aware on sites or dapps that we are using and downloading.",

But you're right that most people are too lazy to even learn about self-custody, which is why they will outsource this \"activity\" to third-party custodians or even centralized exchanges, giving up their right to independently control their funds. It is all about responsibility, and most are afraid of being responsible for something. Neither hot nor hardware wallets are going to solve this problem because these are tools to interact with the keys, not to provide users with self-sovereignty and independence. You should be keeping your keys in cold storage, transferring them to wallets only when you feel the need of spending coins. Simple as that. It doesn't really matter which wallet you will choose to make a transaction (assuming your choice is not an outright scam) because it is merely temporary storage whose only function is to send your coins further.",

As for the platform issue you raised, you did not explain this connection of a thing very well. If you are referring to granting third-party light access due to transactions, then you are on your own. But if you are referring to the connection after a successful transaction or usage, you can always log out manually after you are done with your wallet.Also, make sure that you use only a non-custodial wallet that is open-source and secure with password, fingerprint, text message and 2FA protection in one wallet.",

It can also initiate transactions but it will need your approval to sign and broadcast them. Therefore, there is no security risks in keeping your wallet connected for too long, but it's not recommended for privacy reasons.On the other hand, giving a dApp or a smart contract allowance to move your coins (needs your approval) might be risky if you don't revoke that allowance.
