Yes, it's need to be addicting at some point so that players will go back and play again and again, but unfortunately, it is not the case.",

      "body": "I am a fan of online games in my spare time. and I think your thinking is not wrong.some time ago I tried a Game Play To Earn. because I think the game will be fun to play. and I will also benefit from playing the game. but in fact I became bored with the game. so I didn't continue it even though from an income perspective it was tempting. but playing it just makes me bored. and forcing a game I don't like really gives me a headache. I hope that in the future there will be games that produce but are also very fun to play. Many Play to Earn games currently only focus on the earning side. but they forget to build fun in the game to attract the attention of gamers who mostly don't care about earning.",

The game needs to be addicting enough. Am I wrong? That is the biggest problem of playtoearn to solve, the games are not creative, do not bring a real experience to the players. The goal of the projects is just to want players to buy items, NFT to make money, but they are not inclined to entertain in it. P2E projects do not attract the game enthusiasts it is for investors, speculators, so the projects created very quickly depreciate because they will leave the game when it is profitable. P2E needs to know the balance between entertainment and profit to attract players and maintain the game for a long time.",

Those people/companies will be aiming for rewards so it's necessary to be a profitable game, if not they will just dump it early. If you are just a play for free - to earn player then don't expect too much. Just enjoy it, if you make some then good for you. That is not something we get years ago when playing online games. Players always pay first before they can even enter. Top-up card system.",

Besides most of these coins are not worth the money and hence the main essence is the game and its content.While major P2E games have never attracted me yet, I am of the opinion that these games are mostly aimed at a still you get audience and not the mature ones who are knowing how to make money in real. Bitcoin faucets could be one thing that was similar but they have long gone dry.",

The ecosystem of these games are not supposedly designed for you to make a living while playing (unless you are workiing directly with a gaming company and was paid a fixed salary for playing). It is supposed to be for fun.Time to change the narrative, but it will take a long while. What I mean is that we change our mindset that these games are for fun but with the edge of owning items as NFTs that can be sold in the open marketplaces later on. Just my own opinion guys.",

If people feel comfortable playing the game and can't quit easily, they won't consider the payouts or prizes the game can get because it's a bonus. But if someone sees an opportunity to get a prize from the game, they will be eager to try to get as many prizes as possible, making them chase it relentlessly. So it will depend on how people play that one game, how they can enjoy it, and their goals for playing that game.",

The game has to be addicting enough to compensate the proportion between players who are playing for money against players who are playing for fun. This way, players playing for fun will maintain the economy stable and sustainable. That is what happens in popular mmorpgs where players practice the called RWT/RMT (real world trading or real money trading). Although it's officially forbidden by the games, this practice has proven to work and to be profitable along the years for the people involved on it.",

The game needs to be addicting enough. Am I wrong? I also think that this is the big issue with all those play 2 earn games that are out there right now. I think the main goal for every game developer should be that the game is fun to play if it is a play 2 earn game or not. I also think that sadly this was not the case for almost all of the play 2 earn games out there. They were designed around tokenomics and how to create as much demand for the game token and the NFT's as possible.Most \"real\" gamers that are playing video games (not mobile crap games) are also very much against NFT's and play 2 earn and stuff like that so i don't think that we will see play 2 earn mechanics in any AAA game soon.",
