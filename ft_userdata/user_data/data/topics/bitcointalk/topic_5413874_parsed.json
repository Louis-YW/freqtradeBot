  "content": "Can anyone give me an update about the latest news regarding crypto regulation?I'm European.The European Commission is the only body of the EU with the power to make laws. They are currently trying to regulate crypto currencies via MiCA law (Market in Crypto Assets).There is no transparency about the law, but certain aspects have been leaked. The EU wants exchanges to verify all transactions with regards to money laundering or fraud. Pretty much like the staff of banks either approve or disprove of your transaction.I don't think this is realistic. It violates privacy of users and it also makes them prone to being hacked. The law is expected to be finalized in october of 2022. 4 weeks from now. If exchanges (coinbase, binance..) can not live up to these regulations, how will that affect the price of cryptos?People could say that it would kill crypto. Some channels on YouTube do.Others (me) could see this as an investment opportunity.",

Exchanges registered and operating on the territory of states will be forced to comply with their rules, which relate to the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Otherwise, states may close the operation of such exchanges. Here it is only important that the states approach this issue in a balanced way.",

I do not make it a habit to use exchanges here, still faster and better rates p2p but I do, for occassional convenience use an EU exchange.Proof of funds, proof of income, source of funds, all done and dusted. They have not, apart from the seemingly annual requests for the above, asked for reason of exchange for each tx (which remittance and bank tranfers have asked for decades).And if it gets to that, majority of people will comply.

I always believed in the technology but I also believed, from the beginning, that government would fight back against crypto.And that is happening right now. The crooked central banks want to keep their monopoly on finance and they will use regulation (\"we must stop money laundering\") to do so. I just wonder who will win in the end. An other argument that the EU is using against bitcoin particularly, is that it would generate too much CO2 emission. Which of course is a poor excuse, but they will use that argument. I'm hoping that when this law gets passed, there will be more clarity about options to exchange crypto assets. In secrecy, and with no banks involved. If banks and governments are involved, they will either tax it or confiscate it.I'm not an expert, but when exchanges get overregulated by government I don't see how a complete crash in value of crypto assets can be avoided.And that is when I'll get in. If you believe that all of this is BS, feel free to tell me.",

Aristotle once defined money as something that has 4 features:1) a store of value2) a medium of exchange (divisible)3) portable4) durableBitcoin is the only asset that ticked all boxes so far. Which is why there is so much demand for it. Central bankers can not destroy its value like they can with currency.But this regulation is now aiming to erase crypto as a medium of exchange. Russians can't exchange crypto at the moment, for example. Governments have approached Binance to impose restrictions on Russians. So they can do it to whoever they want, at this point.When governments erase it as a medium of exchange, I believe that demand will go down and so will the price.I just hope (and think) that the world of crypto will bounce back and bypass the regulations. And when there is more clarity about it, I will get in. This is just my view about it. If you think it's flawed, feel free to tell me why.",

Governments can easily require centralized exchanges to disclose the ids of users they suspect for checking if they are involved in unlawful cases. Many bitcoin users [included me] use centralized exchanges. I'm sure I'm making a mistake if people start talking about privacy, but it's a tricky thing to explain because state regulations are not meant to be broken. But I have nothing to fear as long as I don't break any of their rules and regulations.Quote from: Upgrade00 on September 17, 2022, 12:34:12 PMThe minority users who value their privacy would avoid centralized exchanges and stick to decentralizated, P2P ones to avoid the regulations that come with CEX.I think people who are in countries that prohibit bitcoin and crypto transactions will dominate the p2p market instead of centralized exchanges, there may be data on this but I don't know.",

SEC do not have the power to impose environmental impact regulations of crypto businesses services non commodity crypto currencies..but CFTF do have power to impose environmental impact regulations on cryptos, this year there is a push to move bitcoin out of the SEC jurisdiction and into the CFTF jurisdiction. which changes the rules of trade law.. and also is a stepping stone into the EPA having a grip thanks to the CFTF jurisdiction",
