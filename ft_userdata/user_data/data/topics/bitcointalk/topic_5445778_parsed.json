That's the best strategy that's no doubt and no need to argument about it as what anyone can do. After you purchase bitcoin then you may proceed into buying these dex tokens if you think they're worth to take. IIRC, Idex was once a popular dex and has got a token but then, I have no idea how much the value of its token now or if it's still existing.",

I do agree with this, as the regulatory body continues to be hostile to the Crypto market, more and more people will prefer to move to DEXes and we have started to see this with the growth of volume on most of these DEXes, the success of L2 has helped in this area also because it brings down the transaction cost greatly as compared to trading on Ethereum.",

I am sure that DEXs tokens can be good to invest with but we have to be careful as things can easily go down in the market of cryptocurrency...just like what we witnessed in FTX.

While CEX provides authority to regulate exchange traffic, it lacks transparency and puts our crypto assets at risk due to the lack of private key control, as demonstrated by FTX's issues; on the other hand, while DEX allows for asset control, it suffers from high slippage and inclusivity issues, allowing scam projects to deploy contracts, hype them up, and then disappear with investors' money.",

Right now I'm looking for potential DEX tokens aside from the BTC accumulation that I'm doing for the bull run during the halving later. I personally still looking for a potential DEX token, so I have nothing on my radar.BTW, from the list you provided, I see that only 2 tokens have a very significant price increase performance, they are Gains Network (GNS) and Velodrome (VELO). Meanwhile, GMX (GMX) already has a TVL of over $500M, quite risky to invest here IMO. Maybe Perpetual Protocol (PERP) which has very good potential in terms of price increase, because TVL there is currently only around $17M, and they also don't have a significant increase like Gains Network (GNS) and Velodrome (VELO).",
