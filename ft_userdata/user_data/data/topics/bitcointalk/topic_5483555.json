How this video is so unique for the newbies, You guys don't even add subtitles. No hard feelings, just trying to give my review about your video. You guys should add subtitles, or some graphics too, to make it unique and memorable, so that even younger ones would also remember what they are seeing, listening to only voice is so boring, I hope you would understand. Besides this, you are doing good and keep it up.",

      "body": "The video repeats a common misconception. Contrary to what the video says, the halving does not reduce the supply. The supply is always increasing every block until it reaches 21 million.Also, to say that each halving has triggered a significant increase in the price is another common misconception based on nothing more that cherry-picking the data. Not only are the increases that people like to point to happenning 1 to 2 years after the halving, but all of the other significant price increases that don't correspond to the halvings are conveniently ignored.",

I do agree on the subtitles though and it can be a nice touch if OP gets more than just English for the subtitles.",

In fact Bitcoin is inflationary because its supply increases with time, with new blocks until 2140 and 21 million bitcoins were all mined from Bitcoin blocks. Only block subsidy decreases after 210,000 blocks.How is the 21 Million Bitcoin Cap Defined and Enforced?",

Bitcoin halving is approaching us very fast so we should invest in Bitcoin now. Now those who are currently not investing in Bitcoin should invest very quickly. Without investment there will be no profit if the halving period passes, so we should invest quickly. Bitcoin price is highly likely to go higher after the halving Bitcoin is sure to go higher in 2025.",

Now the vast majority of bitcoins have already been mined, and halving the block subsidy is unlikely to radically change the situation. In my opinion, now halving has more of a psychological effect. This is the news that the media and influencers are happy to discuss. And this event has the character of anticipation, and nothing fuels bullish sentiment more than anticipation. In fact, the halving will affect miners almost exclusively. Yes, this will be a big challenge for them. Especially for those who have a high cost of mining one bitcoin.

This is the news that the media and influencers are happy to discuss.There are two things that possibly contribute to impacts on Bitcoin price by its halving. Halve of block subsidy which will be a hook for new investors because they will fell like Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). Another thing is Bitcoin marketcap will become bigger and bigger with halvings till a time it is big enough to hardly have big price impacts.I agree that in future, Bitcoin halvings will have less effects than past events and some more in near future because of less scarcity feeling with block subsidy and bigger marketcap.QuoteAnd this event has the character of anticipation, and nothing fuels bullish sentiment more than anticipation.

Otherwise, the clock is just distracting from the topic because you focus on the arrows or on the numbers on the screen.

Did you only view the video and not listen to it? You should appreciate the video because at least the person who created it made some effort with it, and the information is detailed, and you can notice that he made efforts in searching for and gathering the information he put in the video. It's not about the animation or the visual of the video; it's about the information in that video that will guide and inform other people about bitcoin halving.For the OP, I hope you take all the comments and feedback of the readers and viewers. Now you can know what field and aspect you will need to improve in terms of creating this kind of video. Anyway,  good luck. I hope you create more educational videos about bitcoin.",
