The lottery company tried to compromise and asked to pay the winner with a lesser amount. That alone should tell us that they know they did something wrong or that their system was messed up. Let's leave the result of the case to the court.",

Have they able to specify on how or whats been done by the said bettor? or simply its just an alibi for them not to pay off those winnings?Its true that recently there are indeed topics or issues in relation with lottery winners which hadn't been paid which do really sucks on the ones who had experienced in.They shouldn't have run a lottery if they cant really pay off those winners or give on what they do own or won.Legal aspect? If possible then youcould eventually sue them out and force them for you to pay and lets see on how they would be making those countermeasure or reasoning they would be making.",

Playing dirty games against the winner will only harm their name and will lose any participation anymore. It’s hard to understand how these kind of people moderating lottery",

I don't know if the stories of lottery or gambling platforms making excuses not to pay out huge winnings to people is becoming more or that they have always been happening and it is me who have not been up to date with them, because I've been reading a lot of stories recently about similar situations. This can be really bad for the image of the lottery company and the image of lottery companies in general if this sort of issues are ruled in favour of the online lottery platforms.",

But the problem is, these companies that don't want to give the winnings, they can reason about such if they don't want to give it.",

That means that they want to pay him and just making excuses that their system developed faults etc.About the question, a win is a win, having system error is not an excuse to not to pay, like its not the user's fault if the system made an error its them the company and they need to fix it and aware the amount to the winning user. Court will always asked enough evidence from defendant regarding the claims of the people who complaint, if the defendant cannot make enough evidence, witness, then the complainant wins.",

Finally the authorities will try to bribe the judiciary and win the case against the lottery winner. Whether it is huge winning or low, it is a must to settle the winner so to keep its reputation. It looks like the platform is with plans of running away closing its service at the earliest.",

If there is an attempt to pay the winner with less the amount that they should have, it means that the lottery company somehow recognizes the win but cannot pay the prize in full. There already is the gesture but they just can't shoulder the $160,000 win. Probably just them trying to cheat the winner by settling with a lower amount. Hopefully the winner never gets tired of pursuing this case because he obviously has a lot of reasons to get this case in his favor.",

I think the lottery itself has valid reasons that are clearly pointed out by the authorities. It's now up to the judge handling the case to release the decision.Quote from: uneng on October 28, 2022, 11:30:16 PMSorry, but the gambling company didn't mention any proofs of irregularities to justify their decision of not paying the winner. They simply claim the winner is a cheater and that they won't accept being blackmailed or bullied in order to pay the money.Did you read the article? The matter was already in court. Do you think a gambling company will win just by the statement in the court? Of course, they supported their claims. There are already several big wins that the company processed without a problem therefore there's really an issue with this alleged person involved.Anyways, we just rely on what we read. We don't know the exact details of the case.",

Yes, there could be irregulated on the player's behalf but chances are slim for that. The sad thing is that we will never know who was right, the gambling house (lottery company in this case), or the person who won the lottery.These days, I am hearing these kinds of stories often that the gamblers are denied their payments. Not good for the gambling industry indeed as it will raise concerns about the trust on the gambling houses.",
