I say YES you're right and he said can you train the villagers, youths and women who will be interesting, I will pay you and I said that's fine sir.So today we went to lay foundation of bitcoin and altcoin from our little ideas, we taught the basics important threads o terms of bitcoin like wallets, transactions, hash, price, buying and selling, keys and password, exchange rates and values. To my greatest amazement when are done chief was glad hearing youths ready to do something with their time than parading with villages with issues of cultism.Is nice to learn with others it will give you hedges to learn more and prepared for further tasks. Chief actually show humility by fulfilling his promised of giving us $400 but we gladly turn it down because that's our community people, our home and our youths.",

Knowledge is wisdom and sharing it will never let you go out of it, but will keep increasing while you'll also get revised of those terms every time you teach it to your village friends. It was also a nice gesture to let the money go and instead, help those villagers learn everything one by one as chapters about crypto. Helping others will also help you in some manner in near future and sometimes, when we are talking about something and it gets heard by the right person, you will get yourself taken higher from the level you are at present. Keep spreading the word, it will help more people join the crypto forces.",

It's really cool that your boss has kept his word, and is open to what you're proposing.Â Even aside from the \"BTC /crypto\" aspect, educating people about the financial system and how it works is something priceless.Those who take a close interest in bitcoin, have from my point of view, a better understanding of the system they are subjected to on a daily basis: inflation, basic concepts of supply and demand etc..I hope you will continue to get together from time to time and discuss how Bitcoin really works, it could be of great benefit to your community.Have you thought about creating a donation wallet? Another question, are you thinking of continuing these lessons? Are you interested in how the Lightning Network works and its potential application in your community? Don't you think filming your meetings and brainstorming could be useful? It would allow other people to benefit from it, and for you to keep a record of it.In any case I wish you a great continuation. The adoption of bitcoin will inevitably go through this kind of initiatives!",

Well if that's the case these villagers would need few weeks or months of intense bitcoin class to be able to write about bitcoin and earn too. I was thinking, if Op sets up a site or forum for the villagers don't know if that's what you suggest. The Chief can sponsor programmers to write scripts and launch a site where the villagers can learn at the comfort of their homes and interact with fellow village on issues regarding bitcoin. The site can rank on google within few years of consistency, which can as well help the villagers to make money from adverts and other deals and traffics from different people who are not from the village. Such project can yield long term profits for them and strong knowledge of bitcoin.",

For now, we don't have a lot of plan but we will save it and spend when we will have opportunities.Remember this, yourself, your family, your relatives and friends always come first, if you have more than you need, just help those closest to you and then if there was more, look in the neighborhood. If all people in the world did this, we would have no poverty anymore. We are doing the opposite, for example my aunt lives in dubai, her son in laws are in car/ real estate/ oil company business, practically billionaires, once she told the richest of them that some one needs a little financial assist to start a new life, he told her: if someone doesn't have the money to start a career and get married, they should never think about it, why would I give them money?While a single dinner night out cost them 3000$, they wouldn't bother to help a relative family member with a 50,000$.So yeah, everyone should do that, while OP had never asked anything money related but anyone with a big pocket must support such communities, drop by drop we become an ocean, crypto needs such drops, because they are the most devoted and most motivated people that could become valuable assets in the future.",

I don't know why you tuned down the chief selfless gift because it would have been used to empower some community members. $400 can buy up to 6 android phones in my country which would have assisted some of them to have access to bitcoin education. Telling people about Bitcoin can be very risky in some nations that are going through security challenges and where they are high rates of poverty. People will generally think that you are very rich if they know you own bitcoin. Most of them don't know that bitcoin can be bought in bits, they think that you own one or more coins.",

With this you have to grow the stress of getting them acquainted with the internet before proceeding to teaching them about cryptocurrency. With their low level of internet access they could easily get scammed through either phishing or other malicious means. Another difficulty could be the access to network services which is key to cryptocurrency and some of these communities do not have access to it and going to a nearby community to get service could be stressful and discourages people about the whole idea. The OP needs to show more resilient because this is one hard of a task.",

Trading is not only a highly speculative endeavor, but also an actual profession that requires special education and experience at the very least. I don't know why it is often included in 'beginner Bitcoin courses' like what you are doing here, because that's like a whole different league of risk, required knowledge and required starting capital. Obligatory post to read.I really recommend skipping 'trading' completely at first, focusing on the fundamentals, technical basics, and building a local community. You may even be able to create a somewhat circular economy based completely on Bitcoin in your local community. That would allow you to become completely independent from the legacy financial system and fulfill Bitcoin's original goal.Do make sure to go through the Bitcoin whitepaper, since it is just 9 pages long and a pretty easy read, while covering all the fundamentals.",
