If you got to that account legally, maybe you can claim it back from Hetzner under the pretext that it was stolen. I'm not sure how likely you are to get it back.If you are looking for an Escrow platform, you can look at Zenland, it seems like an excellent solution for such small trades.

Please also provide valid proofs so we can tag the guy. For future trades you can join bptrade telegra group where we provide free escrow services for small trades.
