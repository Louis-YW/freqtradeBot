It used to be a semi popular bot which means most of its bugs should have been found and fixed. The only thing you have to look into is the changes in the exchange APIs that it uses or maybe adding new ones that it doesn't have. But it all comes down to your programming skills.You can also look through the forks of the project to see if you can get some ideas of what others have changed: https://github.com/askmike/gekko/forks?include=active&page=1&period=2y&sort_by=stargazer_countsQuote from: SwankyTiger on August 18, 2023, 03:14:13 PMIf anyone has any other recommendations, I'd love to hear them.Try moving your topic to the Trading discussion board, it may get better replies.

I have a friend that also is looking for software with automated payments that isn't on binance and I haven't been able to easily find a wallet with those kind of uses. If anyone can point me in their direction, it would be greatly appreciated.A few days back I tested the 3commas platform as someone was asking if one of the members has any experience with it so I planned to take some experience and what I noticed it you could attach any wallet or exchange with it where you want your trades to be executed easily fully automated. And after some searching, I found other platforms too from which you can choose the one best for you but just to clear things out I am not promoting them instead I have no links to them and I am also not asking you to join them as it's your own decision to join them. Mean before joining them DYOR (do your own research). Zenbot3Commashttps://www.haasonline.com/https://bitsgap.com/",

The only thing that I recognize belongs to the same category from your list is Zenbot. I did try it in the past and it works just fine, but it is also a bit outdated. Not sure if there is an alternative that is still maintained by its developer nowadays since the competition from centralized services like 3commas is quite harsh, even though there are cases where users get exploited through them.

If anyone can point me in their direction, it would be greatly appreciated.Trading with bot has alot in the bag than been discussed, they could profitable in a bull run but they don't do well in bear market, you will be screw before you eve realized. Have you thought it through why expert and professional traders don't make used of it, they use their head to trade and make trading set up without the help of trading bot because to be scincere, they are difficult to maintained, they can't be trusted because of the API, you may be required to try their premium service and using the basic features of the bot is going to limit you to some things you will want to use.My advice for you is this, learn to trade by yourself, get use to it, if you fail try it again, one day you will become so expert in trading that you will want to designed your own trading bot for people to use, no knowledge is from heaven they learn it from here.",

CMIIW.Ok, if I knew we are only talking about the decentralized one then I might not add it but I did not realize that. So, just to clarify for OP that if you are looking for decentralized and AI trading bots then 3commas is not recommended as I think I forget to add that they will ask you to attach your centralized exchanges which also indicates 3commas is a centralized platform.And dear joniboini thanks for the clarification here and pointing out the difference for me and for OP.",
