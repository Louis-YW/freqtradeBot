After that, he must be set free for a short time.Two UFOs shot down today over North America… and CNN is openly talking about it… what’s going on?https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-02-11-two-ufos-shot-down-north-america.html With a hat tip to the ZGoldenReport account on Brighteon.social, here’s a short list of some of the insanity happening just today:WTF is happening today?1. A new Norovirus that is a Contagious Stomach & Intestinal Virus that is now a thing!2. Massive inflation protest in Portugal3. Jesus Statue got nailed by a lightening bolt4. (Brazil’s) Lula pushing the Mark of the Beast5. Historic protest against the new pension reform all over France6. Two UFOs shot down between Montana & Canada border!7. Turkey’s earthquake was 800 times more powerful than the Hiroshima explosion8. X-1 Solar Flare going to hit Latin AmericaBreitbart.com is reporting, “U.S. Jet Takes Down ‘Unidentified Object that Violated Canadian Airspace’,” saying:An American jet shot down “an unidentified object that violated Canadian airspace” Saturday after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ordered it to be taken down.The alleged infringement on Canada’s airspace comes a day after NORAD shot down an unidentified object over territorial waters off Alaska’s coast and a week after U.S. forces shot down a Chinese Spy balloon that traversed the country for days.RedState.com is reporting that pilots who engaged one of the UFOs said, “the object interfered with their sensors, and they couldn’t figure out how it was flying/what its propulsion system was.”An unknown / non-visible propulsion system? Sounds like anti-gravity tech or something really unusual.Via Breitbart.com:...",

While I think everyone wants it to be aliens, I think more likely this is China testing how well we’re able to monitor our airspace as the design of this UFO is different than the last one. There are also reports of a UFO flying over China that they’re expected to shoot down as well, so who knows what is going on. Maybe this is how the alien invasion starts. In any event, I think this story is worth monitoring.",

I would not dare call it anything else lest I fall on a bullet by \"accident\". The \"UFOs\" are not actually aliens but rather objects which are not yet identified (duh). And these objects, once they are shot down, will most likely end up being identified as some chinese bing-chilling spy balloons listening in on your phone conversation with grandma.If I am wrong then RIP, ET.",

Do you mean Lula Da Silva is punish the Mark of the Beast there? I have not read about it.  Really, you should do your own studies. It's deep. But, where on Earth would you ever find a bottomless pit? ('Bottomless pit' is an accurate translation... better than 'abyss'.) The answer is at the center of the earth.If there were a pit with a shaft that led down to the exact center of the Earth, at the center gravity would be pulling equally in all directions. It would be a pit with no bottom. If there were a 20-foot cubicle room there, whatever was in that room would be weightless. Bottomless pit.The NASB translation of the Bible into English is probably the best one. It uses 'bottomless pit' rather than 'abyss'... Revelation 9:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/nasb77/revelation/9.htm1And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.However, even the NASB translates to 'abyss' in Revelation 20:1.Just because Satan is in the bottomless pit (abyss), doesn't mean that all the spirits of his henchmen are there with him. True UFOs are probably spiritual, but showing themselves to people who think that they are seeing physical. HOWEVER, God sends His righteous angels to help people. Whether or not they come in physical UFO vehicles at times, is really not known. Generally, Bible scholars connect UFOs with demons.Regarding Lula Da Silva, I don't really follow him. But, the idea that there are more and more evil leaders in the world, suggests that Satan is getting ready to come up from the abyss (bottomless pit) to gather them together to fight Jesus when Jesus returns.EDIT: Note that nobody knows when the time of the end will be. There is a lot to it.",

Because not too long ago I saw the news that scientists are now capable of redirecting the lighting and this one is just simply unreal. I wonder what's really going on. It really needs an intensive investigation because these flying objects might not just check the air space but have some hidden mission too and we all know how crazy the advancement of destructive weapons in other countries have. I wonder what will the west do if they successfully learn that the Chinese have a weapon of massive destruction. will they do the same of will they consider becoming an ally?",

The story would repeat, I believe.",

How long have these flying objects been in the U.S., and how many of them have been shot down? If there's only a recent surge of these objects being shot down when they've previously existed, why the change in policy?One might argue the media is not asking the right questions, but that's almost certainly to be expected at this point. Keeping people distracted because they have a short attention span.",
