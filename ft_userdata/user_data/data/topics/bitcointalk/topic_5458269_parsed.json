I no crypto is not a get rich quick scheme but most successful people started from there, also crypto did not just show us about trading but opens our eyes and understanding to see that there are other things you could do online that would help you. A friend graduated from school over five years but there was nothing to show for it no job, he was introduced to crypto trading and he started getting something and from there he was able to establish himself in other area, so the survival of everyone in Nigeria Is not dependent on crypto but rather crypto has empowered many.",

It was a means of creating more wealth for some people while some people took the advantage of it to lead them out of unemployment. Whatever the case maybe, it has undoubtedly helped and improved the well being of many Nigerians that have taken part in it and also help to reduce poverty level to some certain degree. In my opinion, bitcoin have added more value and positive impact to the Nigerians than attributing it to any negativity it must have been used for.",

For those who have known crypto and key into im, their lives are not remain the same again. Bitcoin has changed a lot of lives in we country.

That's the exact case crypto is facing in Nigeria. Majority of our youths who claim to be crypto traders are nothing but into internet fraud while hide and disguise under crypto. Crypto has really helped a reasonable number of people out of poverty in this 21st century and as well as sent some to early grave due to carelessness in protecting their wallet.Mind you, crypto should not be compared with white collar job. Being in crypto make you the boss of your own wealth and decides by yourself while you face the risk involved alone but civil servants are entitled to pension and gratuities after retirement despite the fact that their appointment can be terminated anytime their employer wishes.For OP, just like everyone is saying, with or without crypto people will survive the hurdles. It's just a privilege and we should grab it while it lasts.",

Every revolutionary tool such as the internet,  industrialization and digital financings like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a trance generational impact on the life of the revolutionized,  but also note that not all Nigerians most especially youths are interested in cryptocurrencies and we still have low percentages of the general citizens unaware of what bitcoin is. So for that,  we must have a clear standing before making assumptions on a general basis in discussions such as this,  there is no doubt that cryptocurrency has helped quite a lot of us most especially those who found this forum and constantly engage in the discussion that have helped to shape the understanding of Bitcoin /cryptocurrency including blockchain technologies. Cryptocurrency impact could also mean different things to different members here.",
