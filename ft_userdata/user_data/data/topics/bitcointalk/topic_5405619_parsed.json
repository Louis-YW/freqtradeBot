  "content": "Hi Newbies, please be extra vigilant out there, Don't immediately trust any investment, trade or Airdrop information you find out there, even if the information is coming from the CEO of the project him/herself, because the CEO is not a superhuman, He/She is a normal human being like you and I, He/She can be misinformed, His/Her account can be hacked and hackers use his/her name and account to scam his/her community members, He/She too can make mistakes, He/She can fail to do a due diligence before passing a trade, investment or Airdrop information to his/her community.Always know that your security is in your hands, in crypto, nobody can secure your wallet/your money for you except you, if you follow a link shared by the CEO and your wallet end up being hacked by scammers, it is your fault, the CEO can only apologize, the loss is on you and you must bear it..... Here is what happened to me this morning.There is this project i invested in, they partnered with another project called unifarm, the project i invested in offered staking on unifarm for its investors, so I had my tokens staked on unifarm for about three months now. This morning, while checking my phone, i got a notification from telegram of a new post on the Announcement channel of the project, i decided to check and behold, its an announcement of a new airdrop.. see the screenshot below.I got excited , who doesnt get excited when they see free money? , since this Airdrop information came from the official announcement of the project, and was also posted in the main chat group by the CEO, i assumed it was legitimate and clicked the link, the site opened and when i saw the Airdrop progress bar and how much time was left for the airdrop to come to an end which is 51 minutes...I became so in a hurry to get in, And since this information came from the CEO of the project, i totally threw all caution to the wind, i got my metamask wallet connected immediately and and clicked on the claim button, and in just about 1 second, metamask opened a transaction dialogue prompting me to confirm claim of 175,000 Unifarm.io tokens which were worth about $435, (though I was in a hurry to join the airdrop because of the little time left, I wasn't too in a hurry to read, and this was my savior), immediately i saw the .io extension on the Unifarm token, it quickly occurred to me that this could be scam, i quickly rejected the transaction and disconnected my wallet. Then I open scamadviser to check the reputation of the site, and behold... After the above, i then confronted the admins of the project in the telegram group to know if they verified the legitimacy of this Airdrop from their partner< UNIFARM, and behold< i discovered they didn't.The CEO later came online and said the Airdrop was a scam and apologized for not verifying it with Unifarm CEO before sharing it to the community, and after saying this, he immediately deleted all conversations about the Airdrop before I could get a screenshot of it.ADVICELike i said earlier, in crypto, your security is in your hands, always pay 100 percent attention before you take actions, never be too in a hurry to do some research before joining any Airdrop or crowdsale.The scammers will put something in place that will make you feel time is running out and you have to join immediately if you don't want to miss out, don't pay attention to this, for this is a strategy they use to force you to fomo in without doing some research first, Always pay attention before taking action.Watch this 2.46 minutes youtube video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BFB0qay-yEEDIT:-the CEO later posted the below on the Announcement channel.So far, nothing have disappeared from my wallet, so i assume the hackers didn't gain access, i am really thankful to my Creator.",

I also suddenly joined a telegram group which I thought was the original group. lucky for me to always checking the username, so I can leave ASAP. Well, just a bit suggestions, fake group mostly talks about airdrops, if you find a group that provides airdrops for coins or altcoins that already have a market, try checking the group username or link, again. Maybe it's a clone, make sure to also check the typosquatting method for web page, this will provide a big chance of theft if you have already connected your wallet to the platform from the fake airdrop.",

They are scammers who create fake telegram groups that are the same as the original group or they even copy the developer username to make it the same. Then make some announcements about the airdrop and some of the winners in it. Which in the end is a trap.Need to be very alert to do any work, airdrop or whatever, be careful and alert even though it's an official account. Never give access to your wallet keys.",

Again, you did well alerting the CEO who should take all the blame for ignorantly misleading his investors. That's if he isn't in on the whole thing to start with in a bid to cash out big time. Trust no man on this cyberspace. With the little time I've spent online and in this industry I've come to conclude that there are just two weapons scammers use successfully. That's, one – Greed and 2 – Hastiness. Scammers want to pry on the greed of their would be victims by making them mouth watering offers they will find difficult to resist. This is coupled with making victims think the offer will close on them and they miss out if they don't hurry up and take the offer. Your story exemplifies both items. For me, I try not to be in a hurry whenever I'm on financial dealings, both in cryptos and outside it. I take my time and every other thing can pause until I'm sluggishly done.",

Good job! I know that we are all so vulnerable to be in a rush for anything that is promising (especially when it comes to free money), but it is better to have our wallet safe or not compromised by the scammers and hackers. It's what I have failed for myself before when 3 of my wallets got hacked approximately $12k+ combined that ended up me being depressed and stressed.

They just want a traction to their social media and to make free advertisement, They just do a airdrop for their token. Worthy airdrops do platform interactions, They will make you use their platforms and do task like staking and swapping depends on the token platform. Worthy airdrop usually do this to filter multiple accounts that's why they make each wallet do a transaction to their platform. Research is a must since not airdrop is legit. Also practice using a separate wallet for all of airdrop, NEVER use you main wallet to participate in those. I've seen multiple victims that their wallet was swept because of airdrops.

I know some airdrops have at least 2 conditions: min amount of token, and min holding time (perhaps 4 weeks and above). If you want to join, and want to be safe, create a new wallet, send your token there at the time that is enough to meet holding period requirement between your deposit day and airdrop day, and wait.In some airdrop, you have to claim it manually, have to give access to your wallet (approval). It is when fake airdrop and hackers can steal your money if you use your main wallet to do it.Revoke address with https://app.unrekt.net/",
