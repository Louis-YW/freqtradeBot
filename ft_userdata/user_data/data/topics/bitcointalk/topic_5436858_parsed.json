As you wrote yourself, there is a Telegram bot, and you can also receive notifications on your e-mail (at least as far as private messages are concerned).However, if that accessory means so much to you, you can order it from @mprep because he offers such accessories, among other things -> mprep's Web & Desktop Software Development Services",
