  "content": "I have lately been seeing quite a few post mentioning \"the west\" in several negative contexts. \"The West\" does not exist.\"The West\" is an expression being used systematically by Putin and the official Kremlin propaganda to oppose it to a theoretically different \"Eastern\" approach. This is merely a justification for the War of aggression that the current RF government is waging in Ukraine.The war in Ukraine is not a cultural war and the affairs of Europe, the US and the Russian Federation in Africa, Latin America, Asia and anywhere else are based on the interests that each country has. I am not saying this is a good thing, I am just saying it is what it is. Even the interests of different countries differ (e.g. the invasion of Iraq was not much welcomed by France, Germany is not happy with having to source their gas from expensive US, ...).All those posts are becoming very suspicious because they were not there before the RF invaded Ukraine, so make sure you are not being played.",

Sometimes these people do good, and sometimes they do bad. Mostly they lie when they say that they are the government. But what does it matter, since the rest of the people believe them.",

If you pay a little bit of attention on the speeches of the Kremlin and also the position of the Orthodox Church authorities in Russia, you may realize that one of the talking points about the war is to frame it as a cultural struggle between two or three models battling each other. The Russian chruch talks with more emphasis about it, when they point out to the liberalism and the freedom some groups have managed to get in the \"West\". In Russia it is different, the government indeed wants to keep their cultural model untouched by the ideas of USA and their allies on sexual rights, free speech, voting, etc. So, your suspicions may have an explanation, since it would seem convenient to the Russian regime to push that cultural narrative even forward. To them it is not about alledged territorial preservation but also cultural and political survival.",

BTC has become another asset, it is not controlled, it has become mainstream among investors like any other asset. But of course you have to see yet another \"conspiracy\"... like in the past people thought that the gods ruled their lives because they did not understand nature.Whoever controls the money has a bigger say, but you can ask Luis XVI if he was \"in control\" despite controlling the money. I mean, you could, he was decapitated.EDITED 6/6/2023: The RF psychos have destroyed a dam on the Dnipro. I guess the RF liberation army could potentially do the same in Russia - same rules for everyone. Before anyone says something silly, the way the damÂ  has been damaged is enough to sink the islands in the delta, but not to flood the Russian occupied areas.",
