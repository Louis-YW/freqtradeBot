Please forward it to let more people looking for projects know about this, an independent project from Russia. We have been insisting along the way that the independent algorithm and model will be upgraded soon. There are still many opportunities for miners to participate before it is listed on the exchange.Different from all other algorithms on the Internet, it is almost zero cost, use idle CPU to win a future",
