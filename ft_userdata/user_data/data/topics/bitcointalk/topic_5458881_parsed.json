The price has already dropped by 50%, and you want to lose more money?The mining of this coin is not profitable, and the project does not have money to be added to new exchanges, so the coin may die on this exchange",

There are no opportunities to earn a lot of money for a trader. If someone wants to take risks, then 100 dollars is even a lot. But such coins can be mined in advance, but not all of them go to the exchanges. Such coins do not have a premine and how to buy them if they are not yet traded on exchanges?",
