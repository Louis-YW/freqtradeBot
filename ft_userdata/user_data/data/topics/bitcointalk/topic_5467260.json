Make we nor forget say time lost can never be recovered, opportunity wey we miss don go(otilor).Nothing like phrase wey dey Bitcoin investment sha but if you ask me I go say we fit categories dem into four stages; Learning about Bitcoin  Buying Bitcoin  Hodling  and Selling Before you invest you suppose sabi wetin you'dey invest inside and to increase the knowledge more you continue learning after you dun invest like to dey stay upto date. After you dun buy d bitcoin na the Hodling stage next and this stage you need hold the amount of Bitcoin wey you know say you fit hodl and ignore anything wey market dey do. The Hodling go be for your personal non custodial wallet. And doing dis will help you not to get temptation say you wan sell because if e dey exchange, e no go hard you to go click the sell button. When you dey invest in Bitcoin, try make the investment amount no go be money wey go make you dey get double mind everytime wey market shake small.. this na the main reason why people dey go rush sell their Bitcoin (na because dey invested more than they can afford to lose).Quote from: Makus on September 18, 2023, 10:13:07 PMI get question to ask my superior dem for this forum:Abeg apart from emergencies, when be the right time wey person fit sell en bitcoin? One advice I dey give people na say, no go invest money make hunger go kill you oh. As you dey invest, keep the one wey you go chop and if things no work out as you plan am no hesitate to sell but for only important things that need monetary attention. The market no dey stay up forever opportunity to buy again go come. Apart from emergency, sell when you dun reach the target wey u been set from the very beginning of your investment to avoid regrets. Shey e get reason why you Invest in Bitcoin (fit be to get money to pay for school fees or house rent etc) when you each that target just sell and take profits so you no go dey regret tomorrow if the bear market come. When you sell you fit buy again and our mind go strong because funds dey account to use hold body.",

      "body": "Well, before you start any investment, I believe you already have good plans for the investment (like you have imagined how much you can profit before you either build a house, buy a car or start up another business and then still invest in Bitcoin with your profits from the business you are doing), and I believe if any person already has a plan for his investment, nothing will make that person to sell his coins unless he has gotten what he wants.Although it is not every investor that can discipline themselves like that, some investors, mostly new ones, rush and sell when prices begin to drop and it is not good. People who don't have a portfolio always end up losing their money because, as they don't have a portfolio, they also don't have a strategy to accumulate.Anyway, what I understand is that, as an investor, you should never be too happy while profiting, so you will not end up making the wrong decisions.",

      "body": "To hold bitcoin for a long period of time is not easy, especially for people that don't have a means of income, or people that used 90% of their income to invest forgetting that an emergency can occur at anytime. This is why all investment needs preparation and having a goal to achieve. If you go buy bitcoin like that man wey dey regret say him get 20BTC but only get one due to the calamity wey befall am, you will end up in regrets.If you have a means of income and you have invested into bitcoin, because bit coin price is pumping and you have seen a good amount of profit based on the size of your investment, this doesn't mean that you should quit your job but rather continue with you job and ignore your bitcoin investment, because most times, you will feel that you don't need that job anymore. Forgetting that you need fiat to survive. If you totally depend on only your investment for survival without earning, this means that you will end up selling at the time that you didn't plan for and that will lead to loss and regrets because you think that having a bitcoin investment is having a job. An investment is not a job because it needs time to grow and flourish before you can start getting profit from it.Only use the money that you can avoid to lose to invest in bitcoin and not money for an emergency or money that you borrowed, so that you can have a rest of mind and hodli without regrets. With this no matter how an emergency occur that is beyond your fiat expenses, you will only be forced to sell a little fraction and buy back later when a unexpected funds comes in.",

They all serves as means to provide you incomes.I want to ask the category of BTC investors this.... Do you think BTC is a trading firm expected to have a periodic maximum fixed elasticity?Of course not. BTC is a revolving crypto currency exchange that has no determined margin of assurance on what value it would within a tickle of an eye.Though Bitcoin requires patient and mostly, it requires you to have a job aside that is if you are a beginner or a low income Investor otherwise, there should not be a panic if you sold your coins quicker that later as long it yield you income as a goal of investors.If you don't make a withdrawal or get to sell your BTC somedays either now, later or then and you keep multiplying with millions stucked on your BTC wallet time after time without selling out and no withdrawal then it is equal as you don't have a productive investment.You don't go hungry when you have food stuffs stocked in your kitchen though you should eat and remember there is tomorrow and also work ahead to restock.Meanwhile... Bitcoin is of a denominations with the possibilities of inflations and deflations.Maybe for further conciousness in decision making, you should consider these that Bitcoin price is mainly affected as follows... *Investors sentimentality * Availability suppliers*Competitiveness in the crypto values and *By the market demands.",

Alright! Make I talk something first before I continue. You can't hold bitcoin forever unless u plan to pass it onto your heir. Any investment you do, at one point in your life, you will need the profit and the money that was set as capital.I don't think there is nothing to feel bad about this if he made profit from those bitcoin that was bought, I see clearly he even pointed out that he made good profit in shorting on bitmex which was quite great. The only mistake I think he made was really selling everything when he was supposed to keep small for the future but nevertheless, nothing spoil because the past is gone but the future can be plan while he still alive, all he has to do is to buy the amount he can afford now.There is more halving to come but don't make it as if it's a guarantee that bitcoin price will continue to grow up, we all want that but with the way he is terrified and regretting, he may put all his life saving back to bitcoin and if it doesn't boom like the past experience, he will be devastated. Not good to give people high hope about investment, instead tell them to buy the one they can afford to risk.",
