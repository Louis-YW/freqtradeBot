  "content": "So I just stumbled across this post from Greg Maxwell on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ws8wfd/starting_september_12th_in_oslo_norway_hodlonaut/ikxqxoo/. Everyone with even a passing interest in bitcoin (which includes you, if you are reading this forum) should read this post. In fact, I would read the whole thread, because Greg has made a number of excellent posts.Next month a pseudonymous individual by the handle of Hodlonaut will go to court in Norway to defend himself against known fraudster CSW. For anyone out of the loop, here is an update on the case: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/timeline-of-hodlonaut-craig-wright-case. The very abridged version is that Holdonaut posted on Twitter what everyone knows - that CSW is not Satoshi - and now there is a court case to determine whether these tweets are lawful and whether Hodlonaut has to pay damages to CSW.This case doesn't just affect Hodlonaut; it affects all of us. Hodlonaut is not just defending himself; he is defending us all, as explained in Greg's post I linked to above.So what can we do to help? Well, CSW is being bankrolled by Calvin Ayre and CoinGeek. Hodlonaut, on the other hand, is being bankrolled by nobody. Got some spare sats kicking around? I can think of no worthier cause than the defense of bitcoin itself.https://www.defendingbtc.com/https://nitter.it/defendingBTC#WeAreAllHodlonautTwitter links of individuals who are at the trial:https://nitter.it/bitnorberthttps://nitter.it/SpecificMillshttps://nitter.it/kristiandoble/Thread continued here: Hodlonaut Trial",

Because everybody knows that Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, of which all evidence could be found on his forum profile Satoshi.So my question here is, why didn't Wright provide the 1.1million Bitcoin he claims to own when the court ordered him? And why is he sueing journalist and Bitcoin developers who tries to proof he isn't the creator of Bitcoin if he really is? Because until he log-in Satoshi's forum account, I will still never believe he created Bitcoin.Because for me, this is the case and time for everybody who has ever believed in Bitcoin to stand up for this case.",

      "body": "From what I read on reddit and Bitcoin magazine, I understand this better. I wonder how someone that is not a programmer and having no knowledge of the basic tech of bitcoin to be Satoshi Nakamoto. Just simple evidences are needed to claim if he is the true Satoshi or not, was he able to sign bitcoin message with the address that has the 1.1 million bitcoin? Definitely NO is what that comes my mind. Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on August 20, 2022, 08:11:52 PMSo my question here is, why didn't Wright provide the 1.1million Bitcoin he claims to own when the court ordered him? Because he is not the owner. Because he is not Satoshi.QuoteOn several occasions he's claimed he would provide \"proof\" of his claims, but the proof he provides just gets proved to be forgeries. At one juncture he was ordered to provide a list of specific Bitcoin that he owns to a court and when it was made public parties controlling thousands of Bitcoin from his list immediately showed up signing messages calling him a fraud. Even his mother called out his pathological lying.You'd think that would be the end of it--- but no, the tax fraud set off an improbable series of forced moves as he then needed to repay the tax authority to get them off his trail so in order to get millions of dollars in loans he claimed that he had possession of 1.1 million bitcoins locked in a trust controlled by a \"bonded courier\" that would release them to him on a particular date (think of that scene at the end of Back to the Future 2). Unfortunately, there are plenty of technically unsophisticated but wealthy people out there who can be tricked into ignoring even the most conclusive technical evidence of fraud.When the bonded courier didn't show (surprise surprise), Mr. Wright needed a new excuse and started claiming that his coins were stolen in an oceans 11 style high tech break in of his home to plant a \"wireless pineapple\" to hack his computers. He claims, conveniently, to have erased the computers afterwards so he has is no evidence of these their theft.He is definitely not Satoshi",

Once he can prove to be Satoshi, whatever has been said against him becomes unlawful, but as he will never be able to prove that, they remain true and lawful to anybody with reason and understanding of what bitcoin is.",

      "body": "CSW's game is not now to prove anything.its simply to cause social drama and try to sue (frivolous cases) people into submission/defeat by just pushing the length of court hysteria for as long as possible hoping those on the opposite side of CSW just give up and try to offer him a settlement or pay up.. in short CSW just wants to get money from them while provoking media stories.. and then to double that money by selling the story to media. CSW promised his sugar daddy (ayres) lots of ROI for all the money ayres invested in CSW in the form of book deals, public speaking tours and movie dealsand thats why ayres is pushing this social drama forward and backing CSW, because ayres hopes one day CSW will pay ayres back.. funny part of all this isayres pays for all CSW's costs upfront. EG travel to speaking conventions and court costs. but any £1+ amounts that CSW gets, doesnt go back to ayres. so ayres has to invest more into CSW to try making CSW famous to get ROI on the book deals/movies that CSW promised him.. even if that means that ayres then has to fund the movie budget hoping for returns on the ticket sales..its comedy gold how this is playing out, that ayres is on the losing side but keeps losing by keep paying out hoping one day for a win.if CSW was successful in law, fame, or running a currency. ayres should have been rich by now.. but he is losing more money than he has gained..on a serious noteCSW never cares if he wins or loses these frivolous/slapp suits it costs him(csw) nothing, sugar daddy(ayres) is paying the bill. his game is not about winning. its about drama provoking for fame by prolonging the tensions of the looming court dates. spreading them out over years hoping the other side gives up and settles with CSW whilst also  upping CSW fame rating in mediathus expect many more court cases and more drama to ensue no matter the results of current/previous cases.my opinion is this:we should help those fighting against CSW. but do it on the downlow, keep it at social media level. and try to get formal media to not emphasise CSW any more. ensure things like coindesk and bitcoin magazine (the normal entryways formal media pick up the story) do not announce CSW drama. thus keep CSW out of the eyes of formal media so that he does not get any fameoh and by avoiding CSW appearing in mainstream media. he cant then claim that any drama reached the eyes of millions of people. and instead keep his petty cries to how only 4k people seen the drama thus all he can get is things like £1",
