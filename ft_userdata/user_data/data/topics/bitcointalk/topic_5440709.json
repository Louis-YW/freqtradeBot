As an idea for the future, it would be great if you had an option outside the EU or USA, combined with the XMR payment method it would be very interesting  That said I will really try it.",

I don't argue this if you listed your site on Digital Goods Board, but this board is Service Announcements where the user can think your service can use for mining. or you make an exception mining POS where it doesn't really burden the ram and CPU?.",

If someone wants to mine currencies that require a lot of CPU or GPU resources, we have dedicated servers.This is common with pretty much all hosting companies, even some that offer dedicated virtual resources.",
