So maybe you're in the red now, but wait for the next cycle -- that's kind of the whole point of DCA, giving us time to recharge and accumulate, and to be okay in the very long term.",

My prediction was that there's a small chance that we'd go to 20k if things went really bearish, but best case scenario was to settle in the 30s for the second time and start another rally. I stood by my prediction and kept buying at 30k, then 25, 20, until I ran out of money. On one hand, charts are showing that it was a bad prediction. On the other we couldn't have known that a scammer would be buying bitcoin to pump up the price of his scam token and one of the biggest exchanges was a fraud from the beginning. Therefore, in a normal world, where no black swan event happens, we should've bottomed at 20k, even 22k and at the current state should've bottomed at 15k, but the world is far from perfect. I remember watching indicators a year ago and many were showing that the ultimate bottom for bitcoin in this cycle should be between 19k and 25k, which tells us that at 40-50k range none of those charts were taking into account the possibility of FTX being a scam. One of the indicators was the famous 200WMA that used to show bitcoin bottoms since 2012. This year it failed for the first time. It used to sit almost exactly at 20k. The unrealized loss chart has also been showing capitulation since July 2022, so before FTX. Some people also followed the logarithmic growth curves, which bitcoin fell out of for the second time in history (first being the covid crash in 2020), so if that was a black swan event, we're currently in another one. Growth curves may not be a trader's tool, but they are great at showing abnormalities and according to them bitcoin wasn't doing this bad in the last 10 years.It's almost impossible to predict the price of bitcoin. It's like a ship at sea during a storm, heading for an unknown land, and your job is to estimate how many people will survive the journey. All I can say this ship is robust, it can take it and there's a land waiting somewhere. How long it will take and how beat up it will be when it gets there? I'm ready to wait and find out",

They are 'too' smart with this all of technical analysis and will just invest whatever they can, or used DCA simply as that.Although we have nothing against TA, but most of the time it's a hit or miss. So just uses our gut feeling if you are a long term holder and just accumulate as much as you can in the bear market.",

As what I said, we can't tell that Bitcoin will still exist 10 years from now though there is a big chance. Yes, we can see a huge adoption by now but we're not sure about the future. Because this is not just a simple adoption as it needs support from the government as well.",
