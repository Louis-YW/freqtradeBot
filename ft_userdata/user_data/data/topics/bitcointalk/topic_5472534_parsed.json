I have serious taught on this because I tried even using AI to help write some post of mine and I won't deny the fact but a good mate here in the forum corrected me and sent me a PM to stop if not I will be tagged so in that respect I stop using the AI and I have tried my possible best to work on my contribution and involvement here when it's comes to topic am familiar and also it isn't all easy when English is not first language although my country is a English speaking country but the diversity in language is much and my native language comes as my first priority.In respect of posting of images, although I haven't seen any body get banned although I don't know if it's because I have search hard enough but I wouldn't want to be corrected by someone again through PM so I decided to come public on this one. So please the community should clear if I can banned or tagged from copying someone image in creating my topic without adding a reference link. And please don't mind the English error as am trying to improve in my writing thank you all.",

I haven't seen anyone getting banned for posting images of others here on the forum. Typically, there have only been situations in art contests where people claim artwork that isn't theirs, resulting in disqualification. While it's not a ban, it's still a form of plagiarism because if you didn't create the image or content yourself, you should give credit to the original creator or reference. I usually prefer adding a link below my images to show where I found them. It puts my mind at ease of not being a plagariser.",

No!But don't lie to be the original creator of the image, as it will trigger further investigation.I remember a case of a forum member who posted an image of something that has happened in the past, and he is referring to his present condition that he is the original source of the picture, which was a lie because some forum members do further research and bring out the source of the image. Therefore, I will advise you to include the image source link.",

So please the community should clear if I can banned or tagged from copying someone image in creating my topic without adding a reference link.Yes, you can be banned if it's proven that you have plagiarized.You might wonder how this can be proven. In simple terms, if you copy an image from within bitcointalk, where the original creator is known, like one from the \"10th-anniversary art contest,\" and you post it here somewhere, claiming it to be your own without referencing the original poster, it's a clear-cut case of plagiarism, and I can guarantee it will result in a ban.However, if you've copied an image from the internet, Reddit, Twitter, or other sources, you won't be banned, but it would be unethical to post it and claim it as your own without proper attribution. In this case, you won't receive a ban, but you might receive a tag from someone.In summary, make an effort to provide a link to the original author, especially when dealing with infographics, price graphs, or research (memes might be acceptable to some extent). Remember that someone has invested their time and effort into creating these works, and taking their work without giving credit is unfair.",

Although, a proper reference link is always a good thing but still some members don't like such posts and you may get tagged if you make low quality posts that are only images. I remember a member who added neutral trust feedback on many users because he thought that those members weren't contributing anything good to the forum and were spamming. A member also disliked the users who used to post Twitter now X based image posts on WO thread, and after that many users have stopped posting Twitter images on WO thread. If someone don't bans your account but still it deteriorates your reputation then it's better to avoid such things even if those can allow you to get some merits.",
