Any way to resolve this or even worth trying to get these back online pay power and back mining for more coins ?Interested to hear any feedback on this",

You replied about 2 weeks ago to move the topic but that has still not happened there is no reply or no posts and I do not think it will be anymore. If it should be moved to mining then it will be better if we report to the moderator. I think it will be helpful and the topic will be moved.",

Unless you have very cheap / free power they are not worth much.Even with free power they will not generate much so you wind up in the situation that if you have to pay to have them shipped someplace to have them fixed and then pay to have them fixed it could be over a year before you see a profit.OTOH, if there is someone near to where you are who can fix it for cheap, then it's a different story.-Dave",

Since Dogecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, which is exactly what the A11 Pro is designed for, it's well suited for mining DOGE.The A11 Pro is particularly good for Dogecoin mining because, It's specifically built for Scrypt algorithm cryptocurrencies (Dogecoin, Litecoin, etc.)Its high hash rate (around 1.35 GH/s) makes it powerful enough to mine Dogecoin profitably if your electricity costs aren't too highYou can also set it up for merged mining, which allows you to mine Dogecoin and Litecoin simultaneously",
