  "content": "I have a friend who likes taking screenshot so much that he would take a screenshot of even payment transactions from banking apps and large or small bet winnings. I don't know if he loved to brag with it, but he won lots of arguments with real traders and sellers who accept transfers and claim to have not received it. Sometime last week, we were having a chat and he mentioned how he wants to buy BTC and become a trader and HoDLer as he makes profit along the way. He said he had been learning on his own by watching YouTube videos and from his colleagues in the office. I just knew then that he had already done so, and upon further chat, he already did because he wouldn't really tell me what he's up to until he has done it, that's how I have known him for long. He is still oblivious of my membership here, although I would tell him somewhere on his trading journey. I am concerned now however about his screenshot taking habit, because it would be more problems for him if his phone falls into wrong hands and they see screenshots of Bitcoin transactions mostly.He may have provided the information or data needed by the wrong hands or It can be assumed that he has so much and who knows what ills can come from thoughts like that.* My question is, how safe is it to keep screenshots of Bitcoin/crypto transactions and useful information, on ones device?* How do I go about letting my friend know about such a habit of taking and keeping screenshots on his device that I have observed and warn him about it, without looking like I sense bad days coming?",

But if your friend takes screenshots of sensitive information such as private keys, recovery phrases, or any account credentials. Then the joke will be on him. These can be targeted by hackers if leaked or shared inadvertently or if an authorized person gets access to his phone. Well the better educated you are on bitcoin and the crypto space the less silly things you'd do. Privacy and security consciousness always.",

It's because of this that most people use mixers to kill traces to their hodling wallet.As for warning your friend, I suggest you just educate him on these dangers and probably he may change.",

Maybe since he is into bitcoin, you can introduce him to the forum, where he will know that such practice can make him lose his coins to hackers and thieves. Some of us were not taking privacy serious, until we became members on this forum. Maybe he does not understand the level of privacy that he needs as someone who is into bitcoin.",

If it’s a bad person his holdings will be under attack by the scammer as the scammer will try everything to get access to his bitcoin or other cryptocurrency holdings. He might face attacks like phishing attacks and dust attacks or even offline attacks towards his seed phrase and private key and any mistake from his end the scammer might get to them. As for seed phrase screenshots it is bad in such a way that many wallets do not even allow taking screenshots of them, so that alone is clear warning that it is bad habit",

Simply having them on the phone can be somewhat unsafe, although if there's no info with passwords there, I don't think much can be done with that info if the phone is stolen.",

Therefore, as a matter of prudence, you should not store any information on your phone that could be used against you. Even locking your phone with a password or fingerprint sensor may not be a panacea (If wish and have the skills, can access the phone memory).I see the following danger when the phone falls into the wrong hands if there are \"screenshots of Bitcoin/crypto transactions and useful information\".  Based on transactions, it is easy to identify the contents of wallets, and the phone with a specific person, contacts and lifestyle. By comparing all this, can easily find a specific person if the wallet balance is tempting. Therefore, it is safer not to store this kind of information on your phone.

It's best practise to hide how much you have invested in Bitcoin. These screenshots can help someone in reconnaissance phase to find out a potential target.
