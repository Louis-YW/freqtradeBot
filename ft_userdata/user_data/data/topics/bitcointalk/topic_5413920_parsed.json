  "content": "If you read this article carefully, you will understand that this project deserves much more attention than it has received in the last few years.http://medium.com/bhd-community/mr-bug-and-his-mining-revolution-9d1dbb70cb11The fact is that now there is very little income from mining and it's time to start learning the fundamentals of each project.One such project is Bitcoin HD (BHD). The coin is unique. If someone knows Korean, then you can watch these videos:http://youtube.com/watch?v=FHh5lAx5o3Qhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=d916SBET-nEhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=n2Mtf8C9784http://youtube.com/watch?v=V0yrmSQAaWQhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=qCLouoX2-tIhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=Yvm2nmCD6Wghttp://youtube.com/watch?v=x-FmgH1UqCMhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=YuieWJhA_yIhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=DYyKRoQ1gNAIn any case, history teaches that if mining does not generate income, then it is time for investors to buy coins and ensure their price rises.In this case, everyone studies and determines the coin in which he wants to invest. But among PoW or PoS coins, I no longer want to choose,I believe in a different technology. Think and tell me what you think about it?",

It's like bitcoin in the early years immediately began to cost several hundred dollars. If it were the same, then the collapse of Bitcoin would be the same as that of CHIA, but Bitcoin HD (BHD) was already at the top and now it is at the bottom. There are very few coins in circulation, only 6 million, so the risk of buying and getting a loss is very small. The probability of a return to the price of $30 per coin is very high. Everyone is tired of this PoW and even more tired of PoS, where big manipulator companies invest money.",

An alternative to bitcoin PoW has already been found and it is already working. It all depends on the faith and willingness of people to accept this technology. About CHIA, I can say that there are several tens of millions of coins dormant there and these coins will be distributed to investors, so buying CHIA is very dangerous, even for $30. This is a one-sided game.",

The income from PoW mining on video cards first fell 4 times, and after the ETH 2.0, income fell 5 times again! This means that GPU mining revenue has dropped by 95%.There has never been such a fall, and in such a situation, only 2 options are possible:1) a new favorite will appear, on which a large investor will bet and the price of the coin will again be dispersed into the sky.2) people themselves will find a solution and choose a technology, for example, Bitcoin HD (BHD) and start buying this coin first, and then they will mine using HDDThere is no third way, and the first way is harmful to ordinary people, since a large investor (as was the case with Solana) will again drive the price into the sky and ordinary people who did not understand what was happening lost their money forever.Against the backdrop of rising prices for electricity and gas around the world, I tend to think that the second option and the path that I wrote are most likely.",

      "body": "Don't know why all the negativity against HDD mining. Yes, it's taken a huge hit in profitability along with everything else in Crypto but development continues. Obviously with the bear market I probably wouldn't run out a spend thousands on a new system, but the goal of Chia at least has been for people wanting to participate, to be able to start with spare capacity they already have. I got in pretty early on Chia using a high end system I was planning to build anyway. Luckily I was able to recoup about a third of my total cost before the market tanked. I repurposed one of my 18TB drives I used for plots but continue to run the farmer solo. Today I managed to farm two blocks in one day with only 56 TiB of plots.Once the market recovers as it always does, with ETH moving to POS and the focus on green mining, coins like Chia will be in a good position for the next bull run. The development team continues improvements to build the community. If i've learned anything from mining since 2014, it's that miners that are focused on the long term and are able to continue to mine during bear markets are the ones that do best.",

      "body": "I’m confused as to why this is called Bitcoin HD. Is it a fork of Bitcoin that gave coins to previous holders? This is the only reason the Bitcoin name should be used. Being ignorant and only taking a quick look at the project, if this isn’t a Bitcoin fork it appears to be a typical shitcoin that hijacked the Bitcoin name to try and rip people off to enrich the founder. I hope I’m wrong and that isn’t the case, so where do we claim our free Bitcoin HD?",
