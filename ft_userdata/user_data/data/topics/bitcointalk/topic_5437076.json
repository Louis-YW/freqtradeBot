  "content": "The Subject line is a hightlight from this article from Analytics Insight:https://www.analyticsinsight.net/bitcoin-predicted-to-peak-at-us32000-in-2023/Bull Season is back boys and girls  Perhaps not officially pronounced a bull season by the media yet, but we will have our 2023 Bull Season headlines showing soon, slowly but surely. OR basically overnight Bitcoin will crush all expectations on its way to new ATHs in 2023, no doubt!From same article\"According to analysts, there is a good possibility that Bitcoin will experience a bullish surge. As per experts, Bitcoin will keep growing in popularity in 2023, and if key factors stay the very same, this trend should continue into 2024. When Bitcoin hits its crucial support, it is known to recover. At the end of 2023, the price range of US$32,000 is anticipated to be broken.I've been seeing headlines lately like highest hash rate:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-taps-new-milestone-with-miner-hodling-at-1-year-lowThis excerpt from the article is eye catching: \"Hash rate is a key component of Bitcoin security and significant drawdowns result in network difficulty rising to entice more miners to participate.Network difficulty is also set to reach levels never seen before this week in a nod to fierce competition in the mining sector.According to data from BTC.com, the next automated readjustment will send difficulty an estimated 2.75% higher to 38.62 trillion\"The more difficult it is to mine surely will increase the price simply from supply and demand, as we all know. And all of this FUD by JP Morgan Jamie Dimon is comical. The only reason that he would be saying anything like calling bitcoin a \"pet rock\" and releasing the FUD questioning the true 21 mil BTC cap is because of Bitcoin's ultimate threat to the Federal Reserve. BITCOIN TO THE FREAKING MOOON!!!!!",

The price of bitcoin is now balancing around $23,000, ethereum and other top coins have even fallen in price a little.

Bitcoin is often very unpredictable in its price volatility and brings unexpected surprises to participants in this market. Therefore, I would not be surprised if a long-awaited and long bullish period comes in the near future. After more than a year of crypto winter, this is quite possible.",

      "body": "We all hope that bitcoin can reach $ 30k in the first half of this year and continue its next rally in the second half and can reach $ 50k. But unfortunately, we never know whether the scenario will be as we envision it or if the scenario will be completely different. But if that's the case, it means we're getting closer to those times and for that, we should have plenty of bitcoins from here before the first half. But if that doesn't happen, we also have to keep preparing to be able to have lots of bitcoins because the potential for the increase to exceed the last ATH is very large so if we want to get those big profits, we have to be able to have lots of bitcoins. But no matter what happens, we must remain calm and not panic if there is still a deep correction in the bitcoin price so we can see an opportunity to buy more bitcoins.",

Somehow I can agree it's early to say but the signs are already here because after all a lot of TA guys are saying we are about to burst. $30K is not very far to reach, there may be dumps in between but we know that the market is ready to go up until it's late for some to buy at a lower rate.",

Of course, you're just using the data of a bunch of thrown speculations, but what does a professor from Sussex University know about Bitcoin, as well as all those \"experts\" who boast of good numbers when the market is in the green, and bad numbers when the market is in the red... You will still have to wait for that \"moon\" to happen, because everything below the last ATH is just a recovery, and I personally expect a real bull run only next year.",

I mean pandemic must be a highly influencing factor still it impacted within bitcoin market's own rules. So, key factors are just indicating things and not driving forces here.",

Yes, the difficulty adjustment is the one that follows the price to join more miners due to the high value of Bitcoin, but it is temporary within 2,016 blocks",

You can tell what the rate will be fairly easy and there are rarely any surprises there.What can change is the CPI. If we get a large number like 0.5% then we can have a huge sell off. Same with unemployment number. If too many people got employed and the unemployment rate hikes a new low then that is very bearish and might print the top in stocks.",

However, there are essential things that you should consider. Analyze the market: Check the impact of the media and what they are saying about BTC.Functionality of the asset: Consider it correlated to its price. Is it worth more or less than it is now with what it givesCheck the history of the asset: reading the charts would give an insight as wellSupply and demand: we all know the max supply of BTC.Better to research first and have an informed approach of what BTC is to you and the price it should be and use it as a long-term view of the asset, and you can never go wrong. It can reach higher than that for me, and it's essential to HODL more BTC.",

Bitcoin seems to be moving towards the $25,000 mark, and $30,000 should be just around the corner within the next few months.I'm honestly a little bit disappointed because I was planning to purchase BNB and also preferred the bear market in order to accumulate more Bitcoin.
