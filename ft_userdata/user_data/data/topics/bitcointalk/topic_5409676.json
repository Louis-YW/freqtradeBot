  "content": "In bitcoin blockchain,each block contains SHA-256 cryptography hash,when a new block is generated in the blockchain ,there is a Proof of Work, the PoW requires miners to find a nounce which is hash along with the blockchain for the result to be numerical smaller than the network's difficult target. How can I get the result to be less than the network's difficult target ?",

Because I think you can't able to target less or lower network difficulty you can do that before but right now you can't most of the mining units right now are plug and play(Setup pool and account.) Or are you talking about the network hashrate result on a given difficulty?

This link is really helpful",
