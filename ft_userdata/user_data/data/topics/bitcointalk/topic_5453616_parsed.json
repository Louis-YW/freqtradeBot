  "content": "So, I took a look at the gambling section and saw a thread that is based on an OP that is simply false. What is told in it does not stand up to the slightest rational analysis.I would like to detail it and I have been hesitating where to do it. I have thought about the Reputation section but it would seem too tough against the person who makes up the story I think and I've been known to be aggressive enough lately. I have also thought to call it BS in the same thread but the comment would be lost on the umpteenth page and people would keep spamming the thread no matter what.Then I have also thought of doing it in Meta, as it is a meta-reflection on that thread the analysis I plan to do, but here I'm sure someone will tell me the typical thing that I should just report the thread, but I don't want to just report it but analyze it and see what the other forum members think.What do you think?",

It would have been better if you have made use of this thread to report it instead of asking questions. If it does not belongs to meta, it would be moved. There is nothing wrong for a thread to be moved to the appropriate board.If you do not have enough evidence, do not report the topic because it wouldn't likely be a waste of time to report it. If you have a valid reason but not enough to proof anything, see it as a waste of time too.",

Chances are the person who wrote the story won't even see your response as shitposters rarely look back to reflect on their work. But at least it will be part of the official record, regardless of whether anybody bothers to actually read other posts.If something more was at stake, like they were making up lies to sell a product or service, then it would be more of a reputational or even scam accusation matter, depending on the severity of the lie.",

Presenting fake stories and not being who you are is like admitting to yourself that you are not as lucky as you would like. It's a pity for such people.If you think about it, we often come across invented stories here on the forum and people who regularly lie more than we think. Sometimes, when a lie spills over the edge, I see that it is possible to give a neutral review since a person who lied once will lie twice. A neutral review will be a good warning that waiting for the truth from a person is an empty exercise; you need to believe him at your own peril and risk.",

Some of them are so obvious and annoying that you would question yourself how on earth people will believe the fairy tale.I have tried more than  twice to prove that those stories were made up, it is either my comments got fast buried or no one will listen my side . I therefore learnt to ignore, especially if it's not a story line building up to scam.You already summarised what happens most times in your reply to the post here QuoteIn other words, no one who knows how a casino works can believe that story. Which makes me think that most of the people who have commented in the thread have done it simply to meet the posting quota in the gambling section and/or have no fucking idea how a casino works.Some managers will require their signature participants to make upto or more than 50% of their posts in the gambling section and would still complain when they post in gambling mega threads. Maybe the solution to that problem is to make up stories and start a new thread",

So, with your expertise in value analysis in the Gambling Section, what value do you see in a fabricated story that a poor person spends two months spending like a multi-millionaire, including sleeping with different women in different hotels, supposedly due to gambling profits?Now to @Poker PlayerFirst thing first, I wouldn't have had the balls to give you a reply here if truly the story you complained about was made up, and one thing with me is that, I don't even know how to make stories up, if I did know, I would have been creating new topics every single day, or may be multiple times in a day.Secondly, how did you miss the fact that we do not reside or come from the same country? Harlots and hotels might be expensive in your country of residence, it is not so in mine, I come from Nigeria, ask other Nigerians on this forum, things might be expensive over here, but trust me, with as little as 500 to 1000 naira ($0.654 to $1.305), you could get for yourself a clean prostitute for short term which is between 10 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on the agreement between the both of you, and note, this does not mean that there are no expensive ones, but this ones reserve themselves for the money bags. And again, with as little as 5000 naira ($6.27) , you could get for yourself a single room in local hotel where you are allowed to stay 30 minutes(maximum), if you wanna stay much longer, you pay more - and this again, does not mean there are no expensive hotels.And like i said before, you ahead and ask another user who is living in Nigeria.. I am really disappointed that in your quest to (should I say) catch made up stories, you don't even seem to know a story that is truly made up. Personally, on my end, I might have maybe failed or inaccurately explained somethings not actually as they were or happened, it does not mean the story is fake, and remember I said in the post that, I am not close to the person in question, even though I referred to him as a friend on my post, so note that most part of the story was based on what I was told by someone who I've always seen around the said person. In my comment on the said post, I already told you I owe you no explanation, because if wanted one, you would have pmed me rather than bring your wrong assumptions to the public , my explanation here is in respect to every other forum members following this topic, and what other way can a story that is more like a personal experience (that is not in the news) proven? I did prove it If I know how, or you guys tell me how.. Peace.It's the first time I'm being accused(based on my post) on this forum, and the first time I'm accused wrongly.",
