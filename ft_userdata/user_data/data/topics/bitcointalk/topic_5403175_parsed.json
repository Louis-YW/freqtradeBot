This is easy to say but there are many ways how it will help you to identify this opportunity and there are a lot of bases on how to spot and achieve that.But your point about using such indexes as fear and greed is one of the many ways to identify the FEAR and GREED of the market.But you should also consider the value of it because when we drop from $30,000 before the index is indicating FEAR is high but again now we dropped already to below $20,000 and the FEAR is still high. DCA is also applicable here if you have some value target of the FEAR index then buy some or wait again or scatter your buy orders.",

In that case, you do not even have to DCA, you can buy all in right now at 18-19k range, and you will still profit a lot when the time comes, even if it drops more from here.But, if you want, you can do DCA and it will certainly be a lot better and we can make a good profit from it. That is why I keep saying that the best thing we can do right now would be buying as many bitcoins as we can. Doesn't mean we will make a profit for sure, it just means that we will have a better chance to make a profit if we get in here (dca or not) then any other price in the past year.",

I divided my money into 10 parts. where I will buy in stages up to 10 stages. for example I use $1000, then I will divide it into 10 parts. so you get $100 per share.and I divided it into 10 entries.1. $100 entry at $20,0002. $100 entry at $19,0003. $100 entry at $18,0004. $100 entry at $17,0005. $100 entry at $16,0006. $100 entry at $15,0007. $100 entry at $14,0008. $100 entry at $13,0009. $100 entry at $12,00010. $100 entry at $11,000.and of course the money used must be really cold money.sometimes I add back the amount of money when I get more profit from my daily trading as a savings to forget.With this arrangement, my mentality becomes more stable because even when the bear market continues I don't think it's a problem because I'm waiting in line to buy in the lower area. and if it turns out the bull market is coming and my order is not partially filled then that's fine because it won't hurt me. instead I would be happy too because I profit from orders that have been filled.Sometimes I change my plans too when something unexpected happens.",
