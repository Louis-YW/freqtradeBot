It is almost double the amount one took out in the first place and when it becomes worse is if the duration of repayment is very short. Unless it is for immediate business transactions, loans are meant to be taken where one has the hope of earning to repay. It's just funny how it has become more like a survival tool for both the students, unemployed and even the employed too. Timely repayment of loans from loan apps always gives one a good credit score, that inturn make ones limit increase, but greed is what makes many not to be able to pay back the loans because they took much more than the limit they know they can payback.",

Loans are good sometimes if you know what you're doing, but before taking loans you need to have a source of income so that you can pay the loan back quickly without facing the consequences, and something you don't have chosen to borrow because you should fix some of your problems or you have a business plan that you think will bring you income and you don't have enough money to run the business that will make you borrow loans, because sometimes most people succeed in their life on taking loans to start their on busines without depending on anyone and they become rich.QuoteI'm beginning to think that it's possible that being indebted brings more debt and that the whole story behind some lenders always wanting you to continuously come back for more loan is gradually getting me wondering.Yes, being in debt can sometimes lead to further debt because you don't have enough income to cover your expenses.  If your business did not go well, you need to take another one to solve the problem, the interest is their profit and they will not stop encouraging you to come and take loads with them, and if you don't have enough money to pay back definitely you need to find another lender like bank or credit unions to pay the other one, but the most important thing is that you need to pay the loan back before the dew date, that will help you get good records with them and give you another opportunity. Some lenders encourage you to take out another loan with them in the future because the money you borrow from them will most likely be repaid with interest which is their profit, and pay your loans on time However, taking out too many loans can cause you many problems and lead to debt and financial issues.",

I specifically know about a guy that took loan from different loan micro banks to the point he virtually owe majority of all the loan app in Nigeria. He will take loan from one app ate the money, goes to another one to take another to pay the first one and the circle continue until he has accumulated debt of ₦500k and after the due date, he couldn't pay back the money because he is jobless and don't have work. Later the loan companies were threatening him to pay back else they will publish his name, even called most of his contact to report him, it was a shameful experience and that's why you should never take loan if you don't have another means to pay back.",

But the habit of taking a loan over and over again after a repayment, I thin a lack of much fund is always a major reason why a person after paying a loan, wishes to take another just in other to be able to afford the basic things he/she needs for the main time. While secondly, I will also blame loan apps for the high number of debt rates, and the reason is simply because when a user tries to clear his debt & has a good credit score, a loan app will keep disturbing such user that he/she has been qualified to apply for a higher loan amount.",
