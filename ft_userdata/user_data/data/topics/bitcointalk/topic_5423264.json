      "body": "Since Defi on crypto isn't popular anymore like before, i don't believe with any of % APY from return of our investment from coin we staked it. It's can always changing, you won't get any fix APR/APY and the worse case is, when your token's value also dropped which will make no sense for us to stake anymore (the return from staking is much lower than the value dropped of coin we staked). From @Xal0lex pic on above too, we know it's on yobit, which has fake volume and lot of deadcoins on there, better to not buy any coins especially it's only listed on yobit",

It's better to spend those satoshi on something more profitable.I think the point of it is to lure greedy individuals as they always gets attracted when they see a lot of digits thinking that it can give them massive returns but for a non greedy person, a number like that will be questionable already and it is one of the signs to avoid investing at it because it can be likely a scam coin. Another reason to not buy this coin is that it was listed on a shady exchange called yobit. I've heard a lot of horrible stories from this crypto exchange on the past. The price of this coin now is 1 satoshi, so what? Crypto investing is not about how cheap the coin was and how much we can accumulate. It's not about quantity that matters but it's about quality.",

Secondly, an unknown altcoin, that is traded on an exchange with bad reputation background, that offer high APY is also a bad indicator. Thirdly, any 1 sat altcoin is a lottery.
