      "body": "As at 10th October, 2022, Aptos price was around $10 so the price is not actually high now compared to the time of launch. As at today, 02/12/2022, the price is $4.95 - as at the time of making this comment. So the price is rather low now. However, as a new project, it is IMO, difficult to predict the success of the project. Some of the technology employed in Aptos are that of Diem project which was discontinued in January 2022. While the fund raised to support the project is big (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/), it is very crucial to conduct an in-depth research before investing. It is difficult to predict if the price will eventually be lower than what it is now.",

I can't say that at $4 it was a stupid buy for $APT, but I also can't say buying $APT at $4 was a wise decision. That's because the current condition of the crypto market isn't consistent (IMO). Since Aptos is a new L1 project currently in development, there's still a lot of things that could happen in their ecosystem. It is not unlikely that we will see a 10x increase in the $APT price next year.Source: MarketcapofMany people believe that the Aptos project is the Solana killer project, if we compare the MC of these two projects, we will see the results in the picture above, the price of Aptos will increase by more than x7.",

There's always this questions that's being asked everywhere if they're good to buy this and whatever they suggest.It was just launched a few months ago and it's still early to say if this has been bottomed already. But that's really on you, on your analysis and your take on it. If you see it as an opportunity to buy then go and accumulate it.",

I agree with you that the current price of Aptos is not really tempting to invest. I mean you always have to keep in mind, that the team behind Aptos received around 400 Million $ of funding from big VC's. Of course, one of those companies was FTX, but they also got money from Binance and many others. This means hat those big companies are owning a very big amount of the total supply and i think once we have reached a certain price level those bic companies will start to sell of their tokens and they have so much of them that they can really control the price of the whole project for at least a  few years from now in my opinion.",

With the current high supply and high price I don't think it's a good time to accumulate this crypto project.IMO the downside for aptos due to the FTX already reached the bottom price. It will be going down even further if bitcoin will be dumped again like when it was dumped from 20k to the 16k in a short time. That will give a massive sell to aptos along with another crypto in the market.

I don't think so and how much can you expect for the price of each aptos? VC may be dumping their hold as they got aptos from being early adopters but i don't even care about that since i got my aptos from airdrop and i have sold when it was still at the peak price before FTX was collapse.",

I also think the same, I will wait for a little longer.  My buy plan is somewhere around less than $1.  I will have a scoop of Aptos if they fall less than $1.  Since I think Aptos is currently overhyped.  If it does not fall under $1, then this investment isn't for me.  I don't feel I am missing out if ever I missed this one though.",

VCs investing in Aptos or any other project will buy at a low price, which can be said to be much lower than the public sale. But they won't get all the tokens at once, tokens will be paid out by the project in installments, which can last up to several years. This is to avoid the case of VC dumping killing the project, and they must be responsible for supporting the project's development. Similar to the case of FTX with Sol, FTX owns 280 million SOl tokens but will be paid between 2021 and 2027.",

Still far form their VCs price entry. Though they are lock on near future, there are tendency on retailers to think like this right? Especially degen on a major L1 project like this should work in bulked. But seeing the aptos chart I think it is stable somehow and can have a good profits when enter on good condition.",

But it seems that the Aptos Team really didn't let down the community that has supported them. so the rewards they give to the community via Airdrop are also very good. now I am also waiting for the price of Aptos to drop deeper. because I also want to collect Aptos a bit. because I think the Aptos project will still grow even bigger.",
