We identified the needs of the user and saw that the modern world is less and less dependent on physical goods. This also affected the area of telecommunications. The usual plastic SIM card has become virtual. Smartphone manufacturers are getting rid of the SIM card tray. Apple’s latest presentation confirms this.The global eSIM market is growing rapidly, and our eSimWay company provides users with a convenient solution for travellers, digital nomads, cruise ship enthusiasts, anonymous users and crypto enthusiasts. Many of our eSims include a virtual number so you can receive calls and SMS.One of the main benefits of using an eSIM is the ability to have multiple phone numbers on the same device. This is especially useful for travellers who want to avoid costly roaming charges. With eSIM, travellers can easily switch between local data plans in different countries without having to physically change SIM cards.To activate the eSIM, users can either scan the QR code received by email. The activation process is quick and simple, and users can switch between multiple eSIMs without having to physically change SIM cards.Payment Methods:Cryptocurrencies - BTC, ETH, LTC, USDC, USDTBinance Pay - BUSDMasterCardVisaIn conclusion, using an eSIM offers many benefits, including greater flexibility in choosing mobile carriers and data plans, the ability to have multiple phone numbers on one device, and easy activation and switching between plans. As eSIM technology becomes more widely available, it is sure to become the preferred cellular method for many people.At the moment, we continue to receive new feedback from customers and create new functionality in our service.There is a lot of work ahead, we will publish all updates on our twitter.We are also open to cooperation and if you have a cool API for esim, write to us about it.If you are an investor, we are open to negotiations in order to make a cool product for users from all over the world in a short time.",
