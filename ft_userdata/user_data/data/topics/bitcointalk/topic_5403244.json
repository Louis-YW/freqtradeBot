      "body": "Just a couple weeks ago people were asking if 30k was the bottom and many thought so. In the thread I made  many people thought that we wouldn't fall lower and some who did thought that we'd go to 23k or 20k. For me going below 20k was also a huge surprise because we rarely touched any levels below 200 WMA. You can see that in the well known stock to flow model that we stopped following last year for the first time in many years. After seeing the price drop below 20k I feel extremely bearish, like I've not been since 2014 when Gox collapsed. I feel like we could be going lower and lower even to 10k because of people's stupidity. Going to 17k meant large number of investors left the market with losses. I doubt anyone who sold below 20k did that with a profit and we're talking about thousands of bitcoins. This is going to lead to a year long bear market. I hope I'm wrong about this.",

But the $17K barrier has been breached and is likely to reappear. This is just speculation if you see the instability that is happening now if the price continues to break below $17K again maybe $15K can go down.",

Maybe 17600$ was the bottom or do you think there is more dump in the coming days/weeks?The problem is that we don't know if it's the real bottom or not. We just have to be prepared for the unexpected happenings. Yes initially the bottom that we have initialized was around $30k as I have DCA'd with Bitcoin that time. Then it dropped down to $20k, thinking that it was the bottom again. I DCA'd the 2nd time around $21k+, and here we are at a loss again standing at $19.4k+ as of this time in posting the reply. It's just that we make sure that the amount we invest or trade is something we can afford losing and not going all-in.",

So I think it's still early to say what the bottom will ve, but it's definately a new set of variables we are working with.",

What is important is that the peak of a previous cyclle was broken on the downside, which happened for the first time in Bitcoin's history. Previously, Bitcoin had higher highs and higher lows, which was a sign of long-term bullishness, now this perception was weakened,",

This might be the final bottom btc might ever see or it might just be tiny relief pump just to trap the Bulls further in the net to go down even further. I think both the scenarios have pretty good probabilities of being true. But at this point in time i have an advise for people who think they can't see bear run to get out around an area of 28-30k if btc reaches around there because this bear run might last pretty long and we might see btc and especially alts going to complete rock bottom before they begin to shine again.",

Others predicting that we will see a continue dump to $15k to $12k.But obviously, we've regained some grounds today as we go back to the support line of $20k.So it's either this year, we will see some recovery to the upper $30k'ish, or collapse to $12k, as the bottom price.",

Or this could also be a trap and it can be worsen and be quick again in dumping. If it continuous to recover up to $25k, then that can be a confirmation we're already out of the bottom.",

      "body": "looking at the current market conditions i think $17k is not the bottom level. because there is still the possibility of going down deeper.like yesterday bitcoin is trying to recover price up to $20k and it's awesome. but it turns out that the rejection a few hours ago was still happening so that it went back down to $19k. and now as i write this it turns out that bitcoin is trying to get back up and has already hit $20k back. However, if this resistance reoccurs, several sources have mentioned that a potential drop back to the $16k area is possible. So keep an eye out for day traders. but for DCA I think you can start buying gradually from the next support after waiting for bitcoin to be rejected or not. just wait and see. because many analyst experts say the bottom potential is $11k-$14k. but of course we all hope that doesn't happen. because I imagined the altcoin price would crash. but for bitcoin of course the decline will not reduce buyers. in fact if we look at the purchase order book in the lower area it is waiting and very much. so that reflections may occur quickly. then DCA and monitoring the market is a wise choice.",

Now we have seen something else.See mate Cryptos are now a days very much unpredictable.Many factors are affecting for which the price is so down.Maybe Bitcoins might fall more, but it won’t drop less than 15k usd.The reason for Bitcoins sudden increase in price from 17k to 19k is due to the traders who started buying the Bitcoins, seeing the low price.Hope soon the bear market ends, and the cryptos turn green.",
