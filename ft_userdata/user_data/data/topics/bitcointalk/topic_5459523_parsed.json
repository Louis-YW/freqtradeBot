      "body": "You got a good logo but your announcement thread looks poor in general.Â  How can you be able to properly design a campaign thread with this you have uploaded here. If you look at other managers campaign thread and their service and portfolio announcement thread, you could deduce that it took them proper coordination to achieve what they have done and i was wondering as well you stated you have been promoting graphics designing and see how poor your service announcement thread looks.You claim to have been managing campaign and experienced for six years, I believe you should have a portfolio and you did not list your previous jobs for us to see how good you are and links to the projects you have worked for. Nobody to vouch for you as to their satisfaction derived from the services you rendered to them. I would advise you to edit this thread and update it with your portfolio. Possibly your previous jobs as that would be a good marketing and selling point for you OP.",
