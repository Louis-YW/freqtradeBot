Bitcoin is not like that because it is decentralized and doesn't have a unique identifier. Bitcoin is always locked in the blockchain and it is only the one who has the private keys to that address which the bitcoin is in that can use it to unlock the bitcoin for spending. Fiat currency is different from digital currency.",

Does each satoshi have a unique identifier?bitcoin is different compared to fiat which has a unique identification number, bitcoin does not have that. when you have bitcoin in your wallet, it is yours, and people do not need to see any identification number as long as there is bitcoin in your wallet, then the bitcoin is yours. bitcoin does not require an identification number, since all transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. so whatever the transaction is, someone can see from and to whom the bitcoin was sent.",

Does each bitcoin have a unique identifier, regardless who owns it? Does each satoshi have a unique identifier?Each transaction creates unique UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) that refers to the amount of Bitcoin remaining after a transaction that can be spent in future transactions. Each UTXO is like a chunk of Bitcoin that hasn't yet been used, and it is stored on the blockchain until it's spent in a new transaction. The Bitcoin system tracks UTXOs to know how much Bitcoin each address can spend.The movement can be traced (indefinitely) due to transparent blockchain.Lets say FBI puts some addresses that were used in conjunction with illegal activities on their black list, now every coin from this addresses will be traced by them and who ever uses this coins may have some trouble explaining how he got into possession.Many people had their accounts banned on exchanges due to this \"tainted\" coins.",

Does each bitcoin have a unique identifier, regardless who owns it? Does each satoshi have a unique identifier?the main reason why serial number is encoded in most fiat and not just the US dollar is to prevent production of counterfeit money. Since it's a printable currency that people can attempt to manipulate and create something of such kind, the serial number to the best of the knowledge serves as a means of differentiating real government printed money from one that's possibly coming from a wrong source.Bitcoin is not printed. It's a digital currency which means that you only have it in figures. If I have 0.5BTC, I can only see it equivalent in dollar and nothing more. They isn't a need for a serial number because you can't create your own Bitcoin just from nowhere. I might not be totally correct but to the best of my knowledge, Bitcoin doesn't have a unique identifier.",

I'm not in their class and believe  that all  satoshis are equal in their value.All bitcoin are equal in a perfect world but world is not perfect and third-parties will create external metadata to the transparent Bitcoin blockchain.Blockchain analytic companies earn millions of dollars by collecting and correlating this data. Chainalysis, Elliptic, CipherTrace, and a bunch of others getting rich by selling this data are a proof that Bitcoin lacks fungibility (as a result).If you really think all bitcoins are the same value, would you trade your BTC with a BTC that is known to be stolen from an exchange ?If the answer is no, then all bitcoins are not the same.This is similar reason why \"dirty money\" is not worth the same as \"clean money\" in FIAT world.For true fungiblity money cannot be traceable, it doesn't matter if the metadata is on the same blockchain or an external centralized server - the effect (lack of fungibility) is the same.Fungibility is one of the greatest qualities of gold, meaning that individual units of gold are interchangeable with one another, regardless of its origin, form, or previous ownership. This is the reason why I don't agree that Bitcoin should be seen as \"Digital Gold\" as it lacks this quality, it's like every gold bar is stamped with previous ownership and you can't melt it.Maybe that's why narration has changed to \"Digital Real Estate\" ? more likely to gather more money by sparking imagination from those that are into real estate.Wonder what's next.. \"Digital Mars Money\" - the only money allowed on Mars, surely it has to be worth something, right ? ...right ?",

I call it here real bitcoin because there are fake bitcoins, i refer to ordinals, there they have a unique identifier from the inscription made, i don't really understand how that mechanism works, but that's what i read from the Investopedia article which discusses ordinals [1].[1] https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals-7486436",

There is a unique identifer even from when the bitcoin is minted in the Coinbase block.When a block is found, say 50 BTC as an example, then each satoshi doesn't have a unique identifier however once those 50 BTC are spent then they have unspent outputs which have a hash. So if someone sends that 50 BTC to 1 person, there is 1 UTXO, but if its sent to 50 BTC then there are 50 different unspent outputs.And those get all spents and the trial goes on and on and eventually different blocks are combined with one another and its difficult to trace them but its still there.",

Lots of folks don’t like it though because it slowed down the network and increased transactions fees for a time and that is and has changed and is still changing and improving. I do love the idea though of very small amounts of BTC being put on let’s call them “Bitcoin Bucks” and made as a novelty and collectible for the masses.",
