Primary reason is that the miner warranty is valid only with the entity that 1st purchased it from the manufacturer. It is NOT transferable. That means that when buying from some random 3rd party all warranty service MUST be handled through who you bought it from. That is most likely going to be a big problem... Only the Authorized distributors are allowed to have you directly have you get the miner repaired under Warranty though do still have to start the Warranty process with the distributor 1st to keep the paperwork straight. .",

Since you don't live in China that's just how the world works.The logic is indeed correct, but making a 2300$ profit on a $700 investment is unreal, not with the given market condition.OP, you need to make up your mind on what gears do you actually want, that is the first step, the rest is easy, the Chinese resller i deal with provides DDP shipping which takes care of all custom and stuff, if they happen to have the gear you want at the price you like I will connect you both to deal directly.",
