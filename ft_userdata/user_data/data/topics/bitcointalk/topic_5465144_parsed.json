Bust still though, it might have a good run in the future, reaches new all time high, or will just simply tank. The best thing to do is to really do your own research with this project.Quote from: JeremyW99 on August 31, 2023, 03:22:52 AMALGO has done a full retracement. 0.09 to almost $3 back to 0.09. Here's an updated analysis of the chart: https://youtu.be/IxZcmKGVzbM?si=iRFyDOrtqnWXnyD1When that falling wedge breaks, I think it's gonna explode. Didn't watch the video though, but it's too early to say whether it will exploded. I mean almost all altcoins is down -90% from it's all time high. If it will explode I think that best time will be next year. So if you really believed in this project, accumulate as much as you can.",

Not today that's for sure as it's aready dropped from the video's $0.0961 ro $0.09298. So i am not seeing any breakout. It has been dropping for 2 years now so i won't be holding my breath that it would breakout when bitcoin just dropped a bit.If you think it's a good project, then you shoud definitely buy some as it hasn't been this cheap ever.",

Yeah, looking at that perspective, you think that it's good to buy it.Quote from: Magic-Money on August 31, 2023, 12:17:36 PMHence, the level of preparation base on the alt-coins accumulated will determine profits returns in the near future.It's like another lottery when the bull run market arrives. That's why if someone chasing to own some altcoins before the bull run and checking coins like this, it's your preference and make sure that you have done analysis for it.",

When you were creating this post and the price of algo was still around 9,7 cents but after your made this post, it's dumped to the 9,3 cents. It sounds bad for people who follow your pattern. Quote from: JeremyW99 on August 31, 2023, 03:22:52 AM0.09 to almost $3 back to 0.09. That's and evidence if this token was just pump and dump token. I told you that if ATH of algo was far away from touching $3. How can you say that if it's almost touched $3? It sounds non sense to hear that and we are not in the bullish market again. The chance for algo to follow your prediction is almost zero. Quote from: JeremyW99 on August 31, 2023, 03:22:52 AMWhen that falling wedge breaks, I think it's gonna explode. You can only count on the next pump that will happen in the future but no ETA for when the pump will be coming in again. Everything is changing a lot when there have been many crisis happened in the world.",

It's not a full retracement but it's a good definition of pump dump coin as the price goes up to a crazy level, starts crashing and goes back to that very low price, the difference between the ATH price is too big and it's impossible to go back to it, the cryptocurrency promises that it will go back to that level but the price won't increase again.These conditions apply to ALGO, and therefore I say that the price will not return to the $3 level again.price will back to $1 as new ATH and will be between .1 to 1",
