He is obviously one of those who are under the influence of various people who have been repeating the same thing for years.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on July 17, 2024, 08:26:49 AM~snip~I know that many bitcoin enthusiasts are big Linux advocates. In order to stay consistent maybe they need to switch operating systems. That's what I would do I personally don't use Linux (for now), but even if I did, I wouldn't go so far as to reject it just because its inventor wrote that Bitcoin is a scam. People say all kinds of nonsense and then change their minds after years, just look at what Saylor or Trump said about Bitcoin, and today both of them have a completely different opinion. Of course, the important difference between the two is that one is exclusively a business man, and the other is a politician who obviously says what he thinks people want to hear.",

The rest are useless.QuoteI know that many bitcoin enthusiasts are big Linux advocates. In order to stay consistent maybe they need to switch operating systems.

They also don't use Linux because of its founder, another person I'm sure majority of Linux users don't even know.People use these things because these \"tools\" are useful and they provide a utility.The thing I have always warned about was usage of the term \"crypto\" or \"cryptocurrency\" to define everything. People tend to look at the whole picture and judge the whole scene. They look at 10000 cryptocurrencies and judge them all useless.Bitcoin should be separated from the \"horde\" because it is separate. It is the only decentralized peer to peer payment system that actually works as it is supposed to. The rest as I said don't do what they are supposed to do (like LTC was never ASIC resistant, ETH was never decentralized computer, DASH was never a payment system, Ripple was never a better bitcoin and so on).So there is no \"crypto world\" or \"crypto market\". There is only a \"bitcoin world\" and a \"bitcoin market\" with an adjacent swamp and a shitshow called the altcoin world. And 99% of the times when people say \"crypto\" they mean altcoins.",
