Malware is another way in which scammers use in phishing. It has always been an advise here on the forum on ignoring whatever kind of link you see while making use of the internet because you never can tell who is a scammer until you have been scammed. These are one of the reasons why we should be active on the forum to listen to advice and get information that will protect our privacy and keep our investment safe. An Ad blocker will keep you safe from these scammers.Thanks OP, for a reminder.",

I don't think it's feasible to totally eliminate advertisements... Nearly all applications have advertisements, and the worst part is that even if you pay for a premium version to remove them, they will still appear. That is so f**king annoying. There is a specific kind of advertising fraud called \"Click Spamming/Click Flooding\" that is exceedingly difficult to resist.This variation targets mobile websites and applications particularly. The website or app conducts clicks in the background while continuing to function properly for the user. Because they never saw it, users are never even aware that they interacted with in-app advertisements.Another is known as domain spoofing.Fraudsters typically utilize this form of to pretend to be a high-value domain that is more valuable and more an asset. Although the user and impressions are genuine, the money invested on the subpar website is not justified. Cross-Domain Embedding, Custom Browsers, and Human Browsers are a few examples of domain spoofing. Examples of this scam include websites like Amazon that have been cloned; it will be difficult to detect this because when you buy goods, they will never be delivered, and Metamask is another example of website that can be cloned, when cloned it vanishes after you enter your log-in information.",

If not, ordinarily, some scam link can easily be identified by the Google team and stopped from ever being posted.",

Hackers and scammers are really getting smarter by the day. They have gone from sending links to their targets through email, wallets, telegrams etc. to embedding malware on Google ads, one just has to be careful. This is also bad for Google because from the business perspective, it will discourage people from clicking ads and reduce revenue generation.",

Or let's say that this is no longer possible today with the increasing demand for Internet use and the launch of various applications. Ad blocking applications such as adblock may be highly secure, but they cannot stop all types of advertising, since some of them may appear in a form affiliated with the original content of the site, or the site will not work until after disabling adblock. Literally, it is not possible to stop the movement of ads on various media, because most of the benefits come mainly from ads, without which these applications would not have existed in the first place.The best advice is to encourage the use of adblock since it works fairly often and to avoid clicking on any of the links shown by the ads.",

However, we must avoid opening links from google ads because it is not guaranteed that every search keyword will recommend official ads links and I use additional extensions on my browser to remove ads to avoid phishing.",

I highly doubt that adblock is effective at filtering these advertisements. Unfortunately, in the case of cryptocurrencies, these malicious advertisements are extremely common, and the only way to avoid them is by being careful enough.The issue lies with Google, which isn't doing any serious background checks; these websites are constantly taken down and restarted with a different name and domain.",

I was quick to know the internet when I was growing up, and as a smart guy, I have been extremely careful and it has helped me this far. Some of the measures I ensure these days as the tricks of scammers grow are to avoid unknown sites and links, particularly those that would be sent to me by email (even from the companies I know). I go to the URL myself to avoid issues. I also use Adblocker on my browser, with my private browsing features fully on and always keep my premium antivirus running. One should also beware of touchscreen phishing where you don't have to click the link or ads, merely moving your finger around it will do the work for them.",
