Maybe those who steal assets from FTX are the victims of their assets being held back as a result of delayed withdrawals and end up inviting more trouble than solving problems. I will not blame hackers in this case, besides that FTX has also been proven to steal the assets of its users. Or is the issue behind the FTX hacking just diverting the issue to make them feel that it is considered pure theft? Who would believe FTX bullshit today after the mess they made?",

But the only surprising thing is that after Binance decided not to buy FTX, its price started to fall in the market. This was immediately followed by the demotion of its FTX CEO.Now FTX has been hacked, if you notice these events it seems like these scandals in FTX are a well-coordinated series.

Only dumb people who still called that as a hacking incident. Quote from: Famous Grouse on November 15, 2022, 10:02:12 AMWhy is his wallets no frozen coinbase and usdt. tether already frozen USDT related with what people called that as hacker. The hacker was converting all of centralized tokens to the decentralized token that can't be blocked like USDT. I think that you shall check the latest news again. It's clear hacker was avoiding the centralized coins caused by he worries his money got blocked. Quote from: Famous Grouse on November 15, 2022, 10:02:12 AMStealing funds and buying eth.

I meant based from activities by hackers and it seems like that this guy has been prepared the stolen amounts to be hibernate in the wallet for long term. I guess FTX has been targetting by US regulators. The hacker might be facing by FBI. Only stupid guy who claimed to be an amateur hacker who will be cashing out through fiat money. It's caused by it needs your KYC to be able to cashing out it. It may have same scenario as money hacked from axie infinity.",
