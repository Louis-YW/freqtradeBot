Another are some people that will start trading without any knowledge than to use it to gamble and lose greatly from the start. Humans like to try to get rich quick, which are ways to lose fast.",

As you said, the goals of beginners cannot be generalized, in fact they don't just come from poor economic backgrounds, low academic education, or lack of experience in finance. Even though it is true that lately misleading influence of influencers has been rife and has created several opinions that conclude that all beginners are actually victims.",

Blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized money are valued by some, and they are supported by others. However, many people are also investing just to benefit from the rising value of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin. Therefore, there is a mix of believers and those who are only interested in making money in this crypto currency market. This includes novices, who are also a mix of educated and less educated about the movements of the market.",

Also the majority of crypto advertisements came from influencers that usually hype and shill a certain token to gain viewers. Most of the newbie came from this advertisement and only few came naturally through the curiosity on the crypto technology.So I would say that the statement is right base on the actual event on crypto space.",

But before that, I also had quite a long experience in property investment. and I see how the development of crypto and bitcoin for the next generation. so I decided to invest in it. but because this is a high-risk investment. then the money used must also be money that we really set aside and we really won't use it in the long term or even we are prepared if we have to lose it.everyone's reasons will indeed be very diverse.

If you have ever heard of someone getting richer by gambling, you will never find that in crypto investment, especially if you don't have the capital to buy some coins that are considered potential. For example, bitcoin is the best choice to invest, but if you don't have the capital, the concept of getting profit to get richer is just a dream.Of course it is true that bitcoin is the best investment at the moment, but you also cannot ignore the risk, especially if you have small capital to start slowly and indeed there are quite a variety of reasons for people to get into the investment world, but most of them only expect wealth that is not in line with process to go through.Quote from: Vyeon11 on February 01, 2023, 07:40:59 AMis it really like that in reality? is it normally like that? and I'd really like your opinion.And hopefully you're not one of them, as that will add to the disappointment of the newcomer list. If you came here just to get rich, then you have to learn to trade and that doesn't guarantee wealth either. If you understand the concept of being rich, then the first step you must have is MONEY, without which you will not be able to do anything to add to your wealth list.",
