Source: bitstampQuote from: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/13/us-inflation-faster-than-expected-in-september-bitcoin-falls/\"The Consumer Price Index – the most widely watched gauge to track inflationary pressure in the U.S. – rose 8.2% in September from the same month a year ago, slightly higher than the 8.1% forecasted by economists. The index rose 0.4% from August.\"Last time I made a thread about the increase in the U.S. consumer prices and its impact on the crypto market was in June, we saw the same behaviour in the market",

Out all day and as usual sneaked a look at price, couldn't immediately say if it was more market news or a delayed reaction from yesterday when there were stock selloffs in Asia.More pain to come, interest rates not going to let up. BTC still surprisingly resistant though, no?",

Increase in inflation rate was an obvious thing.People I know already predicted that bitcoin price will decrease as soon as the CPI rates are out.Panic selling will halt soon though. I don't think this will have a long term impact on bitcoin's price.I \"hope\" this is the bottom and we do need a correction which bounces back bitcoin price above $20k.",

      "body": "I guess, this inflation is not only  affecting US economy alone but is also affecting others countries of the world economy, and according to economist researchers, next year inflation will be more higher than what we are experiencing now, which US inflation will increase to 50, and some digital currency will also experience the effect too. I don't think, if this inflation that is affecting other countries economy will also affect Bitcoin price, because during the pandemic Bitcoin price was pumping massively to allow investors to earn well from their investment, but since heavy inflation appear in the land, the price of Bitcoin is depreciating that is making investors to worry if this inflation can also cause Bitcoin price not to pump higher.",

I've seen Cathy Wood comment on that and she said that it's normal that emerging tech comes on top in late stages of the bear market. Bottom line is, people see the value in bitcoin and as the inflation goes up it begins to look more like a safe haven than a risk off asset. What looked like the first thing to dump at 60 or 50k is now an opportunity below 20k.",

We can predict how it will happen after the massive printing from central banks over the globe after the pandemic.It started 2 years ago and we are only witnessing some delayed reports on that problem. How did people think that the USA and other nations won't be in inflationary crisis if the US government printed 40% of money supply within a few months since the pandemic announcement from WHO? Same goes for other countries and their fiat currencies.Why did people feel panic today, last few months, but not in 2020 or 2021? If they are not panic now and in near future, and if they can hold their Bitcoin, they will be winners in 2023 or 2024.",

Your explanation still doesn't make it any clearer because ordinarily one would expect that people will find a safe haven in Bitcoin or any other financial instrument like gold to hedge against inflation. I've monitored the relationship between Bitcoin/Pounds and Bitcoin/Euro, I discovered that Bitcoin follows the pounds pattern more. That's it goes up or dips whenever pound does the same.

Fait is obviously the biggest competition for the BTC as Fait markets own capital and BTC owns whatever you need. Inflation in the Faits is in favor of BTC from a neutral perspective.",

Not taping into your reserves, as that's why you invested in the first place, to have a cushion once your expenses gain the upper hand over the income?",

Today's movement differs. Perhaps, Bitcoin price will respond and move up like pounds is doing before the end of today. It has to do with the expansion and contraction of the money supply. Interest rates going down increases the money supply, up has the reverse effect. At least in theory. The stock market almost always goes up when the interest rates go down, and vice versa. See: Alan Greenspan's market manipulation. This wouldn't seem like it should effect bitcoin price, but remember the markets aren't what they used to be. Before institutional investors got involved, retail investors more or less controlled the market. Now we are just a drop in the bucket. So when institutions pull out investments as interest rates rise, this includes bitcoins. This may be because they are investing on margin, or because they see better returns elsewhere where they can get a better %. It gets complicated, and I don't really understand it all, but that is how I understand it.",
