  "content": "I was reading about inflation recently, countries all over the world have the economy that can never escape inflation, but just that this will differ from one country to another, some country's inflation rate is very high while it is not that high in some countries. In order to preserve the value of your money, it is good to look into assets, like bitcoin, gold and other valuable assets that people demand more for which increases their value over time, unlike government printed money (fiat). That is just an advice, not the main discussion. The main discussion is what I saw on statista, about global inflation rate compared to previous years:Statista.comÂ I could not really understand what this means, we are presently in 2022, but the inflation rate in 2023 to 2027 was included. What does this means? Is it accurate or just a prediction of what could happen in the future? What if the global inflation rate is lesser or greater during those coming year?",

The predictions are made using a computer model that is made to predict what will happen in the future.These predictions are not always accurate, because the future is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. However, the World Bank's predictions are generally quite accurate, because they are based on data from the past. It's probably using world bank as it's source. I couldn't confirm it tho, there was a paywall lol",

But still, it's unknown what will be the inflation rate for those years. Anyway, there could be a basis on it and we're on the recovery period. Hopefully, if things do better for the next years, we'll see the decrease in inflation.We've got that many to tackle, food shortage, still global climate/crisis, oil crisis. If the next years become better, it'll slowed down the inflation.",

Sure. As we are in this forum, it is normal to talk about Bitcoin, about hedging against inflation with Bitcoin, and, in fact, since its inception, Bitcoin has been the best way to hedge against it, which we cannot be 100% sure will continue to be the case in the future. So, it is not bad to diversify with other assets as well. About the projections being made, we cannot be sure, as I would be surprised if someone had predicted this year's inflation. What we do know is how to protect ourselves from inflation, and we have to act on that.",

Currently there's a new disease called Monkeypox, what if the disease will widely affected on 2024? the inflation rate will not 3.76% only, I think it would touch at least 5%.",

      "body": "Some sources claim inflation will be transitory and temporary in nature. Which would correlate with an eventual downtrend to reduced inflation rates. Unfortunately, the historical track record of nations in addressing inflation once it hits, isn't the best. Inflation is like a black hole. Once you get sucked into it. There is usually no easy way out and it takes a long time to escape. The best way to escape inflation, is for everyone to be informed on what it is. To know the proper things to support to get rid of it.The \"money printer go brrrrrr\" meme is great. But, do people know what it means? I still see many supporting things that lead to the money printer working in overtime. They say inflation is bad. High prices are bad. But they still support things that lead to higher inflation. Which is puzzling.",

In 2023, the inflation rate will increase sharply by 4.85% and then another 3.76% in 2024. This means that we can expect a gradual increase in inflation and therefore we should have started to prepare for it, moreover ordinary goods like food and gasoline have also increased little by little as mitigation.",

There are lots of countries, living in different realities, and that cannot be summarized into a general percentage.About the prediction on the inflation rate going down over the next 5 years is probable, but depends on so many factors that it's almost impossible to predict. No one could have envisaged the lockdown of 2020 due to the pandemic or the oil crisis happening now due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.Government fiscal policies also plays a huge role in how different countries react to inflation.",

      "body": "When we talk about inflation, there is usually a difference, a difference between \" healthy inflation\" and a different between \" unhealthy inflation\". One can extend this topic to understand the \" healthy inflation \" according to the federal reserve : Quote The Federal Reserve has not established a formal inflation target, but policymakers generally believe that an acceptable inflation rate is around 2 percent or a bit below. Which means that it's really hard to establish what's going on in today's world and how the government is not being able to handle everything, but with the pandemic and everything in 2022 one cannot just ignore how it can just push everything apart as well. Inflation ( teeny tiny amount) ~ is parallel to a good economic growth ðŸ“ˆ thus one cannot always expect it to be nominal or none at all. Therefore everything that we are seeing at the moment is extremely unhealthy for the economic stability of the whole world.",

Inflation is currently so uncomfortable that it has cost fiat a lot of value. My comment in another thread is that I'm starting to feel the effects of this inflation, but investing should lessen the effect in the long term. You've mentioned gold, bitcoin and other decent assets, I agree on that.And one more thing, don't panic too much in facing this situation where we really have to save more expenses that are not really needed.",

The money supply is constantly increasing because the government is always printing more money. The government is always printing more money because it needs to pay for all of its spending and debt. There's another reason, people generally expect prices to go up over time. This expectation leads to people being willing to pay more for goods and services now, rather than waiting to buy them later when they may be cheaper. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, where prices continue to rise because people expect them to.

Gold and silver better. Cryptos are a risk asset, I wouldn't suggest investing more than 5% of your portfolio on it(if your purpose is investment). They aren't a counter measure to inflation.",

What if the global inflation rate is lesser or greater during those coming year?Staticians rely on mathematical numbers to make predictions via calculations. They collated data from the previous years and with mathematics found a sequences to make a prediction into the future. Because it is purely a mathematical prediction, some factors that can affect the inflation rate positively by lowering it are not put into consideration, what the prediction is based upon is if the present factors affecting it do not change, hence it is a prediction that cannot be relied on as it is based on fixed factors.",

But we prefer going with the flow. So its not good to make so much noise online by sitting on comfortable couch.Managing spending during inflation is one of the best pieces of advice for anyone feeling the effects of inflation, so it should be considered even if you can still afford to buy more than one item.You should know that panic always occurs in the market, not only in the crypto market but in the real market where an increase in demand that is not balanced with supply makes the inflation rate worse. So having control over your spending is one of the best pieces of advice for anyone right now if you're hit by inflation.",
