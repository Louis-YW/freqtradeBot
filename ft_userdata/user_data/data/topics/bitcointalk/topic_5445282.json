And both of them have limits. After some requests you get blocked, and neither of them allow you to request multiple addresses at once.Do you still have a server running a full node?I never worked with a full node, but I can try to make an API for it that would allow such requests.",

I didn't accept, as I don't think those services are any good for the community and it could harm my website reputation.I also expected that betting companies would like to advertise on the giveaway manager, but I received no offers so far!I hope you don't take as an offense but instead only as a suggestion, but would you consider approaching the services instead of waiting for an offer? I see it as a freelancer - whenever anyone starts doing freelancer he/she can't just wait for the clients to appear but instead has to give everything that he/she can to be seen, either from sending mass CV's per e-mail, scheduling meetings with potential clients, amongst other similar actions. I am in no way saying that you aren't well regarded in the community - who am I to say that? - but as everything in life that is starting out, sometimes we have to make ourselves be seen.I see your website as a resemblance to this scenario. My suggestion is for you to approach a company that you see fit and inquiry if the service wouldn't be interested in trying out advertising in your website for 1/2 weeks for free of charge. The worst you can do is that you won't have any kind of revenue during that time, other than that I don't see how you can incur in extra costs for making that. After that initial period you can ask the service if the company saw any advantage in having their banner in your page and then you can discuss things further.Will you give 1/2 weeks as free exposure? For sure. Will it pay off? Who knows? At least you tried and explored that possibility. And if that service doesn't accept being there, move on to the next one until you've made contact with a few of them. Who knows what will happen?As a final note, and for the sake of transparency, I think it's always interesting to see the statistics of the website as an outside service/company. It is something that will always be asked and you can already provide it even before the initial discussions .Quote from: bitmover on April 10, 2023, 11:51:28 AMThank you for pointing this out.

I have been working on a platform, they have a good amount of visitors but they barely get some good sponsors. I have read your earlier post. If you want to get a sponsor, you either have to lower your standard (which I think you won't, there's no point in promoting possible scams) or have to reach a lot of projects (I doubt it will be worth your time).I would rather prefer a pop-up promoting your donation address with something like- Loved our stats?

I am sure that many service providers (casinos and mixers) will want to place their ads on your site.The rest of the members who want to help and who cannot donate financially, can promote the donation link in any way possible.
