      "body": "What exactly do you want to know? Most mixers take your funds, pool them with other funds and then give you the same amount from the pool - ultimately it allows you to blend the sources of your funds with others so you're harder to trace.Most mixers ensure the inputs funds can't be related to output funds and chipmixer does this too by funding output funds you can withdraw before you've even made your deposit (from their reserves of chips).The minimum amount you can send is 0m001 to receive a 0.001 chip, chips double in size so you'd get an output that corresponds to that (eg depositing 0.007btc would give you a 0.004btc, 0.002btc and 0.001btc chip you could withdraw). Anything not evenly divisible by 0.001btc will have its remainder considered a donation.",

The result is that someone following the block chain to find out where your bitcoins went or where they came from gets the wrong answer.",

I willing to make a donation.Please be more specific about what exactly you don't understand.I think that there are enough tutorials and guides about Chipmixer around the internet and every person with above average IQ can understand how Chipmixer works.Why would you even want to use a Bitcoin mixer/tumbler service? Are you trying to \"cleanup\" some \"dirty\" Bitcoins? Do you want to buy something on the darkweb? Beware of the scam mixing services and misleading Chipmixer phishing links. I know that Chipmixer is one of the very few legit Bitcoin mixers, but I've heard some horror stories about people being scammed by them. I don't know if those stories were true and I don't know whether or not those people were scammed by a Chipmixer imposter or the actual Chipmixer website. Be careful.",

The link o_e_l_e_o shared above is the correct one for the only working version via the TOR browser.Never do a Google search on the term \"ChipMixer\" because the results will lead you to fake versions of the site. Although I can see that results are a bit different from what they were a few days ago. Some of the phishing sites aren't at the top of the page anymore. One new addition (on the 2nd place in the results) is this one: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1003345;sa=showPosts. It shows the latest posts by the official ChipMixer forum account (Google being weird as usual).Other search engines, like the often recommended DuckDuckGo are useless as well and will take you to fake sites just like Google.",
