  "content": "Ok so has anyone else noticed that within just a few days after they moved their Bitcoin from their Coinbase custodied P2PK address ( 1CKVszDdUp4ymGceAZpGzYEFr4RPNHYqaM ) to their current SegWit address lists that are posted to https://bitbetf.com/ that there's already a discrepancy?  I guess Wall St is going to try to Wall St even if we know they're fibbing.  I mean as per my node currently the addresses they've posted (as of 17 Feb 1700 UTC) are as follows: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 value shown on my node as of this post is a value of 22,114.33078249 Bitcoins vs. their site bitbetf.com that shows they have 22,517.79 which is a difference of 403.45914782 Bitcoin.  This is a substantial difference!  If you look at it in USD then the amount of difference is $20,576,416.54 at $51,000 per Bitcoin or rather 740,292.0143486239 shares of the ETF assuming the amount of BTC per BitWise ETF is in fact set to .000545 BTC per share as indicated on the bitbetf.com site.  Either way I think it's important to watch these folks as closely as we can and to report any discrepancies ASAP for community awareness and vetting. From my standpoint it's more likely that they either somehow posted the wrong total, or forgot to add the new address however that seems unlikely as it seems pretty clear that they're stacking 1500 Bitcoin in each address and the last one (bc1qgrjjf3xaf9ejmm5lcsfl0e2ep63t6zcxf7h9sw)  currently has 1114.33071307  BTC.  Any thoughts?",
