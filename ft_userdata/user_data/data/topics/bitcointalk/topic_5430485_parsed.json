Anyway i tried compile Bitcoin Core 22.0 and 24.0.1 on Debian 11 and doesn't see error message you mentioned when you create this thread.I use Ubuntu 20.4 for Windows.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on December 20, 2022, 12:01:45 PMI just notice you installed dependency based on 24.0.1 compile guide, you should check compile guide for 22.0 instead at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v22.0/doc/build-unix.md.According to the compile guides, these dependencies are the same than for Bitcoin Core 24  and in fact they are included in Bitcoin Core 24 depencies. Bitcoin Core 24 depencies have in addition User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) dependencies and GUI.",

I didn't compare everything, but here's an exampleQuote from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v22.0/doc/build-unix.mdNow, you can either build from self-compiled depends or install the required dependencies:Code:sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-devQuote from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v24.0.1/doc/build-unix.mdNow, you can either build from self-compiled depends or install the required dependencies:Code:sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libboost-devTake notice guide for Bitcoin Core 22.0 include 3 additional development file for Boost C++. Earlier when i tried to compile Bitcoin Core 22.0 without installing those 3 development file, i hit error when running command ./configure.My real issue is based on the fact that I like to have a full understanding of the source code I use. However, while I installed Bitcoin Core 24.0 without issue it still important for me to understand the migration process between the different Bitcoin Core versions.",
