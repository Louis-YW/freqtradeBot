  "content": "Hey everyone,I'm a Java developer with five years of experience, and I'm currently working on a web application that can help with scalping the market. While I'm still in the process of developing this app, I've already created a screen that can help track market anomalies. At the moment, the app is only available to me, and I'm not yet ready to launch it.However, I'm looking for like-minded individuals who might be interested in sponsoring this project. If I can gather at least 50-100 people who are also interested in trading on this platform, then I will develop the application to be fully functional, and make it available to everyone who subscribes to it.I won't be charging extra for additional functionality. Instead, subscribers will have access to the entire application once it's available. Currently, I'm using YouTrack to share my ideas and potential improvements for the app, and I'm working on it in my free time. But if there's enough interest from the public, I'm willing to dedicate more time and resources to this project.https://i.postimg.cc/9fWnFHQQ/S1.pngI have attached a picture. in which:1. this is real-time tracking of cryptocurrencies, their price changes over the last few minutes.2. This is where the markets that have gone through certain filters and are potentially suitable for trading, or the ones you clicked on in 1.3. Here you can select specific currencies, USDT\\BTC, etc.4. A summary of all the markets for that cryptocurrency. Volumes, trades, delta.This is so far what we have at the moment. By the time it goes public I will tidy it up, refine the language, and whatever else you and I will come up with.The project is connected to the exchange Binance, but if desired, I can complete the other exchangesLet me know if you're interested in participating or if you have any questions. Thanks!You can join the Discord channel, there's nothing there yet, but we could team up there: https://discord.gg/CxaJnR9bAnd while you and I are here, you haven't touched the functionality yet, but you roughly understand what it offers. Â I'm open to your suggestions, criticism, and offer to answer the question:How much do you think a subscription should cost? Maybe we should make it free to start with?P.S. The screenshot that is listed made at the time of writing this post. And if you look at the WTC market at this time, you'll see that it rose by 10% at this pointI am also open to developing something new that has already been tested by you, but has not been implemented by me on my platform. If you have ideas but no one to implement them, contact me and we'll come up with something free, or for a fee.My Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dreiz3r/My Telegram: https://t.me/DREIZ3R",
