What exactly do you classify as \"shitposting,\" if I may ask? The comment is:  QuoteThe right thing for anyone to do in this upcoming election is to vote. \"Your vote is your right,\" so just do your part by voting first, but please play it safe if your pulling unit is not environmentally friendly and you shift to avoid being molested, harassed, or abused. I strongly believe this year's election will be different from the others. Let's just watch and see. All we pray for is a peaceful, free, and fair election. If you call this a \"shitpost,\" you are equally telling me that my comment, which is my opinion over the past election, is trash, or are you suggesting I talk above what I know? For long I have not visited this thread, nah for me to kuku ghost my self for diz our local board, 2 avoid incoming wahala.",

      "body": "OP, Although I have not lasted up to a year in this forum, I have seen the worst shitposts from some members in other boards within the period I have lasted in this forum. I am not against reporting and creating threads for shitposters or spammers because it's a way to keep the board clean and also reduce the level of low-quality or bad posts in this forum. Like I see on these forums, reports that are mostly taken seriously need enough references or evidence to prove the member guilty. I can see that a few names on your list have more than one reference, but considering that there have been no serious shitposts by some of these members. I want to ask, were the references on those memeber just all the references you could map them to? Those references are insufficient to label this a shitpost and perhaps even if few post are considered shit post, there are still other quality post made by them.I see that your account has long been registered in this forum, which I guess makes you more familiar with the forum than some of us here that just got registered recently. It would not be a bad idea to create a thread where you can mention any user that is going against the forum rules, such as spamming or shitposting, and then correct them.This is the Nigeria local board; you need to correct members here so that they don't go out to other serious boards to make the same mistakes. Warn them and point out their errors; if they continue to shitpost, then you can report to moderator. The local board should also serve as an avenue for helping your fellow citizens grow and learn. Most of these members are here to learn and also improve themselves. I love Nigerians; they are always smart people. If you teach them, they will learn. In my opinion, you should change the title of this thread to \"warning for low-quality posts.\"Do you have any boards where all these mentioned users have been warned?",

      "body": "Agbe, in as much as I like your quest to keep Nigerian board sanitized, I do not like the idea behind this thread and I will suggest that you lock this thread.I have toured this whole forum and I can beat my chest and tell you that Nigerians aren't shit posters.This is because we work hard and also we were colonised by Britain, so English is not our problem. Even if our English will not be as standard as the owners like The Sceptical Chymist may want it, yet we are able to make connected sentences. Even in this thread, someone like Obari made better post here. If you see something that you feel is a shit post, report it to the moderators and that will be fine.Infact Nigeria should be the country with the best posters.If this thread is left open, it will give impression that Nigerians are shit posters which is far from the truth. I can even bet that Nigerians produce the most quality posts in the forum.  Check the posts of these users;CryptopreneurBrainboss;Charles-Tim;Smart Virus;Igebotz;Mpamaegbu;Upgrade00;Coyster;BIT-BENDER;SatoPrincess;Poka124RuchiMr right Oluwa-BtcWiwoDavidvictosonFivestar4everMVP Infact and all Nigerian users too numerous to mention, you will understand that we are known for quality. This is why Nigerians are always taking the best quality posts in Best_Change, Livescasino and other campaigns that give bonuses. Proudly a Nigerian and we are the best.",
