A long-term payoff that is way better than speculation would be to spend your time learning about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies one can acquire transferable and highly valuable skills in blockchain, game theory, security, cryptography, consensus algorithms that will remain relevant in for many years.Kindly suggest some other valuable skills one can acquire by learning about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?",

That's the fundamental law of economics. To some point, these laws apply to bitcoin and how it's priced. The different between both are: The stock market is majorly controlled between company share holder's but Bitcoin price can't be controlled even by the so called Wales and miners. They can just to some point shake the price buy selling huge amount and causing a little panic in the market which will not last long. Quote from: Alphakilo on March 16, 2023, 11:26:27 AMit is better not to regard them as investment.  Rather than spend your time speculating about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, you could actually spend that time investing in education and knowledge about bitcoin and the technologies around cryptocurrencies. You can also, in turn, invest by learning and studying the Bitcoin market. No amount of time or energy invested in studying Bitcoin can give anyone the actual price or the right time to invest; rather, it will only reduce the losses that can be incurred to the minimum.Investment is a choice. When you have the right source of information and you convince yourself enough, you can forge ahead and buy some SATs and call it an investment.",

Also don’t complicate learning of bitcoin and crypto-currency, it’s not as difficult or expensive as you are making it, if you are dedicated and consistently ready I believe you would be fine.",

      "body": "Each type of investment has its similarities and differences, and it is important to recognize that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not the same as traditional investments like stocks and bonds. Even investing in bitcoin has big differences compared to other cryptocurrencies. While some may see parallels between these types of investments, we must understand that cryptocurrencies operate in a different way. But, as you mentioned, investing time and energy into learning about the technology behind cryptocurrencies can be a wise long-term strategy. It is easy to get caught up in the hype of short-term gains, but focusing on education and knowledge is a more sustainable and profitable approach. Therefore, I encourage everyone to continue learning and stay informed about the latest developments in this world.",

People have many limitations to use it as a digital currency. While for investment (digital gold), people know it has a big potential to earn money. Since it is easy to invest in Bitcoin, people want to spend their money on Bitcoin. But investing in Bitcoin is as easy as people think, it requires sufficient knowledge.",

Like real estate that you can put up for rent, dividends of stocks, yield from bonds. Bitcoin and gold, collectibles and commodities are speculative assets that generate profits through price fluctuations. This doesn't make them worse than investments, it's just a different mechanism.Some people are good at speculation, but most are not. You can easily get burned trying to trade Bitcoin, especially with leverage. Holding for years is a safer strategy. But learning about Bitcoin and surrounding technologies is not a great idea. It's not a high demand skill set. If you want to spend time learning, better to learn something that is already established and will be relevant in 10+ years. Like programming, AI, automation, data science.",

No one knows the exact movement of Bitcoin. What we could actually know and understand is that bitcoin is cyclical and when we watch a given cycle, we will predict when that cycle will end and when another will start and that is the basis of speculationYou will only avoid speculation if you learn related skills of Bitcoin that doesn't have to do with investing or trading Bitcoin. Because if you are involved with bitcoin volatility, you must surely speculate whether knowingly or unknowingly.",

Speculation about the price of bitcoin is not wrong if you also do it for long term investment, because we all know bitcoin will be good for long term investment. People are free to speculate with their own analysis. But if someone equates bitcoin investment with stocks, bonds and other investments that is of course not the same as bitcoin. Bitcoin fluctuates, volatility is very high, it will be risky for people who don't understand about it.Some of the valuable skills to be gained from learning bitcoin is becoming a Bitcoin developer, if you are serious about it you can take lots of classes that learn how bitcoin works and learn about blockchain technology. Becoming a bitcoin expert will have many advantages, not just speculating, you too can contribute a lot to bitcoin",

It takes only a few that understand the benefits of Bitcoin to invest in it while still been having a very comfortable life.

Well, that's another discussion.You can learn about what difficulties BTC and blockchain are facing and how we can circumvent them. You can make innovations if you're a developer if not then still ideas need no education. You can find ways to legalize it in those countries where it is a ban and overall if you see use cases then blockchain crypto has broad uses and many of them are already in the field like usage for the agriculture sector, energy production, and energy transportation sector, supply chain management sector, Gaming ( like making games to play in metaverse), Entertainment sector, etcThe list of blockchain usage for each domain is long, the query is to which skill you should learn, that needs clarification of the problems that a domain facing and how blockchain can cover it and how can you learn it but first you must have manually confirmed if there is any money in that domain and what's the scope there.",
