Of course, such a method of access is very easy for the bank's clients, but completely pointless if it is a custodial service, similar to any CEX that many use as a \"crypto bank\".People who do not buy Bitcoin to use it as a currency and only want profit without too much worry will certainly choose this option, only that first of all they should be warned about all the risks arising from the custodial service. Banks will certainly (at least some) accept to enable this kind of service, but storage and fees in that case will certainly not be negligible.The only benefit I see in this way of purchase is that the client does not have to do a new KYC, given that the bank already knows all the information, and if they also gave clients the option of withdrawing to non-custodial wallets, it would be a solid option for many who are looking for easy way to enter the crypto market.",

I am sure that service will help Bitcoin to be accepted more but I only consider it as a start for Bitcoin newbies. They can use banks as their first gates to access Bitcoin but after that, they must learn to use non custodial wallets.Not your keys, not your coins. I hope if they use such services, they won't pay big cost before they know what non custodial wallet is good to use and actually use such wallet to store their coins.https://chainsec.io/checklist/",

If banks buy the idea, they will imprison people's assets more than they are already doing, because some individuals who are too lazy to take responsibility for their own security will be the first to rush and taste the new banking features, thinking they have all arrived. But it's actually better than the bank doing nothing and being racist over Bitcoin. But there will actually be a high seizure of assets by government officials, just like they do over account restrictions. If there is any suspicion over any one's fund, they will take over the user's assets without the person's permission.Unless they create something like a self-custodial system where depositors will be allowed to create a key using the system, but the key won't be stored in their database, and this key can only be used by the deposit for all forms of withdrawal within the banking sector and the bank won't have any form of access over the wallet, the bank will try to offer some form of sales service, which might at some point break the buyer's privacy since they are the ones selling crypto to the buyer and they might take note of the wallet. They can make their small gain from selling and buying with their addiction's little charges; that way, I believe people might actually want to patronize them, and if not, I see no difference from actually using the bank for savings and buying crypto and handing it over to them to still steal.",

Imo there is trust issue problem on this since both party can accused each other in event that a hacker or an inside job happened on that specific wallet. The user can mix the coin then pretend it was hacked and blame the banks for the loss while the banks can do the other way around. This kind of situation which both party holds the private key on the asset can create a blaming and stealing game to each other. This is how the way I understand the scenario under this circumstances.",

This is a smart move that could attract more people to the cryptocurrency space. Banks a good at advertisement and can penetrate the financial sector of the economy because they enjoy the support of the government. But I don't see much difference between the proposed service and the services provided by exchanges. The only difference is that banks are insured by deposit insurance which means depositors might be able to get back their deposits if these banks fail. Since 2020 when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) advised banks to engage in this crypto safekeeping and custody services, I cannot find any bank that embraced such service except Bank of New York Mellon (I might be wrong). I don't also know how the banks intend to handle the risk involved in keeping crypto assets. The truth remains that with the constant failure of some regional banks, keeping your asset with them will be very risky. And most of these banks don't have relevant cybersecurity tools which can make them prone to attacks. I will always prefer to keep and own my Bitcoin.",

Thats the point i want to drive at. Its a good idea for banks to try or wish to pick a page out of the decentralized system in blockchain technology and the goods that cryptocurrency hace got to offer but, having centrlized systems mixed with a decentralized system would be some hard to archive innovation.You can't call it private when someone else, a nlt so pro bitcoin organisation is in charge of the safe keepong of your private key... thats some risk as they could still with hold your access by refusing you access to your keys.

These banks would really be trying out to play along with this current trend specially that Bitcoin/Crypto could really bring out that potential revenue for them as an add up but of course it would really be depending if it would be allowed on such country or place. We know that there are lots of countries which arent really that open for such situation at any cost. These institutions are really that heavilycentralized or regulated on which it would really be just that normal that they would be taking into an approach that they would be sticking on where government do prefer.Yes, they could offer that kind of feature on storing up that privatekeys for its users or to those who would tend to make use of their service but its true that it is really thatcontrary on why cryptocurrency does exist which is to be your own bank and we can see that contradictory thing.",

The rule is that nobody should hold our keys, but in a service like this we can also know if the bank accesses our cryptocurrency, and make any transaction. So, it looks like a good idea, because it's not like fiat where the bank controls the digits shown to customer and make use of their money for businesses.

There are two sides to this, first it is defeats entirely the idea of decentralization in cryptocurrency or rather bitcoin. Because this doesn’t really differs from someone that trust online storage services like password mangers or storing them on emails and the rest because this leads straight to losing of one’s key if the platform or bank gets compromised. Also ones fund go be confiscated easily by the government Should they decide to go back and against cryptocurrency. They would just get the keys or seeds from the bank without your knowledge. This method would only be used by people that are not after anonymity or it’s like, or are scared to store their keys them selves. It could also be used in multi sig wallets, where a set of the key will be stored there. But still it Carries the risk which is advice against on centralized exchanges",
