  "content": "People don't pay attention at all. Someone made an exploit for AntMiner S1 (bm1380) chips. https://mightydevices.com/index.php/2018/02/reverse-engineering-antminer-s1/ The source code is there, I want someone to see if they can change the code for RandomX or another profitable algorithm that would work. I have 2 S1s, I could test this on. The proof is here. If someone figures it out for RandomX, we could have at least 75kh. Whoever successfully changes the algorithm, will receive an unspecified amount in BTC. Good luck!",

      "body": "You should post this topic in the Altcoin Mining section, RandomX has nothing to do with BTC and SHA256.I didn't find any mention to RandomX in your first link?I only looked very briefly, maybe I'm wrong but I don't want to waste my time to be honest, I appreciate any form of reverse engineering but when it comes to RandomX it's still a big waste of time so far.In my opinion you can't start with an ASIC SHA256 and make it mine RandomX which is ASIC-resistant as well.A few years ago I was in contact with a guy from Russia. He was sending videos to all his contacts to show that he managed to mine RandomX with an Antminer X3 with a really impressive hashrate. He claimed to have modified the firmware, and show workers pages with crazy hashrate on MoneroOcean pool.The reality was that it was a fake, that the guy was just editing videos and never made it. I think in real life he never really tried to be honest.He disappeared overnight and then we found out from a third party that this guy was just using a huge amount of botnets, and he was trying to sell his so-called \"custom firmware\" for Antminer X3 to inexperienced newbies.That's the whole point of RandomX, to be ASIC resistant, and if a flaw had been found, I think we'd all know about it.PS : Goodluck to try to give motivation to developpers with a Bounty you don't even give the amount",

It claims to be a mining front end for the ASICs that optimizes the communications protocol but I haven't analyzed the code.This optimization has nothing to do with the ASIC chips or the POW algorithm.You can't change the algorithm of an ASIC, that why it's called Application Specific Integrated Circuit. An ASIC for SHA256D will only ever mine SHA256D,no matter how high the bounty.",

CNv2 there was a similar video on YouTube showing something similar with the X3 mining XMR after it had changed algos before randomXI imagine it was also fake?",
