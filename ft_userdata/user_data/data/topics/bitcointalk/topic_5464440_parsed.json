Just as the above user has said, kindly provide a screenshot for clarity's sake. Also, do not respond to the email.",

If I am not misunderstanding you, Qobuz Sublime is not infiltrating this forum, in fact they are targeting your email, personally.Qobuz Sublime is the worst service ever in today's internet world.I'm sure this is what happened to you.QuoteSometimes, you receive unwanted emails from people you don't know. Spammers can get your email address through a variety of methods. Here are some of them:• Guessing - They may use an algorithm to generate variations of the email. They then send the same spam message to every generated email address.• Hacking - Sometimes secure lists are hacked and details are leaked, including email addresses.• Purchase - Some companies sell lists of email addresses. Often these lists are created when you respond to free offers.• Scraping - Spammers can use tools to search the web for email addresses posted online. They then send spam messages to the addresses they find.One of the points above that you are experiencing right now is not the forum that has a problem, if the forum is the problem, of course we also have a problem, but we are fine and no spammers have entered my e-mail.So update your e-mail properly or repair your device, so that it is clean from viruses so that you are not attacked by Spammers.",

I'm not sure if you've really taken care of your privacy so far, but it must be one of the reasons why your email gets noticed.What are you worried about anyway if you receive those phishing emails regardless of where they come from?You are still a newbie with one post, of course you can replace your single use email with another email. Simply put it is an easy choice than accusing mods of selling data or there is a user data leak on this forum.",

To clarify everything - you can visit the privacy section and understand whatever is written there: About privacyThere is a warning that you need to pay attention to about privacy which is the responsibility of every bitcointalk user; here's the quote.QuoteIt's possible to use bitcointalk.org without submitting any personal info.

I have never received any other mails from an unknown service before so how the heck do you expect me to believe you. The only time I think mods your emails are exposed to mods is when you’re reporting a post to them through “report to moderator” function because this message is always displayed there. ” Please note that your email address will be revealed to the moderators if you use this.”",

What makes your account particularly special to be the focus of a phishing emails? Your account represents just a tiny fraction of the overall user accounts registered on the forum. Unless we start witnessing numerous reports of similar incidents, there is no basis for drawing such a conclusion. So your assumptions are wrong and unfounded.  Quote from: willsh on August 24, 2023, 03:01:01 PMEdit: I am certain of this folks.

I came here to warn you guys or collaborate, but it seems from your replies that you are either not willing or not able to do so.There are various methods that spammers can employ to acquire your email, even if you haven't used it anywhere else on the internet. They might resort to techniques such as dictionary attacks, using malware or malicious browser extensions, or even making educated guesses based on common email address formats. Additionally, hackers could intercept email communication through unsecured networks.  The point is, do not rush to conclusions without all the facts. Just because your email ended up with a spammer does not mean you know exactly how it happened.",
