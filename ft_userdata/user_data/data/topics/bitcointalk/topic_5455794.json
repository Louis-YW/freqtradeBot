Is there anyone else who shares the same sentiments?What you mean by \"social attack\"?From my understanding, the lack of significant reaction in the Bitcoin market could be attributed to the fact that the SEC's actions are primarily focused on altcoins and the platforms associated with them, rather than directly targeting Bitcoin. In fact, one could see this as a bullish sign for Bitcoin. Also, this situation is localized to the US and may not have a widespread impact globally. From where I stand, why should I even bother about the SEC suing some company over there? I mean, does it really affect me or anyone outside that jurisdiction?",

More so binance US isn’t the world’s binance so it won’t have any serious impact. What will have had a bigger impact will have been if all the bitcoin the binance exchange had, had been forced to convert into another coin or the exchange was hacked and all coins were moved. But even so it will just be a temporary hit too because bitcoin would still recover, Mt.Gox had a greater impact and bitcoin bounced back",

We've seen how it has affected Bitcoin network for the past weeks and how it made the transaction fees quite high and clogged the network as per mempool.Although there is a huge difference for both of them but news do influence the market itself and we've seen a motion for the price. Whilst we saw how BRC20 craze made the network clogged, the price wasn't moved by inch of it but only the fees.",

You are discussing about Bitcoin price on cryptocurrency market which will be affected if a biggest exchange collapses.Binance collapse can have short term impact on Bitcoin network because as its consequence, Binance Pool will stop its operation too.",

This is not the first time an exchange is starting to face issues with authorities and it won't be the last. This is also not a big issue when compared to previous cases of exchanges running away, shutting down overnight, etc.3. At this point there aren't as many weak hands left in the market so whenever any negative news comes out, there are less people who panic sell hence a weak reaction to any kind of negative news including the thing with Binance.",
