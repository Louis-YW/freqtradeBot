  "content": "BitDegree is world’s first blockchain-powered, smart-incentives based online education platformwhich will revolutionize global education and tech recruiting. The main purpose of the BitDegreeplatform is to let Students acquire skills that are currently required by the labor market. The way to doit is not to ask business what skills they need in the far future (3-5 years), but to respond to explicitlyexpressed skilled labor demand quickly. BitDegree will directly align the incentives of students andanyone who wants them to become knowledge workers in digital economy - like current or potentialemployers, digital service providers and sponsors. Smart-incentive is a smart contract on Ethereumnetwork ensuring the exchange of tokens between a sponsor (the Incentive Creator) and a student(the Incentive Taker), who is committing to study a specific subject in order to receive tokens (theIncentive). The BitDegree platform will offer students online courses with a clear and transparentblockchain-based reward system and achievement tracking. Our use case for blockchain is notsensitive to prolonged waiting periods before transactions are committed, thus, overall platformoverhead (as in expenses) of using Ethereum network for transactional and immutable data storageneeds, will be low. To make the learning process as exciting as playing Minecraft we will use Octalysisframework of gamification design.We see BitDegree as a unique tool for business to recruit tech talent and shape global education to itsneeds through smart-incentives. National government Job centers will be able to track the demand ofskills without having to involve scrupulous report gatherings from businesses and also help joblesscitizens by subsidising studies for skills on high demand. Think about it as Coursera and HackerRankmerged together, powered by blockchain technology. The main benefit of BitDegree platform toincentive providers is the possibility to initiate and maintain dialogue with upcoming talent andreward them for achievements through smart-incentives. Smart-incentives on the BitDegree platformwill range from small to large and be location and topic targeted. From the student’s perspective, itmeans getting paid to learn new skills based on local demand, which not only incentivizes but canactually be a viable escape from unskilled work.",
