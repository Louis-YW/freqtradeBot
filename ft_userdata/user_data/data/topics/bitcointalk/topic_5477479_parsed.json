  "content": "The Federal Government, FG, cannot stop cybercrime in Nigeria until the people’s orientation and value system are properly worked on.According to, Babatunde Obrimah, Chief Operating Officer, Fintech Association of Nigeria, “Cybercrime is not peculiar to Nigeria. It is a global problem. But it has to do with our value system – the get-rich-quick syndrome. The young people see it in the leaders, and they also took that decision to get money because we celebrate money without looking at the source of the money.“Nobody, even Federal Government cannot stop cybercrime. You can’t stop it. But you can reduce the impact by making sure that you do the right things. You can’t stop it because they are also coming up with new solution.“As government is trying to block them, they are also looking into how to break into that. Someone sitting in North Korea can hack a bank in Brazil.“It is a huge problem because in a day of manual banking, armed robbers attacked bullion van; they probably went away with N20 million, but someone can sit in his room and take N20 billion from another person’s account. So, it is a huge problem, and until we address our value systems, and actually we are able to ask ourselves questions, like this person is a civil servant, this person is a politician, even in the National Assembly, how much money do you earn that you should have this?“Until we address those value issues with sincerity, it is problem we are going to have. It is not a localised Nigerian problem. It is a global problem. It is just that we have a situation that a young people just see that as an opportunity to get rich quick, buy flashy cars, live in decent part of the city, wear designer clothes, and life is not about that,” This has caused congestion in prison whereby so many inmates were acquitted on the approval of the executive arm of government in various states as a way of decongesting the prison. There are progressive cases of EFCC and police arresting and parading fraudsters daily adding to our normal civil and criminal cases.In less than 5 minutes, a fraudster will wipe your account if they should get in touch with your bank alert SIM card or A.T.M card. This has posed risk in the banking systems. It would have been better if the only victims are our politicians because they are the bigger thieves killing the country but the common struggling man is always at the position of being a victim.",

Internet fraud is as old as the internet. Just as crime internet fraud which is also a crime cannot be completely decimated. It can be only be reduced. To achieve this, the government needs to stop lying to itself. Create real opportunities for the Nigerian youths to be gainfully employed and with good pay. The minimum wage has to be increased from 30k to 50k. Fix our educational system. It's just too many. But the first and foremost is to fix the leadership of the country.",

Criminals has move into cybercrimes which is more convenient for them.Nigeria is not the only country with fraudsters but what makes ours worst and disappointing is from the fact that here fraudster and cybercriminals can live openly being accepted by the public and while not totally being scared of the law enforcement agency since they can bribe their way out of prison. While in other countries Cybercriminals are trying to hide their identities for fear of the public and law enforcement agency since they know once they are caught they are going to lost everything and may even spend their life time in prison.The mass public of Nigeria accepts fraudsters and cybercriminals with the fact these people are trying to get out of poverty because the economy whereas they don't know they are among the people making the economy to continue to suffer inflation.Pray God help us working hard to make it legitimately to be successful.",

The government should work on themselves firstly and create opportunities that will drive out the interest of the youth from internet fraud. The efcc and police called out to handle this people are now doing business with them, so we should not deceive ourselves.",

This has posed risk in the banking systems. It would have been better if the only victims are our politicians because they are the bigger thieves killing the country but the common struggling man is always at the position of being a victimThis is why it is always advisable not to leave your important informations on your mobile for or expose your sensitive informations to where someone else can gain access to them. Always delete an alert from your bank once you have read them. Always resist the urge of giving someone else your ATM cards and pin to go to the POS or ATM machine to withdraw money for you,  instead transfer the money to the person account and let the person use his/her card to get the money for you if you are too busy to do it yourself. Before someone can gain access into your account he/she must have gotten little information about you. This is why in the crypto space the first lesson you will learn is never release your wallet phrase to anyone. Also if you have been around this industry for long you will always hear the saying; not your key, not your money. What this means is that once you expose your wallet phrase, you will lose your money. Security is every man business and if you keep waiting for the government you will wait for all eternity.",

Just like other advance countries have standard security officer, whom are really dedicated in there job. Nigeria man will always put his life and family first before security. while foreign security put their job first before anything. And we want the country to be better. We can make the country a better place if we take our security system serious. the force or military people should stop giving information to criminal. If they don't stop that, things will never change. Taking bribe and aprihendind innocent people while the bad citizen continue roaming around.Quote from: Jenwi on December 11, 2023, 06:39:54 PM“It is a huge problem because in a day of manual banking, armed robbers attacked bullion van; they probably went away with N20 million, but someone can sit in his room and take N20 billion from another person’s account.

This information is always gotten from the the people who are either bankers or the people who distribute money from billion van. So if you check out, you will notice that it's only an insider that will tell the outsider how the inside looks like.Sometimes this information spread from mistakenly leaving important things on your phone. Which need to be deleted, and if it's seen by wrong people, they'll use it against you just like @jubilsmith said.",

      "body": "Lately, we've had a whole lot of threads on the board talking about cybercrime and while this is a general problem that is of great concern to every Nigerian that wants the reputation of the country not to become tarnish by these ill act, I still feel that we aren't painting the right picture regarding this snf let me also state this very clear that the issue of cyber crime isn't peculiar to Nigeria alone, their are lot of other countries and nationality engaging in this awful act.Because it has beenme out reality that most of our youth are tilting to this direction, it's very necessary to look at the root of this problem and find a way of addressing the problem from their.The reason why the strategies by our leaders is not yielding any positive result is because what they do most of the time is to threaten this guys and sometimes make arrest offer which they get themselves freed by paying a certain amount of money. This goes to show that the problem isn't just about cybercrime but more of the corrupt mindset that the average nija man has and what we should be talking about should be on how we can sensitize people for follow the right processes of getting things done.That mentality that their is always a shortcuts to achieving things is one of the major problem of the country because most persons just think since making morning legimsteoy is difficult, the only shortcut is to go into criminal activities just to secure the bagWe need a lot of sensitization and rehabilation to be done on not just our youth, bit also on our children that will take on the affairs of the nation. I guess that's the only easy we can solve the problem of cybercrime and other criminal activities in the country.",

The problem with cyber crime no one can control it, if anyone get caught the person will face the consequence but no one can control it cause the love of money is just too much, most people want bigger house, cars etc. The reason why cyber crime keeps growing everyday is as a result of peer pressure, young people with no money feel oppressed with those flashy cars.Just like what everyone is saying creating of opportunities and employment, I don't see creating of job opportunities as a way of stopping cyber crime, this dirty act will still exist even with job opportunities, a lot of employed staffs are into cyber crime and do you think the young ones who have tasted this money and enjoyed the system of getting quick money do you think they will stop. I don't believe in the regulation of cyber crime this is society for us and we should learn to accept the reality, you don't expect everyone to act right just because we want everything to be in order that's impossible. The issue here is everyone should be careful and avoid friends like this, if you observe people who always fall victims are friends with fraudsters, they always know your next move and sometimes we share personal informations with them in the name of friendship.",

If the youths are engaged in doing something that will be beneficial to their lives and also earn them a good source of income, there is no way they will be thinking of who to go and scam. Also, if there are sufficient employment opportunities, young graduates will also get employed and keep their eyes off ingaging in cybercrime.The arm force should be trained and equipped with high-efficiency technology that can help track down the cybercrime guys and make work easy for them.",
