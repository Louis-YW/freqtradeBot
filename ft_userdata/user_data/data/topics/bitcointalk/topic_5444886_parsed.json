The good news is that you can recover your wallet with the help of a desktop wallet, and people use Electrum most often.

But due to the loss of email access, and he used seed Phrase to restore, but it failed. Then, with everyone's help, he recovered his bitcoins and transferred them all to his Trezor hardware wallet.I am also quite surprised that until now, there are still many people using web wallets to store bitcoins.

Thanks again for the tipsYou should really do it and I'm glad that you're able to import and get it or else it will be another horror story that I've read from this section. Wherein those people that still got balances on their blockchain.com wallet can no longer be retrieved of how the recovery process have changed. Now your funds are safe and it's advisable if someone is still reading in here that has got funds there, you should start moving it from there to another more trustworthy wallet like his, a hardware wallet which is Trezor or a Ledger or even to a desktop wallet like Electrum.",
