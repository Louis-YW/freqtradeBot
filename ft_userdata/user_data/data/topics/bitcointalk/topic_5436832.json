  "content": "after doing dev work with ethereum and bitcoin it seems that both consensus options are blatantly fairly flawed. POW has obvious scaling issues and POS seems like a bandaid solution with wealthy people automatically being allocated more currency through an infinitely compounding cycle. Is the crypto/blockchain community not open to new type of consensus? It seems like POW and POS just keep getting updated rather than addressing the real issue and switching base mechanisms. Do others just not see issues with POW or POS?",

      "body": "Apart from the drama that Franky loves to raise about devs, he is right. The scaling has very little to do with mining algorithm, it is about the block space being limited which exist in both PoW and PoS.However the flaws in PoS are by design and there is nothing that can really fix them whereas PoW doesn't have those flaws. For example in a PoS coin (specially altcoins) where people store their coins on exchanges and the altcoin exists only on the exchange for trading (aka gambling) the exchange suddenly gains a supermajority power to control the PoS network (which has happened in the past!). Something that is not possible in PoW because by design we have a genius way of preventing such attacks by making them needing to do actual work.Quote from: aidoyoh on January 26, 2023, 06:23:33 AMWhat do you think it would take for people to be open to a Consensus method that works off a new base mechanism(not based in POW or POS)?Most people are very open to new innovations in cryptocurrency world the problem is that we are always disappointed because almost everything new we see is a money grab project which is why the algorithms they introduce is also designed to ease their scam not to innovate and solve problems. Example: everything about Ethereum from its conception to help create tokens to scam people to their recent switch to PoS that helps them make money using their 72 million premined coins.",

The moment you start deviating from this fact the more complicated and confusing things become.It's simply a consensus method for proving to a trustless Network that a work has been properly done before it's approved, possibly with reward. Any Consensus method you develop should be based on this(PoW), maybe slightly or completely different from Bitcoin PoW type.Proof of Stake should never even exist in the first place as the name and idea is fundamentally flawed. Consensus or agreememt only happens once a work is done with proof that it has been done, which is why a true consensus must always have the word Work rather than Stake attached to Proof..So your own consensus method must be Work Based Proof and nothing else.You could say \"Issues with Bitcoin Proof-of-Work\"  rather than \"Issues with Proof-of-Work\". Proof of Work has no issue as it's perfect consensus method for a trustless network or world.By the way, Bitcoin PoW remains the best consensus mechanism for a decentralized & trustless network as far as I can tell. It doesn't violate the other Bitcoin principles. But I know of alternative PoW that will prove very useful for any truely decentralized and trustless network. And it maybe compatible with the current Bitcoin.  I just prefer it tested on another network. Notwithstanding, the current Bitcoin consensus is still very much useful and it's the right method for any true cryptocurrency.",

It seemed promising a first but with all the required amendments is it really still the best solution out there or is it time to rethink the base principles of consensus. POW has indeed the theoretical capacity of getting centralized by miners migrating where they can get more profit (cheaper electricity, lower taxes, maybe solar/wind power).But this is the theory. In reality the miners are pretty well spread, much better than 5 years ago. In reality the miners can pick the pools they want and I don't see why miners would be dumb and endanger Bitcoin (and their revenues) by using all of them the same pool (and even trying 51% attack, which would clearly bring the price down).Actually I've seen - not in case of Bitcoin - one pool getting over 51% hash rate and still not attempting anything fishy. Again, staying honest usually pays off better in this business.Or.. do you see other issues which you expect us to guess?!",

Proof of Work is like randomly selecting presidents and not revealing who they are until they are done with their term (pretend the president is actually the one who makes decisions). Sure you may prevent murder but if you select randomly it is rare you will select the best candidate for the current market condition, as you are limiting access to all the potential information. This makes it difficult for the network to optimize itself into the future as it is constrained to a single network perspective for each decision(proposal). Seeing as blockchain is software I feel like it should be built to scale alongside computational innovation rather than being restrained by it.(block size wars, time server constraints, pow function) If you based a network in communication could it possibly be the best way for all relevant data to be compared and the system optimized for the next state. In an ideal world wouldn't everyone be able to properly communicate their perspectives and reach common ground? The only way to have all the relevant information is communication, and we can program computers to communicate clearly and uniformly through protocols. Why is network communication being minimized rather than optimized amongst consensus methods?",

POW does not read or write polling cards). nor about keeping votes a secret for 4 year term. nor about the PoW being related to editing votes when received(again PoW is not about reading polling cards). (a malicious polling count station, could if it had enough power to outpace the other poll card collating centres, could produce an empty batch(management decision not related to PoW). thus holding up/delaying any change of majority by having nothing to count for a period. but thats not PoW caused.. thats bad management of selecting to not fill their batch BEFORE using PoW to secure an empty batchPoW is about securing a batch ID of collated votes(or empty boxes). which then is a proof of confirmation they are then counted and locked(or nothing new occured) and treated as valid locked positions at that given timeif a polling count centre had more cost/power then its competing count stations. it could go back and make its own pile of empty batches or batches of collated votes it favours(again not POW related but management decision) and then make the batch ID's faster then competing stations. to overtake them and re-org the results(costly endeaver that can easily be rejected by other mechanism, thus not worth attempting)...why i say its a poor analogy to compare to electionsis if treating btc as votes. satoshi has remained president with most majority votes for 14 years, even when elections that could change who has what btc every 10 minutesmeaning elections can swing to a new vote majority leader any time(EG a merger of greyscale and binance) where they show they have more btc/votes than satoshi by co-mingling their coinwhich has nothing to do with PoW and PoW has nothing to do with election counting.. just batch securing an ID of a the count of recent vote changes",

      "body": "I feel I understand how bitcoin works as I have rebuilt it multiple times testing various small changes, although I can understand why it was unclear what I meant. When I say bitcoin is like the government, I meant it in a very general sense with nodes acting as the citizens within the population. I am not referring to transactions acting as votes but rather nodes accepting/confirming the longest chain as their vote. Citizens(nodes) do their jobs everyday to contribute to the economy which is the ongoing macro system(make and distribute transactions). Presidents(nodes) are randomly selected to group transactions for the next block through attempts at solving the POW function for that block.  Just like a president a citizen(node) is selected for a brief time period to make potential decisions for the networks next economic state. The difference being instead of 4 years of decisions it is building 1 block/proposal worth of decisions.When it comes to the analogy, I am referring less to the specifics of the voting/election aspect and more to how it is unlikely for a system to be represented accurately from a single point or origin. A president is selected and then treated as a temporary origin point for decisions. The population can always rebel(accept another chain), however, the problem more so lies in the fact that the “president “ only has access to a single market perspective for forming proposals. This means each time a proposal is made it is only coming from the perspective of that position in the network thus limiting the systems ability to build the most efficient block for adapting to market conditions. Focusing on network communication you would be able to instead decide on the best potential block for the network rather than the block of the first person that solves the POW. In this analogy you could take it even farther and say that mining pools are similar to political parties how the network uses mining pools to group candidates and simplify the selection process but I will admit it's a bit of a stretch.To summarize:POW:Selects proposal based on what node is making it.(selects potential proposal based on node who first solved POW)Ideal:Selects proposal based on best proposal for the current conditions (Selects node based on best potential proposal)Transactions = participation in the economyProposals =transitions system to next economic/market stateNodes = citizens President = node/citizen who solves POW first that term(block)Votes = which proposal/chain a node is willing to confirm/using",
