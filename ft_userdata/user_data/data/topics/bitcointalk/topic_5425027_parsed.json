  "content": "Hey guys,With all the KYC talk lately I wanted to open up a thread and ask about your opinion. The side of the user:- Prefers no KYC- Prefers anon coins as a payment platform- If a KYC is triggered, they want to trust the brand with their documentsThe side of the casino:- Regulators are asking them to do KYC, but they need to find a balance on when it's triggered. E.g. to keep a portion of the user happy, they can rise the trigger to a certain amount. - They are tied to a payment provider, either because of the license or CMS, and can offer only a certain portion of cryptocurrency. - Users are abusing them if there's absolutely no KYC matrix in the system. What would, in your opinion, be the best balance here? Efialtis from BTCGosu mentioned that some of the casino managers make exceptions, and I can imagine how that's possible, but I'm curious in what you would like to see there. Quote from: efialtis on November 08, 2022, 06:11:33 PMRegarding KYC: Their management confirmed with me personally that they would not enforce KYC. (Same old story, we could of course argue about that just like with any curacao licensed crypto casino) - the good news is when I have personal confirmation of such a statement, then I am putting a \"No\" and if they break their word at any point of time, I would take action. That is how I have always been handling this topic and how I will continue doing it.",

So for both of those who want to have 0 KYC implementation and casinos and regulators, they have to meet in the middle, which I think  the idea of having KYC being asked is based on the amount of money.Also, casinos should not just accuse anyone without any reason, if they ask for KYC they should entirely explain what happened and why they ask for identifying documents. (I know there might be privacy concerns here, please share your knowledge about it, I'll be glad to hear it).",

Which in my case has probably already happened as i gave my ids in the past a lot without considering the consequences.

Apparently a higher percentage of gamblers would prefer casinos that have no KYC requirements because this will help save the unnecessary stress for verification of user's account and the KYC restrictions sometimes placed on account that are yet to be verified.2. I think the demand for this will be a rare occurrence since everything now evolved round about digital currency in this era.3. Gamblers don't use KYC request to build their trust on a gambling website, what they build upon is the capacity to how far they can deliver their services when it comes to enjoying gambling varieties without any delay or denials in their gambling experience with their casino.I don't think i can really side the other side",

I think KYC is the trend now, so it is somehow difficult to not implement it since regulations are imposing that centralized casino must implement KYC for anti-money laundering.  I think if the casino wanted to implement KYC, they must implement it on the registration and before enabling deposit address so that a player can have a choice whether he will undergo KYC or not before playing.  That way player can avoid losing fund in relation to KYC issue.  This also solve the casino's problem of multi-accounting and other exploits done by users.It is either implement KYC or not, if the casino wanted to implement KYC then do before the player is able to deposit funds.",

Any platform that has related to any financial matters will always ask for this KYC, the thing is to choose the higher minimum withdrawal for the required KYC and also avoid asking for heavy requirements of KYC.

Yes, OP should move this to the gambling discussion board.As we have seen, casinos and bookies with gambling license have kyc requirement in their ToS.This is part of their compliance also to where they are licensed, so it is understandable that they need to put it in their Terms.Some of them are not very strict when it comes to implementation, however, the user should always be prepared to submit if in case he is playing on a casino which requires kyc.In this regard, if you don't want any trouble, just play on a reputable casino, which you think you won't have problem submitting your kyc docs.",
