It is a two way something. First the government is yet to legalize or accept bitcoin or crypto as a legal tender due to same fear as you have, so people will still use fiat as an exchange for transactions. Secondly since the inception of crypto most especially bitcoin people have begin to see that the fiat currency isn’t great for future holding Due to inflation and excess printing which causes its devaluation. Now they are looking for a currency that is a store of value or hedges against inflation and that is why many are looking into bitcoin for investment purposes. This act has been the reason why the government decided to have its own digital currency (CBDC) which is still has same similar characteristics like the fiat currency to me. I don’t think people will abandon the fiat currency totally but dependent on it will reduce drastically. But the fiat currency will still be use for internal or little transactions or when things like the current transaction fee saga on bitcoin arisesQuote from: collinscoinz on May 11, 2023, 08:44:11 AMIn am saiying this because of the value of our naira i observed that our 500 naira is o.124 and some fraction in dollar and our highest 1000k is1 dollar so were is this country going.Why not create this thread on Nigeria Board to have a better discussion as it concerns it.

The government always need to be in power of everything, so they won't allow something they can't control, Bitcoin is a perfect fit for something they can't allow as a country's currency.Op instead I would rather dream about how crypto and Fiat can co exists and governments maybe one day be more friendly to crypto and bitcoin, enough of all the bans and FUD already, to me, people are winning, more and more people now prefers crypto because things are getting harder and people want to have a good life.  You can lose money in crypto but the risk is not like a casino gamble, unless you make it so, crypto is changing peoples lives than their government, I read that's even one reason why the government won't want crypto to succeed. It's is about the people losing money in crypto or is it about seeing poor people turning into millionaires?",

An example is El Salvador. The faith of other currencies, like the local currency of every country, do you mean? It will just be what it is; the idea of local currency cannot totally be eradicated; it will still be there. If there is no economic solution provided to combat the situation of inflation, that will mean that our local currencies will devalue and the purchasing power will really be minimal.",

The growth of digital currencies has created significant competition with the use of fiat currency. The lack of bitcoin legalization is preventing fiat currencies from viewing bitcoin as a credible alternative to itself. If bitcoin becomes legal today, I'm confident we'll see a drop in the use of fiat currency as people learn more about what bitcoin is and the value of having 100% ownership over your asset. Bitcoin is intended to be used as an alternative to fiat currency and is not intended to replace fiat cash. However, the acceptance of bitcoin will undoubtedly represent a threat to the use of traditional currencies.",

To avoid all of this money deflation for one or two reasons, Bitcoin is here to provide us with a transparent alternative to fiat. Instead of keeping your fiat in a bank where it can still lose value, why not use it to invest in Bitcoin and reap the benefits?Quote from: collinscoinz on May 11, 2023, 08:39:29 AMam saiying this because of the value of our naira i observed that our 500 naira is o.124 and some fraction in dollars and our highest 1000k is1 dollar so were is this country going.[/quote]Even though fiat currency loses value due to inflation from time to time, the country's economic system contributes to the value difference between the dollar and the Naira; thus, instead of keeping Naira, which does not have a stable value, buy Bitcoin and hold.",

Realistically there is no opportunity yet for digital currencies to dominate payment systems, moreover every country has rules governing payment systems legitimate.But I'm sure the growth of digital money will continue to grow, where many people will make payments for products that have accepted payments using it and today there are also several online products that can be paid using digital currency and business people will also think about providing easy services to customers.",

The citizens in these underdeveloped are limited by basic infrastructures such as electricity and internet facilities. This means that Bitcoin adoption will not happen at the same time globally, it will be relative. The type of leadership will to a large extent determine bitcoin adoption.
