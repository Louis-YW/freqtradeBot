The alleged bribe was discovered during a search of the former investigator's apartment on Bolshaya Ochakovskaya Street in Moscow.Among other things, according to \"Kommersant,\" he was found with a laptop Apple MacBook Pro, which had been hacked only a few months later. In it, the attention of investigators of the central office of the Investigative Committee drew the folder called \"Pension,\" which turned out to be a photo of a sheet of paper with the records of codes that allowed Tambiev access to 932.1 and 100 bitcoins.\"____Nothing new, that in Russia officials and security forces have long been taking bribes in bitcoins, for every crime like this that is solved, there are a lot of unsolved crimes. It's a good thing at least one freak didn't earn his \"pension.",
