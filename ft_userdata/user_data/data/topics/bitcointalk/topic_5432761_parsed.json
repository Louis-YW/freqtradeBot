What are you basing your calculations on? Or is this just some veiled shilling of some trx based real estate scam-platform?",

      "body": "Tron is now widely used due to its low fee through USDT transactions for having its own protocol. But looking at the real estate as you've mentioned it. I don't think that it is something else that someone should have been too excited about. I have seen many projects conveyed interests and focus on real estate but none of them really took place and became known with that niche of their project. It's not really going to work on that side if ever Tron or any project keeps working to the side of the real estate, it's better to leave it as good as it is.",
