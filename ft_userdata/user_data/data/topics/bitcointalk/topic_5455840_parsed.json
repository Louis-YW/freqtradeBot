Although if you're advanced user who don't mind some inconvenience, you can use airgapped computer/laptop which contain Bitcoin wallet software solely used to sign transaction.",

If anything, you should especially if you're holding a large amount, but you need understand that this type of attack could happen to you regardless of the wallet you're using if you're not careful.",

Even if you own a highly secure device, with your carelessness, the risk will still exist. But all 3 platforms you are using are insecure and unreliable. I mean, you are giving your assets to a 3rd party to control, they can get hacked or can get greedy and steal your assets. You do not have full ownership of your assets when using centralized platforms. Learn about non-custodial wallets, especially open source hardware wallets, which are considered the best solution today for our crypto assets. Where you have full control over your property and its safety is entirely up to you.",

For convenience and security, use open source wallets such as electrum wallet. If you have a mobile device, you can download Blue Wallet for IOS and Electrum for mobiles that support Android devices.

Well I understand  how ill  people speak of exchanges but at some points, I think these exchanges have stepped up their games and they don't just vanish with people's funds but rather with a notification  for closure and withdrawal of funds will be sent their customers.Why not just tell op to save up and buy a hard drive because I think all of them can be bridged no matter the security  used.I don't even enjoy using trust wallet  personally  and I wouldn't even suggest that for anyone and I will even prefer using binance because I feel secure using it.",

Since all 3 have been hacked before. The wallets you are currently using are not recommended.The best wallet to store your Bitcoin is either in an open source hardware wallet or in an air-gapped wallet, the only way your wallet can be hacked is if hackers compromise your wallet to steal your keys or your seed phrase, so storing them offline provides enough security. If your funds are not that big and you just need a wallet for spending, then run Electrum on your online device and keep the amount that is small in it. Choosing the right wallet is the first step to ensure you're not hacked, the other one is your operational security, even if you use an offline wallet, and you expose your seed phrase, your funds would be stolen, even if you use an offline wallet and you tell everyone about your BTC's, your funds can be stolen in a $5 wrench attack, etc, that is why your operational security must be good.Lastly, you can add extra layers of security like making your wallet a multi-sig one or adding a passphrase, this will increase the security of your funds.",

However, using a hardware wallet is generally considered much safer than a casual online wallet (hot wallet). This is because wallets connected to the internet have a higher risk of being compromised compared to cold wallets.For the OP, I recommend either getting a hardware wallet like Trezor or ColdCard or setting up an Electrum wallet on an air-gapped device for secure transactions, as already mentioned by ETFbitcoin. I think those options are the safest for now.",

Try to keep your wallet disconnect from the internet. That will make it more secure and that's how big exchanges store their currencies.",

Try asking google about it and you would get some information. FTX is a CEX like Binance and atomic wallet is a close source wallet like trust wallet. Now, back to the wallets.... Binance is an exchange and it uses a hot wallet while trust wallet is a non custodial close source wallet. Both are not recommendable in storing funds and you should move your assets to a hardware wallet like trezor, ledger, ellipal etc. but if you cannot afford a hardware wallet then you can download a non custodial open source wallet like electrum (only from the official website to be safe).",

You're wrong by storing Bitcoin on those platforms that you mentioned, some of them aren't wallets like Binance exchange therefore it's wrong to use them for storing of your coins. They might be convenient for you now but when they start getting attacks from hackers or the government and they eventually shutdown you'll regret storing coin on the exchange.Store your coins on non custodial wallets, store your coins on wallets that gives you complete control of your private keys and they don't keep backup. Non custodial wallets are the perfect for storing your Bitcoin. You don't have to be scared of hacks when you use one.",
