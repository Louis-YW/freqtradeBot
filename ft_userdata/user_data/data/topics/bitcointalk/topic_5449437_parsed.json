The liquidity of ETF is really great compared to physical gold, and that is a drawback that cannot be overcome.

Take a look at the mutual fund schemes, it's a tokenization of stock market. Check REIT, it's a tokenization of real estate projects. Both of these investment avenues offer fractional ownership of the underlying assets and are highly regulated. To catch up with the trend, we are seeing paper gold which also offers same facility. I personally think these are great ideas which effectively removes the entry barrier for a large amount of population. By the way, I personally invest in paper gold and have been doing it since last two years. Yes, it comes with a premium because banks earn on spreads. That's acceptable!",

The challenge would be the interaction and the way to incentivize people to deposit over-collateral, because gold does or have as much demand as stable coins have in the crypto space.",

Isn't it a scam that investors will trade virtual ETF tokens, but legally there will be no claims against the bank?In my opinion, the tokenization of real assets is possible only in the situation of a corresponding change in national (international) legislation.  A bank account, government bonds, the right to real estate, shares of public and non-public joint-stock companies, the right to own gold - the state protects the ownership of all these assets.  Tokens can also become such assets, but only if such a method of confirming the right to use, own and dispose of a real asset is recognized by the state.  If not, then the token is essentially worth nothing.  After all, a token is a virtual world asset, and its corresponding asset is a real world asset.  These are fundamentally different worlds... This is the genius of the idea of ​​Bitcoin - Bitcoin belongs entirely to the virtual world.  It is connected to the real world only through technical infrastructure (specialized computers and sources of electrical energy).",

If we bring a blockchain based system, in every transaction the gold storing person also gets some kick backs and certain portion goes to transaction approver.

Purchasing PAXG is free from settlement and credit risk.you can only redeem whole ouncesQuotePricingPAXG pricing reflects that of the underlying XAU spot price against USD in real time. Trades minimum size of 0.01 TOZ. you can trade using tokens at 0.01 coins(tokens) but remember only able to redeem whole physical ounces if you want them delivered to your homeQuoteCreationPAXG can be purchased with USD or unallocated gold. Both forms of payment are converted into allocated goldbars through an LBMA clearer and tokens are minted in relation to those specific bars. At any time PAXG holders can see the serial number, value and physical characteristics of their vaulted gold.each serial number in token matches serial number on ounce of physical goldQuoteRedemptionInstitutional investors can redeem PAXG for LBMA accredited Good Delivery gold bars, unallocated locoLondon gold, or for USD.you can ask for the official token to be 'burned' and get official physical gold delivered(LBMA) or trade your token on secondary market with someone wanting to buy it with their unallocated(not in vault) gold (p2p)QuoteCustodyCustody of the allocated gold backing PAXG is in LBMAvaults. A nationally ranking auditor attests to thematching supply of PAXG tokens and underlying goldassets every month.Custody of PAXG tokens is with Paxos Trust Company,LLC, a New York limited purpose trust company regulatedby The New York State Department of Financial Servicessilly thing about thisalthough LONDON has the LSE and fca and everything seems like its british. the paxos company are HQ in america with american licences and exchanges... not britishi will say this that LBMA has vaults in many countries. but having US regulations on a london vault/safe. is a mismatch of communication and jurisdiction",

For example, if you want to send 10 PAXG from one Ethereum address to another, and you want to ensure that the receiver gets at least 10 PAXG after fees, you should send at least 10.0020004001 PAXG total to cover the cost of the on-chain transaction fee. If you initiated a transfer of 10 PAXG, the receiver would get 9.998 PAXG after fees.Storage fees: Paxos does not charge gold storage fees to its customers at this time.Creation and Destruction fees: Whenever you buy or sell PAXG from your Paxos account (on either the wallet dashboard or PAX Gold pages), Paxos charges small fees to process both the creation and destruction of PAXG tokens (see fee schedule below). This includes all sales or conversions of PAX Gold to or from USD, gold bars or unallocated gold.These fees do not apply when purchasing & selling tokens through our exchange order book or anywhere else outside the Paxos wallet. If you wish to purchase or sell PAXG through our exchange order book your trades may be subject to applicable trading fees.https://paxos.com/paxgold/And what is the interest of the company that stores your gold?

However, the use of encryption can reduce this cost by enabling split ownership and real-time payments 24/7, as mentioned in the article.As for your concern about a legal claim against a bank, it should be noted that cryptography does not necessarily mean that an investor will not have a legal claim. Encryption can be implemented in a variety of ways, and the legal structure can prescribe the rights and obligations of investors and issuers. It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of any investment before deciding to make it.Overall, the tokenization of real assets like gold could provide new opportunities for investors to access these assets more efficiently and conveniently.
