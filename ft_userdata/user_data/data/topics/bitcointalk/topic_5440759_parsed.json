  "content": "Hello Everyone, It appears that some of the cardinals and penguin notes from 2019 were left unfunded. While this could be due not following up, it could also be an error on our end. Either way, any notes that should be funded, WILL be funded. I'll be back in England on March 8th, and will check the cold storage wallet designated for funding these notes. So far known: Northern Cardinal (66 pcs made)41 - ready to fund42 - listed as error note in spreadsheet, will verify 48 - ready to fund49 - ready to fundPlease post here if you find any of these two notes unfunded.",
