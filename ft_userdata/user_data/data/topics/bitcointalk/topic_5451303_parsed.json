  "content": "I don't really know if I should be making this post, since im just a junior member but I just decided to speak out.I noticed recently, most users who commit plagarisms are no longer banned from the forum, as this is one rule that most users tends to break. Is there something new that we should all be aware of, like a new rule added to that of plagarism? last I checked they haven't updated any rules lately. Â These days, users who plagarise no longer gets banned, but have the post deleted or all of their previous post deleted taking out their ranks as well. Is this supposed to be happening? With this whole idea of not banning plagarism users, they won't learn any lessons but will actually find a new way to continue with plagarism(ie paraphrasing or using Ai to answer questions and creating post.Some of these users have been reported by members of the forum but some of them seems to be ban immune, some how they have been given many chances by the moderators to correct their mistakes.Please if it's possible, I would love to hear from the moderators who are in charge of plagarism. if this post tends to offend anyone please moderators should kindly delete it. But I think it is a Matter we should all come together to discuss.QuoteI updated this post due to some latest information I got thanks to @chuckbuck",

Don't worry about fairness in this forum, it is great!",

      "body": "The rule is here and still in actively enforcement status but it has been less used than in the past.If it is no longer applied, you won't see forum members got banned permanently by plagiarism. Even so I understand your concern because I saw many people have same concern as yours and they raised it repeatedly.No official comment from staffs, global moderators and admins. I believe that there was change for that rule enforcement which is more keen on giving forum members more times to break that rule but still is not banned.",

      "body": "I don't think you should worry too much about this. If some accounts, being newbies, do not prohibit, then perhaps the moderators see in them the potential for growth and desire to learn more, but because of the ignorance of the forum, newcomers make mistakes. Lately, newbies have been given multiple attempts to learn the rules, stop copying, and start creating posts on their own.History shows that all beginners who never bother to read the rules are sent to the ban.But the worst thing for such accounts can happen later. They may rise in rank, but plagiarism in their history may be discovered later. And then the real drama will break out for them. I think moderators are wise educators.So, OP, leave the decision to the moderators; everything has its time.",
