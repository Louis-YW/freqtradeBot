So, honestly, I don't think that it is their intentions to come up with CBDC project (the pilot project) any soon. Maybe in future if the results are admirable but till then we just have to wait. And additionally the developer Pedro who found some loopholes in the solidity language using reverse engineering on ABI is the oy one there to point out as once other developers will join the auditing then it could gain some trust among people as one single developer might have biased decision but it is what it is. Means the flaws are in front of us and they (government) accepted it too.Well, lets see what will be the results of these test will be.",

Brazil intends to launch its digital currency by next year. The central bank is just testing its CBDC to ascertain its functionality. The crypto community in Brazil has raised concerns over the privacy issues the platform has. Regulators can freeze (unfreeze), reduce (add) balances and move funds from one address to another. The Central Bank might argue that these functions will promote safety, reduce fraud, and be effective in monitoring other financial operations. But the regulator also failed to state the circumstances that will lead to the freezing, reduction, and transfer of funds. This is a clear violation of the privacy of citizens because the central bank has total control of the wallets. These functions didn't come as a surprise that is why it is called central bank digital currency, it is centralized.",

From another tweet, it seems like they refer to \"current legal legislation\" as the basis for such actions. I'm not sure how broad that would be, but I believe we can safely assume reasons that usually led to bank accounts being frozen, etc would be used as one of its criteria. Stuff like money laundering etc is probably gonna be quoted so often in the future.",

This lack of transparency raises doubts about their intentions and makes it difficult for people to trust the system.Potential for abuse: Imagine if any entity authorized by the Central Bank can make significant changes to people's CBDC ledger. It opens the door for abuse of power, where someone could manipulate or control financial transactions without proper oversight. That's definitely a risk we shouldn't overlook.Limited user control: It's disheartening to think that external entities could have control over our wallets and financial transactions. We should have the freedom to access our funds without unexpected restrictions. This lack of user control could disrupt economic stability and negatively impact individuals' livelihoods.Uncertainty for economic actors: When businesses and investors can't predict how a financial system will operate, it creates uncertainty. If the CBDC's final version includes these control functions, it may deter economic actors from embracing the system, which can harm Brazil's economy in the long run.Though i think this is only a pilot project and this will not be accessible for the whole nation very soon but this initiative shows that it will happens in the future.Your concerns are understandable, but at the same time those are some of the concerns we always had about CBDCs, many people out there do not understand how dangerous they are as this means that now governments will have the power to silence any political enemy by just erasing, freezing or restricting the access to their funds, not only that they can block any transaction for any reason and treat your money as if it was theirs, and if the fiat system was already bad enough, a system based on CBDCs will basically destroy the freedoms humans have been fighting for thousands of years.",

Oh, wait. So you shared me this BCB releases pilot project and opens application for eligible participants news to show that the CBDC is publicly available?But i didn't meant to say they are not going to avail it for anyone, but for at least someone like they will choose the participant and then they will test it in a close environment. That's what i tries to said and that's also your shared news telling me. And, yeah the news of freezing funds either confirmed by your provided source of by the OP's provided source. The point is CBDC are centralized and they can freeze our assets if they see any illegal activity or even if they tag a transaction as illegal then your account will be freezing. In simple words, CBDC is nothing but a digital centralized bank using blockchain technology nothing less or nothing more.",

Brazil CBDC PilotThe government has the power to freeze funds in commercial banks suspected to be proceeds from crime, money laundering or to be used to fund terrorism. They also have the right to withdraw such funds because the commercial banking system is centralized. CBDCs are not different from fiat banking because they are still controlled by the central bank. The government will not just unilaterally freeze or withdraw from the accounts of citizens unless there is an allegation of financial malpractice. This is not a strategy to reduce people's funds but to control it.",

It is just a fiat payment system that seeks to promote faster transactions and bypassing of middlemen in payment systems. The service have been existing in Brazil, the United Kingdom, India, and some countries in Europe. Transactions that would have lasted for days to complete can be executed in minutes. The government is doing everything possible to give people options to focus on fiat transactions. They want to compete with the swiftness of bitcoin transactions, so they are creating alternative payment channels. Making FedNow transactions to be charge directly from the central bank bypassing some intermediaries is targeted at giving people the feeling of privacy. While the free service offered by FedNow is to compete with the relatively cheap transaction cryptocurrency.",

The API file(CBDCAccessControl.md) information suggests that they implemented the mechanism to fully control the system contract.The following is translated information from the file:QuoteIts main functionalities are:    Determine which wallets can send/receive     Control the papers from which address can issue/redeem/freeze a wallet balance.It is not an uncertainty a currency system that is governed and controlled by the government must have total control mechanisms in place. It would be insane and absurd if they did not have those mechanisms for control.",
