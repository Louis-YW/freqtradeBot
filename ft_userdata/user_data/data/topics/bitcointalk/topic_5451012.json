The cracks are now being exposed with the high inflation and the impact of Covid and the Russia vs Ukrainian war. The problem now will be to convince people that Bitcoin is a safe haven, because the volatility in the Bitcoin price.. has been one of the factors that kept institutional investors away from Bitcoin. It has only been a few years ago, when the Bitcoin price was $60 000+ .... now it is floating around $30 000.",

The greater the price swings - the greater the earning potential for those who can correctly identify trends.I don't think anything as young as Bitcoin can become a reliable store of value. It takes time. And if Bitcoin is to survive it will probably slowly evolve from a highly speculative asset into something closer to gold.It's worth noting that recently Bitcoin broke the correlation with stock markets, and if that's not just temporary, it could be a sign of changes in investors' perception.",
