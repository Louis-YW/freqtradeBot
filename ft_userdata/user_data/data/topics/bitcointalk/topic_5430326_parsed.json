Because there will be no new meaningful discussion. But we must not forget that the World Cup football has just ended. There will be different types of Â meaningful discussions and information about World Cup 2022.To those who asked to lock the thread I would point out that locking it after 2 weeks would have been very effective. But I think it is not very logical to close the football world cup thread and open \"After the world cup tournament\" again. Which is just changing the heading. Discussions that could be done in previous tropics. I wouldn't call it a conspiracy but those who are complaining need to think about it deeply. I hope that the moderators of the forum are also prudent enough to take appropriate decisions before considering the fact.",

Since the first one discussed the World Cup in general and this one is more focused, it was titled FIFA World Cup 2022 Group Stage Highlights to talk about the group stage, which some people find worthy of being okay. I changed the title of the thread to FIFA World Cup 2022 Discussion Thread because it started to get interesting as people started discussing more about the World Cup in general.Since the World Cup is over, I have no issue with the thread being closed or the moderators locking the thread. The thread's goal has been achieved, and it has been worthwhile while it has been going. I just verified that the moderators have now locked the thread, so everything is fine.",
