      "body": "What that start gambling addiction is not about people that do not understand probability. When I was addicted, I understood everything and how I can lose, but I want to earn and make daily income from gambling. I thought I was better and looking for ways to earn money from it, but at the end, it was not a good story at all and I had to quit gambling for a year. This makes me think that others that are addicted is because they want to make money from gambling, looking for different strategies to increase the probability to earn than lose as I did when I was addicted but still nothing worked out as planned but losing money frequently.",

It is something we do not need to go far to see, really, those biases are everywhere: when people do not share their bets because of superstition, when people do not want to change their seed in probably fair games because more superstition, when they use their favorite or lucky numbers to play lottery. I have even read threads here in the gambling section of people who still wonder whether these casinos casino games are really about chance/ luck or not. The answer for anyone should be obvious, otherwise they should read more about how gambling works.",

This is wrong if you ask me because I don't see consistency as addiction as addiction is easily misconstrued from negative perspective. Gambling addiction is supposed to be a situation whereby one is unable to control how much he gamble with and when to stop gambling. Anyone who does not fall into this category is not supposed to be regarded as an addict. Just so we are clear, there are people making legitimate income from gambling, far more than what people make from conventional jobs.",

The truth is always covered, gambling is above catching cruise and having fun although we can as well sees it as that but literarily people finds it as life game changer or life change where they continues to gamble and possibly hit a major target at this point they don't consider how much they lose but without knowing gradually they are sinking down into gambling addiction, whomever that can control greed can never develop a gambling addiction.",

      "body": "I ask: why do many people become addicted to beer? let's imagine that a person is president of a country, he has a work schedule that doesn't allow him to spend hours in a bar drinking beer with friends, he has many people around him cheering him on even if he does something stupid, the people around him side of him continued to praise him because they believe that by doing so he can give them a good job in some big company or some good position in the government that is much better than the position he currently occupies in the government, so the chances of the president becoming addicted to beer are very small. Why doesn't a very rich person who plays with a lot of money at the casino become addicted to gambling to the point of becoming bankrupt?In my opinion, the reason why very rich people who play with a lot of money in casinos don't go bankrupt and don't get addicted to gambling is due to the fact that they don't play for money, because they already earn a lot of money from the many businesses they do. they do, they have many other things to do in life every day, so that time when they are playing is one of the few times they find to play and even if they lose they know that they only have that time to play and they will not prolong it any longer. time for them to play because they need to do other things in life, like card, manage their business, work on a film or go have fun at a nightclub with women, so the chances of them becoming addicted are very small.but when a person lives in an environment with financial problems, lives in an environment where they constantly suffer a lot of criticism from relatives, friends and work colleagues, then the tendency of these people will be to play to earn money or play to spend more time on the computer or telephone and thus forget about the society that constantly criticizes them, consequently these people become addicted, the frustration, the pain lead people to always look for some refuge such as alcohol, drugs, sex and games and unfortunately this leads them to addiction and destruction",

      "body": "Gambling addiction doesn't start completely that way or isn't dependent on such analogy alone. They're multiple reasons why people can get addicted to gambling. Which may include; anxiety, loss of money, mental disorder etc. Why the analogy looks great is that it only helps us become responsible gamblers and why it's tagged as the reason to gambling addiction if not obeyed, is that when a person isn't responsible they'll become irresponsible. Generally speaking, gamblers are expected to follow such instruction to enjoy the fun of gambling. Although the strategy isn't certain if we'll win or not, but when we do not think about gambling as a form of making profits, we'll tend to win more. As our minds won't be racing on which decision to follow. Once the mind is at rest, our predictions become better than when in a hurry. A player that doesn't follow such strategy, can still control his emotions not to become addicted. He'll only play to win and end up becoming sad when he doesn't. Somehow it's bad to be sad over losing in gambling, which can also have a bad repercussion on the mental health of the gambler.",

People who successfully manage their happiness hormones will usually be very successful, all because they have complete control over themselves and their thoughts. that is the reason why risk management in gambling is important, wise people will not be intimidated by winning, they will definitely be more afraid when they keep winning because they are sure that the time will come when they lose.",

He feels there is chances he would win if he continues to wager and he keeps getting more addicted. Well I think the best is for automatic control of such from the casino base on some criteria like how much lost etc but like I said earlier, I doubt that would have yet except the regulatory agencies enforce that on them.",

Most times, the victims do not even take note of all these signs of addiction,  all they know is that they are happy playing and when they lose, it motivates them never to give up.Addiction can also set in when a gambler has no other job aside gambling.  No other hobby aside gambling. This can be disastrous as the gambler will channel all his time, attention and resources to gambling.  With time,  all he will think about will be gambling and there are every tendencies that he will become addicted to what he channels his mind to always. To avoid addiction,  every gambler needs to have other hobbies and jobs where they can channel their attention to too.",

Being rational means you are depending on your mind over your heart or emotion which is sometimes being disregarded in gambling. If you know to yourself that you have a tendency to lose, the that's emotion already; which pushed us towards this activity or industry in general.However, the tendency of getting addicted is dependent with the gambler, I agree. If you won't lose your sense of self control then you'd be fine crossing every bet.The simplest way to understand gambling addiction is knowing one's financial capacity and risk tolerance.",

When we gamble we feel fear, excitement, a loss is followed by depression, we feel tired, but the next day we often feel full of energy like we now have to work twice harder to make up for the loss. When we win it's euphoria, that feeling of accomplishment all gamblers look for. Not many people know that we can get that in many other ways, for instance by doing work that is visible, helps you and/or others. When you decide to remodel the house and it looks great, you show it to your friends and they want the same thing done at their places. That's when you feel appreciated, accomplished. There's so many ways to release dopamine, and you can quit gambling by doing something else that makes your body react the same way, like climbing a mountain or jumping with a parachute.",

That would mean everyone would be winning which is statistically impossible as it's a zero sum game and money has to come somewhere.And Andreas is spot on like always when we speak about probability. But this is an analogy for investing into scams, and addiction mechanics. And when we look at gambling from investment point of view, it obviously wouldn't make sense. Gambling however isn't investing and we can't assume that all people are in it to invest. Some of us are in it for pure thrill. It doesn't need to make perfect sense in terms of rational investing, as it's just one way to have fun. Some people invest with same mentality and that's what andreas is talking about. Investing for thrills is similiar to gambling. That's why people used to treat leverage trading as gambling and okcoin exchange was jokingly known as okcasino.",

Yes, you are playing for fun but we know that losing money is never been fun and this is where it would really be triggering up those kind of hopes and desperation on which it would really be derailing you into your primary approachtowards gambling.Addiction starts on the time that you would really be changing up your aims and goals specially if you are on verge on chasing up your losses or trying out to breakeven then this is where issues would really be starting. Some could be able to control and some are not and this is something that must be avoided in the first place.You should really be that sensible on whatever things that you are tending to get involved with.",
