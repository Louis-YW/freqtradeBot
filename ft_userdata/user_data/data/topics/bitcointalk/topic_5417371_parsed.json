  "content": "Sometime ago, I read on this forum how some parts of Pakistan were flooded. I never knew that some months later, I would be impacted by floods in my home country Nigeria. Recently, a neighbouring country released water from its dam and coupled with the heavy rainfall this year, many states were flooded. Houses, properties worth millions of dollars, and acres of farm land have submerged. Pitiably, a lot of lives have been lost. Sometimes, I blame the government. Sometimes, I want to blame the neighbouring country for releasing the water from its dam. There are times when I want to criticize the people of the affected states for building and living near waterways. But now it doesn't matter. People living in other regions of the country have felt the direct consequences of this. The whole region has been impacted and people transporting food, petrol and other essentials have either been delayed or canceled. I want to do something. And, I have been thinking real hard about how I as an individual can help ensure that this flooding doesn't recur. I do not mind writing a proposal to the government. I just need some ideas. How have you tackled flooding in your country? What works and what doesn't? Share your thoughts with me.Image source: thisdaylive",

The heavy rainfall was the cause of why they released the water. They wouldn't want to wait for the dam to break otherwise it will be more catastrophic.Old cities were never planned, it had just been created thru the accumulation of the residents its why cities have no flood control projects.Diverting the river I think will work because they can release the water from there slowly but it would be a huge project as well that would need billions too.",

Because just as you can't control the weather when it gets extreme, or this dam that has overflown and is causing chaos now, it's the same way writing proposals can't do anything. It would only serve as thrash in their offices, because just like @Oluwabtc noted, I don't think these government actually care about the plight of its citizens. It's one thing to make provisions for IDPs Incase an issue like this comes up and another to actually go straight to the source and stop it totally, because the more those in power are being less concerned about the state of its people, the more lives and properties are being lost.",

Little depends on ordinary people. We are all noble in our desires, and everyone understands that there are flaws when any disaster happens, but the trouble is that our complaints do not change anything. If everything happens as you describe, then it is not clear what the governing bodies are waiting for in order to prevent the recurrence of floods. Maybe those figures of human casualties do not impress them? It is unfortunate that in the 21st century, during the development of various technologies, a person can still not argue with natural disasters. And the leaders of these countries are engaged in a tug-of-war for power instead of properly organizing the security of their people.",

I'm sure the government has tried to deal with it, but that doesn't mean they can really avoid flooding quickly. Various solutions have been tried, but they all require cooperation between the local community and the local government. Because when they are not given facilities to dispose of their waste, this triggers them to ignore which waste should be burned and which organic can be stored as agricultural fertilizer. Well that's all the old story where the Flood from the dam has no proper drainage or clogged drains. No matter how big you submit a proposal to the government, in fact they will ignore it all. Apart from spending a lot of money, they make sure the money goes into their pockets before being distributed to the cleaning district.",

If really the political promises are implemented in Nigeria this flood issue has been deal with since but irony is the case always. The water (flood) can be stopped if only the government is ready to do it. They can produce tunnels and channel them to the sea or oceans from the Dams so that whenever the Dams are open the flood will straight to the sea not to the villages again.

Buy property on high ground and make sure you've got all the drainage sorted out correctly. Beyond that you cannot do much to withstand the elements - buy enough supplies to last you up to a month maybe, stuff that is dry but will give you all the necessary vitamins needed to wait out for things to return back to normal. Try to equip your home with things that are able to supply power, whether it is solar panels or a backup generator, they could prove invaluable in allowing you to access electricity while others are struggling just to survive. When buying a place, think about what the world is likely to be like in 10 or 20 years time, as it's rapidly changing right now.",

From the news,QuoteRecords indicate that Cameroon and Nigeria were  supposed to build two dams at inception, such that the Nigerian dam, known as Dasin Hausa dam which was to be in Adamawa State, would contain water released from the Lagdo Dam at any point in time.  Read more Completion and fulfillment of the agreement to build a dam would have saved us the current situation Nigeria is currently in with the flood. if you are searching for ideas on what to do, you can consider writing an open or closed letter to them urging them to complete the agreement and finish the dam.",

From an area that has never flooded, we have a huge floodplane built really low down so that when water levels rise or the rain falls particularly heavy, all that happens is a few extra fields get flooded. I think a tiered floodplane is one of the most efficient ways of dealing with flood water in this way (and having multiple troughs and areas of vegetation to take water away before you have to panic).Most river diversion plans are great though as it gives you an opportunity to build a deeper and wider trench that's much less susceptible to flooding surrounding areas and preventing the water from doing things like turning might also help to increase the flow of water away from properties without and increased risk of a bank breach.",

What works and what doesn't? Share your thoughts with me.Writing a proposal on how to tackle the flooding menace might not be a bad idea. It is possible that you might gather innovative ideas that would give birth to some uncommon solution to this challenge. But in this case, the government knows what to do but they have refused to do it. For me, the best option is to organize protests to show your dissatisfaction with the handling of the flooding disaster. This can attract the right attention that would make the government act fast. The national assembly is already discussing the matter in the parliament. But the main challenge now is how to assist the victims affected by this disaster. They need all the help and assistance for them to survive because most of them lost everything in this disaster. Most of them need food, water, clothing materials, medical care, and educational services. We must ensure we support them in any way we can.

We have funds to clear all this, we just lack good Political representative and governments. October has been bad one for us 2020 ( out brothers died during Endsars protest and now peeps loosing them live's with flood )The government knows exactly what to do but they decide not to do it. I heard that there were plans since the 1960s to construct a bigger dam that would have the capacity to hold the water released from the Cameronian dam and water would be released gradually to avoid flooding. But government prefers to abandon the project and channel its attention to looting the country's treasury. Some persons in some quarters also believed that there is also a tribal undertone for the abandonment of the dam project. The northern religion which houses the main ruling tribe of Fulanis and Hausas has never been affected by flooding due to the release of water from the neighboring countries' dams. It was mainly the coastal areas of the countries that suffers the impact. It has been alleged that the Fulani government that has been in power doesn't care about the solution to the problem even when various government environmental agencies have raised the alarm of flood this year. The government believes that it would not affect the northern region because of its geographical features. But this year's flooding didn't just affect only the southern zones it basically started from the north. The northern states are now suffering from the same flooding the southern part has been suffering for a long time. It is now that the government wants to become reactive instead of being protective when they had the opportunity.",
