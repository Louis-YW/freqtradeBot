  "content": "I have experienced some guys who are chronic gamblers making unimaginable predictions from football player's jersey numbers, basket ball, hockey, rugby etc jersey's numbers. I have experienced this and their prediction is only based on these numbers shown on TV sports analysis consistently and regularly.These chronic gamblers feel that when these jersey numbers keep flashing on your TV stations maybe during the sports news, analysing the jersey numbers on different clubs and display of the jersey numbers may be a sign that such number will appear as draw for the week and they do their permutations on that.This is for example what I'm saying with the jersey numbers not about the person but numbers precisely.The pictures are different and analysed differently for the week.Like 7,19Another week 10,7,17Another week 10,7,17,10 (probably 10 confirmation of banker   for this week)Another week 8,7,8,10 (probably 8 confirmation of banker for this week)Another week 16,15Another week 10So this particular guy in Nigeria around 5 years ago followed some Jersey numbers he has been monitoring for the week and according to him 3 of the numbers where consistently and regularly appearing on different TV stations for the week and he concluded some numbers and went to stake them 3/3 in the weekend draws and behold! When the matches were played all turned out draws and this guy cashed out from different pool shops where he did the stakings. It was a big winning story in the area alongside few guys he gave the numbers to try their luck.My question is, have you experienced this kind of gambling with Jersey numbers ?Note: The pictures are just to illustrate my point with the jersey not particular about who was wearing it and I didn't need to link any source because any jersey number will do or can be imagined, at most written with bare hands.",

It's unusual to see that there's this strategy that exists and if someone was able to win through this, well, it's amazing.",

This strategy like a natural marker has become the belief of the ancients in gambling, by looking at the date of an accident and then analysis it to be a bet.",

What do you mean the lucky numbers 7.10, 8 and so on.If what you are talking about is the type of lottery gambling, of course we will see that there are lots of people who put lottery numbers properly and correctly, generally it's all just a coincidence. For me it was just coincidence and luck, In my opinion, this type of lottery number bet is misleading, many people take the number trick as you said and there are many other ways they believe they can place the lottery, they don't care about cemeteries, they can even ask for animals and use them as a number guide.What is clear, I don't trust soccer player jersey numbers, for lottery bets and maybe that has never happened to me, even though those numbers often appear on TV screens and so on, I installed the lottery purely because the numbers that came out in my own brain were not guided by a football player, even though he is a top star.",

Seeing as this is the case of jersey numbers, I reckon the team themselves would be irrelevant. (Since other teams could have the same numbers and show it). Honestly, this is a really far-fetched method of connecting what you've seen to luck, It's really forced so I highly doubt a lot of people would've experienced it. I honestly think the story was just forced so it can be turned into content by journalists or whoever wrote the story, (or maybe even the person himself who did it). To answer though, nope, and probably never will. There's just no sense in it.",

This strategy is purely based on luck and most people that use this kind of bet style are those that doesn’t want to think hard for there bet. This is really a sign of a chronic gambling because you are betting without knowing well on what you are entering and just doing it for the sake of having a bet.A professional or normal gambler typically don’t place a bet on a match that he doesn’t understand or analyze well because of the fear of losing the money. Chronic gambler doesn’t have this fear already that’s why they can rely on superstitious for the sake of there bets.",

This is because in Nigeria, people have so many spiritual beliefs, so they could take it towards that betting angle.Personally, this is senseless gambling that just went in his favour. And if I may ask, how many matches has he used the method to win since then? Something like this is not feasible in persistent practice and could be seen among those that are very addicted and desperate for gambling. My advice for the person is to take things easy before it becomes unbearable for his mind.",

So I think this is something not of a strategy that I could rely on. But if it worjs to some people then it might be. Another thing is the kind of sportsbetting I engage with, most of the time; which us about winning team or player not some sort of number guessing.Quote from: m2017 on December 08, 2022, 01:50:38 PMI have never seen or experienced anything like it in my life.
