I've seen a similar scheme before, and I can't figure out why.Cash secured loans are used to prevent large losses and help businesses or individuals avoid bankruptcy. Not that anyone will go bankrupt on a 100 USD loan but that's why they exist, I am experimenting here and will keep this going for as long as I have enough data for one of the products we plan on offering to our private clients.Reasons why cash secured loans are a thing:1. Build credit 2. Better loans in the future3. Keeps collateral intact as it can be slowly paid back.It's easier when the collateral is used to slowly pay the loan in case of a failure where the original investment is lost. Collateral can also be topped up or stay intact while loan is slowly paid over a specified period of time. Hope this was clear.I don't know where you've seen this before but they probably had the same idea in mind.",

Escrow is available and I will add it to the topic like I did with my other one here (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396027.0). I don't expect people to send me their money with no escrow so thank you for reminding me. I'm using localcryptos as escrow but I'm willing to go through any reputable member of the community.As for the requirements, they will be edited in the very near future. I understand that as is, this isn't a working system. Thanks again DireWolf, I appreciate it.",

This is not a loan for me/us, this is a gift for you .If I need 100, obviously I don't have 200, because if I had 200 I would not need 100. Get it?Like I previously said, these type of loans are given to prevent business or individuals from going bankrupt. If you invest that money and lose it, what would work better for you, being able to pay it monthly in small increments or get a 1 million (example) dollar hit all at once?Read here for more: https://www.thebalance.com/cash-secured-loans-315598Topic will be edited, already have a plan in mind.",
