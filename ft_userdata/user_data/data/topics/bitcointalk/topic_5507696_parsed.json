Scammers would do all the methods they know since they are trying to catch the carelessness of people and take advantage with that situation then get something from them.",

This helps the user to easily and quickly identify each address without straining their eyes.",

      "body": "I do not see anything similar or look alike there. It is never possible that there would be similar wallets at the same time. This is likely the reasons why transactions are made into the wrong wallets as the ending and beginning looks or starts with the same alphabet or number. This is  also why the needs to always cross check wallet address before making any transaction so that one does not mistakenly send assets  to the wrong wallet thinking it is the real one they sent it to.So therefore, you did not find any twin wallet. If you check well in between the wallets address, you would notice the difference and that alone discredit and also disqualifies it from being a twin wallet and I believe the private keys are not same and would never be the same.",

      "body": "Yeah this is called address poisioning but its commonly only used under Ethereum or their L2 networks. Maybe its a issue with Solana also. Never had an address poisoning before on the bitcoin network. The way it works is as follows, you send a transaction to a specific address, and a few minutes later an similar transaction is send from your wallet, however it sends 0 ETH so due to the way the network is designed, it appears in the block explorer.You a few months later want to send to that same address, and you quickly copy the latest transaction because it looks similar and it ends up being the scammers address. This has been going around for 2 years now. If bitcoin fees are going to be super low, then I can see it happening on the bitcoin network also but it wont appear as a sent transaction because that bug doesnt work on the bitcoin network.",

Goodness me!!!Someone actually did that, sending an address accompanied with the private key…! That’s some genuine newbie thingy. Funny how a lot of them don’t make same mistakes, perhaps they learned before ever owning a wallet though.Wallets having similar starts or/and endings doesn’t make them twin wallets.Quote from: hugeblack on September 01, 2024, 03:20:42 AMThanks, I don't know how I missed @mocacinno's reply but it's a good example of stopping being lazy and double checking address before sending.At this point, it ain’t about being lazy but, being really ignorant.
