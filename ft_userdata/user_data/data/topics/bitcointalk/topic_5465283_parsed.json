      "body": "I think you are getting it wrong op, you earn merits not out of chance neither luck. Merits are earned when you make useful contributions to the forum. Don't worry about how much time it takes you to earn merits. Just do good things here on Bitcointalk like making posts in the boards where merits are possibly given, sharing your knowledge (without plagarising), and you'll definitely earn some merits. Many beginners have asked the same question in the past, but my answer remains the same. Quoteearning merits isn't super easy, but it's not terribly hard either. If you focus on your contributions and don't obsess over merits, they will come unexpectedly.I decided to give you one, to help motivate and encourage you into creating more quality post. With this you see that it isn't very hard just try. (I would have given earlier, but didn't have any s merits)",

Could this be your desire to join a campaign that is making you bothered or you are just generally concerned and feel your growt is slow here? Firstly, before you think of the side benefits like signature campaigns and all that, this is a space where information and ideas are shared so if you focus on getting merits alone, it'd push to keep creating threads that do not add content or value, rather it's only adding to your post count.Â When you make informative posts and being involved like @Nwada supplied, those merits will come in.

Let me ask you this question, do you feel any of your posts has been useful to the users that came across them. The answer is no and that's why you haven't been merited. Not trying to discourage you but how to get merits starts from the type of content that you're delivering. The more productive your posts get the higher the chances of your posts getting merited.QuoteConsidering my observation and what l have heard, it is a very vital requirement that is difficult to get. l want to ask about how someone can get merit, is it something that can be gotten through posting useful content, or is it something that can be gotten by chance or luck?Since your time on the forum, haven't you seen a posts that was merited, if you haven't seen one then probably you're posting on the wrong section of the forum that's always full of spammers which meriters tend to avoid reviewing those sections of the he forum because it usually a waste of time. Merit is vital that's why it isn't cheap and easy to get and be less concerned about merits you have in the last 120 days because it's going to take you alot of months before that should be paid attention to (merit in last 120 days is only important when you're looking for a signature campaign to join).",

If you contribute good information to the forum and at the same time members find your contribution worthy then they will appreciate that posts of yours with merits. The merits can be earned by those members only who actively contribute in this forum and they don't really care much about merits when the create posts. If you create posts solely to earn merits then I must tell you that you won't get any merits because the merits are only for the posts that are helpful to the other members of the forum. If you have enough knowledge about a certain aspect of a thing and you share your knowledge with other members in the forum of a thread or a reply to a current thread then you may get merited for sharing that information. You should go through the comments of other reputed members and you'll learn everything about the merit system. I recommend you to lock this thread because your question has been answered fully.",

So as long as youâ€™re not spamming and or trolling and you keep making constructive comments youâ€™ll surely be noticed one day and the merits will starts to flow in, like I said earlier no formulas for it.",

Both if you ask me.How much merit you receive is depending on the decision of the users (with sMerits) reading your posts, not you. So you need to make quality posts, initiate discussions and make meaningful comments in order to get their \"attention\" and earn your merits. This becomes easier if you have a local board too where you are active and there are merit sources in that local board.Hence dont bother too much about merit but on your quality of posts. Merits will come on their own when you least expect them and dont let this dishearten your involvement in the forum.",

You can also be lucky and receive merits by chance, but that is in a case where a merit source in the board where you have posted, just decides to distribute merits randomly to forum users there, but it does not always happen.

Considering my observation and what l have heard, it is a very vital requirement that is difficult to get. l want to ask about how someone can get merit, is it something that can be gotten through posting useful content, or is it something that can be gotten by chance or luck?No getting merits is not difficult unless you are not able to share some useful or valuable content here. For example, I am going to mention a thread here which I also recently found and once you will open any of the topics mentioned as in lists in that thread you will find the OP's of those topics have received a lot of merits even some got 100 or 200 and more too. Because they have shared valuable, real, and self-tested knowledge.Which is not just useful but also increases the trust of other people or members on them. Let's say if you have the potential or have great knowledge in any micro field of the big field of Crypto then start writing about it and those who will like it might appreciate your efforts with merits but that's not for sure.And you can rank easily and will be supported if you are active in your local board as I have seen a lot of local boards helping newbies to settle here even besides the merits you will learn a lot and earn a lot but you have to be eligible for that. And you can become eligible once you have the knowledge of experience. You can also earn by sharing useful content too which must not be as valuable as those in the threads. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364418.0",
