Fast forward a few years, and we have Proof-of-work rush in all different sorts of algorithms, all claiming to be the best of the best in security and mining. Joy.. were those days.. gone truly.. just one survived, and that is why it all began..bitcoin We are all now stuck with Idiots on twitter who dictate crypto decisions for us, constantly supporting proof-of-stake and stingy pow coins with mining rewards paid in nickels. Decentralized, Proof-Of-Work, High paying in mining rewards. I ask for time to help me build in return for one final taste of the good old days.The name is Berylbit. info - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5423044.0",
