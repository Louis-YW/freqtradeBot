So I am guessing since we didn’t have a -20% day then it’s not that important.It affects 0.5% of people. So it’s not major but you do wonder why it’s happening. Could be a bad sign if other exchanges start to do this also. FTX really messed up our industry with all their shenanigans.",

I simply believe this has nothing to do with any prob with Binance by any US agents if one exists. And as for SEC, they are saddled with the responsibility of protecting investors, but the stoppage of US bank wire transfers does not stop other wire transfers in alternative currencies. And the USD wire amount to only 0.01% binance flows, so it's nothing, especially when there are other USD transactions through other channels. It's just the USD wire transfer that would be affected in this light, all would have been affected if any probe applies in that regard.Still, there are some other Federal prosecutors after some American hedge fund's dealings with Binance. This might have some undertone but still not a strong reason to temporarily stop only wire transfers in USD.",

The only issue I have with this news is that Binance didn't give any reason for this suspension. They would have told their customers the reason but everyone is suspecting an SEC investigation. There are also speculations that it was because of the company's faceoff with a leading banking partner. But the number of customers affected according to the exchange firm is insignificant, maybe 0.01%. Most Binance operations are still available and this news only affects customers in the US.  I don't think it is a major threat.",

Binace works with people all around the world and not just USA, plus they work with dozens of coins and tokens, probably over a hundred of them too.So, when you say \"binance suspends withdrawal\", that sounds like they suspended for everyone and for everything, when in fact you can say \"technically\" you are right that they just suspended US dollar withdrawals for Americans, which makes the title \"sort of\" true but also misleading nevertheless. Try to pick better titles next time to make sure you do not fear people for no good reason at all.",

But they are saying it will be back in 8-12 days depending on the country. Things will be interesting in the coming days as to what sort of update they will announce.When it comes to SWIFT, it's always going to involve geopolitics conflict, therefore there will be changes soon. Binance will probably consider adding other finance messing besides SWIFT.",

FTX was in the same position as Binance, a heavily regulated US branch, a god knows what entity behind the international main branch, dealing with sponsorship on major events, attending senate hearings, and look how SBAFU the funds were!
