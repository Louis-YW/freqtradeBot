You do not need to use all your money to buy bitcoin at once, you can just use certain small amount to purchase bitcoin weekly. But I will still say buying now is good just like we said it before the FTX implosion that bitcoin decreased to $15400, but it is now over $21000 again.",

It is quite possible that neither in 2023, nor even in 2024, the price of the first cryptocurrency will exceed 50,000 US dollars.  However, if we consider the situation on the market from the point of view of a long-term investor, then buying Bitcoin at a price of $21,000 seems absolutely justified. In the future, the price of Bitcoin will rise, and the prudent investor will make good profits.  However, he may have to wait until the price of the asset exceeds $100,000.",

I was lucky enough to have gotten my self some btc in early December which makes me to be on a profit side already.

      "body": "If we look at the macro level - all the politician perspectives (Russia at war, stocks are going down, house market is going down...) we can all think yeah maybe institutions are starting to put their money into BTC, but I think that average price institutions are buying was at 16k and 32k approximately, this means - if the recession is here I think they want to close their positions at 32k, which means that at that level we can see a huge selloff. We have all already seen how quickly price can rise and fall on BTC. I think that cryptocurrencies are not yet a safe heaven for institutions. So in my opinion I am buying BTC and others, but I forget this money so I invest an amount I will not miss for about a few years.I think this is a bull trap. Nobody knows what will happen on the other side of the planet who will invest big and who will sell big at a particular time. Be aware and invest as much as you are comfortable.",

Similarly just because we broke one major resistance at $20k it doesn't mean we are in a bull run, the price simply corrected itself and went back up trying to get closer to a realistic value otherwise it still takes time to enter a bull market.So far the signals are positive though.",

Do you believe this is a bull trap or true recovery for next bull is now here?I would be interested to see what you people think and why. When looking at time through history for dips, then either now or this year is the time for Bitcoin to begin a gradual recovery from the dips it has experienced in the past year and I personally don't see this as a bull trap due to the recent uptick. occurs slowly usually will be more stable and stronger at the support level. So I assume 2023 is the Bitcoin recovery period before the next bull comes next year because I don't think it will come this year.",

So this might be the same scenario here, 2022 is one of the worst bear market, but maybe this 2023 we could see a recovery, not the bull run that we expecting, but at least a good $30k-$40k at the end of the year will not be that bad isn't it.In any case though, either bull trap or true recovery, I will advise you to continue to accumulate, the price is still very cheap today. Save and stack sats as much as you can and then we will see what will be the price in the next bull run, it could be a conservative $100k or higher. And that will be a huge profit for us if we start to pile up BTC thru DCA or any strategy that works for you.",

Regarding my prediction, I would say this is a price trap because I believe history will repeat itself and bitcoin will only increase when the halving occurs.",

Analyse yourself the market. If you see the past year patterns of Bitcoins, then this year Bitcoins are bound to go up. So yes there are high chances that BTC will go up this year. If you are waiting for more cheap price to buy the Bitcoins, then definitely you will miss the golden chance of acquiring Bitcoins. As seeing the current growth, I don’t think BTC will fall in price any soon. So if possible buy as many Bitcoins as you can now, and hold for 3-4 months. Then definitely you will see great profits in your wallet.",
