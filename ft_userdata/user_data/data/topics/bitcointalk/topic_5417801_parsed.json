  "content": "This isn't sponsored or paid post by Coingecko. I was just browsing and saw their post on their Facebook page and it hits me after reading it. A throwback Thursday and it's been a year already since bitcoin has reached $64K+ (actually $66k on CMC's chart as for checking it) and there's more to this price because this wasn't the highest. But considering this throwback and this price is closest to the ATH that we've made last year. I'm sure that many will reminisce that moment when you're about to sell but didn't because you think that the price will go higher until you were not able to sell and missed it. And also those that have bought at the top and then has to hold it until now or sold when it's a bit lower to cut losses.Well, just a reminder that it's been one year that has passed and there's going to be more to go and hopefully, we go back to that former price and even higher soon as we know a few years from now, halving is about to come.Source",

If 2021 was 15k we'd have an almost perfect rising curve with 19k today. Have confidence in bitcoin. People in 2015 and 2019 also had their regrets and hopes not knowing that they're so close to another high.",

Yes indeed time goes so fast that we often do not realize that the time has passed so long. That means we will also feel the same way when bitcoin reaches its ATH again. Perhaps we would say, \"it doesn't feel like the time has gone by when bitcoin has had such a deep decline\". This should motivate us that time is slow because today the market is not doing what we want. I believe if we are patient with eating we will not feel long in waiting for the bull market to come.",

But with how things are happening these days,it seems more and more countries are recognizing the potential of btc, making it as legal tender by small countries.Also, the adoption is further increasing because more merchants are integrating the crypto payment in their system.Just look at how many crypto casinos we have today. If there are no people patronizing it, they won't survive.So this year, we may have not seen an ATH, but the hope of recovering this market is high because of these circumstances.",

That's how greed works and hype. Everyone was happy during that time and they are always thinking that we will still go up but shit happens.So for now, I am curious why people not buying anymore despite of that all-time-high year ago, maybe they are still waiting for some good position or they will be aboard once that all-time-high breaks?
