      "body": "Why do you want to store it on a USB? There's quite a big risk to the drive if you do that and you likely don't gain much (if it's because you're using a shared PC, someone you're sharing with could accidentally download malware too not realising you're attempting to use it to store funds).You can buy crypto from many crypto exchanges and withdraw them to your wallet (places like coinbase and binance - look up where's popular in your country).If you really must use a USB stick, you can put a standalone/binary executable of electrum (from electrum.org) on one but make sure you write down your mnemonic before sending any funds to it (preferably multiple times) and keep both as secure as possible. Also, if you're new, the technology isn't too forgiving and transactions are irreversible so test it for a few transactions with small amounts if you can until you feel a bit more comfortable.Be aware of scams too and don't make investments that you haven't fully researched or don't need to (most newbies lose money, often to scams).",

But unfortunately, both of them require KYC to buy/sell anything.If you are not interested in KYC, I'd recommend you to try bisq, an open source, decentralized and non-kyc p2p exchange for buying and selling btc. You may follow the given youtube guide to learn more (its old but still helpful): https://youtu.be/4LyEKA5Iq9I Also, use a good hardware wallet instead to store your precious BTC.",

Just have a look around.I'm personally mostly using the Passport Batch 2. Definitely recommend against just using a USB flash drive.

Never store your seedphrase in your computer like in your mail or messenger.Once you generate enough money to keep a big chunk of BTC in your wallet, then you can opt to buy a hardware wallet. Most hardware wallets cost between 60-100$ depending on the country.",

Its not as easy to hack anyone's wallet as ppl assume. Unless you dont download a random malware or giveout your own seed to a phishing site (who give some fake promises to you) , you wont get hacked.

If you are going to hold bitcoins and add even more, doesn't matter frequently or occasionally, invest in HW!Otherwise, if you want to use it as hot wallet, you can even open an exchange account, for instance on Binance and activate 2FA for authorization, for adding crypto addresses into list and for making transactions.If your device gets hacked and you are afraid that someone will steal or even delete your crypto wallet and you don't think that you'll manage to safely keep private keys, then use exchanges but only as a hot wallet!Hot wallet means the one that is meant for frequent use and not for long-term holding.",

Make sure your storage solution is also suited in a longer term, not just for this moment in time.The cheapest recommendable hardware wallet is probably still the original Trezor Model One. Do keep in mind that it comes at the cost of being susceptible to hardware attacks, so make sure nobody gets access to it. On the other hand, such attacks aren't worth it for $500 or $1,000...General recommendation, since you seem to be new to this topic: operational security should be your best friend. If nobody knows about your BTC, nobody will go searching for it, either.Quote from: AllYourBitcoinRBelong2Us on February 21, 2023, 04:46:26 AMQuote from: Edwardard on February 21, 2023, 03:40:43 AMQuote from: AllYourBitcoinRBelong2Us on February 21, 2023, 03:28:28 AMYouch, I have under 550 dollars of btc and I want a cheap way to store my btc is there any cheap hardware wallets u recommend?Ah, so since your portfolio value is quite small, I would say you should better use a self-custodial wallet like electrumWhat if someone hacks my computer can they steal the btc?Yes.

If that's the case I suggest reading more on how to secure your seeds/private key/whatever you end up using later before you buy a hardware wallet or something similar. Those devices are not a shortcut to magically protect your BTC forever, you need to understand how to use them and their drawbacks. For example, even if you use a hardware wallet but store your seed on the cloud/unsecured computer, you can still lose money. If at the end of the day, you can only use your computer to store crypto for whatever reason, you should focus on increasing the security of your computer with better security practices. Quote from: Synchronice on February 21, 2023, 10:12:47 AMOtherwise, if you want to use it as hot wallet, you can even open an exchange account, for instance on Binance and activate 2FA for authorization, for adding crypto addresses into list and for making transactions.Please don't rely on an exchange to store your crypto. They are not invulnerable to hacks either. Not to mention you don't control the seeds/private key required to spend your coins, and they can ban/close your account anytime they wanted to. Don't allow another FTX or scam exchange to come again if you really want to own your BTC. Stop relying on a third party if you want to store your cryptocurrency. I'd say if you really need a hot wallet and you can't find an app that is flexible enough for your purpose then using a closed-source wallet is slightly better compared to using an exchange. That being said, you should move your funds/switch asap to an open-source wallet. CMIIW.",

The only way you can protect from computer being infected is with a hardware wallet that has a secure chip set. I will try to keep it simple for you but I think you meant hardware wallet when you said usb wallet. Hardware wallets connect over the usb cable but they are not normal usb. They are products that are developed to allow people to use their wallet online but without compromising their device with a normal usb you would compromise your usb as soon as you plug it into a infected computer with a hardware wallet it does not allow writing to the device and only allows reading but it has other features too. When you 1st use a hardware wallet you will create a seed which you need to back up physically and store it in a safe place. This can never touch a online device and should never be revealed to any one else. Keep this in your vault or safe deposit box at home. Then you will create a PIN number but this pin number is handled on the device. When you enter your pin you will not enter it on the device but on your computer it will pop up showing your buttons but the actual numbers will be obfuscated on your computer but will show on your hardware wallet. This is what stops people compromising your hardware wallet when your computer is compromised. Instead they just see you clicking blank buttons. When you enter the correct pin the hardware wallet will send a token to the computer without revealing your pin number but will tell it there was a successful pinHardware wallets should be stored safely at home because there has been examples of people breaking into hardware wallets when attacking physically but online and stored safely they are probably the best option for new people.",
