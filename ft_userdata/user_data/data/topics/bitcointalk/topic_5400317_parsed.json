If you sell computers, gadgets, other tools, web services etc., then it's reasonable to have customers willing to pay in bitcoin. Oppositely, if you're oriented towards people who may not have an idea of what's bitcoin, then they will simply not pay in bitcoin.Quote from: dvj33 on May 26, 2022, 06:17:03 PMEvery time that I've offered Bitcoin as the only payment method available I've ended up losing the customer.But, you shouldn't force them pay in bitcoin if they don't want to. If a person doesn't know what's bitcoin and is forced to use it, he'll probably just choose another store.",

It is normal OP in my opinion, don't get discouraged or begin to overthink the situation...as you mentioned that you just started, you haven't met all your customers yet, you are yet to met those who their preferred mode of payment is crypto.There are some other reasons why the customers you've had currently choose PayPal option for payment, and not necessarily because they perceive you as a scammer;- It is possible that they don't have crypto or are not conversant using crypto as a mode of payment. Many still view cryptocurrency as something strictly for investment (an investment scheme).",

The non-reversible side of Bitcoin is actually what intrigues a lot of people, and not just scammers to be clear. I'm sure a lot of us have been scammed via people charging back their payment, and usually when it comes to payment disputes, Paypal rule in the buyers favour. So, one of the issues with Bitcoin albeit a small one is normal small time business owners are going to find it difficult to get Bitcoin as a payment because they haven't established enough trust. Whereas, the bigger companies which are more established will probably benefit from Bitcoin due to the issue with chargebacks. I know some users here have commented about Amazon in the past, and how people used to abuse the system to get free stuff. That ends with Bitcoin, and protects them. Unfortunately, this means that the seller of the service/product technically has the power due to no chargebacks. That is understandably a draw back for many people, especially when dealing with less established sellers.",
