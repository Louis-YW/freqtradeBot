I don't know how someone will analyse rhe blockchain networks to find 100 BTC transaction in 2011 since trades on CEX is not broadcasted on the network.  The best you can do is to check which exchanges were operational in 2011 and those legally available in your country. When you find that out, try the forget password option and they will send you password recovery link to your email if you have account with them. Hopefully your BTC will be there.",

      "body": "The forum is great for peeking at the old days since threads that time are still alive and may serve a clue. But the thing is, if it's 2011, the exchange is highly likely to be defunct now with MIA owners or with no backup information from that time and could pose a problem when trying to prove you own what you claim to own. It's also safe to assume owners would prefer not to refund anything back. Recovery chances seems extremely low.",

Common, you were the one who bought the bitcoin on whatever exchange you claimed to, so how can someone else on this forum be able to tell you the exchange where you bought the coin?I think what you seek is not very possible. If you had transferred those coins to a self-custodial wallet, then it would have been easy to track the wallet, but you left the coin on that exchange, and even if it was sent to a different wallet, we cannot tell if it was your bitcoin because there could be other people, many people who bought 100 bitcoins that same period, and they could have sent them to some self-wallet too.",

Since you didn't even indicate which service it could be, it isn't straightforward for someone to investigate this for you.If the transaction dates from 2011, and currently there are not many currently active services/exchanges that date from that time. As one of the possibilities, you can try to reset the password on all exchanges from that time. For example, go to https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/ and check one by one which was registered on or before 2011.Another thing you can try is to at least find out what your address is. If you remember the exact amount of Bitcoin you had there and the approximate date when the transaction took place, look at this list List of all Bitcoin addresses ever used - weekly updates work again! Everything seems quite laborious and a lot of manual work, but if it is the amount you mention, it would be worth a try.",

From what you have written it seems like you used a centralized exchange to buy your coin; but the issue here now is “are they still operating?” If you don’t remember the name of the exchange you used i think it’s because it was not a popular one and might have closed down their service and that’s one issue you’re more likely to face. And since it’s a centralized exchange there’s nothing you can do to reclaim your coins back if it my speculation turns out to be true.Quote I’ve made a purchase using my credit card but it is impossible to get a bank statement for the year 2011 now.  There is no information about this purchase on my email also.  Does anybody have any idea how to find out what was the site and where the BTC now ?This is another dead end;Quote Maybe it is possible to analyse all the Bitcoin blockchain blocks for feb.-march.2011 and to select those who contains the sums near to 100 BTC ? And then  we can try to find the owner of the bitcoin adress where the funds were transfered to... Is it real ?You remember the popular phrase ”not your key, not your coin”? that’s what best explains this situation. It will be impossible to analyze the transaction since it was never made because you purchase it in your cex account and all that was displayed in your account were just number not real bitcoin so unless you moved it to your non-custodial wallet you won’t be able to get anything by analyzing the blockchain chain. And aside from that; if your come across a transaction with 100+ bitcoins it does not automatically mean that’s your transaction, there is a high probability of people transacting that amount since the value was not substantial back then so this is also another dead end. Quote The reward of 10 BTC will be distributed in case we find this BTC.This reward is quite enticing with the current price of 1BTC but until you come up with a better lead on this case I’m afraid nothing can be done for you.",
