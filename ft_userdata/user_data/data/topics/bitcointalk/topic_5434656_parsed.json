      "body": "If they direct you to exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, or other top exchanges in the market we can call it arbitrage but since this is a new exchange with no history of testimonials or reviews, we can then conclude that they indeed own or working on that exchange and this their platform to scam people.They are good at explaining things so even if you don't know about arbitrage they will teach you how to do it and how to make a profit from it, it sounds logical you buy low on one exchange and sell it on another exchange at a much higher price.Random people messaging you on telegram is not good, so you have to change the setting of your account so it cannot receive messages from random people.",

      "body": "It's common nowadays basically in the telegram. I get a personal message like every day from some strange people in the telegram. Most of the time comes with a female profile picture with a suitable message. But I don't give them a chance to increase the chat message somehow. Here are some ways how I try to be away from them:1. If they just come and share about any offer like OP I just delete the message and blocked them2. If they come with a female profile and with a suitable message, I open their profile and try to see their username. About 90% of the time they don't have any username. So I don't reply to them or delete them3. If I feel they are fake ,I just don't try to increase the chats.",

On whatever platform, ignore all of these warnings and refrain from downloading any files. Maintaining your security should come first because it is feasible for the virus to assault through the file. There are currently 2023 malware attempting to enter, so everything needs to be handled carefully and on guard.",

      "body": "After reading your post about the site, I had to go through the site myself but I am not really and truly convinced about the services. At first i noticed the registration process  looks like as just a way random scam sites do register just your email, password and verification codeI was reading the terms and conditions of Service here  chapter 3 (3.1) and I stumbled upon this. Do they mean before one can chat on the exchange platform one must have deposited up to a  five hundred dollars. That is what I really do not  understand. I think it will be nice they give insight on it. As a registered member of the exchange it is nice one have access to the chat box but it would be nice  they throw more light on this. This is not ok with me as I find it very awful to see that for one to chat, one must have had such amount deposited in their account. If it is possible to ask them, is the fund for chatting fee or what? How reliable is the exchange to say that they have such high benchmark for account holders to have deposited on their account with their exchange before chatting on their platform. Are they really serious about their exchange?Edit.......",
