Life on earth is short if you can't get it right, and life is hell if you're not living it right. I'm a spendthrift, so I always go beyond my monthly budget, and sometimes borrow from my investments which I repay the moment I get my money back anyways. So this goes to show that not only do you have to have a plan, you gotta follow it through as well because plans are just a rule for you to follow, and some rules could be broken. With that being said, it's inherently great to always plan your expenses as that is the first step towards effectively knowing how to budget, because at least now you where your money is coming from and where it's going to. Ultimately, the journey towards being financially literate in practice is a little arduous so the dedication is necessary to pull through.",

If you earn money easily, you'll have no feeling of keeping it properly and you'll just waste it in things that you want to enjoy. But if you've earned it hardly and you had exerted a lot of effort on it, you'll definitely choose to be wise on it. That's a lot of lesson to be learned for you and I am sure that if ever blessings comes again to you, you'll not waste it.",

I believe it will be difficult not to regret your spending if it cause you to lose money, things, houses, etc. Well, at the end of the day if you don't overspend every day I believe you can avoid the worst. Buying overpriced things really sucks, I hope it will get better for you if there are no alternatives.

I have never really stopped buying useless things, I see it as a form of appreciation for my achievements, as long as it's not excessive.As long as your investment is liquid, meaning you can sell it anytime, or at the very least it is not locked for months or years, that's good. If not, you should probably choose other options. What kind of useless things are you buying? Stickers? Statues? Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on March 06, 2023, 04:57:09 AM Better to keep some controlUnfortunately, that is the hardest part of finance management. Most people know you need to control your spending, but at the same time, they don't have good control over it. The best way to do it is to build a plan around your low control over your desire, don't do too much window shopping, etc.",
