Since the thread is not self-moderated I bet you're going to give moderators a lot of work reporting posts most especially those that are high-quality posts. That is by the way,  back to the discussion,  my ideal altcoin will be a coin that has a robust ecosystem that supports the liquidity of the coin to keep its price up for a long-term base,  and we already have a few of such altcoins in the market but since you said we should stay off mentioning projects name I will abide by that rule.",

      "body": "the ideal altcoin is created by a team way after they deliver a finished product that solves some problem for the community. which then starts to be used by a larger and larger base of people and only then starts to be monetized. Only when the product is ready and used by people, a token is created for it. A token whose economics are supported by the product, but not on the basis that the user of the product must own the token (like many projects do). In my opinion, this spoils the product because it increases the entry threshold for new users. The token economy should be supported by burning tokens for a portion of the product's profits.Product first, monetization and token second. We have hundreds of thousands of altcoins that first generate a token and then promise a product that they usually do not deliver. No wonder. The creator is paid in advance and is faced with the choice of working on the product for free or promising another product with the creation of a new token. This is why I personally never buy into a product's promise. product first, monetization second",

So you can do the mining and earn some revenue.  But the problem is there is no big ecosystem of proof of work altcoins. If you can build the dapp on the proof of work blockchains, that have more security than the other projects. Because it is a layer 1 project.Eg :1. Security2. Decentralization",

Any tokenomics will always come up with a better outcome as lonh as the security of the project is good and has a very high defense again potential breach. Also a good use case will do, revenue always comes aftet the product has been seen or effectively working in the community needs or aspect.Since we cant drop name in comparision Im sure there will be dispute about this topic regarding best altcoin traits.",

There will always be loopholes, flaws, and mistakes that will be found in the long run. I want something with high security and yet high privacy. See, wishful thinking. I want something with low transaction fees and yet faster transactions, almost instant. Another wishful thinking. So, how could a forum member answer this right if no comparison will be made? Like better than Bitcoin. Better than Ethereum or so on and forth. Comparisons make one project look better and that type of discussion has been used for a very long time because someone needs a basis to say their ideal altcoin.",

What we see with these projects is they always try to take over the past and established ones. Not knowingly, most of them are just the same and that's why an ideal altcoin is the one that unites all of these altcoins.

Something like a native token from a guild or company. Also, to have a powerful burning mechanism would be ideal, so we could get rid of excessive supply and price depreciation, allowing the token to work in a sustainable way on long term and building a positive reputation inside crypto market.",

Since it's decentralized, security isn't a big matter if the coin is already exist for a decade.

It must have no owners or devs or team behind it, or at least not after it was created because it is required to have a team to build it, but after it is built I want it to be decentralized.If there are devs that give you a roadmap to tell you what they will do with the token or the coin then it is not a good one, they should just create it and let it be and they would have as much power over it as we do. These two things are the most important to me because this already gets rid of %99.99 of the coins and tokens out there on the world today.",
