  "content": "According to research on online gambling behavior by GamblingAware,  slot gaming is more likely to cause problem gambling than sports betting and is heavily skewed towards the most deprived area.[1]Quote.Insight into Online Gambling LandscapeCarried out by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) in collaboration with Professor David Forrest and Professor Ian McHale from the University of Liverpool, Patterns of Play analyzed online gambling data between July 2018 and June 2019 from seven major operators and a total of 139,152 online gambling accounts across bingo, live and virtual casino games, poker, slots, and sports betting.The research sought to provide an insight into the online gambling landscape by answering four questions related to the basic patterns of play, the patterns’ variance for different types of people, patterns’ variance among different products, and types of behavior associated with problem gambling or at-risk gambling.The NatCen data showed that online bettors with the largest losses were men around 40 and coming from economically deprived areas, while women dominated online bingo with 62%, in slot games female participation represented around one-third of all, while in casino and poker, similar to online betting, women’s share was less than a quarter. More details about the research are here.[1]But Why are slots so addicting?In this article[2] we can read about the Psychology of Slots.  This tackles that slot machines is responsible for the greatest percentage of revenues in America's gambling capital in Las Vegas.  It also stated that the reason behind this success lies in our brain.Cognitive Dissonance – The Psychological Phenomenon That Helps Us Gamble.Just like how smokers disassociate from the well-known evidence that their smoking is killing them thru a psychological phenomenon called cognitive dissonance[3] Similarly, slot machines provoke cognitive dissonance amongst players. Quote Every licensed slot machine in a land-based casino or online has a Return to Player (RTP) percentage that players can easily access.This tells players on average, how much money they can expect to lose from every $100 spent wagering. Despite this figure proving to players that they will lose more than they win on average, people continue playing.In much the same way that the nicotine rush of a cigarette makes the risks seem worth it, the chances of a big win help gamblers forget that they will on average, lose more than they will win. Dopamine – The Brains Reward SystemWhenever we do something that our primitive brain finds to be good or beneficial, such as eating, procreating and exercising a neurotransmitter called Dopamine is released in our brains. This chemical messenger is synonymous with pleasure and when it is released, we can often feel a sense of euphoria.[2]Here are the factors stated on the article[2] why slots machine produce a high level of dopamine in our brain.Video in slots machines          Slots videos are designed to deliver great highs[4] and waves of euphoria to players.  Matching it with money rewards, huge amount of dopamine is released into the human brain.Association of slot machines  with the intense feeling of pleasure          This is the reason why continue playing slots machine even though they are losing, they keep on searching for the dopamine rush that a win can triggerDesigned to constantly offer small reward to keep players engaged          This is specifically designed to activate the reward system in our brain as we begin to associate slots with pleasure, we will likely continue playing.Interactive Controls – Increasing ControlSlot machines are designed for interactive controls.  This makes us feels that we are in control of every action we make thus giving us a sense of certainty ignoring the fact that winning and losing are really uncertain.Quote every time you push down on the ‘spin’ button on a physical slot machine or an online slot, you are taking control in a way that your brain views as positive. Each time you press the button, the visual whirlwind of colours and shapes in front of your eyes release Dopamine in your brain.No matter how many times you push the button, the same thing will happen, the reels on the slot will spin. This simple yet effective feedback loop boosts feelings of control amongst players which encourages them to ignore the uncertainty of winning or losing and play on for longer.Visual & Audio Cues – Making MemoriesAnother factor why slot machines is addicting is its Visual and Audio Cues.  Whenever we win something, it retains in our memory because of these factors.  The more winnings we got from slots, the more prominent it will be in our minds.  It is because of the visual and sound effects we witnessed every time we win.QuoteWins on a slot machine game are often followed by the sound of coins dropping from a height, flashing dollar signs on the screen and an array of flashing lights on the slot terminal. This makes a win on a slot a full-body experience that is not only intensely pleasurable and rewarding, but memorable too.When these wins become etched on your brain, your Dopamine reward system is more likely to be activated whenever you think of slot machines. This helps to keep even the most casual of gamblers interested in slots for a long time, potentially even years after spinning the reels.Summing up on  why Slots is very addictingSlot machines aren’t a trick, nor have they been designed to deceive you and appeal to your primitive brain. Rather they are enjoyable distractions designed part by intention and part by accident to engage you for as long as possible.[2]Add on:Gambling Problem Possible Solution/Avoidance:If ever you feel that you are in a borderline of being a compulsive gambler , you can refer on these list of link for ideas on how to deal with it.The 10 most successful ways of overcoming gambling urgesGambling Addiction and Problem GamblingHow to Help Someone With a Gambling ProblemHow to Stop Gambling: 7 Helpful TipsGambling - advice for family and friendsSources and references:[1] Research on Gambling Behavior Raised Red Flags around Slots[2] The Psychology of Slot Machine[3] Cognitive dissonance in tobacco smokers[4] How Video Gaming Could Improve Your Cognitive Health And SkillsA question to slots players out there, have you ever felt the uncontrollable urge to gamble after exposing yourself to slots games for a long period of time?  How did you manage to keep sane after being exposed to the most addictive gambling game in the industry?",

The problem of gambling is when someone is using large sum of money which is beyond his capability. It is not only slots that are addictive, all other gambling means are addictive. But what makes it most addictive are people that think they can make a living, earning, profit from gambling which will not be what will happen as the person continues gambling.",

Although in this topic you posted was too informative and helpful as well to everyone who are always in the gambling site. In fact, through this discussion you feed me about this things regarding  the cause of gambling problem. Now back to this question you asked, my answer is yes!

And then you become hook up to it and becoming your favorite even though you know the odds are really not going to be in your favor in the long run and it's based on pure luck.I don't know how I overcome it. maybe when I don't have money to gamble was the main reason. So at least I recover my insanity although from time to time I still play slots but not like those years and as I learn to control myself, I just gamble to have some fun.",

You'll crave for it, your brain will always look for that pleasure you're getting regardless of the game you are playing. Slots, well, they are the easiest game you can get your hands into, and also probably the easiest to get your hopes up for.

It pretty much applies to every game that is gambled on, be it Casino games or spots betting. The definitive nature of it is based on individual understanding, acceptance and liking towards a particular game to gamble upon. This is exactly how you get to build an addiction especially when you feel you know the game too well already and associate your trier frequencies to a win.Slots and many other Casino games might seem this way compared to sportsbetting due to, the timing and how many go you could go in hours over the games you are particulate about bit the same doenst go for sportsbetging and I say this without considering the virtual reality aspect of it. So yeah, it's pretty much every game in the gambling industry.",

It took me a while before I broke my habit and it started when I found a different hobby during my free time eventually it became a daily activity for me and it kept me busy so I have no time to start a gambling session. Even though we can be addicted to other games as well, I have to agree with the article as slot games definitely have the factors that trigger a lingering feeling to come back and play again.",

But since hit the jackpot isn't easy and you have limited bankroll, this make you want to keep deposit until you got it, you're thinking if you hit it, it can recover your losses.
