  "content": "What is happening with the Bitcoin network?mempoolThe last time Bitcoin Network got super congested was in April of 2021. When High priority transaction fee was $62 approximately. It was the same time when we were in Bull Run and the price of Bitcoin went to 64k. CMCAt the moment we are in the Bear Market so i assume we might see either a big low or we remain in the same phase or Bull Run is on the way. What do you guys think?",

      "body": "For the last few days now, I have experienced this high network fee. This time, I don't think it's as a result of the high transaction volume on Bitcoin; that's the increase in frequent movement, as it was on April 20, 2021, as you have mentioned. This high fee could be a result of the new NFT hype on the Bitcoin network. I can remember vividly that the high increase in the ETH gas fee was a result of an increase in demand for NFTs and a high increase in Defi projects. I believe this is also the case with Bitcoin, although Bitcoin is charged a transaction fee but not a gas fee since the NFT of anything has not started with Bitcoin. I can't recall experiencing any such high fees on the Bitcoin network.But the sweet thing here is that you can always customize your fee to the lowest that you can afford to pay, but you shouldn't expect to see your coin immediately. Whoever pays a higher fee gets their transaction executed first.",

What do you guys think?I was under the impression that markets were crushing causing people to panic sell or anything in those lines, and had to check price on preev, coindesk etc and  everything seems normal....But checking mempool again, average fees seem to have gone up if you want your transaction to be added to the next block and I can only speculate that this could be artificially done to gain better rewards by the miners.. Because there is nothing justifying the raise of the transaction fees. Just hoping miners are not shutting down or something in those lines that is putting so much load to cause the clog, currently over 400 thousand transactions pending...",

      "body": "The hick in Bitcoin transactions fees used to accompany a market dimension such as the bull market and when I studied the market in the last two weeks, the Bitcoin monopoly has been gravely congested the hick in fees has left many Bitcoin transactions unconfirmed most especially those the choose low fees and if you want your transaction to be broadcast easily then one need to choose high priority. We cant speculate what direction the price goes but then I will recommend that we all continue to hold more bitcoin, because there is a high possibility of seeing a bull run is around.",

      "body": "Bitcoin’s Frenzy of Activity Pushes Average Transaction Fee Over $7, Nearly 2-Year HighIt is because of BRC-20 tokens and low quality projects try to migrate their projects to Bitcoin blockchain that is a biggest chain and can be helpful for them to catch attention of token fans. Those tokens can be weak, low quality but from what you have seen on Ethereum blockchain, Binance Smart Chain and other chains with smart contracts, you will see the same with BRC-20 tokens.I guess it won't stop soon and the Bitcoin network, mempools will be more overloaded with those shit tokens.",

What do you guys think?So we either go up or down or sideways? Totally agree!You're analyzing this from the end result instead of looking at the cause, the previous cases of high fees per transaction were caused by a bull market or a span after the forks wars, it's not that high fees cause a bull market, it's the other way around. And since the price is quite flat in the last few days probably everyone is waiting before making a move, waiting for a sign those fees will have a bad effect on the price or for BTC to gain even more users due to the brc20 madness.

Hopefully the devs will remove that shitty idea called “ordinals” and bitcoin will become usable again. Otherwise this has the potential to kill bitcoin.  In the end one of the best selling points of bitcoin was its ability to make cheap transactions. If bitcoin can’t do that anymore than it will be useless for the average guy.",

Honestly the headache of these ordinals, we don't know how long we will deal with it.       We have no other options to avoid this but to still make the transaction especially if we are using electrum, there is no other choice to swap to another crypto. It would be okay if it was on an exchange and at least somehow it could be swapped to other coins that are lower than that.",
