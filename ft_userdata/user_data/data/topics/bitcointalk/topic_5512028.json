  "content": "I decide to go through my chrome as usual and today I happened to spot a news on my news feed page which sounded so awkward and lame. Well I wasn't too surprised to find a news like that on my feed though since it's still like a sign that bloggers are still at creating write ups like this that of course can mislead those who are bitcoin newbies. I didn't even bother clicking the link so I get redirected to some article that I believe isn't worth reading. Below is an image of the news caption.Bitcoin is built on a completely decentralised network which is something the government isn't mostly happy about since there is pretty much no central body in control to impose certain regulations and rules. This is pretty much the reason why Satoshi disappeared for so many years now since if he was around he would seem like a central body that the government could probably use as a medium to impose certain regulations on bitcoin. Satoshi disappeared since around late 2009 to 2010 which was shortly after he mined over about a million Bitcoins as speculated by most sources. What then would make any one think he'll appear all of a sudden?If Satoshi should appear all of a sudden, it would be bad for the bitcoin network and even the entire crypto ecosystem since bitcoin pretty much has an indirect effect on the whole crypto ecosystem. A couple of things that would happen if Satoshi should appear all of a sudden are;If Satoshi should appear all of a sudden, it already partially means good-bye to our dear decentralisation like I explained before, since the government can now have a central body to indirectly control the network.Secondly there would be an unfriendly shift in bitcoin price and also a general dip in the crypto space since the government would want to take control of the coins he mined ( picture the effect of moving about a million coins on the network)The bitcoin network would likely experience some changes that may not support discentralization coupled with the fact that Satoshi's appearance may cause vulnerabiliies to appear in bitcoin's protocol.Decentralisation is the key power and importance of the BITCOIN network over other crypto currency networks.I believe Satoshi wouldn't want to toss all the decentralisation  BITCOIN has built over a course of about 15 years now by appearing all of a sudden.",

He never proactively appears to put himself at risk of being arrested or killed.QuoteSecondly there would be an unfriendly shift in bitcoin price and also a general dip in the crypto space since the government would want to take control of the coins he mined ( picture the effect of moving about a million coins on the network)Satoshi Nakamoto can say, \"I lost these private keys\", and governments will have nothing to seize.QuoteThe bitcoin network would likely experience some changes that may not support discentralization coupled with the fact that Satoshi's appearance may cause vulnerabiliies to appear in bitcoin's protocol.It won't. Because Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin as a decentralized project so even the Bitcoin founder can not have a power to shut down Bitcoin blockchain or change Bitcoin protocol as a single entity, programmer.Your image attached is too big.Quote from: Mia Chloe on October 05, 2024, 05:12:31 AMCode:[img width=300]https://www.talkimg.com/images/2024/10/05/iJIFG.jpeg[/img]",

Just think about it, why would he reveal himself and risk getting into trouble?

Satoshi knows that if he tries to reveal his identity, it will be a suicide mission for him because the government will get him arrested. Putting everyone on confusion who is the real Satoshi, is the fun because the government has no one to hold responsible for giving people financial freedom.There have been a lot of claims by some persons to be Satoshi and I am not surprised if this is also coming up because bitcoin is currently a side attraction to everyone due to the potentials that it has.

Though even if he's around there will be decentralisation but this may highly be affected by sentiment.Exactly satoshi appearing now doesn’t mean the decentralized nature of bitcoin will gone, people do not know that the network is controlled by the node runners and that a consensus will be reached for any fork to happen. Look at even miners although there are few that censor transections most others still do not and this is decentralization. Bitcoin is even secure to the point that even a 51% attack will still not affect many things like censorship of transactions. I will say it is better that Satoshi remains hidden because of his own safety, many will say Vitalik is still around and I say because he didn’t develop the biggest threat to marginalization of the fiat currency. If satoshi surfaces today then his impact will be on market sentiment. Any comments directly from him will cause the Market to change sentiment, him investing into anything will be like an Alpha just like some Shitcoins use Vitalik to shill their projects most of the time",

Haha.We can't be certain if Satoshi is still alive, given his anonymity from the start. However, recent movements of large amounts of Bitcoin, especially those created during the Satoshi era, make sense to consider that it could be him, so he is alive. The Bitcoins associated with Satoshi are spread across different wallets, so pinpointing his exact holdings is nearly impossible, but speculation with some basis is always possible.I'm sure there have been many reports on this satoshi era wallets topic, but I'm sharing this one as a reference to support my point.https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/20/satoshi-era-wallets-move-16m-in-bitcoin-after-15-years-of-dormancy/",
