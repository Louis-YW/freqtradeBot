  "content": "Although I am a Bitcoin maximalist, I believe that you should diversify your savings as an additional security measure. It is also important to keep some savings in easily realised assets. Bitcoin is great as a long term hedge against inflation, but I don't cosider it to be an easily realised asset. Of course it is a simple matter to sell coins for cash, but its volatility means that it is important to time the sale. The law of maximum perversity states that when you need to sell Bitcoin, its price will be at its lowest ebb. Bank savings accounts can enable you to withdraw funds almost immediately, but the interest rates are low. In view of these facts I decided to purchase some UK National Savings premium bonds last December. These are government bonds that don't pay any interest, but the interest from all of the savers' bonds are placed in a prize pool, and prizes are awarded each month. The prizes range from £25 to £1,000,000. I won £50 in this month's draw, and the money will be paid into my bank account, and it is tax free. Now what should I do with the money? I could use it to buy more bonds, as the minimum purchase amount is only £25. Alternatively I could buy a few Satoshi, as I believe that we will see a sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin later this year, or perhaps early next year. The million pound prize is tempting, but so is the doubling or tripling of the Bitcoin price.",

Lets be realistic because investing that 50£ in cryptocurrencies isn’t really gonna help you tremendously. Go have fun outside and i bet that money will be worth much more than 1£ or 2£ profit you make in 6months on cryptocurrency.",

Although I do not invest in bonds, in this case, I would recommend continuing to invest in bonds. It is not only profit but also entertainment, creating fun for old age retirees like you. I think we can do anything as long as it makes us happiest. Both are not bad in your case.",

      "body": "When I know that I'll need some cash from my BTC over the next month or two, I sell a bit in advance when the price seems pretty good. That's what I do to avoid the 'law of maximum perversity'. Not all countries have reliable bonds you can buy to invest money, and some may require significant sums to invest. I bought a bit of military bonds of my country, but it was just to support my country (Ukraine) rather than as an investment. And once you buy it, you can't get your money back for a time specified in the bond contract (usually 6 months or up to a year), so it's not an easily realized asset in any way.As for £50, I liked humanvelocity's reply, but I can see that it's not really an option for you. It seems that this money won't make a big difference as an investment, so why not donate it to a good cause, perhaps? Or use it for an experience that you haven't tried or haven't done in a while? Like playing mini-golf, going to a cinema, trying VR. Something like that. I know of your age, so some of these options may be less appealing than others, but there are plenty of things that are worth trying once or doing occasionally.",

It is not proper to put your trust that an investment will get to a particular price but it is not wrong to expect it to increase more than 5 times. The truth is I am expecting my Bitcoin holding to multiply more than 10 times but my financial plans don't depend on my lofty expectations. @Jet Cash is an experienced Bitcoin maximalist and understands financial matters but I think he just wants to gamble with his fifty pounds and wants to get the response of members.   Quote from: Medusah on May 03, 2023, 10:21:51 AM50 pounds are nothing.  If you had won 50.000 we could talk.  If I had won 50 pounds, I would just take my family out for dinner. Fifty pounds is a whole lot of money if you invest it. If you take your family out ten times because you feel the money is irrelevant, you have just lost 500 pounds that would have been enough to invest based on your standard. Fifty pounds is enough to buy about  0.003 BTC which is someone's monthly salary in my country. Instead of spending that insignificant sum on luxury, it will be better to gamble it in Bitcoin.",

I think it is better if you use that £50 amount to buy bitcoin. At least, it will be surely that you will make the £50 to £100 at least because Bitcoin will reclaim its $69,000 all time high in next bull run. For higher price like $90,000 or $120,000, I am unsure but if it happens, you will make your £50 to £150 or £200.",
