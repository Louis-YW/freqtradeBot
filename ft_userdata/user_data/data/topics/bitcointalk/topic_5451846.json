I think this is the first time that I've seen them halting bitcoin withdrawals due to the network traffic aside from seeing that exchange like them suspends withdrawals during the bull run. Because even in the year of 2017 where it's known to be highly congested, there's not much issue like this of halting bitcoin transactions through exchanges but they've all adjusted the fees. So from this, that's probably the best decision that they can while working for some other things that shall benefit them.",

But anyone who wants to withdraw bitcoin can convert into another altcoin and withdraw it straightaway so that is not going to be a big issue at the moment in my opinion.",

They know that  even if this high gas fees is not their fault, users will still be pointing them in regards to how much is subtracted from the amount in withdrawing.However, not allowing to withdraw angers people still. It just show Binance is in control of your money and you can't do anything unless you withdraw your funds from exchanges.",

Just like Oshoshondi said,  this is a big lesson for those holding their Bitcoin in exchange, because the Bitcoin is in a personal wallet you could decide to pay higher fees and move on with the withdrawal in a situation that demands urgent Bitcoin withdrawal, but yeah this is binance a central exchange so not your keys, not you Bitcoin.",

I just think that whoever is always trusting to keep their funds in the centralized exchange is also agreeing to their terms and policies so that when any issues arise, they can bear the inconveniences that the CEX is going to be causing them. If I want to trade on a CEX, I only move my coin there; otherwise, I see it as a very risky thing to keep coins on exchanges when you are not using them. It's just like keeping our money in the bank, where they can do anything with your funds, like decide to give you conditions to follow before you can access your own money.",

They can pay higher fees to make transaction confirmed faster but this will only make the network congestion worst. Although, this is not the first time they did this decision and not the first time they were bashed from the community, they always do this when it comes a situation like this and in somewhat way it helps. As for the disadvantages, well, users are to be blamed first from using such services/platform, now that they are in it, so just go with it until they decided to open the withdrawals again.",
