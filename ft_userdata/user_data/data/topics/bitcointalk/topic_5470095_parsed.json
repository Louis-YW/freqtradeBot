Like the first poster said, it is possible that some sites pays people to talk good about them to deceive people that the casino is with good reputation. How do you use to judge a casino with good reputation? We have seen some casinos that were rated high that ended up scamming customers. I believe and  trust personal reviews from members  that has tested the site because they will give you the right feedback on their observation. I can see that a casino that has been tagged as a scam casino in this forum is on your list, this means that you don't know much about casino with good reputation. Welcome to the forum.",

I got curious to not see the big names we have here on this platform but rather a sc casino well known here with lots of complaints from members who got scammed by them and are yet to get their response before they stopped their campaign here went away. Their various accounts here have been tagged and flagged coupled with their promoters too. So why should you give them priority on your front page to be amongst the first 5 listed casino. Are you indirectly promoting a scam casino here?You can use the search engines for your information to see for yourself about the 1xbit.com casino you have listed on your website. I believe after seeing it you will know what to do immediately because of members here visit your website and finds it there you are automatically out of their list too.",

I was about to do the same, but I guess you beat me there. Good catch.Since they are giving that shady site a full 5 out of 5, then obviously there must be something fishy going on. I would dare to say that either 1xcrap paid for their reviews there to be effectivly good or perhaps this casino reviewing website may be just copy-pasting their reviews from other sources (which they did not take the time to check properly). Either way, I am still willing to the give the benefit of the doubt to any platform which show to have actual good intentions and comply with a minimum of a moral standard, so they won't misguide their visitors.I expect the 1xgarbage review to be corrected soon enough, if these guys are actual professionals as they claim.",

I never bother to take a look at their site,  since I already know what it looks like,  and what those and such projects are always up to,  thanks for confirming my suspension with this update of 1xbit having a 5 score rating on this platform.",

I haven't tried 1xBit yet but the other ones on the top list are legit. One particular thing that I like about the cryptocasinofinder site is their ability to criticize crypto casinos for different shortcomings rather than just writing super positive reviews.",

The quick facts tab is very useful to only show that details on the casino we want since it’s flood the whole review page once it’s explode on the main page along with the other details.What I just want to notify you for improvements is how the casino being scored. All of them has 5 star which doesn’t have any specific score. You should implement scoring system to come up with individual ratings and just provide criteria on your score system. It will be helpful if you will provide exclusive vouchers which users can’t get when they sign up regularly on the casino.",

Whomever does your research for you has failed you IMO. While 1xbit may have good bonuses, licenses, limits etc, they do not have a good record of processing withdrawals. They have been selectively scamming for years. The only reason they are still allowed on this forum is the fact that the forum does not get involved in scams. If they did, 1xbit would have been banned long ago. You run your site as you wish, but if you expect the people of the forum to give you a chance you might want to do better research and not publish reviews of scam sites. If they paid you to write a review and you knew they were a scam, then you're just as bad as they are. Not saying that's what happened here, but let's hope it's not the case.",
