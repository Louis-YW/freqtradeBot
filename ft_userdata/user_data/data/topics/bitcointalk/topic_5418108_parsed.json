Now, scouring the internet especially the crypto-based sites and forums can be a tedious process and if we have to join all that come our way then we need more than 24 hours a day for that. Sometimes I just realize that things actually boils down to luck...being at the right place at the right time. Good luck on finding the gems you are looking for.",

Solid crypto projects that have a great product but haven't really marketed themselves It's up to one's point of view, for me it might be a hidden gem but I'm not sure you'll like it, so finding hidden gems should be based on your own research. I will only give you one piece of advice; if you want to find hidden gems that are taking the market by storm, such as the apt, use Twitter to do your search. It can be said that all new projects, potential, information, most are updated and shared on it, must say twitter is the place for you to update and exploit the best market we have. Now there are also a number of potential projects evaluated that will be like aptoss that you will find on it.",

Solid crypto projects that have a great product but haven't really marketed themselves The big gems I know are BTC and ETH.  Honestly, there are many projects in this space that offer great profit opportunities, and everyone will have a different approach to them. Some of the low-cap and long-lived altcoins in this market, in my opinion, have some strong upside opportunities when the trend is uptrend, but the important thing right now, I believe, is to hold onto personal assets. I am waiting for an opportunity that I think might be safer. I have a view that 2023 will be a good time to invest, but DCA BTC ETH coins is still one of the ways that I have done it in recent years.",

Add in that it allows for a non-censored internet and you have one hell of a Diamond in the rough. Another more mainstream coin I like is Matic/Polygon. The amount of partners on metaverse projects they’ve managed to work with is in itself a pretty bullish sign. I think a lot of people will be using this chain in the future.",

And there can be another token which is average but has a great marketing behind it and it can be successful. A good marketer can sell you a bad product with good marketing skill, it is only when you have had the product that you realize that the product was not as good as the marketer made it to be, that is why extra caution is needed when searching for new projects to invest in. It is risky and you can easily make losses. The prices of some solid crypto projects are currently bearish, you can still profit by making your choice among the strong projects and buy, then wait for the market to be bullish. You can have more assurance with them to do well as the market gets better than with the very new projects that you are not certain of and may just be good projects from marketing.",

Do you take a look at GTN is another fastest blockchain 5.0, this is to tell you how smart and faster its. Then other thing you need to know about project is look at those with low Cap and newly launched by the time they get a higher market cap you would notice you have a gem maybe with might give you 30x to 50x in the next bill run.",

I'm more focused on large-cap tokens instead of gems.Because in my opinion, investing now in gems right now is pretty risky, to be honest/or i would say its gambling. Large caps with strong team and good use case like Ethereum and BNB have ability to survive this bear market on the other hand we cannot say the same about small cap tokens and we don't know if they have enough money to continue working on their project.

And that is the thing though, I mean you really need to have a good sense and skills on what or where to find this hidden gems. And it's really very different, you have to spend more time digging, and it's not a sure fire formula to find this gems. So there is also some element of luck to be able to give this projects that will give you that X amount of returns in the next bull run.",

Solid crypto projects that have a great product but haven't really marketed themselves It's very hard to find a project like this due to the existence of private investors in the form for Venture Capital. Usually good project looking for this angel investor to fund there project initial operating cost and marketing and just repaid them later on once the project succeed. VC only accepts quality projects which is the reason why hidden gems is only rare these days. Try to check old projects that still under development or lack of marketing like Neo, Kardiachain and many other blockchain that still have a very under value tokens.",

People may be holding it now because there are NFT sales vs pre-sales. There will be an unloading at some point. But the same conversations were made in the SOL, it went over 100 dollars, these things are never clear. I will just stay away.",

What it shows is that is a product is having its use case and solves a real problem, it will need the least marketing and be able to grow on its own.Then we have these shit coins that claim to be prepared hat not, but end up as a disappointment in the long run.So my hidden gem is never hidden because it is bitcoin bought at low price.",

Aside from Bitcoin, Ethereum and BNB, these coins have been showing good potential for years and survived the previous bearish seasons. We've seen how these coins went along with the price of other top coins during the bull market though XRP has been facing a lawsuit, it maintained a good value despite the market situation as well. So for me, buying these coins would be a good move as a preparation for the market recovery in the future.",
