Why are they not helping the blockchain and the cost of spending Bitcoin.Because of the question that you just asked and because of the wallet that still do not make segwit their default addresses. But over 95% transactions are segwit transactions.If there are many exchanges that still support legacy and nested segwit transactions, I think most noncustodial wallets are supporting segwit addresses by now, although not all.",

And the old ScriptSig fields for native segwit address outputs are cleared, wiped out. Since these exchanges are constructing transactions the old way, they cannot add witness data to transactions making it impossible to send to bc1 addresses.Nested segwit on the other hand (addresses starting with a 3) have their transaction outputs constructed by creating the witness data AND placing a standard P2SH script and signature in ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey respectively. That's how the old transaction format can still send bitcoins to nested segwit addresses even without witness data because the transaction will still be valid in the old format.",

While I haven't actively used a legacy address for years, I still have some coins on legacy addresses in the form of old paper wallets or old encrypted cold storage wallets. There is no point moving those coins to a new segwit address just for the sake of it, when they remain perfectly safe and secure where they are.When I finally come round to spending from those wallets, then I'll obviously direct any change to a segwit address, but in the meantime the coins can stay where they are. I'm sure there are plenty of people in similar situations with coins on old legacy wallets.",

Binance is supporting segwit which you also talked about. There are exchanges like Bybit, Huobi Global and many other ones that you will only see accounts with legacy address. You can not also use many those exchanges as example for the first question because you can send from their legacy address to other bitcoin address like legacy, compatible segwit and native segwit. I do not know of taproot address, but you can send to other addresses. I will say that is not laziness if an exchange only have legacy address, but allowing transfer to other addresses. But an exchange only allowed legacy address and do not allow sending to segwit, what should we call that?The exchange that I have used before that do not allow sending to segwit is this exchange which you can not tell people to use called Yobit, the exchange may be allowing sending to segwit now, but did not allow when I tried that in the past.As for Binance, I have been using it for over three or four years ago. If you want to withdraw, you will not see legacy or segwit, you will see bitcoin.Binance do not discriminate if you want to send from one address to another. I do not know of taproot address. It give the option to select either Bitcoin legacy or Bitcoin segwit if you want to deposit.The withdrawal fee for all the bitcoin addresses are the same on Binance.

My market cap will be $30 trillion!According to what I read, the coin is not just pegged in price, but collateralized, they bought bitcoin for it and they have it in their reserve. They reserve and mint the token which are altcoins. If they buy bitcoin and mint the same amount of token, that will increase bitcoin price and marketcap appropriately.But the problem is that many people do not know the main bitcoin from the fake ones on Binance and many other exchanges, they will think they have bitcoin, not knowing they have altcoins.

Just like you should avoid any exchange that overcharges you on withdrawals.I trade and I use many exchanges. Out of tens of exchanges that I have used, I still have five active ones which are Bybit, OKX, Kucoin, Binance and Huobi. I noticed how Binance manipulate to favour itself. Example is when Binance user deposit altcoin pegged with bitcoin and other coins on BEP20 chain, the confirmation is fast and you can use it to trade immediately olto open position in derivative market, unlike the main coins (not only bitcoin) which they can delay for almost 10, 20, 30 or more minutes, they do it for altcoins that can confirm almost instantly too, they delay them with many confirmations required and reaching certain confirmation before it is unlocked. The one that occurs to you people which are the fake bitcoin that you are talking about, it is more than that, but this is about bitcoin, I will not explain further. Out of all the exchanges, Binance manipulate the most and having what are centralized. It has its own stable coin which is BUSD, two chain which are BEP2 and BEP20. Traders traders just have to be wise for the wrong approach Binance is using, but the liquidity on the exchange is good. Other exchanges that I have mentioned too are good, they are my best pick before they started to make KYC compulsory one by one. This year alone, Bybit, OKX and Kucoin has made KYC mandatory.",

The answer is no. Remember their whole \"proof of reserves\" nonsense a few months ago which actually proved nothing at all? All but forgotten now. According to coinmarketcap: WBTC is also backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio via a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians, ensuring that its price is pegged to Bitcoin at all times and allows users to transfer liquidity between the BTC and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner. All to-be-converted BTC is held by a custodian, who takes part in the actual minting and burning of Ethereum-based tokens. When WBTCs are burned, the user can reclaim their BTC balance from the custodian. During mining, users send BTC to the custodian for storage and receive an equivalent in WBTC tokens. BitGo is the biggest custodian for Wrapped Bitcoin, and they will mine a certain number of WBTC and send them to the merchant's Ethereum address.The user who wants to swap between wBTC and BTC performs a trade — through a centralized exchange or atomic swap on a decentralized exchange — to move funds to the merchant. Once finalized, the user can use their BTC/wBTC as they see fit. If WBTC is converted to BTC, the associated Wrapped Bitcoin balance will be destroyed through a burn transaction.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wrapped-bitcoin/So, You are trusting Bitgo with your Bitcoin. It's the same as trusting an anonymous person online by giving them your private keys. There is no point in using Wrapped Bitcoin while the Original Bitcoin is in front of you. This does not make sense. Bitcoin fee is still tolerable even after the BRC-20 Craze.",
