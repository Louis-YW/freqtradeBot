Unfortunately, we tend to mix religion with politics, thereby creating religious supremacy that has complicated our plural society instead of making it better. I don't think religion has helped us so much in Nigeria, there are people even thinking that for the case of Nigeria, religion is being used as another form of colonialism because people are more loyal to their religion than their country and even humanity. What we need is total reorientation to enable us know that our greatest responsibility is to humanity. We can't continue to experience religious multiplicity when our humanity is depreciating.",

Religion never started from Nigeria but the way we use dey carry am for head e too much and sometimes due to say we dey blinded by this religion we dey miss out on so many benefits from the society and community.Of a truth, if we are capable of keeping this religions aside and regard ourselves first as human, there will be positive result from such a decision digging down to our economic sectorQuote from: Hewlet on November 22, 2023, 03:56:50 PMIf churches and mosque begin to talk about saving her offering in bitcoin or even receiving bitcoin as donation into the church or mosque wallet, e no go take time before most government parastetals go have a second thought on advocating for bitcoin adoption in the country..This one go hard for the aspect of Churches or Mosques to save her offerings as Bitcoin no easy cos this our churches are mostly headed by Elderly people and is very difficult for them to accept the use of Bitcoin and even when u try to teach they feel less concern and unwiling, talking about the stress of trading from Naira to Btc when dey can easily deposit the money in banks and make easy withdrawals when needed",

What we should all understand and know is that humanity is much greater than religion, without humanity, the point of religion has no meaning. People have been hiding under the shade of religion to destroy other people or a nation. No religion teaches violence or any negative impact to the society, if it was so, it won’t be a religion to be practiced in the first place. It his just time for people to begin to perceive as what it his in the society and act according to the teaching of the religions which they all promote positivity and no negativity in them.",

I believe most of this things wetting dey cause am na believe people choose to believe. Nowadays people choose to believe in general overseas (GO) more than God's word. Reason being the magic they parform. Wetting me I see they cause all this religious manipulation na this so-called men of God wey go acquired power, dey perform wounders, and those wounders Dem dey perform they blind fold Church members not to know the reality from fantasy. As head of any public organization I believe they get influence. wetting Dem talk dey always get recognition and people dey like follow am. And whenever these men declare must surely get inpact on the members either positive or negative. Na this thing  dey make people dey confuse about wetting Christianity be, and come dey creat the wrong impression say na oyibo man use Christianity decived us. Where as na we make an be like say Dem decive us. One thing about we 9ja people be say, we too dey over Doo things. I think say no be only Christianity oyibi bring come 9ja but also other things. But the only one people dey mostly emphasis on na Christianity. And I no blame them because Christianity talks about love, unity, peace and togetherness, now e come be like say wetting Dem talk na the opposite. But wetting on go understand be say in every 12 there is A Judah. And everything wey also dey happen na to accomplish the word of God. E get one church wey no dey drink medicine because there religion no parmit such. And this thing don cause most deaths of citizen base on what dey chose to believe. Some of this ducterine is no proposed by God, but Nan and due to man's ignorance not to understand the principle of life, they end up Choosing a part that can change their mental faculty all in the name of religion. So these things naim be the reason of religious discrimination. And Christians dey channel every problem to government not knowing say them too get a negative influence to the society also. Most churches don't turn to a place of defruading people in the name of Christianity. Tanishing the image of God.",

In the society we are now, so many people believe in what they are being thought in religious places and it would have helped us a lot had it been we all practice a single religion but since we have different religions and doctrine it is very difficult for everyone to agree together on something and achieve it but however, the commitment of individuals in their various religious beliefs is a good one.Quote from: Hewlet on November 22, 2023, 03:56:50 PM Apart from the fact say the government no accept Bitcoin for we country, you know say e get certain persons when no go still accept am even if it is approved by the government as long as there religious leaders kicks against it.

There's not an issue with the fact that one has a spiritual doctrine or not but as a people we should not always put in this doctrines in judging every random situation. In some cases, these doctrines are not needed but we tend to always involve them in all our endeavors.   We are such a set of religious people and are so bent to it that every affirmation contrary to our so called religious beliefs will pose a danger to our relationship with people around us thereby leading to conflicts that are unnecessary. We can live as a nation, putting aside every difference and lend a one voice. There ought to be no room for favouritism all because of spirituality whatsoever. We should be united in our dealings, that's actually what will give the beauty in our diversity.",

For example I have come across so many self acclaimed righteous people from different places and from other religious background yet it still doesn't change the fact that these individuals are people of questionable character that's why it is wrong to judge somebody based on their religious background but by their character they possess.",

If we consider the conventional way most churches use in saving there money for instance,  the people that are mostly assigned to take care of the money are mostly individual that are of good reputation and it's always on a rear occasion that you will notice that church funds has been stolen from the banks. If we also consider the part of computer illiteracy being much in the church, I think if you are careful to observe the structure of most churches, you will notice that there are lots of skilled individuals in the church and what most of the churches so is that they assign individual that are good in tye technical aspect of the church work into the technical unit while the ones that are computer literate are assigned mostly into tye media and secretary unit. If bitcoin is being accepted as a medium of making payment in the church/ mosque, it will only take some form sensitization to be done for tye members and the rest of the job would be handled by people that knows about bitcoin in thee church.",

So many things are messed up not really because of religionism but from the root of Nigeria as a country. Nigeria was never ment to be a country, it's the combination of different countries either 3 countries of 4 that are all ment to be on their own with their own believes that would have help Dem develop but the europeans used this three major religions to scatters us all, the hausas became muslims and can. ot help you except you are a Muslim, Christians the worst of it all they are even against themselves because of what one man of God (self acclaimed) has told them. different church different people. what a confused country this Europeans have created. Now looking a the religious practices in the country you will notice that if all the capitals spent in building this churches are spent on human capital development, china would not be compared to Nigeria in terms of productivity, dubai would not be compared to Nigeria in terms of beauty. For instance, imagine how many church we have in the country are all turned in to educational centers for children and adults to come learn how to produce anything that is produce able, build skills on each child and the ones that ment for school go to school, just imagine such thing and you will find out religion has rubbed us alot but we are so convinced (brainwashed) by our selfish men of God to only thing of how to put offering and sole seeds. In regards to Bitcoin adoption perhaps you have a good idea that can lead to Bitcoin adoption in Nigeria but how can they know about Bitcoin when they are business buying lands to build more church in an area where families can not feed properly but the church pastor will have 3 cars, oh what a finished country. In a church there will be pipe burn water but people who lacks water can not fetch it only ment to be catch by its members or their calibers, in mosques people who are Muslims are only allowed to fetch water from the pipe burn water in the environment. but all this I believe with the rate of awareness people will begin to look outside this and help one another to become successful country.",

I know say we don get so many scam wey dey pretend to stand by God, but that no mean say you go talk am like say na general thing. With my own self I don witness healing without taking drugs, but from prayer.The fact say Nigeria carry religion for head na good thing because, we no know wattin the future holds, serving our creator with joy and dedication na very sweet thing wey you your self go confirm the benefits korokoro, so no talk like that. Then for the case of woman and their husbands, even the bible talk am clear say the husband naim be the head of a woman no be anybody, so women Dem supposed to dey give their husband that maximumI no know why them go even bring religion matter come board sef, una they forget say this na general board all religion dey inside, una go just open mouth they talk wattin una brain just just think, they cast una self. No be only our own bad pass so make una stop am. Na so una take dey cast una house matter for outside? Tomorrow una go call una self christians yet una dey here dey talk una believe down. I am ashamed of people posts wey I read for here.",
