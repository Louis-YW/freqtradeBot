  "content": "Now that Apex (https://apexpl.io/) is 100% developed, documented an d released, ready to begin the next phase -- crypto related operations.  My business partner recently disappeared on me, hence currently looking for a new mutual partner who's good at marketing.  I'm a highly skilled and experienced back-end developer and have been involved within crypto since 2010 just a little after bitcoin came out.  I'm also creator of Apex at https://apexpl.io/ which allows me to rapidly develop and deploy quality online operations.At my peak was tech lead for a previous main client, and was responsible for developing and maintaining around 40 different bitcoin related operations.  Everything from web wallets, exchanges, mixers, escrow, debit cards, auction site, P2P exchange, HYIP, and much more.  He became filthy rich in the process.  I'm looking to replicate the same with someone.You may view the business plan I have for the crypto operations at:    Crypto / AI:  https://apexpl.io/Crypto_and_AI_Business_Plan.pdf  For more information on me to get a better idea, links below:Apex Business Plan: https://apexpl.io/Apex_Business_Plan.pdfApex Pitch Deck:  https://apexpl.io/Apex_Pitch_Deck.pdfResume: https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdfYoutube: https://youtube.com/@apexphpAlready have a fully featured general purpose bitcoin package at: https://code.apepxl.io/apex/bitcoinMonero package is 70% complete and can have that done within a week.  Have lots of Ethereum code floating around, but would need to be all consolidated into a nice, streamlined, portable package.Also have a coin mixer ready to go except the theme / design, and links to a demo are at:Homepage: https://mixer.envrin.com/Example Mixer Status:  https://mixer.envrin.com/status/mjovfd8qWzqMjiufnfg3tpu9mYbhoFCS1y Admin Panel:  https://mixer.envrin.com/admin/Investment needed for:* Marketing* Web Design (I'm blind, can't do it myself, but have an excellent guy)* Video Editor* Liquidity for the mixer and base exchanges, as they're quickest to get online and easiest to make profitable.In exchange, I'm thinking along the lines of 15% royalty paid monthly until you have realized a 50% ROI, then royalty drops to 3% in perpetuity.  If anyone is interested in this, drop me a line at matt@apexpl.io to discuss.Youtube:  https://youtube.com/@apexphp",
