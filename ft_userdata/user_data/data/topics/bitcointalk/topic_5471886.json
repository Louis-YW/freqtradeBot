Most of the exchange offer almost same low rate on Bitcoin. It’s not really worth it leaving your coins on exchange in exchange for a mere profit which you can easily have by just holding your Bitcoin safely on your non-custodial wallet.Some crypto casino offers much higher interest rate if you invest on their bankroll compared to exchange offers if you really decided to be exposed on risk.",

Investment in bitcoin? I doubt there is a platform like that but if there is surely its not that much % to gain on that since bitcoin is a PoW and not a staking coin. Maybe a deal to locked your bitcoin with such small interest. But for the sake of decentralized aspect, I doubt youll like it since its small and your tokens will be locked. If only bitcoin has a PoS structure and get a maximum reward but its not worth it if its the same just like that.",

Where were you during the fall of centralized lending platforms like BlockFi, Celsius, and the even bigger fall of FTX? If you are new I won't be surprised but you are an old investor in the market and even an old person on the forum. And it can be said that this forum is a community that hates centralized exchanges because it has too many risks and goes against the concept of decentralization that bitcoin has created for us.

Try to listen to people telling you here and its so risky to do that since we never know on when those exchange would provably the target of the attack or they became scam so better invest your bitcoin on other things that you know and make sure that you have the possession so that you will not get scam by those scammers.Better to hold your bitcoins rather than believing on monthly or yearly returns since you can make sure that your bitcoin is on safe condition. Also make sure that you hold your own keys so there's little risk that we might get compromise.Those keywords like \"Not your keys not your coins\" and \"be your own bank\" is great reminder for people not to take a investment risk on other platform which offer similar services.",

If you need option of where your coins will be secured, then you don’t need an exchange m, the best secured place to keep your coins is in your own private wallet, anything that moves from your private wallet to a centralized exchange then you are no longer secured. Better stop looking for where to get some APR and focus mainly on how to secure your coins, this comes with being cautious, avoid sites that promise high APR, people who look for ways to multiply their coins like you are the reason why scammers keep on developing money doubling sites in other to attract you to them.",

You don't need the help of any platform to start investing in Bitcoin, if you believe that the only way for you to start investing into Bitcoin is for someone to do it for you then find someone you trust, like a brother or life partner and save the money with them, until you are ready to DCA into Bitcoin.I know that some people find it hard to save money, they aren't lacking but they are not just good with saving money and investing, it is not in them from the start, I have someone who is like that and I helped him keep money for a while until he end up using the money for what he intended to use it for. Bitcoin isn't safe in the hands of any centralized exchange, stop looking for this as you can become a victim to scammers who could see you as vulnerable, Bitcoin is best saved in your crypto wallet, download Electrum wallet and write your recovery seed, keep it to yourself only and start buying some part of Bitcoin when you can, weekly of monthly, your choice but don't ever invest into Bitcoin through any centralized platform.",

Just like other people have commented already, not your key not your coin. My advise for you is to hold your bitcoin on a noncustodial wallet. Coldwallet if it is huge amount of money. The interest on those exchanges are very small and not worth the risk at all. If bitcoin bullrun starts, you will gain far more than their APR.",

Be careful of the exchanges or investment platforms that lure you with a fixed monthly income, because they are most likely going to scam you of your funds. I wouldn't trust any exchange with the safe keeping of my funds at the first place. Instead of relying on APY to make profit, why don't you just get a good wallet, be doing DCA gradually and hold unto your Bitcoin long term? That's more profiting as you can get to sell during the bull and make good returns of your investment.",

Centralized platforms are not safe, you don't have full control unless a third party controls them, avoid them and choose your own wallet which is much better.Investing in bitcoin is enough with a non-custodial wallet, I think every investor chooses this option rather than storing it on an exchange.Even if you want to profit from the APY offered by the exchange, it won't be much if you save it there, I don't really recommend it.",
