  "content": "The Florida governor portrayed his support of Bitcoin as a matter of civil liberties, and attempts to restrict crypto by his opponents as government overreach.“You have every right to do Bitcoin,” DeSantis said. “The only reason these people in Washington don’t like it is because they don’t control it.”“Bitcoin represents a threat to them,” DeSantis said. “They’re trying to regulate it out of existence.”DeSantis pledged that if Congress ever tried to institute a ban on “things like Bitcoin” by passing new legislation, that he would vehemently oppose it. He also said that the current administration could snuff out Bitcoin if Biden is reelected.“The current regime, clearly, they have it out for Bitcoin,” DeSantis said. “And if it continues for another four years, they’ll probably end up killing it.”https://decrypt.co/142306/ron-desantis-tells-elon-musk-bitcoin-will-die-if-joe-biden-is-reelected___These are beautiful words and an ingenious election campaign, maybe not everyone uses bitcoin, but everyone loves freedom.",

Sadly I expect one of the things his campaign will show is how few people actually care about bitcoin. And it will not be a correct measure for that either since, as I noticed he is exaggerating, other bitcoiners may see that too and might not care about a pretty much lost cause (i.e. DeSantis).But I was proven wrong in my predictions in other US presidential campaigns too, so take my words with a pinch of salt, just for case the reality will prove me wrong and will make me an interestingly nice surprise.",

I think it would be more accurate to say “And if it continues for another four years, they’ll probably end up ATTEMPTING TO killing it.”  I think bitcoin is passed the tipping point and while it might be more difficult if they tried to kill it, it wouldn't succeed.He is right about the desires of many the current politicians around the world to try to kill bitcoin because it interferes with their inflation loving agenda of Keynesian policy which allow them to steal from people's savings without the people being aware of it much of the time.  Until inflation hits and then they attempt to blame everything except their own policies for the issues.  Likewise, he is right about the wishes of authoritarians around the world to stop bitcoin because it robs them of victims by allowing people to protect themselves from insane policies.DeSantis has a financial war chest twice the size of Trump per an article I saw last month so I wouldn't count him out.  (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/28/desantis-trump-money-00094205 )",

It is fascinating that in most countries there are elections for the parliament or the president every 4 or 5 years, and that at that time the average person mostly forgets about all the promises made by politicians, and even less evaluates how many of these promises have been implemented.What everyone seems to forget is that the presidents in the US change, but the politics are always the same. No US president can publicly be pro-Bitcoin, because it would mean that he is actually against what the majority of Americans support, which is the US dollar. DeSantis is therefore completely irrelevant in the context of Bitcoin, like all his predecessors.",
