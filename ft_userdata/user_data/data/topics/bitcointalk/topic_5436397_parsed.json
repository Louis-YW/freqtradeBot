Want some examples? Paying taxes, office rent, fees for the accounting profissinal, social media staff, hiring employees to develop and help with the programming, after all we have a lot to create like a marketplace, a mobile app that is compatible with android and ios, building a swap, blockchain and game and other services that need to be outsourced.As you can see, there are many things to develop in the long term, logically, it is impossible for only 5 or 6 people to accomplish this alone. As the project grows, the more we must invest in qualified professionals to help us deliver what we set out to do.I hope we were able to answer your questions, and if you still have any questions, feel free to ask us. It will be a pleasure to answer them.Best Regards,Paycoin Solutions Ltd Team",

It is not fair to put our project on the same platter as other projects.Furthermore, the 10% of devs works as follows: if a dev wants to sell a part of his tokens he can only do so if authorized by the other devs.The % coming from the transaction fees serve minimally to remunerate the devs while they work on the project, after all, we intend to fully focus on the project and get out of our current jobs, but we all have family and bills to pay, so this small part would have this purpose, since we cannot dump our tokens on the market freely since this is in our contract between the devs to preserve the project and even the other devs.SincerelyPaycoin Solutions Ltd Team",

This authorization, it happens after the locking period --1 year-- or do you mean within that timeframe, if any dev wanted to liquidify their token, they could witho having to wait for the locking period if other devs agreed to it?Hi!You misunderstood.Dev tokens cannot be sold under any circumstances for at least 1 year.After one year, the dev that wants to sell part of its tokens must have authorization from all the other devs to do so, under penalty of being excluded from the project and the company.We developers are concerned about chart health and liquidity, we certainly won't dump the token because it would be the same as killing and burying the whole project.We will only think about selling some token if and only if it is highly profitable and not hurting the chart and its liquidity because even if we sell all our tokens, we still have 1% of the fees as profit distribution for us.Note that destroying the project by dumping the tokens would end that source of income, which would be a stupid thing to do.I hope I have cleared your doubts by answering this question honestly.Paycoin Solutions Ltd team",
