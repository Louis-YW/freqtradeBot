So I thought maybe it can also be used this way.For any users that verify staked bitcoin addresses, it would be great if we can also leave neutral feedback right after verifying the address. So if a scenario occurs that needs signing a message there will be another alternative on how to find the updated staked address by going to the user's feedback.Reference link will be the quoted message that it was verified.Comment will be the verified staked addressif the user stake a new btc address and a new user verified it, just add 'updated' on the comment.",

Anyone can easily view any user's address from this site https://ninjastic.space/",

If so, most of their their trust feedbacks will look like spam. Neutral feedbacks got some value as well.Quote from: Crypto-DesignService on January 26, 2023, 03:21:50 AMSo if a scenario occurs that needs signing a message there will be another alternative on how to find the updated staked address by going to the user's feedback.Searching them on ninjastic.space doesnt take much time anyway.",

      "body": "I think current method is already doing what needs to be done. Since it can be verified multiple times by different users by running the signed message, there is no point adding it in the trust feedback. Last time I suggested about  QR code embedding in the profile where user can insert QR for their btc address for ease of payment. It could have served the purpose of Valid Address associated with that account. However, it seems more of unwanted work rather than something fruitful for the forum. I realised perspective of ‚ÄúUSER‚Äù and ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù always has a different logical point of view. Sometimes it makes sense.",
