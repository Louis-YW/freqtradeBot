Other than that, a signed message from the public key of the genesis block could also work for the rest of this decade, and perhaps even a few years later than that. At some point in the far future, it can be reversed so it can't be treated as evidence forever. On the other hand, his PGP key is far more secure.",

Satoshi Nakamoto is the name of the creator of the crypto asset Bitcoin and not necessarily the truth of the name.there may be some people who actually know about it but are unwilling to publish the truth or the current whereabouts of Satoshi Nakamoto.do you believe that your statement for Satoshi proves its existence, because bitcoin is the highest value crypto asset and Satoshi himself still holds a large part of the total Bitcoin supply.wouldn't proving his existence create conflict and a threat to Satoshi.but we do not know what the purpose and intent of the creators of bitcoin never publish the truth and existence.",

Two things might happen. The market might crash because FUDs would start spreading. People might think that he is going to sell his coins and that will cause the market to tumble down. Or once he reveals his identity (which is going to  be a very big news), more people will be interested in bitcoin and cause the price to go up.I doubt he is hiding or is scared to reveal his identity. He chose not to in order to keep bitcoin truly decentralized. If he did reveal his identity, people would worship him and focus more on what he would say and less on the community.",

Are you an agent of the government or a Bitcoiner ? There are so many journalists around the world looking for Satoshi to publish a pending news. I have never heard that Police or government are looking for Satoshi ?  Some people thinks Satoshi is working for the government and central bank. If Satoshi is part of the government then I think government has no concern about him. But it Satoshi is a Japanese or some one else then do you think Governments are so foolish that they have no idea of who is Satoshi ?",

And now you are looking for satoshi to help your business.Why would anyone care for you?

How CSW can accused Satoshi ? What will be the outcome ? In that case, You Franky1 a British born educated person can advocate for Satoshi and find a good solicitor.
