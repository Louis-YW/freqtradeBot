  "content": "Crypto gambling website representatives: please DM so that I can send you my CV. I am only responding to respected crypto gambling representatives here. I have many remarkable academic accomplishments, and looking to make a deal in exchange for my provably fair system. Depending on the size and the reputation of your casino, I won’t ask for escrow and you’ll get to see my system before any payment is made. This is what I have to offer: I have a unique approach to implementing provably fair games. Unlike current methods, my approach significantly simplifies the implementation process. This results in a game system that requires minimal cryptography understanding from players, almost no coding skills, and only a brief time to comprehend and verify game outcomes. This approach can be applied to most provably fair games at this stage.Presently, average crypto users interested in playing provably fair games are required to navigate through approximately four pages of information https://stake.com/provably-fair/overview, possess a deep understanding of coding, and dedicate substantial effort to comprehending and validating the fairness of results. My proposed approach addresses these challenges and offers, as well, the following advantages:- Equally robust provably fair gameplay, ensuring the impossibility of cheating and enabling verification, with no trust required.-The explanations provided to players are presented in a half-page format, yet deliver the same value as the current four-page requirement.Other people who have useful comments might do so, but please refrain from trying to know how I get to implement the provably fair games this way because I am not saying anything nor giving any hints. Stories about people who passed through similar situations as mine are appreciated. Thank you!Edit 26/08/23: It is so hard to get to know legitimate emails where I can send my CV and a letter. If you know any, please post them below.Edited on 25/10/2023: I am only looking to make a deal for my system. I have previously stated that prior I should be hired as an advisor but I now think that’s irrelevant for the service I can offer.",

      "body": "provably fair games are okay as it is. They don't need to be improved upon or whatever. They basically speak for themselves even lol. While I think your idea is great and could see some use in the future once gambling becomes larger, I don't think the problem of \"cheating\" or whatever is a large-scale problem really. After all it's already randomized as it could get. Plus you could basically have it verify its validity. I think it all boils down on \"fixing what doesn't need to be fixed\". Provably fair is great as it is so I don't think this improvement is needed. Although with your skills, you're definitely going to come up with an awesome idea with real-life application that people will ponder upon for years to come. Keep at it brother.",

That's certainly possible. But it's also possible that, due to your lack of knowledge and expertise, you don't see the flaw in your system, and that's why nobody is using it. Cryptography is essential, and there's no alternative to it.It's a tough call whether you're onto something big or just missing a beat.",

Thank you!There is no solution that can beat the game system owned by a gambling site unless they themselves manage to give in.

My best bet is to be hired as an advisor, reveal my idea with some legal protection, and get some extra fee on the revenue generated after it is implemented. No doubt it is going to be implemented as it is much simpler to understand by the player and gives him more confidence he’s playing fair games.As I mentioned in the OP edit, it is so hard to get to know legitimate emails where I can send my CV and a letter.

Taking a great team to handle this is also ok, just make sure you understand the terms and also have your own terms to limit the casino and you can avoid them from selling your idea or work to other casinos without your approval, this term can serve as your protection.",

They’d rather profit from their biggest operator if they have to choose between small and big ones (if they have many casinos)I have gone through the whole thread and I really think that other members of the forum have guided you very well about the matter. I would like to say something that's different and maybe helpful for you. I don't think that any of those well known casinos will be willing to sign a legal contract with you because they're already okay with their version of the provably fair system and they don't want to spend any more money to someone else's system. Instead of pitching those casinos I recommend you to launch your own casino if you have the budget for that. If you can create your own casino then you don't need to ask others to test or implement your version of provably fair because you can implement that in your own casino games without someone else's permission and you may get appreciation from the gamblers if they found your version better and easily comprehensible. Other casinos may not pay you well for that system that you are giving them and that's why it's way better to own a casino yourself and implement the system in your own casino. That way you may earn better revenue from your research and others may get license from you if they want to implement it in their casinos.",
