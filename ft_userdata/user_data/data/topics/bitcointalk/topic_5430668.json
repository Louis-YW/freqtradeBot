  "content": "I just necroposted to an old thread in which Johnson Lau came up with a numbering system for satoshis, which I independently also came up with a decade later. I think it's worth giving its own thread, so I'll copy what I posted here:So, funny story, in the beginning of 2022, I came up with the exact same scheme discussed in this thread. After I finished the scheme, I realized that it was basically serial numbers for satoshis, typed \"satoshi serial numbers\" into Google, and found this post. It feels natural extension to bitcoin, so it makes sense that multiple people have come up with it over the years.I called it \"ordinal theory\" or \"ordinals\", because it uses order in multiple places: The order of satoshis in the supply of satoshis, for numbering The order of inputs and outputs of a transaction, for inheritance The order of transactions in a block, for inheritance of fees I've spent the last year implementing it, so just 10 years after the OP, you can finally try it out!The binary, written in Rust, is called ord, and the code is on GitHub at https://github.com/casey/ord.I has a bunch of functionality:Conversion between different, equivalent, notations, including the raw integer notation, block.offset notation, names, and degree notation, which is based on relation to difficulty adjustments and halvings.An index that connects to a Bitcoin Core node instance and tracks the location of all sats.An NFT implementation which embeds NFT content in Taproot witnesses, assigning them to the first sat of the first output of the transaction, \"inscribing\" that sat with contentA rarity system: common = not the sat of the block, uncommon = first sat of the block, rare = first sat after a difficulty adjustment, epic = first sat after a halving, legendary = first sat after a conjunction, which is the difficulty adjustment and the halving happening on the same block, which happens every 6 halvings, and mythic = first sat of genesis block.A naming system, which assigns unique names consisting of the letters a through z to each sat, basically base 26, but starting backwards, so that all short names aren't locked in the genesis block.A block explorer, with a signet instance hosted at https://signet.ordinals.com and a mainnet instance at https://ordinals.com. The block explorer supports search, try putting in different representations for a sat: 0, 0.0, satoshi, etc.A wallet, which can construct transactions to send particular sats and make and send inscriptions.Everything is open source, permissively licensed, and independently developed, so try it out and let me know what you think! Keep in mind that this is still very much alpha software. We're as careful as possible developing it, but it hasn't been audited and may have bugs",

      "body": "I understand that by 'naming' each and every satoshi in entire bitcoin network, you are trying to bring the 'collectible' feature to every satoshi. Basically, even 1mBTC got 100k satoshi which means what some celebrity 'held and sent' may not get the rarity grade due to massive in number.If it is all about \"tracking\" then doing that in bigger unit might be helpful.Probably I am not knowledgeable to realize this tagging each satoshi kind of concept with real world utilization.Anyway, congrats and good luck with your contribution to bitcoin devotees.",

      "body": "See, this is my confusion when it comes to units in Bitcoin, which led me to ask this question in this thread.What I found out from responses there is that inputs are all combined anyway before being transmitted out -- so how do you then keep track of satoshis when mixed with other inputs? It's easy to track inputs if always sent whole and never combined with other inputs, but once consolidated, does this mean you lose their \"serial\"?",

Now it seems that miners are giving core developers the finger and doing what they want. This is likely the result or prior said developer behavior and in my opinion is a must to restore balance to Bitcoin. I personally love it and think it is necessary.",

So, aside from the NFT nature of Ordinals, could there be any further use cases? How would this complicate transactions? I assume people would be hesitant to transact unless they have no valuable Ordinals? The idea of rare and more valuable Satoshis (in terms of NFT collections) has been going around a lot but I have yet to see any demand for them.... I could be mistaken...",

I could be mistaken...The demand is huge. Some have already gone for multiple BTC. The thing is there is no marketplace for them so most sales are being done P2P.To make up for this, some people have been depositing the Ordinals in an Emblem Vault where they are wrapped into an Ethereum ERC721 token. That way they can be sold on OpenSea. Sales there have been huge.Emblem Vault sales blew up in the last 24 hours. You can see what they were on average prior to yesterday. The action is largely thanks to a series called Bitcoin Punks, which is just Ethereum Punks set against an orange background.Crypto Twitter influencers got wind of it and Bitcoin Punks is now the latest NFT grift. No doubt after the pump is finished, prices will tank and the slowest among retail will be left holding the bag. None of that is rodarmor's fault, of course... just the way things go in this space.",

AFAIK the current Ordinals explorer only displays media files. So while I could inscribe a JSON file and attach it to an ordinal its contents wouldn't display on the explorer.Counterparty users are looking for a way to host the image data for their tokens as an inscription but its a matter of getting the xchain explorer ready to read it as part of a token description.One of the coolest experiments I've seen so far is called Rare Ordinals, where ordinals are being tokenized on Counterparty to leverage its market system (dispensers & DEX).I've heard a market for ordinals is in development.",
