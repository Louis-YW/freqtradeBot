There are hundreds of advanced European heavy industry that the world needs and imports, in addition to tourism, agriculture and banking services.But the problem with the euro is that many countries (including the European countries themselves) do not want it and want the dollar instead of it. Unfortunately, Europe is subject to the United States, and therefore they cannot bypass the dollar and adopt the euro as a base currency instead of the dollar.Europe is a great economic power, but it loses its role and power because it falls under American hegemony. I think that the United States exaggerates the Russian threat to Europe to keep Europe under its control.",

What I understand from the side of the exchange rate against any currency is not based on whether it is needed or not, it's the same with the Dollar which dominates the world and this currency has always been a necessity for the world economy. The euro is still the third largest currency and although their influence is not as strong as the dollar, the exact reason why the euro can't have a bigger impact is because they don't seek to rule the world, so their role can't affect the world economy.That's just my assumption and I don't know if it's relevant to what actually happened, because the euro is still the third largest currency and they should be easier to dominate the global economic market and maybe we often see euros used to buy football players though the currency is still seen from the dollar as a comparison",

It's the smaller countries that are more susceptible since their reserves are more in USD, their currencies will plunge and inflation also affects the daily lives of everyone.",

I am not bashing you i am just trying to understand the points you have made. Like why do you think that euro has nothing to provide others like why did you think it has no demand at all. Euro is still the second most currency after US dollars i think, well even i am wrong but Euro still has better potential then Japanese yen and Chinese currency. i prefer you to read this article for better understand of why i think that.

Even some countries with good resources are not doing well, their currency is devalued and still going down, it's not always about resources mate, there is more to this whole thing.

If the world geopolitical stance went against the U.S., this would not mean the end of oil. It would mean the end of the USD, and another reserve currency will take its place. Oil is just another commodity, and it is only under the tyranny of the U.S. due to its global dominance. One day, this might not be the case.As for GBP, it's worthless. Use-case being forex? Please. The country and the banks are the only vested interests. If a better currency existed over GBP and the country could use it, they would. Forex markets won't miss them either.China, well, they are much more powerful than we all think. So I won't undermine that currency other than the fact it is fiat, and subject to the same fate as what USD, EUR and GBP will inevitably face.Russia has a lot of gold. A lot. So at least their currency could be backed by a store of value commodity if they choose to.Quote from: Shortmaster on July 22, 2023, 08:38:24 PMBut when it come Europe there is nothing so euro value might fall very soon becouse world don't need euro and nobody dont want junk eu debt bonds really when times getting harder people want food and commodities and natural resources but europe don't provide nothing to the world so no demand for euro currency either.So If euro IS so useless what they might do with euro well they Will lower the rates and Will do super qe and print out Even more money and inflation in Europe Will go to Even much higher then it IS now.Euro Will be printed a lot probably and exvhanged by smarter guys in to usd or gbp before the collapse of euro currency.I Will sell most of my euro currency becouse i feel it Will start lose value fastest since no euro currency demand on the global markets.Off course this euro value falling Will create BIG debt and BIG buildings in Europe but at the end europe Will be pretty much like soviet union when the Money printing stops and they cant hide euro with junk bonds and dirty swaps anymore then euro currency holders Will be victims of hyperinflation becouse currency Will lose value so fast If there is no demand by other nations and countries.EUR is not the only fiat currency that fits into this bracket...and \"smart guys\" are already moving their money to better currencies than USD and GBP.

For example, the inflation rate is high in Europe too and in my place too. But the degree of high inflation depends if the people change their location. For example, if i have to earn in Euro then the inflation rate in my place will be dealt with easily.As 1 euro in here become 318 pkr and if i talk about the dollar then 1 us dollar here in my country equals to 286 pkr. So, from these numbers tell me why the amount of 1 dollar is lesser than 1 Euro. Because the euro is not in danger but every currency is. if we go back to when there was a debt ceiling, inflation, the next financial crisis, etc. fuds and problems are going on in the US then many said Dollar is in trouble. Even the BRICS formation also threatens the economies using dollars. Because they were going to degrade dollar. not Euro. Euro has its own marketplace while the dollar targets its own users so we should not consider the euro a troubled currency. But we might say the inflation rate is increasing. And to that, i agree.",

Also if I look at the financial data, multiple financial superpowers like Germany, France, Italy and Spain comes under the top 15 list where Euro is their main currency. So I am really not sure why do you think that Euro is not needed. It definitely has a very powerful place in the world economics. Also as icalical had correctly pointed out - you are forgetting about their tourism. The data shows that 538 million global tourists have travelled to Europe for vacation. So I am sure EURO is not going to go down anytime soon unless a nuke war happens.

Just like the US, European nations understand the world economy and they know how to manipulate it for their benefit.

Currently, the most profitable resources are humans and technology. These nations might not gave gold, silver, oil, and gas but they have the brainpower to maximize these resources because of their technological advancement. Currently the artificial intelligence, medical, IT, and electronic private sectors in Europe are far richer than most countries that boast of essential mineral resources.",
