  "content": "New Bitcoin ATMs are set to be installed in 59 Latino grocery stores around the United States. A bitcoin ATM is used to purchase and trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin using cash. More than 10,000 bitcoin machines have been placed in various locations around the US since it first became available in 2015. As its operation will appear safe and the same as using a regular ATM that they have been accustomed to for years, it looks more convenient and pleasant to be used with those who are new to cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin ATM brings a number of benefits to your company, including: 1. Standing out from other companies in terms of market competition 2. Increase revenue generation 3. Create space for more clients 4. Possibilities for marketing 5. Continuing the current financial vogue.",

This has been a major setback for most Bitcoin enthusiast who does not find it appealing to use Bitcoin ATMs under those conditions.",

Bitcoin ATMs provide a convenient and user-friendly way for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. This can help shops to stand out from their competitors and attract new clients as well. Additionally, the current financial vogue for cryptocurrencies means that Bitcoin ATMs can help these shops to generate additional revenue. By shops I mean companies that will install these ATMs(it only makes sense to install these ATMs at public places where people are in need of cash)",

How much are some of those guys getting paid to pump these tokens?Quote from: edgycorner on June 23, 2022, 09:48:59 PMRoger ver installed a few bitcoin cash ATMs in the Caribbean too. I know how this forum feels about roger Ver, but that was a smart step. Bitcoin ATMs provide a convenient and user-friendly way for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Roger Ver is a sorry piece of %$%# and he is not doing anything for BTC , I wouldn't be surprised if his ATMs would sell you fake bitcoins (BCH) instead of BTC.LE: Just as I was sayinghttps://beincrypto.com/roger-ver-unveils-ambiguous-very-first-bitcoin-cash-only-atm/",

It's not just in the US but hopefully, it will spread like wildfire to its nearby countries.And eventually, we'll see it on almost every country even they're few except those countries that don't like cryptocurrencies and has imposed a ban on it.",

How can Bitcoin and Shiba be combined??!!! Can't even compare, Shiba Shitcoin is very volatile so I don't know how it is accepted at the ATM with Bitcoin.",

To me the most important part is on how many % of fee the ATM charge. The ATM I know charge 8-10% and thats simply to much for a larger investment. Also there is many times a lot of KYC involved so you could for the same effort simply use an exchange.Why they include shiba inu is something that only they can understand",

I really want to try it and feel the sensation. I'm even looking for ways to use it.such as the following.how to buy atm in bitcoin1. Set up an account with an ATM operator.at this step you are required to create an ATM operator account before you can use the ATM machine. usually just by opening the id card or sim. quite easy steps.2. Enter the required wallet information.at this step you will be asked to enter your wallet information at the ATM, either via a QR code or an alphanumeric key.3. Enter cash.you just need to enter the cash you want to convert into bitcoin. The amount of money you enter and the amount of Bitcoin you will receive as an imbalance will be shown on the screen.Your Bitcoin wallet address and the amount to be sent will also appear. 4. Confirmation of purchase.Confirm your purchase details and hit the submit button. Once confirmed then the machine will issue the amount of Bitcoin that corresponds to your wallet. and it worked.these are the steps i read. please correct by people who have tried it. because I haven't tried it myself.",
