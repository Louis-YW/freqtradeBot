There are only a handful of cases where a weak key was used and it was revealed.I was going to say maybe OP can just get a list of all known broadcasted transactions and then deserialize them, but that does not include the nonce, which is supposed to be secret by design.Even if OP wanted to make up a bunch of values for the nonce, that is not possible because it is practically a 256-bit value so searching it is as pseudo-random as trying to find a private key.",
