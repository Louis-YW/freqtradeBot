So that some fool (yes they are really fools) people believe the man is really from the stake and click on the link instead of opening the email. Btw anyone from telegram like this can not be a legit person. So always avoid him and block them instantly.",

Telegram should take action in these fake and scam channels and account and should be permanently banned otherwise most of users will be fall victim of these scammers. Hacker's are very clever and they trying to use every way to get access of other funds and this kind of scamming is part of it We should forget this phrase \"\" Admin will never DM First\"\" . If any admin which looking 100% legit dm you first then it's 100% scam. Similarly those channel who add you without joining are scams and should be report spam instantly.",

The person who messaged you is a scammer who purchased the Telegram Premium service and paid $3.99 per month and got one of the premium features, which is a badge next to his name, which is an emoji of the verification mark. You find these scammers in abundance in all crypto groups, not only in the stake group, They send messages to investors and beginners in order to deceive them and steal their funds through a fake link or something like that, so we have to be careful and whoever sends messages to you first, block him because admins never send messages to people first, this is a rule followed to prevent fraud.",

Because this tempting offer will attract new gamblers and they may fall prey to such scams. This warning will make them more alert. Clicking on any unknown link is always risky, so gamblers should refrain from clicking any link from any unknown source. Scammers are now using different techniques to scam, now they are starting to use the stake.com name. Scammers will continue to use this technique in the coming days.",

They indirectly open opportunities for people to get scammed. The $4 subscription price is too affordable even for novice scammers.I think this thread deserves a move to the B&H board with a more general title, since the point of the topic is a warning about a company's fake telegram account with a verification emoji. There is a possibility that similar accounts with other company names will emerge.",

I am surprised that Scammers are started to buy Telegram Premium to make it look like they are real. Whatever, I don't know if stakes give you support Via Telegram because I am not a VIP there. But, I believe such casinos always send promos and other offers via email. Scammers send emails too. So, You have to be careful before you click on any link.",
