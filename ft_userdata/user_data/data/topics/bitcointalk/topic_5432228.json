You might move this one to service announcement board since this is related to a service not project development imo.Have a bitcointalk ANN thread link on the website for redirecting ppl to open discussion.And my query is how safe is your site?

The only information stored is that supplied when you create a link.Since the unlock address specified is your own, you don't need to trust us with your coins. The unlock process happens based on public blockchain data, and I believe this is the safest method possible for an unlock address.",

The link is unlocked for everyone who has it as soon as the address received amount is greater than or equal to the requested amount. Address reuse is considered dangerous, so a new address for each link is intended.",

Say you're an Onlyfans creator, and say you want to have users pay for content. It makes much more sense to have each user pay 0.0002BTC to a unique address, instead of having them pay a certain amount collectively.QuoteAddress reuse is considered dangerous, so a new address for each link is intended.Address reuse isn't dangerous, it's bad for privacy. But you're still doing it: when I set a larger amount than the address has received, your site tells me to pay the difference between that amount and the amount already sent to the address.You could ask the user for their master public key, which allows you to generate different addresses for each link request. To avoid a large \"gap\" in between addresses, you could for instance start over after the first 100 unused addresses.",

Say you're an Onlyfans creator, and say you want to have users pay for content. It makes much more sense to have each user pay 0.0002BTC to a unique address, instead of having them pay a certain amount collectively.The primary use case we have in mind is for a content creator one-on-one with a customer selling their completed work. It allows the simple flow from payment to the unlocking of content. That collective unlocking is possible is simply an interesting side-effect.Quote from: LoyceV on December 29, 2022, 09:03:27 AMAddress reuse isn't dangerous, it's bad for privacy.

We will consider further how selling the same content repeatedly could work, but we think some kind of account creation would be required for that use case, which is something we're trying to avoid for simplicity sake.",
