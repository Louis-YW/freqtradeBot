The first key is the order of G (the generator point) minus 1. And the other one is 1. What happens when you “multiply” 1 by G? You get G. Which is your pubkey  your pibkey there is the x only coordinate of the generator point of secp256k1Sounds like the author just constructed a pair of keys that collide, rather than taking a random public key and finding a collision through some algorithm, which would have been pretty bad. Basically this is just FUD to scare noobs.",

      "body": "This is not a collision, it is not the first time ever, nor is it in any way difficult to do. It is an inherent property of the secp256k1 curve that bitcoin uses. Taking the negation of any private key modulo n is the same as negating the resulting public key across the x axis. As such, the two private keys which OP has given, which are modular negations of each other, produce public keys with the same x coordinate but different y coordinates.Here's another pair:Code:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD036413Fwhich give the following two public keys:04c6047f9441ed7d6d3045406e95c07cd85c778e4b8cef3ca7abac09b95c709ee51ae168fea63dc339a3c58419466ceaeef7f632653266d0e1236431a950cfe52a04c6047f9441ed7d6d3045406e95c07cd85c778e4b8cef3ca7abac09b95c709ee5e51e970159c23cc65c3a7be6b99315110809cd9acd992f1edc9bce55af301705",
