  "content": "Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick has updated his previous Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction, now forecasting that BTC could reach $120,000 by the end of 2024.

      "body": "Ok, so he predicted $100 000 for 2023 and we are only at $37 000 now, with one month away from 2024. How does he expect people to take him seriously, if he thumb sucks price predictions like this? Yes, it might reach those prices, if the SEC approve the spot ETF application from BlackRock and if the Halving hype will drive up enough media awareness to push up the demand for bitcoins, but that is still not guaranteed. Let's just wait and see .....and hope for the best.",
