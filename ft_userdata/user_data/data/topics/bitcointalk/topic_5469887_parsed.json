  "content": "I was kinda wondering what would be this announcement from dedotfi project a security platform with such a huge noise these days. Now they set it off by launching a possible IDO anyone here would participate? Aside from potential airdrop which indeed confirm by them. This ido might represent an initial launch of them since they promised to do the tge as per their admin on socials this quarter 4 and we are already at that.Here is their website for everyons info or those who might be interested :https://de.fi/2.0They open up a 24hrs window with 2 choices of price. 2hrs since they opened they got around $300k out of $1m full investment and I think they can close that soon.Got some referral codes to use their platform just dm who anyone wanted one (might be a crtieria for their drop)",

I think the potential of this coin is good considering it focuses on the security and cross chain derivatives.I just dont like how they handle the community with the lack of transparent plan and future development.",
