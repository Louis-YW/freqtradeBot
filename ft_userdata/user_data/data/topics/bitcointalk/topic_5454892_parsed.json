  "content": "Bitcoin is dying, it is not surviving the NFT attack. The mempool is permanently clogged with ordnials, and the developers don't seem to have any resistance plans. Even here, at these forums, there a lot of trolls writing dozens of layers of abstract nonsense in support of ordinals and totally ignoring the fact that normal payments with bitcoin have become impossible, as simple as that.It's been a few months now, and there are no tiniest signs of recovery. That was it. I'm going to exchange my bitcoins to another cryptocurrency now. Since I am switching currencies anyway, I want to choose a good one, preferably eliminating the other problems bitcoin has (apart from ordinals), and not gaining more problems. I think I'm not the only one here who thinks about the same ideas, so I am creating this thread.Specifically, for me at least, \"a good currency\" means the following:1. Decentralization, at least the same level as bitcoin has.2. Open-source, preferably with a package available in one of the major linux distributions (this ensures at least some level of information safety).3. Privacy must be better than bitcoin has. Mixers are a very weak point of bitcoin, making a lot of centralization necessary.4. A strong anti-NFT position of developers. After switching currencies, I don't want to face the same problem I escaped from.My own research:I found 3 popular currencies that (apparently?) meet these criteria, more or less: dash, monero, and zcash. As for open-source, they all have sources available for download, but the only one I found in a major official repo was monero, in debian. On the other hand, monero still looks \"beta\" in the sense that the version number starts with 0, unlike with dash or zcash.Speaking of privacy, I see some contradictory information. Sometimes I see claims that monero offers better privacy, sometimes I see claims that monero \"mixes\" your transaction only with transfers of the same or similar amounts, while zcash \"mixes\" your transaction with many more others. Does anyone here know better or more precise details?Speaking of NFT, I could not find any specific information about dash or zcash. Monero seems to resist. It looks like they have limited \"the size of tx_extra\" (if I understand correctly, this is some kind of \"comments\" field, and this was what the NFT attackers used against bitcoin) to 1k (https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/8733), hoping that this will eliminate NFT.Any other opinions, advantages, or disadvantages of these 3 currencies?",

My point is that using privacy currencies has its own advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of using Privacy currencies is to help users protect privacy and secure transactions, especially when there are high security requirements. In addition, these currencies can help users avoid being tracked or monitored by other governments, organizations or individuals. However, using privacy currencies also has opposites such as the risk of using this money for illegal activities such as money laundering and illegal item trade. Privacy currencies can also be banned or restricted by governments or financial institutions and make currency conversion difficult for those who want to convert to mainstream cryptocurrencies. As such, on a case-by-case basis, the use of privacy currencies may or may not be appropriate, and the use of these currencies must comply with the law and strict regulatory requirements.",
