  "content": "I had this in my mind for a log time now (cca. 2018-2019). I remember someone told me that theymos appears in a documentary about Bitcoin, but I don't remember movie's name.All I remember is that it was (could have been?) one of the following titles:The Rise and Rise of BitcoinBanking On BitcoinDeep WebBitcoin: The End of Money As We Know ItMagic Money - The Bitcoin RevolutionBitcoin: Shape the FutureDoes anyone know which one is the movie starring theymos? Or, in case it's none of these movies, does anybody know a documentary where he appears?Thanks in advance.",

It's just I don't know about which one we were talking. And he said something like \"this documentary is even more interesting, as theymos also appears inside the footage\".And I am sure that it's one of those documentaries because I did not watch any other Bitcoin documentary excepting those ones (and I know that because I wrote their names down at some point). So it's one of them.I asked this question to avoid watching all six movies again, as it would take a lot of time (especially if, considering my infamous unluck, I'm sure that the movie where theymos appears will be the last one I'll watch from all those 6 documentaries).",

I remember this is the most recent I watched and it intrigued me the way it was filmed: is has a shadowy narrator, talking with a distorted voice, this being a hacker, if I remember well. At some point he describes how he made \"his first sack of money\" or something like that. And it was even more interesting, as it was the only Japanese documentary about Bitcoin. Maybe this is the one I talked about with my friend... However, I can not be sure. But if nobody knows, if nobody actually watched these documentaries, then I guess I'll have to watch them all again, one by one. But I'll start with this one.",

I hope this documentaries featured bitcointalk because I think the forum needs more exposure.Hehe, I just realized now that, while trying to find a movie starring theymos, I also shared some very interesting materials for those interested about Bitcoin at large. I can grant you, all documentaries are worth watching. If I may suggest you, I'd recommend to start with Bitcoin: Shape the Future, continue with The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, then Deep Web. Then you can pick the rest in any order you wish If you are so interested in such materials, I can also recommend you some more movies / documentaries, these ones being about Ross Ulbricht, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden. Again, all are worth watching.Silk Road Case - The Real, Untold Story - documentary about the injustice suffered by Ross Ulbricht during Silk Road trialIthaka - a documentary showing Julian's struggle to avoid extradition to USMediastan: A Wikileaks Road Movie - a WikiLeaks very own documentary - full movieRisk - a WikiLeaks documentary, directed by Laura Poitras (a friend of Julian Assange) - full movieThe Fifth Estate - a great movie about WikiLeaksWe Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks - yet another documentary about WikiLeaksUnderground: The Julian Assange Story - another movie about Julian, depicting his early careerCitizenfour - documentary about Snowden, starring himselfSnowden - fiction movie about Snowden, starring Joseph Gordon-LevittI hope this helps.Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 20, 2023, 08:55:32 PMQuote from: GazetaBitcoin on February 20, 2023, 06:23:07 PMNow instead of talking about documentaries I have to talk about (denying) doxxing.

And this can easily end up with doxxing.Oh well, that makes sense a bit. I did not think about that...In any case, I believe that if theymos actually had a - how is it called? - cameo ( ) inside a movie, he appeared with his nym, not with his name. I am sure that from all those which ever heard about theymos, 99% know only the nym theymos and maybe (only maybe!) 1% know his name. And that 1% may be a big number. Most likely, if you'd tell his name to those knowing the nym theymos, they will just nod their heads, without understanding about who you are talking.Following this idea, I am also certain that, if theymos ever appeared in a documentary (after all, my friend could have been wrong, leading me to live with this impression in vain), then he appeared in credits as theymos. If his name were there nobody would know who is the one they watched, lol (or almost nobody).",
