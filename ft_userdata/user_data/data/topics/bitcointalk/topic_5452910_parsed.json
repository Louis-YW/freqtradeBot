Some hot wallets need to be updated to fit in the current demand as relate to transactions,  not only in casino but even some exchanges have fixed fees that are relatively higher than the regular blockchain fees,  and these fees charges regardless of network conditions make it hard to use some of that platform so best practices are. Always check the withdrawal fees before making your first deposit, and be sure of what amount you pay for fees at the point of withdrawal.",

Can you mention the casinos that you saw high withdraw for altcoins? If you think that bitcoin withdrawal is high, you can be using altcoins that has low fee, like litecoin and Tron which I have seen on many gambling site to have a low fee. Also USDT on Tron network and on some other networks has a cheap withdrawal.

If you check exchanges, most of them increased their bitcoin withdrawal fee. Taking Binance as an example, the exchange increased the fee from 0.0002 BTC to 0.001 which is far higher than $5 with the recent price of bitcoin. Only the exchange that I am using that is better with very low fee is OKX and the lowest the exchange charges recently that I know is 0.00016 BTC which is more than $4.",

Any casino that is identified as doing this cannot be trusted and I will advice anybody gambling on these casinos should immediately withdraw and seek a better and more customer considering casino.",

If you just signed up on a centralized exchange, you can pretend as if you want to withdraw, to know how much the gas fee costs, but on online casino, you will see this only after you have enough wins or funds for withdrawal. It's true that withdrawal fees are quite high at casinos, that's probably their strategy go try and convince gamblers to leave their money at the casino and not withdraw immediately after a win. To me it doesn't feel like robbery because the casino also needs some support staff to verify withdrawal request. As long as we know about the high fees before hand there is not an issue as we can factor it in. I still don't feel comfortable of leaving large sums of money at the casino and will rather take it out even with a high withdraw fee. When signing up at a new casino I think it's possible to check out the withdrawal process and it also depends on the type of transaction we choose. I noticed that it's usually the cheapest to withdraw our money in the same way we deposit it.",

You can always check the bitcoin transaction fee checker so that you may know the current status of the network and current recommended fees set. But you can also check if the casino set the high withdrawal fee as default since maybe they do it on purpose to make sure that each transaction will be sent more faster to the owners wallet. But also you can ask the casino representative directly about that since they can explain to you about the fees they set.",

About their high transaction fees, I think it's because they are not using a pool. Sure, it's faster but it ain't cheaper. But if they are charging lower tx fees before and got higher just because of recent events, then you might as well wait for their maintenance so they can fix it back. For other gambling sites, it sure is a robbery, you might as well pick reputable ones that have lesser transaction fees. Stake.com is one of the gambling sites that charge less fees. 7k satoshis for Bitcoin at each withdrawal. If you want, you could just use their service instead.",

You don't need to be awkward to make a deposit or make a withdrawal at online casinos at this time, even though the Bitcoin withdrawal fee reaches $ 5, for me it's not an obstacle and a problem for us to make bets.That is why you have to choose and play at casinos that offer many payment features in various types of crypto, for that, never deposit/withdraw in just one type of crypto, like Bitcoin, choose a few cryptos to make it easy for you to overcome your awkwardness.Example: features of crypto types such as LTC, Doge and so on.Talking about costs, many crypto users are currently switching to the LTC feature, whether it's in the deposit or withdrawal method, LTC costs only 0.001LTC for one transaction only spends $ 0.08, one time withdrawal, cheap isn't it.Actually there are many other alternatives that you can do, at a time like today, Bitcoin withdrawal fees are quite expensive.",

I know Bitcoin recently has a high transaction fee but that's no more right now, some online casinos are still asking for 5$ per transaction when it should be 1$ or less. The situation with mempool can change at any moment, and no one wants to pay fees to someone else out of their own pocket, and obviously not to constantly adjust them to the current situation, which would certainly be the most fair. If you look at what is currently happening with mempool, you can see that the current medium priority fee is around $3, and in some blocks even more - which again depends on the number of incoming transactions and the number of blocks (4 blocks were found in the last 5 minutes).Quote from: Outhue on May 16, 2023, 09:13:15 AMNot just only Bitcoin withdrawal, even coins with very low transaction fee, isn't this robbery? ~snip~Maybe we can talk about something called a service fee, as is the case with CEX. In that case, the price of withdraw does not depend only on the price of the transaction, but also on the service you use.",

Can you imagine if they lowered it to 10 sats/vb for your withdrawal and then suddenly the network becomes overloaded? The lowest priority shoot up to 50 sats/vb which means you'll have to wait hours or maybe days before your money arrives at your wallet. You wouldn't want that also unless you're not in a hurry.",

Agreed. I know there's money that needs to be made and these Sportsbooks and casinos must find a way to make it somehow but this compounding 5 bucks is too much, enough to actually keep them afloat for months on end even if a large portion of their playerbase wins by a large margin. A little sad nothing could really be made to dissuade these casinos from imposing high fees other than boycott.

I imagine many services had to raise withdrawal fees as a result in order to make sure that their withdrawals go through in a timely manner and that they don’t lose a ton of money in the process. I think a solution might be to give users the option to have a longer withdrawal time with a lower fee so that transactions can be batched and sent with a low fee that might take some time to confirm.",
