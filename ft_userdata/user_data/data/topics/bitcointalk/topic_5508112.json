  "content": "A friend wants to visit a country and they were enquiring for proof of funds for him to be issued a Visa. This young man has invested heavily in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that he might not be able to present the minimum amount they want in his fiat account. But he can present ten times more than the amount the embassy is asking if they want it in cryptocurrency. The embassy is insisting that although Bitcoin is legal in the country, they cannot accept it as proof of funds. The guy is a little bit frustrated because he is been forced to sell his coin prematurely in other to present the amount they are requesting. The visit is for an important business where he needs to test run and evaluate some equipment he wants to acquire. Taking a loan might not be appropriate since the embassy wants to see the flow of cash and not just a lump sum. I suspect that countries like El Salvador might accept Bitcoin for such proof. How is the situation in your own country? My country will not accept Bitcoin because the government is anti-crypto.",

My country will not accept Bitcoin because the government is anti-crypto.  I don't think apart from El-Salvador, any other countries accepting Bitcoin as a proof of fund during visa application. In order to get Bitcoin accepted as a proof of fund, Bitcoin needs to be designated as a \"Legal tender\" in that country. There are some countries like Japan, Denmark, Germany etc. where Bitcoin is legal and people can choose to pay using Bitcoin but even though the Visa application will not allow Bitcoin as proof of fund. Unfortunate, but Bitcoin still has a long way to go to make its significant mark in the world politics. My country has imposed 30% tax on Bitcoin but still doesn't accept it as a legal tender where you can make payment for goods and services.",

At least many countries accept and have guidelines on how to add Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to Income Tax Report. It is beginning of better adoption in future but as said, it will come with more regulations.",

My country will not accept Bitcoin because the government is anti-crypto.  The thing is that the government cannot accept what they can't regulate. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technology are still evolving and with Bitcoin especially being decentralized they won't likely buy into the idea of making it a proof of funds. Bitcoin is volatile and the proof of funds the government wants is something to show that these applicants has a stable financial ability to cover up their expenses while outside the country. I wonder why your friend didn't have some backup funds at all, to me it's not a good thing. It's good to Invest your money in cryptocurrency but you should at least have something in a main account just in case. You know how crazy it can be sometimes, nobody can predict what happens next. His wallet might be hacked or something like stolen funds, where then will he start from? . As an investor, even a holder should also apply what is called proper risk management no matter how big or too small your investment is...",

Of course, before all that, he should check if such a procedure will satisfy them or if they will still think that it is not enough.I personally think that in very few countries in the world BTC can be accepted in that way, because for it to work, people are needed who know how BTC works and who will accordingly ask for a signed message from the address where the coins are located. Otherwise, anyone can come with a watch-only wallet and say that they own any amount of BTC, and most people do not know the difference between a wallet that has private keys and one that only shows balances without the possibility of transactions.",

But if you read the necessary conditions, you are indeed required to have money for living expenses in the destination country. It even seems that my country will not approve it, because what is proposed is crypto, not fiat money that is recognized by the world. Responding to this problem, I think your friend doesn't need to be sad. You told me he had 10 times the money required by the requirement. If he wanted to be right then it shouldn't be a big deal he lost 10% of his crypto money. Perhaps El Salvador can be an alternative because of its legality as a currency. But if the goal isn't there, I think monetizing 10% of crypto is a pretty good idea. Or maybe be patient to cash out your crypto and delay the departure.",
