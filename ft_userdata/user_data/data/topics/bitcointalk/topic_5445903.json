  "content": "What happened:  There's a new user claimed to be a new management of 1xbit scam casino, but the old 1xbit representative account come and pointed out if the newbie user has nothing to do with 1xbit. 1xbit1.com site is a mirror from 1xbit.com, but 1xbit.com account in this forum is either a troll or scammer. A newbie might believe 1xbit1.com account is a representative of 1xbit scam casino, so this thread created as a reference to prevent from anything could happen e.g. the account ask user's email and password via PM.Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3537178Flag (Support/Oppose): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3143Quote from: 1xbit_official on March 18, 2023, 07:07:32 PMHello guys!The OP's account of this thread has nothing to do with 1xBit in any regards.Quote from: logfiles on March 19, 2023, 11:24:44 PMI think it's a mirror link of 1xbit.comQuote from: 1xbit_official on December 16, 2020, 12:49:33 PMQuote from: brandonlang on December 15, 2020, 05:27:27 PMAgain changed and cant login.

I create this thread just for a reference of my trust flag where someone didn't satisfy with my old flag, when someone have create a new flag, I will lock this topic.The flag has been created by @dragonvslinux and has support there. New accounts under the name 1xbit will continue to appear for the same reason, they always introduce themselves as new management who want to solve problems that have been created by previous management. It is necessary to increase efforts to eradicate fraud from 1xbit on the forums to prevent more victims.Your wish has been realized after the flag was created, if there is no other purpose in this thread, it looks like you should lock it immediately. Previously there were several threads spreading how dangerous the 1xbit site was, we can use the service there to continue the discussion about the 1xbit scammers.",

You can not create a flag using a locked or self-moderated topic and this is by design, therefore, the topic shouldn't be locked as well after creating the flagThis is what the administrator saidQuote from: theymos on June 11, 2020, 01:16:36 PMYou're supposed to use the link in the flag to link to a topic where the flag is explained in detail and people can discuss it, not to the topic where the person was scamming. For discussing the flag, selfmod or locked topics would not be ideal. If a topic doesn't already exist about a scam, create it yourself before creating the flag.Regarding this recommendation from theymos, there however is a topic already that discusses this scam accusation which isn't selfmod or locked...So personally I think it would be OK to lock this topic, as long as in the OP there is a link to discuss the flag (below the flag link) for example in this format:QuoteScammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3537178Flag (Support/Oppose): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3143Discussion topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445339.0As in reality, there is already a topic discussing this impersonation scam, so not convinced it needs another.The only issue would then be if the discussion topic is locked or removed, then this topic would need to be re-opened.(I'm recommending this as there are quite simply too many topics about 1xbit at the moment)",

It doesn't make sense to me, of course and in fact I'm pretty sure it's highly improbable. While I agree that it would be better to build a new casino instead of buying an old one which has been sunk by its bad reputation.Quote from: coin-investor on March 24, 2023, 03:47:33 PMIt's impossible for 1xbit to have a new owner it's just unbelievable, and the official representative just refutes it, anything about 1xbit is bad, even if they say they are serious this time in correcting their errors.For whatever reason, I have ignored this scam casino and continue to say it is bad to consider.

Indirectly the seniors on the forum have educated and prevented newbies from connecting to accounts on behalf of 1xbit representatives, the bad reputation that has been inscribed so far is due to the greed of those who want to collect money by sucking up all the balances of their users.The majority of forum users already know how dangerous the 1xbit site is, except for newbies who have just joined here.",

The move is to first make their victims believe they are out to help recover funds, because I see no reason they will demand for email address and password of users if they won't make 1xbit users believe they are out with massive rewards from the real scam casino. It is good 1xbit has come out to deny their association with 1xbit1.com casino so we know to deal with both differently.",
