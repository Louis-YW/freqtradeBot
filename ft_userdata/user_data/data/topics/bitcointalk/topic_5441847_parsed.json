While they were calling people to interview about vote fraud and stolen votes, they were bad-mouthing those people they interviewed \"crazy\", \"nut\", etc. Unsurprisingly, Fox is not even commenting on their own lawsuit during prime time.Still, I won't comment further on this, since this is lawsuit that is not closed yet, there is no official verdict at the time being.",

They are all full of sh*t.The important part in the lies is, accidental lies vs. intentional lies.Anybody can tell a lie by mistake. When he sees his mistake, the honest thing to do is own up to it, and start telling the truth. Those who are intentionally lying won't change except to save their own skin.The other side of it is, in something as big as what goes on in government, the media, and the medical, it's often difficult to determine what the truth really is. This means that one can't always judge who the liar is, to say nothing about if the lies are accidental or intentional.",

Fox being a public company, it would not be surprising if some hosts end up getting fired because of pressure coming from the share-holders.Also, I just stumbled across this news, I seems dominion got some former private Zoom calls of Fox's hosts discussing their accurate call for Biden's victory in Arizona.Inside the Panic at Fox News After the 2020 ElectionSource: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/04/us/politics/panic-fox-news-2020-election.htmlQuote“Listen, it’s one of the sad realities: If we hadn’t called Arizona, those three or four days following Election Day, our ratings would have been bigger,” Ms. Scott said. “The mystery would have been still hanging out there.”",

If Murdock believed something, and now believes the opposite, when was he lying? Was he telling the untruth when he said what he believed before, or is he telling the untruth by what he believes now?Murdoch is 91-y-o. He comes from a time when America still believed in freedom of the press. Freedom of the press is also freedom for reporters to print and speak what they believe is true, and not to always follow the party line of their boss or owner. This is Murdock.Murdock's personal understandings and beliefs are not 100% knowledge of everything, and he knows it. If he believes that the insurrection parts of Jan6 were Trumps doings, or if he believes they were Dem criminal activities, or if he believes something else, he believes only because he has seen and interpreted some of the evidence to move him to believe the way he does. He could be wrong, and he knows it. That's why he allows his people to point out their views and beliefs, as well.Murdock is in it to make money as well as bring out truth through the media. The truth is in the videos that Tucker Carlson is showing, not the feelings that Carlson or Murdock have about the videos. Even if their understandings of what the truth is are opposite, do they know the truth?Carlson maintained that when people watch the videos, they (the people) are the ones who are supposed to make up their minds. Certainly Carlson expresses his own opinions. But we all have to make up our own minds. Was there rioting or wasn't there... and how bad was it? Was there justice in the whole Jan6 government handling of the situation, before, during, and after, or wasn't there? Carlson, like Murdock, is simply stating that you need to make up your own mind based on the videos. Carlson is simply bringing into view some more of the REAL info about Jan6.The point is. Neither Murdock nor Carlson have the whole picture. They are simply bringing what they have into the open. And, they are throwing in their own opinion to some extent. And that is what the media is supposed to be about. So, they both are heroes even if their personal beliefs change based on new evidence... that is, even if their old beliefs turn into lies as seen from the new evidence., and, even if their personal views are opposite.Media people are not judge and jury about anything. They are investigators who point out what they have found in their investigations, so that we can all be judge and jury for ourselves. That's what the new videos of Jan6 are all about. More info so that we can make an intelligent decision on our own.",
