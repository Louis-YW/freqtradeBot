  "content": "GM crypto fam.The SEC claimed that FTX's exchange token FTT was sold as an investment contract, making it a security. Adding:Quote“The large allocation of tokens to FTX incentivized the FTX management team to take steps to attract more users onto the trading platform and, therefore, increase demand for, and increase the trading price of, the FTT token.”Could this decision have an impact on similar tokens, given that almost every exchange issues its own tokens?Source: https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2022/comp-pr2022-234.pdfhttps://tokenist.com/sec-classifies-ftt-as-a-security-could-binances-bnb-be-next/",

IMO if all of exchange site tokens could be classified as security. Any exchange token was sold as investment contract to the its investors. That reminds me with binance when it has raised a few million dollars from investors when it just getting started a few years ago. The only problem is why that garbage SEC was taking such decision after FTX has been collapse. Why didn't SEC take a step when FTX was just launching FTT? SEC was also garbage.",

Because they are benefiting on it for there money laundering scheme and now they are destroying it to burn all the evidence along with the exchange. I doubt that FTX can recover with this pressure coming from US government that want to cover there asses on this big scandal. Even SBF is already use as escape goat now to hide his connection on democrats scam.SEC itself is not the garbage but the people controlling it since SEC is just the department that gives security to all consumer while the current chief is affliated to SBF through MIT connection.",

Not solely because of FTX, but as the ecosystem evolve and grow bigger, a centralised institution will take a stance. Such centralized exchanges' token is no doubt are more suitable to be categorized as a security, so nothing unexpected for me.As for other exchanges copying the method, the incentivization scheme surely benefits the exchange on its own, which is why it exists in the first place.",

All the rest of the exchange native tokens will soon also be Security. They really have to point out a really clear regulation so developers can also do what is needed.

SEC was also garbage. well there wouldn't be funds donation from SBF, you wouldn't want it if you are one of those in the congress visited by SBF's friends. SEC will make the rest of the tokens to be security as well. Gensler already said it before that 99% of the crypto are security except BTC. but this time at least SEC step up and maybe dev teams can no go offshore. there will be a lot of crackdowns by the country where they go, its time for each country to also make money out of crypto companies.

That is what I am thinking too, once the FTT token is classified and listed as a security token then additional criminal charges will be pressed on the FTX exchange.  I believe(correct me if I am wrong) one cannot release a security token without the approval of the SEC or financial institution.  This will add more years of prison for SBF and his subordinates.",

Its too late for this news though and I don’t know if this can still affect FTX where in fact they are no longer here in the market so this SEC decision is too late for the investors of FTX.",

There are either irregularities during sale phase or marketing. On these things it's essential what sales people say, what sort of marketing there was etc. Token doesn't need to provide dividends or other income to be a security. All that needs is a promise of providing income in some point. There have been many icos in the past that have talked about the price and the markets and they have been charged of being securities later or will be some day when sec has time for it.",

If the SEC argues its decisions in this way, they can issue a similar opinion about almost any cryptocurrency. This verdict may therefore have more serious consequences than most people think.",

Government is human too, so if they are greedy it is normal, we are greedy when investing in crypto too, if we are not greedy we will never lose money for FTX. What I care about is who is willing to spend that much money to get SBF out on bail, and with the government offering such a high fine, they probably don't want SBF on bail either. I know that investors will have little chance of getting their money back, but that money would rather fall into the hands of the government than let an asshole like SBF hold. I used to think SBF would get away with it, but given what's going on, we can expect him to receive the heaviest punishment for his actions.",
