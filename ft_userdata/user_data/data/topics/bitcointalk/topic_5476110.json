E dey very necessary for newbies dem and people wey never too understand some things about crypto like me  to dey spend time dey follow this forum up to learn more but, we fit do am in a smart way so that we no need to dey spend that 80% for this forum. Many of us get work before we enter here.  like me now, I be electrician so I no go fit just ignore my work come dey read people post.The alternative na be say make you use your telegram bitcointalk notifier take dey follow some strong hand dem for this forum, so that when dem post you go fit get notification, den from there you read their post to learn from dem continually. If you try this thing wey I dey tell you, you go spend less time here but you go dey gather information small small dey go. And when e comes to social media I like to use the X social Media because for there you go fit follow some guru dem for this bitcoin matter and from their post you ho still dey learn, most times sef I dey participate for online live meeting for X wey dem talk about bitcoin and the crypto system. So if you sabi used social media well you go see say no be just place wey you go discuss with your friends, but na another place to take learn.",

      "body": "OP see success now is not too measured by how hard you work now again as success is being measured by how much of creativity that you have, like what do you really have to offer and what you're offering is it worth it? That's the one billion question. One of our major problem in this life is impatient, we don't want to walk before we run but we want to fly. If most of our legendary now tell you how they started their journey in this bitcointalk forum you will even find out that some of us are very very lucky here. Some legends here when they started they devoted all their time and effort on this bitcointalk forum, some of them even spent 2 to 3 years before they started eating the fruits of their labour but take a look at now that even before 4 months some people have even reached the level of a full member something that even took some senior members here years before they could achieve not even that they weren't too creative but at that time too this bitcointalk forum have not recorded the kind of improvement it has now because then there were very few merit sources coordinating how merits was distributed within the forum and there were no or very few local board for people to interact more in a language they could understand and also assist each other to achieve certain level of success but now we have about 109 merit sources and lots of local boards.Talking about spending much time on social media; the reason why people spend most of their time on social media is.because that's where majority of the information we share here are gotten from. The information that is being circulated more here are gotten from these social media platforms because that's where majority of people across the globe interact and give information just like the X ( twitter ) now. You will find out that majority of the information we circulate on this platform is gotten from twitter and other social media. And in that social media that's also were majority of the world population are so it is easy to get information around the globe through this social media platforms. Now it is not how regular or committed that you are in this bitcointalk forum that matters what matters most is what impact are you creating towards the improvement and growth of the forum like are you really learning from people here? And are you also giving out information that will assist someone here? Those are the questions that should come across your mind. A lot of people here also have some other important activities they do outside here that fetches them income so you don't expect such people to always be active here when they have other stuffs to attend to outside here as the world now requires versatility because if you ain't skilled in different professions then you will really find it difficult to propagate to a certain level of life.The reason why most of us are very anxious to get merits from our posts here is just majorly to rank up quickly and join signature campaigns that will earn us income at the end of the day because if this signature campaigns are being scrapped out from this forum watch how many persons that will still have time to be more active on this platform. It is important for us to know that life is in stages that's why even in our institutions we graduate from one class to the other and that's how our knowledge and exposure keeps increasing so it is good for us to take things here one step at a time no need to rush things as the learning process cannot be skipped because that's what makes us to know and improve better in the future so like a saying that \"a hot soup is being licked gradually\" so na small small them dey take lick soup wey dey hot as life is a gradual process and we move from a stage to another.",

      "body": "I don't think if spending such time of about %80 here is really a sign of success. Sometimes success is messured according  to the value you creat with your time. Staying here in Bitcoin forum all day without learning anything is also as doing nothing. Many people have spent countless times here, thinking that it will do the good but they failed, because they don't know how to go about it just as @makus said, say person need to get telegram notification bot wey go dey connected to some of your conversation with some discurssion with some oga them. So that if them make comment, you go receive the notifications so that no be every post person ft read.For here, many people dey grow on stety basis, and most at times them no dey dey online steady. Them dey make sure say them task themselves to achieve a better thing or contribute meaningfuly to the forum, just withing the little slightest chance wey Dem get. So you go confirm am say wetting one person fit use the whole day do somebody go use 1hour do am. Or wetting take take 10 years to achieve by mr A, go take 1 or 2 years to achieve am by me B. That is to tell you say no matter what you do, if you no dey follow the wright track you no go still grow as you talk.Quote from: Richbased on December 01, 2023, 12:34:48 AMIf most of our legendary now tell you how they started their journey in this bitcointalk forum you will even find out that some of us are very very lucky here.

Everything you talk here na true because I don hear am for different, how members dem been suffer well well before them fit rank up for here. because merit been scare. But now new people go do 30 post no merits, them go start to complain. If you see this forum you go see some people wey don dey here for long. there activities Don reach 500 but just get 30 to 40 merits, and them never still give up. that is to show you dem no give up on the hustle. One thing is for sure, for this life every first timer dey discover something and they always sacrifice things to achieve what they potray now. Thia 9ja local board wey everybody dey come dey creat thread almost everyday like this, I think na the effort and hardwork of some legendary wey them put for here, to take make here a better place today. some of the old members account dem ban am, because of Small mistake but now there mistake don be a form of correction for the newbies. So the old members here really suffer. So I think them deserve respec. We sopos learn from them, because them be buch of knowledge. No be say we go dey quote them anyhow, why we no no how the quote botton even come out.",

      "body": "Consistency is one of the ingredients of success but it becomes easy to be consistent when the passion is there and easier to channel our time into meaningful things when we have passion for the meaningful. It is worth sounding a caveat here which is that what appears to be so meaningful to Mr. A might be a wasted effort to Mr. B and over time people have failed to continue the push because of criticisms from others who don't understand what is meaningful to them.In as much as channeling effort into meaningful things will certainly pay off notwithstanding how long it will take, knowing that opinions of people as regards what should constitute meaningful things shouldn't take center stage in our bid to clock our target. Doing and doing again while paying attention to the evils confronting us or better put, to those elements which are antithetical to doing meaningful things is necessary if we must develop. In summary, with fewer distractions and more engagement in what constitutes meaningful things to us as an individual, growth becomes inevitable either sooner or later.",

Op, I don't know how you feels in couping in this forum but to be, the realistic achievement of this forum is in ligns with the outside world. Basically this forum is primarily for bitcoin discussion and heroin we can't attain the whole lessions of bitcoin here. We also adop to learn different things about our bitcoin journey either in the social media or the physical outdoors.Behold, we've heard so many of us discussing our their lessions and experiences from one bitcoin investor to the other by interfering in a social discussions, so are through the media updates.We can actually tends to grow our bitcoin knowledges at all cost and in many ways. I can also testify that there are lot of technical knowledgeable individuals or even those who invested in the bitcoin before this forum was discovered and yet they're no amongst the forum users here.You can say yes, you can't grow yourself without this forum, you can actually be right but that's just at your own view and not in all ramifications. Most forum users here might not be here to acquire knowledges but to spread the and impact others with the potentials they've up their senses to whom is willing.If you ask me, I'd tell you that I don't want to deep in too much of my carrier and capacities into this bitcoin industry because life didn't just end here, i most especially want to acquire the elementary knowledges in the sense that I'd understand how to keep my asset's secured, know when to sell and when to buy more for accumulations, and how to stay secured in the theft societies and not most deepen of the technical knowledges.",
