  "content": "Today's downtime which according to me was for a few hours, created a panic among a lot of users. Considering how a famous Bitcoin Mixer was shut down suddenly and next, we read that MODS are not supposed to join the Bitcoin mixture signature campaign. This panic is justified, don't you think so?¬†What happened in the past doesnot matter. What happened today after a sudden closure of a campaign promted me to check the official Twitter handle. After 2018 there were none as in tweets from the official handle. Considering the amount of time, the  forum was down. Rather, keeping users questioning, who are active, engaged, and were concerned of this situation. I think it is the right time to activate the Twitter handle active. That will relax a lot of members. If the handle does not get activated then according to Mr. Doge Twit who owns the platform, inactive users will now get their accounts disabled. The last tweet from the official Twitter handle of Bitcointalk was in 2018. If another tweet does not come up then the only official handle will get disabled. Can @theymos look into reactivating Twitter?Thanks.",

      "body": "I just went through the Twitter page of the forum and I discovered that most of the tweets there are related to denial-of-service attacks. Maybe what we experience today is not a DDoS attack but another kind of network problem, so nothing to worry about. I also guess that this forum is not social media savvy which is why it's Twitter and other social media account is not bubbling with activities. I was also concerned about today's downtime because it lasted for a long time. If the administrators are not comfortable with social media, it will not be a bad idea to devise other means of reaching out to members in times of emergencies.",

I was writing a post and when i refreshes another page, website was down, well, i was able to copy the post so that I don't have to write it again. Well, then i waited for it's retrieval. Point is, if we have another way to get notifications of such incidents we will remain calm as today show has really scared me, (for a reason).I hope the moderators of this platform still have access to this twitter handle.",

I don't know how Twitter considers dealing with these accounts, but if they disable the accounts, won't the alias be available to be used after some time?My only concern is having this alias available in some years from now and eventually someone ill-intentioned will start using it to trick some unaware twitter users, while using our forum as a bait. It's true that we can't prevent that today - with alias such as @bitcointalkorg or something like that - but if we could avoid this one to fall in the wrong hands, that would be great from my perspective.",

We don't need to let things be - for the fact that we can't change them - atleast, alot could be done since we can control them too.Is it not necessary for the forum growth and some subsequential enablement?? C'monnnn, I'm seeing Twitter the same way I see 'em lame social platforms,.. the likes of FB and the rest. It could rehabilitate a part of the forum's Treasury in time to come and also, make prevalent, the happenings in here.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

I am not sure it worth it keeping the handle active considering how centralized the platform have become lately.

I think it would be beneficial if theymos logged in occasionally to keep the Bitcointalk Twitter account active and prevent it from being deleted. Since the account has the original name it would be unfortunate if it were to be deleted and someone else took advantage of the name for malicious purposes. imho, it is advisable to ensure the account remains active and protected from deletion.",
