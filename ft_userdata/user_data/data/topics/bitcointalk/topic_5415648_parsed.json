  "content": "I created an Electrum wallet last night not realizing what a watch only wallet was. It said import address or private key as an option so I did. We have been having the worst I mean the worst time trying to locate where our transactions have went to. So I thought this would be the right option to make sure it even accepted it. IT DID!!!   HUGELY excited until I went to transfer it and it said unsigned googled more to find out what WATCH only wallet was and been spending most of the day trying to figure it out. THEN the amount that was in it from last night tripled. I was using the app so wanted to just get on my laptop and see if there maybe was something I was missing. I went to log in and it said password incorrect.     First it asked me the options which of course this time I put standard wallet. It let me upload a file which I happen to findin my computer with the same name as the one I created on my phone. So was confused why the password didn't match because I don't recall ever having set up Electrum in the past. Either way I put in a different password and it worked. STRANGE. HOWEVER to my now new dilema. MY 1st question was how do you go from WATCH only to STANDARD. however now....Question 2 is much MORE important. WHERE DID ALL THE MONEY DISAPEAR TOO   its all gone now. I see the outputs everything. I know you cant just put in anyones Transaction numbers because I tried inputting some on my wallet on my laptop and it would tell you these are not basically linked to your wallet. PLEASE PLEASE I need some advice its been going on months we have been trying to figure this out. These coins are from years back we recently thought what the hell lets look and see if we did have some. We use to mine back in the day as well. My son helped with that I have no clue and now he don't even remember how we did. it. Either way I have numberous transaction ID just cant find where it goes. This was the first time we actually was able to get one to upload and take.",

This was the first time we actually was able to get one to upload and take.  this is a long post that needs more time to understand. Are you putting the correct private key code like this?p2pkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...          -> 1DckmggQM...p2wpkh-p2sh:KxZcY47uGp9a...    -> 3NhNeZQXF...p2wpkh:KxZcY47uGp9a...         -> bc1q3fjfk...I guess you didn't put and got wrong address",
