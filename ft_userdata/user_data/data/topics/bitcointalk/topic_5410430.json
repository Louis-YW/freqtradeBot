  "content": "Good day everybody,I'm looking for a 0.5 Bitcoin loan without collateral until around May next year. I know that I'm new here and I don't see the chance as very great, but it's worth a try for me.By the way, I have no problem with kyc, also by phone or video call.In 2018 we started to build a three-family house, moved in in 2020 (parents, sister and I), January 2021 diagnosis of cancer in the mother, finally died in October from liver metastases. 6 weeks ago my father was also diagnosed with cancer. brain tumor. We were given the opportunity to take part in a study, but this is not (currently) covered by health insurance. It would increase survival chances from ~10% to 50-60%. Unfortunately we cannot raise the money at the moment due to the repayment of the house.If there is one or more together that could help us I would be very grateful. I'm not looking for a donation, I'm looking for a loan. interest is not set by me.Please refrain from comments because of scam, only registered today, without security no one will lend you so much and so on. for me it's just an attempt to get the money we need.p.s. my english is only as good as the google translator. i am from germany but my english is not perfect",

You're not getting the totally-not-donation here. Woah, OK. First off: I'd like to apologise, for that reply, on behalf of my fellow human (I will assume the species, we are on the internet after all, lol).Let's imagine that you did not post anything, suchmoon, the opposite of what you did. As to say: you contemplated the \"if I have something not-nice to say/nothing nice to say, I shall not say anything or find a different way to say it\" phrase/whatever-sentence, and so made a 'correct choice' and decided to say nothing at all. I write this for you as much as I write this for me/anyone reading this by the way. We've all made similar mistakes many times in the past and perhaps will in the future, no big deal at the end of the day, just felt like writing this up.. I hope one can read it in neutral tone, I hope I can express myself neutrally too, and we can all learn from this.So.. IF that had happened, I feel OP still probably wouldn't get their loan.To give them the benefit of the doubt (I'm assuming you don't know OP at all) regarding their statement, could have been a good option. What a rude thing to say if OP is truthful. If OP is not truthful, what a useless thing to say.Even your last part \"You're not getting the totally-not-donation here.\" 'could have been' expressed as \"(perhaps) seek a donation OP\", full stop. Now.. let's say that that was the only thing in your reply - I'm sure your 'point'/scepticism re:OP would have been conveyed and OP would still find themselves in whatever situation they're in (still probably unable to secure a loan of that size on here)..Quote from: PaulBf1 on August 19, 2022, 12:21:34 AM[...] doesn't mean you can ask for a non-collateralized 0.5 BTC loanOP is entirely allowed to ask. Anyway, I get what you mean.Alas.. rest well, all.@OP, do you have a job/how do you plan on repaying a loan worth 10-odd kEUR + interest in approx. 9months?",

It's clearly a play on emotion and not a serious loan request. Not to mention the absurdity of taking a Bitcoin load for a fiat expense and having fiat income. Then I'm the bad person for pointing this out LOL.If you can repay this kind of loan in less than a year then any bank would be happy to lend you unless you're a horrible credit risk.Quote from: marcotheminer on August 19, 2022, 07:04:18 AM~A lecture from a deadbeat borrower, awesome.

Why don't you lend OP the money and show us how it's done.Right, a lecture.. please re-read my comment.Re: your \"lend OP\" proposition. Not sure if that's a question (no symbol that usually denotes one: \"?\") or a rhetorical! I'll answer anyway: I'll ask the right questions or try and help out if I can, though as it stands I'm fairly sure I; a)won't be able to fill such a loan size b)and if I was able, as it stands I wouldn't be willing. Still, doesn't mean I reply insensitively.Best of luck to you.
