  "content": "Please be warned about casinoin.io. They don't payout winnings. Yesterday, when I tried to withdraw they said I had to wait 24 hours and then I could withdraw. So I waited more than 24 hours and then tried to withdraw again and they now claim they are having maintenance issues. Proceed with caution if you decide to gamble at this casino.https://thumbs4.imagebam.com/af/9e/79/MEAUDZ3_t.jpg",

They once promoted themselves here, but seem to lack customer interest as far as their rep hasn't made any updates and has been inactive for a few days after publishing the announcement.Coming back to the OP's problem, it seems they don't have any social media accounts so it's hard for you to contact support in some places.I'd love it if you update the progress.",

Their Ann thread is de as and their official representative didn't log in for almost two years, so I don't think they really care about what's going on here on this forum. Maybe they were telling the truth and they had indeed some technical issues with their wallets!Anyway, glad your withdrawal request has been processed and you got your money.I suggest editing the topic title to [Solved] .",

Note that yesterday I had linked my complaint here at bitcointalk when I contacted their support regarding their second day of not processing my withdrawal request. I doubt the reason your withdrawal was processed is that they got afraid of earning a bad reputation on Bitcointalk. I might have believed that if they were constantly active here and depend on this community for new players. But they don't, and they haven't posted any updates or news in 2 years. How much money are we talking about approximately? You don't have to say the exact figures if you want to keep it private, but you can mention the total number of digits. 5 digits, 6, more? If it's a relatively big amount that doesn't happen every day, maybe the casino did need some time to collect it from other wallets depending on their setup. You have been paid, so you should adjust the title in a way to show the community that the issue has been settled.",
