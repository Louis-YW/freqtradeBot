  "content": "QuoteHave you ever dreamed about a three-day weekend all over the year? For some workers in the United Kingdom, it is becoming reality. As The Guardian reported this Monday, a hundred UK companies have signed up for a permanent four-day working week for all their employees with no loss of pay. This movement represents a revolution within Britain’s labor market.2,600 workersThe 100 companies employ 2,600 staff, which represent a small percentage of the UK’s working population. However, the 4 Day Week Campaign group hopes that it can become a trend soon.According to The Guardian, supporters of the four-day week say that the five-day pattern is a hangover from an earlier economic age. For them, a four-day week would drive companies to improve their productivity. Also, they believe that the policy has proven a useful way of attracting and retaining employees.The two biggest companies that have signed up are Atom Bank and global marketing company Awin. With 450 employees each, those companies have been accredited by the four-day week campaign.Wellness and wellbeingIn an interview with the Guardian, Adam Ross, Awin’s chief executive, said adopting the four-day week was “one of the most transformative initiatives we’ve seen in the history of the company.“Over the course of the last year and a half, we have not only seen a tremendous increase in employee wellness and wellbeing but concurrently, our customer service and relations, as well as talent relations and retention also have benefited,” he told the British media outlet. The Guardian also revealed that the UK campaign is also coordinating the world’s biggest pilot scheme for about 70 companies.This project aims to employ about 3,300 workers, to adopt the four-day week in a trial with researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, Boston College and thinktank Autonomy.Increasing momentumJoe Ryle, the UK campaign’s director, said there was increasing momentum in the adoption of the four-day week, even as companies brace for a long recession.“We want to see a four-day week with no loss of pay become the normal way of working in this country by the end of the decade so we are aiming to sign up many more companies over the next few years,” he said.Most of the companies that have officially adopted the four-day week are in the services However, the campaign said that some manufacturing and construction employers had also signed up.https://news.yahoo.com/hundred-uk-companies-adopt-four-120000418.html....Nearly everything relating to the UK in news cycles has been doom and gloom for the last few years now. It was surprising to see optimistic UK headlines: 4 day work week with \"no loss of pay\" rollout. Of course this is available on a limited trial basis for only 2,600 employees. Given recent trends where many believe billions in student debt should be forgiven by governments with no fallout or damage to the economy and financial insitutions. Does it make sense to rollout a 4 day work week without cuts in pay? Or without businesses sustaining significant losses. Where does the money come from. Is it a good business model for the future.The american equivalent to this would probably be efforts to raise minimum wage or to unionize large corporations like amazon or apple. Its difficult to tell which direction public opinion is leaning. Or whether people are taking steps to learn more about business and finance to help them support what is best for them.",

A reduction in work hours should be balanced with pay cut except the promoters of this policy have the intention of supporting the affected firms financially. Also this policy shouldn't be forced on the firms in the UK but should be optional except the government want to pay for the companies' losses.",

This experiment has been done across the globe: UK, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Iceland, and some others. If I'm not mistaken, results vary. But the overall goal here is not centered on the workers' well-being alone. It doesn't stop there. After all, the workers' well-being will definitely affect their performance at work. If workers are overworked, suffering from fatigue and burnout, unhappy with their jobs, it would result into poor production, poor quality, errors and mistakes, wastage, and so on. Resignations, absences, and leaves will be common. But if you've got a strong and happy working force, it will definitely result into a better and faster production. So this is thought to be a win-win situation.",

I would say it really depends on the industry whether it is possible or not. There are sometimes just some logistical hurdles to cut a week down from five or even more days to less days, respectively. The articles I just went through mostly refer to the well-being aspect and the chance to attract new talent. I have seen articles in the past for such initiatives for other countries as well, and I recall that it was often said that the work would still have to be done for the week. So to say, the deal being that if the work is done on Thursday, people can take Friday off. This would go into the direction what you mentioned, work 10h/day if you please and then take three days off. Whenever possible, I would advocate such a model as well. I have been in a job where I was completely free to choose to work between 6 hours and 12 hours a day. That was back at the time when I was in my early 20s. A certain goal was set for the week and we were free to choose (unless there was an urgent deadline) how to go about the workload for the week. 6 days were possible, starting as early as 5 AM and finishing as late as 9 PM. Of course one could argue that the productivity decreases when working days get longer and longer, but first, you can really get used to it as you know that we are just talking about a three day work week potentially and you have plenty of time to recover, if necessary. And second, it really depended back then on the work that needed to be done. We had a mix of less intellectually exhaustive work (engineering experiments where stuff just had to be prepared according to plan), and more exhaustive stuff (actually coming up with the plans). I can tell you that most of the people arrived at 5 AM in the morning and left at 5 PM in the afternoon and still had a happy face. It was such an amazing and diverse group that I was working with back in the days. Very well educated mothers who could organize a nanny for their children much easier (because just three days a week), lots of students who were literally able to take a 70% job besides their studies (that was how I got started, but I went full time), but also lots of engineers in their 70s who weren't able anymore to go a full and stressful distance. From what I can tell, our productivity level back at the time was always on point. I did that job for almost 10 years and then I went abroad. I have ever since been a strong proponent for way more flexible working hour models. Application numbers for that company always were through the roof back then and the diverse set of people on my team also showed that there are crazy different circumstances people are coping with, and they have all been willing to work hard, but had to sort out all kinds of problems in order to make their weekly schedule fit their life circumstances. Children, taking care of parents ( for example on dialysis days, their own health issues, studies, shared custody, desire for individual freedom, time consuming/extravagant hobbies, etc. the list goes on). Most people really aren't lazy. Many bosses who complain are also often not very good at defining goals and the respective guidelines. Defining goals and guidelines can actually be a hard thing, it is not always trivial. All too often the blame for lack of success is shifted onto the workforce. The company I worked for back at the time had frequent meetings involving their employees with the objective to improve the definition of goals. After some time everyone developed a feeling for the time and effort that is probably required to get to a certain desired point/output. Of course it didn't always work out perfectly and we needed more time and those who were able pulled off way more hours a week then, but even then our boss paid the extra hours in many of the cases unless we really fucked up. If the system and the whole environment is set up the right way, and a way that allows for the system itself to evolve over time, flexibility can be an enormous contributing factor to productivity.",

However, this would have a significant positive impact on employees because they would have more rest and productivity that they could bring to the company. Well, this is still in the trial period, but still, I am hoping to see this soon and also experience this one since the two-day rest day is very short for me.",

You have to complete a project in a month that takes you 40 hours of work, it's just a waste for that guy to stay in the office doing nothing, but it's an altogether different thing for almost any other kind of job.You can't just have the workers in a store or in a hospital or police or any other kind of job that produce things continuously switch to a lower work schedule and be paid the same stuff, it would mean hiring an extra guy to cover for the days which is basically, just give the first worked a 25% raise and that's it.Where would the money come from when in your business model nothing has happened?I certainly doubt that having the guy at Tesco working 32 hours and not 40 would mean 10% more shoppers  Quote from: rat03gopoh on December 01, 2022, 11:09:08 AMIf the company is oriented towards the production of goods, it isn't a problem. If the median is one laptop per hour and your employee will assemble only 32 per week instead of 40 but get paid the same amount, how is this not a problem?",
