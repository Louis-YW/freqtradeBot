The small hints probably aren't for the people that he'll meet online, it's probably for those close to him, someone that knows them personally and with those small hints, they'd be able to identify them, kind of like their very own secret or something like that.",

I always believed that Satoshi Nakamoto was not one single individual, there should be a group behind it or a few individuals. The reason I feel intrusive is due to the person who claims to be an OG of Bitcointalk. This individual is attempting to solve a mystery that I was never interested in uncovering. I have always found nature beautiful, and I don't see the need to dig the earth. Unfortunately, this anonymous user has destroyed my curiosity.

Did Satoshi delete it by himself or later admins delete it like sirius, theymos?The topic number means it is very earliest one and very few people knew about it and still alive today.  Nick is Satoshi, interesting if someone can provide more information about that.Satoshi Nakamoto tried to mix his writing between European style and USA style. It is abnormal and it seems Satoshi Nakamoto intentionally did it to hide his nationality.Personally I don't care real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and wish that nobody will find him.",
