  "content": "Username : UnsoldierThis user is very interesting when most of his posts actually only spreading about news especially on Russian boards, since I don't understand about Russian language, so I can't read the quality of his posts. But if you look on his posts on gambling boards, it literally doesn't have any value at all, he only copied the whole tweet about the casino promotion only. Did he's a paid shill of those casinos he bump or only want to fulfill his requirement gambling campaign?Even he's not a signature participant, this kind behavior will harm this forum reputation since it will mess the forum with spam and low value posts.I check his post history, only a single post on gambling boards he didn't post any link and it's just a common sense.Quote from: Unsoldier on May 29, 2022, 01:38:55 PMI like English footbal and I wanted Liverpool to win. But Real Madrid was stronger in this match. It was a beautiful and very tense game. Well, now we are waiting for the next Champions League final.

I don't know whether I'm correct or not but it seems he doesn't know English at all, maybe I'm wrong as I haven't checked his full post history. From the last page of his post, I can't see any post in the global section other than the posts in the gambling section. For fulfilling the requirement, he is only copying the promotional text from various gambling sites and pasting them here. I don't know how Hhampuz would evaluate them if he noticed. Maybe he noticed already as I can see Unsoldier is in the campaign for more than few weeks(edit- 5 weeks).Also, I don't think these are spam. What if any authentic/responsible (official PR manager of the casino) would do this post? Would they be counted as spam? No.",

Which means, your doing some real job over there with your pals and tries to break the language barrier that poses a challenge to your participation on other forum activities.

It is a disconnection from an ongoing discussion and that in itself seems spammy.Notably, in my quote as at above, you seemed to have responded to the accusation quite well with regards to your difficulty with English.

He isn't a plagiarist since he already give the original source, if this can be considered as plagiarism, he will get banned from the beginning.After this thread created, I see Unsoldier changed his behavior to post in gambling section, but all of his posts is just a common sense.

I did not think that gambling machines appeared so long ago.Probably, the inventors of the first slot machines did not think that they were changing the gambling industry.
