I recently opened an Edge Wallet in order to acquire some Bitcoin to purchase Monero/Privacy Coins. I was advised that this was the way to go in order maintain my anonymity but I am being asked for ID verification in order to make the deposit. I dont get how you can remain anonymous if you provide those details, surely its the same as opening an account with Kucoin or Huobei along with KYC verification as I have done in the past?Much appreciate any feedback",

Actually you do not even need to talk to the other person. The software handles everything and there's also a kind of escrow system in place that ensures neither party can cheat from each other.For a while now, P2P cash is also a payment method available in Bisq, meaning you can find trustable P2P trading partners on there instead of looking for someone on sketchy chat groups or elsewhere.It has to be kept in mind that P2P trades are not without (personal) risk, while being simpler and subjectively more secure than accepting a Bisq trade that is paid via bank transfer or Revolut, as they might technically be reversible. But then again how do you verify that the cash you get in hand is fine... it's all got to be considered before you try this with a lot of money. Personally I have never had an issue on Bisq so far.",

      "body": "Any wallet which asks you for KYC should be avoided. Period.If you want real privacy from your wallet then you should be running Bitcoin Core over Tor[1]. Anything else - Electrum included - will result in your wallet connecting to a third party server in order to query your addresses and balances, which obviously is very poor for your privacy. For Monero, I would suggest using the official Monero wallet[2], and again, setting up your own local node to connect to. In both cases, you should verify the software you download before running it, and in both cases it will need to sync the entire blockchain (~400 GB for Bitcoin and ~100 GB for Monero).For a less aggressive approach, then running Electrum over Tor provides a little privacy, but all your addresses and transactions can still be linked by third party servers. There are some less obvious attacks when using the official Monero wallet with a third party node instead of your own node, but again, this is a possibility if you don't want to have to run your own node and download the blockchain.[1] - https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/[2] - https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/",

If you want to stay anonymous then buy only on P2P sites that don't ask for KYC verification. Or look for Bitcoin ATM near you, some Bitcoin ATMs only provide SMS verification without submitting IDs but a limited amount usually around $300 to $1000 or maybe more this is the fastest I think, and gives you anonymity compared to buying BTC directly in exchanges.",

It after all can be used as an alternative with some reservation. To buy or sell bitcoin/monero or other coins, use cash (completely anonymous and in no way can the owner be identified by it, not to mention the tracking of transactions and the remaining traces). But there are things to consider here that the buyer will have to physically contact the crypto seller in order to receive the cash, which is not suitable for some. In this case, the buyer doesn't leave the data of his documents anywhere, but can reveal his identity with the help of his appearance. Some signs of identification can be partially hidden with the help of hats, accessories or masks during a pandemic. This method is not the simplest nor the easiest, but may be applicable in some cases.",

As far as I know it has a pretty similar back-end structure as the Blockchain.com wallet. Now, the reason why OP is asked to provide AML/KYC, is because OP tried using the buy-crypto-directly-in-app feature.
