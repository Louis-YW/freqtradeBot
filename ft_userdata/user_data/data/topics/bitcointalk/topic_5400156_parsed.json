Crypto or altcoins are mostly because of hype or pump and dump, many people doesn't care with the whitepaper and any explanation about the project. Not to mention, those project looks good in the first appearance and then turn become scam project.",

Bitcoin's whitepaper is far more simple to understand than \"The future of oracle networks\" or \"Proof-of-Useful-Work\" and it still contains concepts such as \"Timestamp Server\", \"Proof-of-Work\" and even poisson distribution math that isn't understandable by the most. You'll be far more safe if you invest in things you're sure you understand.",

It is easy for scammers to plagiarize one or two whitepapers than to bring up their own initiatives and what led to their fake project. Some people fall for this scam, but which is easily avoidable if the whitepaper is checked for plagiarism.I understood your point. Some projects can still have unique whitepaper but not unique itself. Some became pump and dump while some later failed. Example at recent is Terra Luna and UST that were created by Terraform Labs.But, actually, some people can still go and read the whitepaper and make some approaches to know if a project is true or fake. But, even if a project is not fake, there are still chances that the project can become a failed project. There will be more competition as more coins are created, over $19600 coins and tokens are currently existing while nearly most of them are shit and dead coins.",

Moreover, entire offices were filmed with the logos of these projects, right down to printing the logos on dishes and clothes and hiring famous actors.But as a result, the scammers worked off all the money they spent on advertising at the expense of naive investors, just like the OP, thinking that if everything is beautiful, then it is legal.",

Using this bearish market for an example, most coins arr down never to rise again whole, some might struggle until the surge comes and they go stabilise once more. In fact, its in times like this that one can get to identify a project that have got some potential to it.Of course, white papers can be professionally written and other gets to be plagiarised, for sure most users don't care much about the white papper in picking a crypto investment but give reasons to the hype attached to it and that doesn't make it right as, it counts towards its crash as well. Although, these @White pepper offers some incentives to it and you can tell that before the hype, there must have been those that have bought into the idea of the white paper and pushed forward with veteran investors on the project. That was the case of DOGE, Shiba, Luna and even Apefinance.",

Once we are successful to pick the right project, we may be able to turn the profits highly. But vie versa, when the project si dead, even before listing, we may face a high risk of loss.
