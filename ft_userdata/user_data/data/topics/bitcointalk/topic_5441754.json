But then we can overlook the fact that some investors have failed to understand the fojndanmamtal practice of bitcoin which is (never expect anything unless on the long-term bases) must investors got in when the price was at its all-time high at the moment have lost a big percentage of the funds, but if the hold for the long term it could become a significant investment in the future.",

Even if the price doesn't rise today I know and I'm 100% sure it will one-day so that's how confident I am in Bitcoin a 100%.",

What's your percentage trust?Those who withdrew from the Bitcoin communities did not know the value of Bitcoin and its decentralized advantages that changed the financial system and made it better without the control of the authorities and centralized banks. I am almost certain that this group has regretted their withdrawal from the Bitcoin market in the past years; now, as you can see, Bitcoin was able to live and coexist under harsh conditions, and its adoption increased on a broad level by businessmen and large companies, Bitcoin has become an integral part of our professional and investment lives, and no investor can do without it, as it is the leading and safest currency in the market. We trust and believe in Bitcoin, and this trust is the result of many factors and experiences. Bitcoin was able to make many millionaires and eradicate the lives of poverty, so I believe in Bitcoin by 101%, and I see that in the immediate future, we will witness an explosion in the price of Bitcoin.",

I'd always believe in bitcoin and that's why no matter what FUD I see and negative thoughts from billionaires or trillionaires all over the world, it won't matter. Anything they say on it, good or bad will just give exposure to bitcoin and that's the publicity that they'll give to it.

It is very obvious that Bitcoin is everything we need for the market to go up and give up what we need. Those that think that Bitcoin is not for them can keep going in there ignorant perspective of buying crypto projects that may not last longer in the crypto market. It is not bad to hold some altcoins but we also need to hold the most essential coin in the market which is Bitcoin. There is nothing we can do about it we just need to keep holding for the better time the is coming ahead of us.",

You should have asked “do you still believe in cryptocurrency” instead because every other coin follows the trend of bitcoin and if bitcoin should eventually crash (which can never happen) then I believe every other other coin goes down with it. No matter what happens i can never stop believing in it, bitcoin is the future. Though everybody does not have the same mindset so I won’t blame people who don’t believe in it I believe they have their own reasons.",

It's gonna make them doubtful because they haven't seen how the market cycle for bitcoin. But those people like us even if we've got regrets about not buying early and selling at the top, we knew how it will go eventually for the next cycles and years to come. Despite all of those missed out opportunities, this won't make us doubtful on bitcoin because we've seen how it went far and moved as low as it can get on a bear market.",

What's your percentage trust?Apart from one other investment platform that have been flourishing in my country, Bitcoin is my most reliable investment. It is not controlled by any government making it very difficult to manipulate. It is not also controlled by any bank making it a beckon of freedom. Transactions are unlimited and unrestricted making it reliable. Transactions fees are not exploitative like bank controlled fiat. The anonymous and privacy features can make a billionaire live a humble life because nobody knows how much you are worth. The price might be unpredictable but it is better than some currencies that keeps losing value. I believe totally in the Bitcoin project.",
