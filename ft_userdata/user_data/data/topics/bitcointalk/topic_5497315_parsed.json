  "content": "FIRST WHAT'S CRYPTO CURRENCY? A digital currency in which transaction are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system Using cryptography, rather then by a centralized authority. The crypto currency are not centralized authority, so banks don't allowed them. Which are characters in 6 ways. (1) SO WHY BANKS ARE REALLY AGAINST CRYPTOCURRENCY? Cause the volatility of cryptocurrency markets are concerns over security and regulations. They've made many banks cautious about involvement in the crypto space. Some banks have even banned the use of cridit cards for purchasing cryptocurrency, reflecting their hesistancy to embrace the emerging technology full. If only the cryptocurrency are ready to make a good terms with the banks.(2) AND WHY DOES CRYPTO CURRENCY DISRUPT BANKING AS WELL? First from the Centralized to Decentralized finance. The cryptocurrency operates on Blockchains, distributed ledger that records transactions across a vest network of computer. This erases the need for central authorities , creating a more open and transparent financial system. And this also causes the risks for banks. (3) CRYPTOCURRENCY RISKS FOR BANKS?  Risk of fraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants. Legal uncertainties related to custody practice, redemption, and ownership rights, some of which are currently the subject of legal processes and proceedings. And this lead to why they aren't accepted in banks.(4) WHY IS CRYPTO NOT ACCEPTED IN BANKS? The main reason banks do not accepted Bitcoins as legal tender, is because they aren't backed by a central authority. Such as a government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not regulated or guaranteed by any third party. And this will also make the banks to get scared of linking up with crypto currency.(5) THE REASON WHY BANKS ARE SCARED OF BITCOIN? Perhaps the most existential threat Bitcoin poses to banks, is because the potential to render traditional banking systems obsolete. As more Individuals and businesses adopt Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies for their financial transactions, the need for traditional banking services could diminish. And it gonna affect the banks increases accessibility. (6) HOW DOES CRYPTOCURRENCY AFFECT THE BANKS?  In my own opinion, cryptocurrency have had a profound impact on traditional banking. By challenging the status quo and disrupting long-est abolish systems, their decentralized nature, cost advantages, and increased accessibility have implications for both individuals and financial institutions.In December 2022, the Basel committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) announced a new standard for banks which sets a limit of 2% on crypto reserves, defines how to classify cryptocurrencies and makes provision to minimize the risks associated with cryptocurrency exposure. https://www.google.com/search?client=ms-opera-mini-android&sca_esv=8ffd5b3fe64f0225&channel=new&q=Cryptocurrency+risks+for+banks+2021&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdqoux45-GAxXrgf0HHc92BmwQ1QJ6BAgEEAY.Click on the link to no know.So what I'm ultimately getting out here, is that crypto currency can't go in line with banks. What are your thoughts towards this?",

Traditional banks have been against even fintechs because they reduced their customer base, cryptocurrency has the ability to also affect the customer base of these banks that is why they are against it. When we take it from a business perspective, we've got three choices. One is to make the system more effective than the competing one, and this isn't possible with the traditional banking system. The second choice is to get adopted by the technology, and many banking firms have begun to get used to BlockChain technology. The third is to add the services associated with cryptocurrency to the banks so that they can keep their customers even when the surroundings get flooded with cryptocurrency adoption. There is a saying that when competence is high, there'll be more business. This scenario is different with cryptocurrency because of the innovative technology, which needs to be understood beyond a business perspective.",

Some banks have even banned the use of cridit cards for purchasing cryptocurrency, reflecting their hesistancy to embrace the emerging technology full. If only the cryptocurrency are ready to make a good terms with the banks.It is not as bad as you think, although cryptocurrency is reducing the earnings of banks in some ways, yet it is not so serious to the point that banks will now deem it as their core enemy. In my country, it was recently noticed that banks are losing tenths of billions of dollars to cryptocurrency yearly and that can't be a lie because, for instance, initially, I was unable to do any transactions without the involvement of banks and other digital transactions that will still later deal with banks, so banks are having it all at that time. And guess what, it was a huge extortion as they set the fees wickedly high, but now cryptocurrency has saved me, how many more other people would it have saved? So banks are losing in one way or the other due to cryptocurrency, but still, they are making their money even as they declare huge profits yearly.However, what banks are doing that seems to be anti-crypto is not always the fault of the bank but the fault of their regulators. They have to obey the laws of the land even as the central bank and other regulatory agencies are often threatening them with restrictions and sanctions if they do business that is crypto-related.With centralized establishment as well, banks have their share of benefits in cryptocurrency which shows that they are not entirely enemies because no matter how much crypto you bought today, there must be an equivalent in fiat in a certain bank as cryptocurrency buying and selling are merely being exchanging for fiat currencies, and banks always hold fiat. So, the government and regulators are to be blamed here and not the banks.",

Official adoption of Bitcoin by governments will eliminate the need for banks. Banks are centralized and fully regulated, which is completely inconsistent with the principle of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Adopting Bitcoin will make banks useless because most people will turn to acquiring Bitcoin and using it as a means of payment with ease and with a great deal of privacy, instead of entering into a spiral of routine and complex paper transactions for banks with a violation of privacy.",

The fact that people don't need them to hold big amounts of money is something that they are worried about. The ones who control the money are the ones with power, and just think about all the people who die and the bank keeps their money, what a nice business for them... And the fact that if you take a loan from them they charge close to 80% but if you invest with them you only get 3% annually...So, from that perspective banks need their users to have an economy dependency with them, and cryptocurrency cuts that dependency, that's why they don't like cryptos.",

Banks have posted warnings about bitcoin, simply because they comply with the law, and they are not wrong to issue warnings to users when bitcoin has not been legalized by the government. Additionally, misunderstandings or controversies surrounding cryptocurrencies and banking are largely due to many cryptocurrency investors spreading false information that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies were created to replace and overthrow the empire banking institutions and fiat. I believe that these misunderstandings will soon disappear as governments gradually accept and legalize bitcoin.",

Banks and nobody else really cares about altcoins, majority of which are absolutely useless. Not to mention that the bank have created centralized shitcoins known as CBDC or are in the process of creating some (they aren't against something they created themselves).Bitcoin is different but I still wouldn't say they are \"against bitcoin\". Bitcoin as a payment system that doesn't need any third party middle men like the banks has effectively made banks obsolete but at the same time bitcoin is not here to \"replace banks\" so there is no reason for the banks to be against it.QuoteThe main reason banks do not accepted Bitcoins as legal tender, is because they aren't backed by a central authority.The main reason is because the legislation doesn't allow it. Otherwise in a country like El Salvador where it is counted as legal tender the banks accept it as legal tender as well and bitcoin is not backed by any central authority be it in El Salvador or elsewhere!",

Yes that's just the simple truth no body will seat down watching it opponent take away food from his table the fight of fiat  bank, otherwise know as traditional bank is because of the good record of digital currency is becoming more effective, attractive and  attention deriving to customer than the fiat bank so the investor who as well act as patronizing the government connive to fight just to keep their business moving because of they seat and watch they will be left behind as the digital currency will throw them away from the banking space by taking all their customers leaving them with lesser active that can't sustain the business.Example many transaction that bank do perform before is no longer in their custody only few with less technology knowledge runs to bank for transportation, it's because this bank will loss more customers so it's normal thing when competition exist the first in the market will fight to condemn the arrival of the opponent just to remain monopoly.",
