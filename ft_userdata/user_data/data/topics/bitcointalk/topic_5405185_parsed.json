I have some metaverse tokens that bought at the bottom but i have sold all of them at the peak price during december last year. You have made a good decision and the price of hex has been decreasing to the more than what you have bought. Why can you call that as a mistake? https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hex/You will able to buy even more cheap hex but there's no guarantee if this token can go up or not since people known that so well as ponzi",

Why are you still holding or why you soldThrough ICOs and some trendy hype on socials media. I believe in project cause I see a potential on what they are building and my instinct were right. I hold and sold some of the coin I gained a lot but of course, still finding for new ones that can potentially repeat what I gained but so far for now none. Its literallt better to buy low mid cap or down huge cap coins since its bear market and wair for a profit.Not sure if I did a million already but maybe if I add some of my profits that I withdraw or spend maybe it reaches there already.",

If you do not research carefully but only buy according to other people's opinions, you only lose money. Don't go back to blaming him if you don't reach your goal later on because you don't have any investment perspective.",

Since many people did not believe in the crypto market before and only a few bought the first coins and now these people have become rich. At the moment, a metaverse is developing in the Crete industry and I can say that after an indefinite time, many who bought these coins will receive excellent profits. So now make a choice for yourself what to invest in.",

Stories of success involving bitcoin adopters are common and there are even people who wrote books to share their experience and inspire others to thrive in financial world. However, we must be careful with such stories and always look for evidence they are legit, as there are many scammers trying to lure people into altcoin investments promising returns they can't guarantee and telling facts about their personal success that aren't true.",

Selling them at ATH wont make me a millionaire, but it definitely gonna improve my life.

It was PundiX that changed my life, I just accumulated the token from a bounty project here in the forum and hold it for a while. Soon, it pumped so hard that I could make millions in our currency but I sold some of it early thinking it will not reach a higher value than that. I was wrong. It pumped harder but I made a good amount that I afford a house and a lot of things I cannot buy before. I don't even know if I can repeat the same feat, a part of me says I just got lucky or in the right place at the right time.",

With such projects can become a millionaire only the creator of the project, or those who invested earlier, even at the stage of seed investment. This project does not have as much liquidity and capitalization to make ordinary investors millionaires . So, such projects in the long term should be avoided, it is a one-time investment and they pay off only when you enter the project before the crowd. If you went in for $100 and made 50x profit, it doesn't mean that the project will make even more money and with even more investment in the future.",
