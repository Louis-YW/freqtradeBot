      "body": "Yeah, it is definitely an interesting question that requires a broader explanation from Hoskinson himself. How will that be possible? providing privacy and at the same time access to regulators, which part exactly will be private, and which part will be open for regulators' scrutiny?I doubt this is anything near private, you can not claim to have a privacy project and also give access to regulators, he must be misunderstanding the whole concept of a privacy coin.",

Is that just FU because he didn't get Dusk network devs to join even when he allegedly offered to hire them ridiculously lucraticve salary? I am pretty sure that's not a concidence. And now when i am reading about it at the same time, it doesn't sound like anything revolutionary, maybe something like mina and doesn't even compare to what's dusk has been doing.But to the OP:s question, confidential transactions can still be auditable.",

Where is the privacy from the blockchain if it can be accessed by regulators? That's enough to said what he was saying in his whole explanation was actually BS. Monero is more than enough to secure your privacy. You have a good project like monero which has proven its tech.Why need to trust a BS (non)privacy blockchain developed by ADA.

Where is the privacy from the blockchain if it can be accessed by regulators? Well sweet thing with zero knowledge tecnhology is that you can decide what you reveal. And you won't need to provide actual history of anything but the the confirmation that regulators need. However this all needs to happen on layer 1 to make sense and to prevent front running which is something Ada is missing here.Quote from: asriloni on November 29, 2022, 03:57:52 PMWhy need to trust a BS (non)privacy blockchain developed by ADA.

They can get continuous demand because they still have a solid fundamentals compared to most new coins which are only good at hypes. You will see soon that those new coins are the ones who will disappear first more than these old coins.Cardano already disappointed you before but why not gave them a second chance? Everybody deserves it. I think this new update made by Cardano is going to be a game changer for them. This is their answer to the left and right regulations which are happening right now. They want to regain back the privacy of the users.",
