  "content": "üì¢Announcementüî•=== The new SpaceXpanse Multiverse and ROD Coin website is here! ====== The new project's roadmap is also ready.. ====== https://www.spacexpanse.org/ =====================What is SpaceXpanse ROD coin?SpaceXpanse ROD coin is the native cryptocurrency of the SpaceXpanse Multiverse platform. And the ROD blockchain and its core wallet serve as the foundational layer in the platform, providing essential functions such as secure value storage, transaction processing, mining, and network connectivity for users to interact with the blockchain network. Additionally, the ROD core wallet serves as a tool for users to manage their ROD holdings and participate in various activities within the platform, further enhancing its utility.See more about the platform here.What does SpaceXpanse ROD blockchain do?‚úî Create, store and transact its main cryptocurrency - ROD coins, fungible and nonfungible tokens /NFTs/.‚úî Support two PoW algorithms: neoscrypt-xaya and SHA-256d - for merged mining, generating blocks every 30 seconds in 3 to 1 ratio.‚úî Grant halving the block reward every year for 5 years, then ~3% annual inflation of the block reward for 59 years.‚úî Allow register and transfer of arbitrary names /digital IDs/ for trustless user identification, which can hold and transfer value.‚úî Provide fare amount of secure data storage in every block, delivering possibility for near real-time communication between the nodes.‚úî Support Atomic trading for exchange of in-game assets (fungible currencies as well as non-fungible items) in a trustless manner.‚úî Possess Play-to-Earn functionality, which allows a part of the block rewards to be \"placed\" inside a decentralized application /DApp/, where users can pick/win them up and bank them to their on-chain address. /WIP/What do we want to achieve?QuoteTo put the technology to real work at lastBy putting the crypto technology back on track, we are making a self-sustaining virtual environment, which we called SpaceXpanse Multiverse, where people can communicate, create, have fun, and which can be easily accessed by anyone from anywhere.How we will make it happen?QuoteWith some help from the Open-source communityThe whole project will be carefully structured and will gradually broaden the scope of its tasks in a span of four years to avoid any roadblocks on its path.COIN SPECIFICATIONName: SpaceXpanseTicker: RODSymbol: …åAddress Letter: RAddress Header: 60P2SH Header: 75Port: 11998RPC Port: 11999Algorithm: neoscrypt-xaya and SHA-256d, for merged mining - ChainID:1899Block Reward: 800 ROD¬π, halving every 1,054,080 blocks /~1 year/ for 5 years, then imposing ~3% inflation for another 59 years when the supply will reach ~2.5 fold increment from before the start of inflation.Reward distribution: 75%/25% - 3 neoscrypt-xaya blocks and 1 SHA256d block every 4 blocks.Block Time: 30 secondsSpend: 6 confirmationsBlock: 120 confirmationsStorage: A name-value database for storing and updating entries in each block.

So you have to adjust your spacexpanse.conf file to accept calls from outside the computer you have your wallet running. Something like:Code:server=1daemon=1listen=1externalip=txindex=1reindex=1rpcuser=changeuserrpcpassword=changepassrpcallowip=192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0rpcport=11999and change the IP mask with your network's one if different. Then you have to point the miner to tour computer's wallet address: 192.168.0.120:11999. That's all.",

      "body": "Hello again, here's the latest news.. ¬†Read below @everyone. After some serious head scratching and testing, a decision was made: to make the block award equal to 800 ROD with halving every 1,054,080 blocks /~1 year/ for 5 years and then impose ~3% inflation on the supply of that exact moment until 59 years are passed and the supply reaches ~2.5 fold increment. But let me put this into some context to help you understand the reasons behind it:The problem we're facing was to have enough supply of coins for steady development in the SpaceXpanse platform for the first few years of its existence. Not only the supply we'll need in the projects we have to develop but for any other in it. So our initial idea was to increment the divider COIN in the code /so called Satoshi/ to 10 instead of 8 but after serious backlash from the control group /our friends and colleagues/ we decided against it. If you're interested in the reasons: main, but only, was the confusion and eventual losses it will cause when just looking at the digits or buying ROD at an exchange e.g. 0.00000001 against 0.0000000001. So the only option left for us was to increase the award hundredfold to 800 ROD per block in the beginning. This way at the end of the 5th year and block award 50 ROD we will have 1,833,823,998 ROD. Then the 3% per year inflation will kick in and by applying the rule of 72 after ~59 years and we will end with ~4,615,066,365 ROD. But let's just say /for example / that we'll have 500,000,000 users in the SpaceXpanse platform then. This will give us a little bit more than 9 ROD per user which is clearly unsubstantial for smooth work of the system. So to avoid that and for some other reasons we're introducing bar as the smallest undividable part of ROD /instead of Satoshi/ and KBar and MBar as fellow members of the ROD family. Then we'll have some ~923,000,000 bars for everyone to deal with in the SpaceXpanse platform, which looks more than enough to grow some tycoons there.  So to be clear: these changes are introduced because we want SpaceXpanse to have smooth growth in the years to come and to be fair and square with its users. That was it! The new wallet passed the Regression and pre-release tests with flying colors so we'll introduce it to the public later today.. Stay tuned. P.S. And for those who will ask why the premine was 199999998 ROD to start with, which will give us some gruesome advantage over everybody else, the answer is: we weren't unaware of before-mentioned problem, so if we've decided to stay with 8 ROD per block, we're ready to burn a substantial amount of the premine into oblivion to regain the balance. P.P.S. The new wallet will be mandatory and it will refuse connections to the old one, if somebody's wondering about that. Also because everything with the blockchain's looking good enough, with the new wallet we're moving the end of pre-release/testing period closer - it will last till block 55560 which is ~ 1st of July ~12:00PM UTC. After that the award will be 800 ROD per block instead of 1 ROD.",

But if this quote below can't give you an answer, let me put it that way: we're not making this for the money, maybe not only because without money there's no progress . Actually it was really frustrating that the blockchain and technology behind it became investment tool rather than tool to help people and businesses deal with some day-to-day obstacles. Because of that we don't care that much about the ROD price but about ROD usability. We want the price to be controlled by real supply and demand and not by something else.
