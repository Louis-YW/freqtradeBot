      "body": "I think you should spend a little more time growing your channel before offering promotion. Both of your channels are receiving an average of 10 - 15 views per video at best. You should also describe what is entailed in \"sharing\" your link. Will you create a video dedicated to what you are promoting? Will it be an advertisement at the start of future videos? Will the link just be in your bio?",

      "body": "Your first channel has only 24 subscribers and second one has 1.54k but it doesn't seem to have been active since the last video was uploaded 3 months ago, and the videos have an average of 5 views per video which is very low according to what most other promoters that I have been working with.You will need to work a bit on your channels to grow them more popular in terms of views and subscribers and also make your channels more active to offer any services through them. Just my thoughts; probably might help you to get clients quicker than you could assume. Good luck!",
