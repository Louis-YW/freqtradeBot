You think?If they had this for CB Pro I’d probably be all over it.. I LOVE zero fee trading because I can make tons of tiny % gains quite easily (usually).. HUOBI with small margin both ways and zero trade fees was like exchange paradise..Wash trading, fake volume, whatever you want to say about zero fee exchanges, it is what works the best for my trading style..What say you?BTW trade fees on CB are high..When I use CB I always transfer to CB Pro and use that for less trade fees and use limit orders instead of market orders to further reduce my fees..Cash app is really the easiest way for me to buy instantly without having a USD balance sitting on CB or whatever, but cash app fees are insane high..$30 fee on a $2000 buy on cash app.. ridiculous!!!",

Like me, I will prefer a $30 monthly charges if using up to $5000 to trade actively daily, but that is future trading though. Exchanges are really making what we think is a small percentage to make money in just a single day, with very low amount single trade on Binance while trading derivatives, $5000 worth of trading amount will deduct almost $2 for makers and $4 for takers if not more. Some traders can open and close two or more positions daily. But that for trading derivatives which requires lower trading fee percentage if compared to spot trading except that future traders can leverage more which will also have more trading fee in amount.But this will depends on individuals.",
