Do your own research (DYOR)  is a term used in cryptocurrency, to advice investors not to invest on something they don't know about. There are various reasons why you should do your own research, some are: You get to know more on what you are investing  It gives you reason to know if the coin or token is worth investing It makes it easier not to fall into Scam projects  To know the right time to buy and sellThere are lots of reasons for doing your own research but sometimes it is hard to know what you need to focus on, when doing the research. Some are:What do you want to know :Before doing a research, you must know what is the reason for undergoing the research. It may be to know the Return on investment (Roi) , if the coin or token is a scam project or othersCheck the Economic status of that coin or Token :To know about the trading volume, market cap, liquidity and others Check the community :Check the team developers, how organised and structured their website, social media handles are, read the comments sections on their handles. Study their Whitepaper:To know what the token or coin was created for and how it works Search for individuals and companies supporting the projects : Good tokens or coins most times have top individuals and companies supporting them  There are others but this are some of the basics and lastly   Check for any Red flag about the project  Researching is a continuous thing because after investing, You still need to be informed about any update on the project",

There are quite a lot of popular influencers who promote scam projects, celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather and some others have got themselves into trouble before for promoting a scam project. These popular individuals do these things to profit from it, most times they do not know anything about what the project offers. Bitcoin is the best crypto, yet it does not have any known top individual supporting/promoting it per se, it is all on the community, it just has an actual utility, and that's enough to convince people to use it.I'd rather suggest people do their research by basically looking at the utility/use case of the project, is it something that can help solve problems in RL, and whatsoever the project is promising, is it something feasible? Because quite a lot of them lie in their whitepaper, they just copy one fake promise from a dead project and paste it in theirs.",

It's very possible that some people would not do research before investing in any project they see because, at times, they feel so influenced by the person advertising the project but the statement DYOR would let them know they are doing so at their own risk and not coming back to blame the advertiser. That's the reason why I agreed to your second point.There were two DeFi projects I encountered last year. One of these projects would allow you to buy any amount of their token, but you would only have to sell 2% of your holding every day. The other project allows you to buy their token, but to sell, you will need to spend 10% of the gas fee from BNB and 10% of the token, of which some who do not Do Their Own Research may end up regretting the terms.",

Also Bitcoin growth can not be compared with other cryptocurrency basically its still the best cryptocurrency to invest in, only few altcoins that has good Whitepaper and basically the best altcoin is Ethereum because of the use of SolidityQuote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on April 03, 2023, 04:47:51 PMI disagree with fact four: DYOR doesn't let one know the best time to buy and sell.

There are various reasons why you should do your research, some are:The most important reason why you should do your research is so that you will not blame another person for your own mistake. People like depending on other people's financial advice or investment analysis because they don't want to take responsibility for their actions. They fail to understand that although there are people who have a vast knowledge of the bitcoin space, the sector is unpredictable. Most of these influencers have no practical knowledge about Bitcoin, yet people follow them on social media and accept their financial advice. People fail to understand they these influences are businessmen and women that are paid for their service and they don't necessarily care about the outcome of the investment.",

Project teams meet these people, who they know have the power of the internet, pay them, and tell them exactly what to do, and that's exactly what they are going to do because they are paid to do it. Let's take, for instance, the people advertising 1xBet on social media, comedy videos, news sites, etc.; does that make 1xBet a legitimate casino safe for betting? I'm not completely saying that there are no better ways of making better investment decisions, but if we rely on all of the above-listed facts alone, we might all be victims of one big scam one day.",

This kind of people doing their own research is just a waste of time. Generally the phrase \"do your own research\" has some latentmeaning in the forum, which I personally think I have been able to understand. What that really means is that someone that is giving you that advice is not stating that you should take it as a financial advice because they will not be liable for your losses or gains. So telling you to do your own research is indirectly telling you that every decision you make is assumed to come from your own research and you take full responsibility of the consequences of your decisions.",
