  "content": "It is good to have some good news after the scam of Sam, however, after reading the article I was head shaking after every paragraph. Encouragement of self custody and the use of decentralized exchanges is admirable but I reckon the writer of this article does not know the differences between bitcoin, wbtc, ethereum, bisq, uniswap and sushiswap.However, it is still good for everyone to know that solutuons are being created. It might not be the best solutions, however, they are certainly better than centralized exchanges.I did not include those parts of the article where I speculate was only added by the author because I think self custody should always be encouraged.CNBC caught up with the 44-year-old patriarch a few days after the family made the move from Lagos, Portugal, to Phuket, an island just off the western coast of mainland Thailand in the Andaman Sea. The family is currently living on 0.3 bitcoin a month — about $5,000 — and they are buying back the bitcoin that they sold when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $55,000 a year ago. For the Taihuttus, the cascade of crypto bankruptcies and failed tokens just shows that “bitcoin is the king” and “completely different than all the other projects,” Didi Taihuttu said.n crypto, one of the mantras is “not your keys, not your coins,” meaning that rightful possession of tokens comes through the custody of the corresponding private keys.Read in full and scratch your heads https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/bitcoin-family-moving-more-than-1-million-into-dexs-after-ftx-collapse.html",

What they do is convert BTC to fiat (when they can't pay in BTC) to pay their day to day expenses. And with the money left over, they buy BTC again.They had several years to live in Portugal, and they always made their life based on Bitcoin. Now that the laws in Portugal are going to change, and the cost of living in Europe is going to increase, they have wisely moved to another country that is more favorable, to maintain their lifestyle, always based on Bitcoin.",

So it is more different to a collapse of Bitcoin.Indeed, even though it crashes the Bitcoin market when the news if FTX collapse spreads, it doesn't mean that it is the end of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is bigger than FTX and Bitcoin market will prove it sooner or later.After the series of the collapse of centralized exchanges, it is normal for wise people to learn from what they experience or saw.  So it isn't a surprise of more and more Bitcoin holders avoid keeping their Bitcoin in centralized exchanges and take responsibility for themselves to keep their Bitcoins in their wallets.",

Now, am not saying we should not get involved with them anytime but we have to be choosy and always use CEX when really necessary. Right now, the reputation of CEX is down to almost zero and this is the way it should be. People are going back to the very tenet of cryptocurrency which is decentralization and it is taking the loss of billions of dollars for the industry to be really alarmed.",

I can only hope that more people will follow such examples and take the matter of storing their coins more seriously than they did before the FTX.We know that people do really learn up lessons on the hardest way or into something which they had already commit out those common mistakes which is something that a very common scenario that do happen intothis market on where people do end up on being that too confident and too careless with their assets which they do really make out these centralized platforms for being their main wallet.Doesnt matter if this one involves that Bitcoin family or an average joe, it would always falls or boils down into the same concept and overall idea that coins shouldnt really be stored up into something which you dont really possess the keys. We do know the risk but there are eventually situations which it cant really be avoided to make use of these centralized platformsspecially when we do really make out some conversions out of coins aside on doing that p2p which we know that it is really risky personally.Time and time, people will encounter situations to remind them of what's need to be done with their assets. But take note, moving into decentralized exchanges may also pose risk to them, in whatever form it maybe. What is the chance that the future of ethereum tokens is always bright? But I believe, that $1M they are moving to DEXs is not their whole assets.I am sure that they will also retain some to BTC and other top alts on their own wallets, which they have full control of, as stated from this article.They believe that BTC is still their \"solid bet\", despite of all the drama they encountered throughout the years. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/bitcoin-family-moving-more-than-1-million-into-dexs-after-ftx-collapse.html",

This, of course, does not mean that he does not have other tokens, but the focus is on saving BTC.",

This guy is simply explaining his future plans. He didn't say \"I will move all my coins to this particular DEX\" or \"I will invest coins in this particular DEX startup\". He can do whatever he wants with his own money/coins.There's nothing wrong with him having future partnerships with crypto companies, as long as the crypto companies aren't scams and he discloses the fact that he is being paid to promote them. He isn't some kind of massive social media celebrity, so I don't think that any crypto business is going to bother paying him for shilling/promotion.",

So, aside from probably speaking engagements and guesting there since they're now known as the bitcoin family.There could be endless opportunities for them to get invited somewhere. That budget is a lot if it's somewhere from Asia except in Japan and Singapore but still, that's already more than enough.",
