  "content": "What happened:: Stake scammed me for 0.14892000 BTCHey everyone,Long term customer on stake (3 years).I have lost about 2 million USD on their platform during this time- I have encountered many issues with the sports provider scamming not only myself but other players as well.Typically, stake support was good at resolving these issues but lately? Not a chance. This is mainly due to the fact that the sports team and all of support dislike me personally and are all racist towards me.sport:81744842I placed this bet and immediately after placing the bet, I turned on the live video for the game and noticed the score was wrong.I contacted support IMMEDIATELY and they ignored me for about 5 hours- by that point, not only did the match with the wrong score and wrong odds lose but so did another one of my matches.This is a strategy by stake so that they can respond and say “well your other selections lost anyways” simply a scam method on their end that may work with an amateur.Issue with the multi was the e sports matchMinnesota Timberwolves (Hunarik) vs Phoenix Suns (Shag)The score and odds were wrong on 5 different occasions.Stake refuses to do anything. I have filed a complaint with multiple third party agencies that deal with complaints and also have contacted curaçao gaming.I should also mention that I am a diamond player.Stay away from these trash cans. In addition to being scammers, they have lowered all bonuses ten fold.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2072589.100Amount Scammed: 0.14892000 BTC / 4020 USDPayment Method: BitcoinsProof of wrong score https://ibb.co/fDWmDXVhttps://ibb.co/1ZWnj9Ghttps://ibb.co/TRx4wCFhttps://ibb.co/njwwtY2Match can be viewed here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ00y1iMidc&feature=youtu.be@Micro @StunnaIf you guys don’t refund me within 24 hours, I will be taking this to the next level.",
