  "content": "Hi, I just downloaded Bitcoin core to transfer my bitcoin from an exchange into a wallet. Right after my transaction had started, my bitcoin core crashed, and I wasnt able to record the private key or anything. The error message I get when I try to open is this: Error initializing settings: Failed loading settings file:- Unable to parse settings file /Users/jwiraj99/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/settings.json.I saw another post talking about how I need to delete the content of my settings.json file, but I do not have this file, so I have no clue what to do.I am the least tech savvy person and really screwed up with this so any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Back up that file before you do anything else so you're sure you can't delete it accidentally.Being without a settings file sounds OK as long as you still have the wallet.dat and it hasn't been corrupted. Did you encrypt your wallet?I'd recommend going straight to trying to do a reinstall or download the binaries from bitcoincore.org and try to see what you get access to.When you load up your wallet with core it'll say 0 for a quite a while because it also needs to sync. But once you see the address again, it'll become a lot easier to get the funds out if you need them quickly or to wait for the software to sync.",

Click here to know the default location of bitcoin core data directory. If you neither have the wallet.dat nor the private key, there won't be any way to recover the fund.",

I just guess that your library folder may be hidden. Quote from: jwi5 on December 14, 2022, 12:10:35 AMI actually realized that I never even created a private key.

The address you got and sent bitcoin to has been generated from a private key. That private key can be easily exported if you can open your wallet.",

If you don't see it load after restarting, and get the \"is already loaded\" message when you try to open it, post the contents of the debug.log file. There may be some corruption happening.",
