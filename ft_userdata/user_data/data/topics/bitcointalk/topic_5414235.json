  "content": "MicroStrategy buys 301 BTC at an average price of $19,851.00 or worth 6M$.Everyone knows this is the ultimate bearish indicator. The price is now bearish due to the upcoming Feds meeting regarding interest rate too. Are you shorting the news? What price do you think is the bottom considering the interest rate that Feds released is too high to what economist expecting?",

MSTR is doing the same thing those of us who believe in the future of Bitcoin do, buy more now when it is cheap. In general doing DCA is a good strategy, which is what I do, as do many people and also MSTR who have done a kind of DCA, but the DCA does not have to be the same exact amount at the same exact time intervals. It is smarter to take advantage of these times to buy more.",

They are underwater now, based on their average buy price.

He keeps buying the dip that’s why social media people are using his tweet as signal for more bearish movement since it was proven multiple times already.There’s really no clear logic behind if you are expecting a TA or FA on this kind of post.

What price do you think is the bottom considering the interest rate that Feds released is too high to what economist expecting?When the interest rate increases, we have historically seen people moving out of non-traditional investment and investing in traditional assets. That's probably what's happening in the market now. But that is not a permanent situation, it's super temporary. I believe Microstrategy is bullish in long term holding of bitcoin. They are trying to do cost averaging it seems as their previous purchases are made at a higher price. It does not tell us which direction the market will take to be honest.",

People wont really be putting up much interest or attention if we do see these purchases on bull period but now when themarket is on deep reds then this is where people do really put up some emphasis or recognition that this might be a sign of bull run or recovery is on when these institutions is really making purchases without even trying to look back that they've been doing this if ever they do see the price had a good entry point.This isnt sign but rather a casual purchase of coins whenever they do see its worth to buy in.",
