It is not even gambling but a means to earn little amount of money that does not worth your time, or maybe my time.",

The only viable and sustainable model for apps to be able to offer regular payments is to share some of their revenue with users. And as most of their revenue would be generated from ads (assuming non-gambling apps), the best you could get is a tiny fraction of what they get paid from advertisers to show you ads, so almost never worth the effort.",

Coz to answer your question, these are most likely not gonna work until they get to make people to deposit and put their money into the game to put value with their coin. While gambling doesn't offer free money without you making any deposits first. If the gambling website offers you free money where you can use it to place a bet, believe me, you'll be ask for the deposit on the latter when you request for a withdrawal.",

I remember seeing those offers on some micro earning apps and sites where you can pick tasks and they tend to give the highest rewards since they usually require you to download games or apps and possibly put in your credit card as well. The risky part when doing these tasks is that there's always a chance that the reward doesn't come in even though you've completed everything.",

If one could successful convert such earns from these games or other apps, these monies could be used to get gift cards or could be withdrawn in some instances. In most cases, those apps are all waste of time. If I'm sure about it, these apps you are referring to do have tons of advertisements.Unfortunately, no one can even confirm if they are paying since no one can even reach the requirements to become eligible for the payment. Some users will advance fast on their early progress but when it's only at least 1-2% needed to complete the required tier, that's the time something not right will happened and the progress will stuck now, for let's say 98%.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on January 18, 2023, 09:34:47 PMFor most cases where the earnings cannot be converted, but purchases could be made with bank cards, to fund them, what is best adviced?How real are some of these winnings/earnings, incase anyone has had luck cashing their gaming/other apps wins to real cash/gift item?We can give you much better and more accurate responses if you can give examples of the apps you are referring to.But as I mentioned, mostly it's a waste of time.",

There are advertisements that tells you that even if you just download the app, you will earn $100 and you will also start making money as you play. Do not mind those adverts, they are not real. I payed axie for a while and would've made a profit on my $240 buy in if I sold the tokens I earnt when I'd earned them after playing it for about a week or two for about half an hour a day (I was familiarising myself with NFTs so don't think it was time wasted).If you're buying into something that's new, it'd make sense just to buy the token once you've researched it (when released, games can be bad for graphics too until there are enough initial tests done).If you plan to install anything, I'd recommend getting familiar with creating a virtual machine and then you'll keep your wallets as safe as possible. If you're playing nft games.a lot require you to share a code between the machine the game is on and the website (with your wallet connected). Anything more than that is probably a bit sketchy. Your wallet will also try to make sense of what you're signing so if you're more used to understanding these messages then you'll also be a bit safer (ie spotting the difference between sending funds and signing a message in the wallet software you need to use to connect).",

There have been reports that in game purchases could be recorded by those and you'll be enticed to do that when they've got some good offers that you can't ignore. At the same time, as you download and install, it could also be included to the user term agreement that a malware might be attached on it not knowingly you've got it already monitoring all you do in your app and phone.But I don't think that this has something to do with gambling.",

I have been browsing the Play Store for quite some time looking for a casual game that would entertain me while I am waiting for my kid from school. I can tell there are lots of games now that are free to play and give out rewards but I won't download them in a rush if I were you. Most of them have advertisements inside, long ones, and a 30-second feed mostly. Are they real? Some do, but it takes time before you can withdraw it because the minimum for withdrawal is an amount that you will need to play for months to achieve it. My wife tried to do it once, but after withdrawal, she never played it again. It will bore you to the core and will be stressed by the ads popping up.Oh, and Google cannot always keep you safe, there are too many files in your storage that will be left when you are done with it.",

No other options but to research deeply on that specific game and find some reviews. Just be careful as sometimes, reviews are not generic, and maybe good reviews are for cover-up only to make the app goods look.Another option is to play those apps in actual and see if your effort and patience can keep up.",

I mean how much are you going to win? I think it's not that big and not worth to try it because you might compromised your mobile phone or your computer, just saying. I used to download this kind of apps way before there is crypto, like ptc and others, I I would say that the pay is so small that its not worth your time.",
