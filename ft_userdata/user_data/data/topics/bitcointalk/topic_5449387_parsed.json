  "content": "The world of Web3 gaming is still relatively new and uncharted territory. Many gamers are interested in trying Web3 games but discovery, onboarding, and fear of scams remain significant hurdles. Our mission is to solve those issues by providing an onboarding experience as simple, fast, and secure as starting any traditional game, with the added benefit of having all your Web3 assets securely at your disposal no matter what game youâ€™re playing.Are you looking for a Web3 game that is fun, engaging, and might even give you a chance to earn? Tired of scrolling through various forums and sub-channels? Superb.games is building a definitive list of all available Web3 games. Weâ€™re also building tools that find and highlight Web3 games that stand out for their quality, innovation, and ease of access.Trying out a typical Web3 game is often a frustrating and complicated experience. To solve this, weâ€™re building Superb Walletâ€”a cross-chain, automatic wallet that will provide you with quick and easy access to every Web3 game. It will support all major (and minor) blockchains and comes with built-in access to the biggest NFT marketplaces.
