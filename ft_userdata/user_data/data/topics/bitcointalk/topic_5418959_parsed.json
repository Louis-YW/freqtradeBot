For a simple project, they have a website and they include all of the people behind the team that's working for it.Gaining trust from investors is hard and that's why I agree to jawhead that there's a need for your project a purpose. If it's the same as the others that have just gained money from the community, you're not getting any trust from anybody.",

Lol, this is a sign if your project is scam and only to get money.I would like to ask in response, what are you talking about?I have already begun to analyze this topic and, as I expected, this is a fairly common approach in the crypto community. It is not so easy for project owners to pass KYC and it costs more than a couple of dollars...For example, even on pinksale.finance, this service costs $750 and requires verification of the owner's identity.If we consider the company solidproof.io, then the cost of their services for verifying project owners starts at $1,500. Of course, it is worth noting that the cost of these services includes the initial promotion of the project.In addition, there are aggregators that provide such services and value their reputation. For example, stakingrewards.com",

So people judge the product, not the owner or developers. And within that scenario and in the cryptocurrency world, decentralization should be encouraged, hence its characteristic is tied to the product. So, there is no way the user relied upon the developer or owner.Kindly look at Bitcoin, do we know the owner? Nope. Do people still invest in it? Yep. And as we should have known the saying, don't trust, verify!Quote from: RemanCrypto on October 31, 2022, 04:43:38 PMWhat organizations are there that provide KYC for project owners?IIRC, there was some project that solve owner identity verifiability for its users with the owner's privacy in mind, but I forgot the name. Nevertheless, I don't think there is a point in it. Back to the reason above.",

Like the people behind the projects. Usually these people behind the project are being doxxed to give assurance to investors that they are really building the project but dont easily believe if its just on website, cause chances that these people social accounts are just being used. Dig deeper to check or much better confirm via call and check their social if they are really posting about it.",

For example, stakingrewards.comSo basically you want to launch a project, and need a launchpad to raise funds, but you don't want to do KYC because you need to pay those platforms? Even if there was another reason that you can't prove that the project developer is real, building trust is hard if all you have is an empty promise. Build an MVP at the very least, make it usable, and post it on the forum or other communities to build your name. The landscape is different from the ICO boom phase where people happily throw money on anonymous teams because they love memes.EDIT: Looks like OP already start selling his project with the usual 15% return per year ads.",
