Visitors must be given an opportunity to browse the site completely before logging in.Also, the rules on the registration page do not give clear information about the site’s policy. All that is present is general advice about the risks of gambling and a disclaimer of any risk assumed by users.The advice is good, of course, but it is not the site's policy. The site's policy must be written in detail so that all users can see it before registering and not after registering on the site.",

Just created a throw away account here because I'm a bit curious, that's why I can say you will not find ToS or other terms. Below is the only rules they have: They have Randomizer page but it looks so simple, unlike what I used to see in other reputable casinos. I'm surprised to see someone has wagered more than 7btc, 500k doge, 240k trx, and some other coins in this brand new dice site. Who is in this world who want to take a risk that much money in a new dice like this?",

Cause, seem like just not right by basic due diligency check.I think the same about this casino and I agree with you that these points raised some red flags... and when there are red flags, I mean if there's even one red flag, people should be extra careful. By that I mean we should avoid making deposits, but if someone decides to check the casino despite all the red flags, he should make some small deposit. Well, Isabel needs a different approach... she needs to be more cooperative, and if she behaves nicely she can get nice advice on how to improve her casino, after all, there are many experienced people here.",

And almost all coins and tokens today have a casino dedicated to the token itself. i don't think there are serious players coming from the forum. because if you have no idea about their terms, are you going to create an account blindly? the regular route before signing up is they will ask if you agree to their terms. but here, it says their rules, not their terms and conditions. so don't know if they are running legit here.though the domain with uncommon extension is not the sole factor in determining if the site is scam or not. but why it is indeed not available to view the details of its registration? so that's really quite questionable for one.

Website extension doesn’t matter anymore since many scam casino is already using .com and other “premium” extension just to look like a legit casino while it just cost few dollars because the domain name is what matters anymore to determine premium of the website. I honestly will have to disagree with you here, there is actually a big difference in having to doubt or speculate whether a site is a scam or not due to their level of commitment both in monetary terms, in build and launching something that is really appealing to people, this can not be compared to the site that doesn't want to spend a dime of their own money in their bid or quest to scam unsuspecting victims. I personally sometimes don't feel too bad when I am scammed by a site that clearly spent alot of money to make their site appear so legitimate and trustworthy. But nothing angers me like falling victim of scam or a site that even a 5 years old child should know it's a scam site from the way it was poorly designed and most important parts of the sites being built by things that are completely free of charge. Quote But on this case, The website is clearly new and offer only dice game that is already widely offer by all casino. I doubt many user will be interested to deposit here while there’s tons of games as options in different casino.And here, you are wrong again, this site is not new as you claimed, the domain age according to scam adviser is 2 year old, a platform that have operated for 2 whole years can't be considered new I believe, you can verify this on https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/dicex.ccFor a platform or domain to be considered new, it has to be in between the age of 1 to 100 days.",

And @aliveNFT is trying to know is that, he has to navigate around the site first to see if the site is good to gamble and if the terms and conditions are nice for him to go in. And the first thing he meant as he visited the site was to register (sign up) and login (sign in) when he has not seen anything in the site. I have said this in money of the newly created ANN threads. Really it is not nice to register to a casino which you have not seen anything rules. Op if you are part of the developers then you guys should remove or separate the registration button and sign in button from the main page and keep it at the corner of the home page.
