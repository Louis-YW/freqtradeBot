  "content": "A click-baity headline fro the Economist. The very first sentence says it all: \"No. But the theory is spreading online\".Article is hidden behind pay-wall, but can be accessed e.g. hereDid bitcoin leak from an American spy lab?https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/04/did-bitcoin-leak-from-an-american-spy-labQuoteThe origins of covid-19 remain unknown. Most scientists think it jumped from wild animals to humans at a meat market in Wuhan. But it is also possible it escaped from a virology research lab in the same city.Now a similar argument has broken out around bitcoin, the first and most used cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s accepted origin is that it was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous coder, who published a paper describing it in 2008 before later vanishing from sight.But a theory circulating online holds that bitcoin was dreamed up by the National Security Agency (nsa), an American spy agency that also does cutting-edge cryptography research. “I think it was a shuttered internal r&d project which one researcher thought was too good to lay fallow on the shelf and chose to secretly release,” tweeted Nic Carter, a prominent bitcoin fan. Mr Carter and his fellow travellers think they have a smoking gun: a paper written in 1996 by nsa employees entitled “How to make a mint: the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash”. And the paper cites work by a researcher named “Tatsuaki Okamoto”.(...)",

And sheeple becomes a new kind of meme.  I didn't know Bitcoin was meant to overthrow any government, I must've missed the briefing. As far as I know, it was meant to provide an alternative to the flawed financial systems.And yeah, since the beginning there have been theories about BTC being a US intelligence project, and the fact there was no real resistance to let the BTC market grow to its current size seems to confirm this. But, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter, as long as it's an open-source and as long as Craig Wright is not confirmed to be the real Satoshi",

Tweet from Nic Carter, Tatsuaki Okamoto coincidence, NSA, hell even the Covid-19 analogy. Does the same journalist writes on the Economist?Quote from: stompix on October 07, 2023, 05:33:04 PMBut imagine this being true, some users around here might need some extra pills if they find out the thing that was supposed to overthrow the government is a tool leaked by the government to control the masses!Work like Bitcoin could be government-funded. I mean it occurs often in bureaucratic systems to pay someone to open a hole and another to close it. As I have said in the duplicated thread, it does make some sense that peer-to-peer electronic cash was a concept that began from within the government, and took a more anarchistic shape when someone saw they could forestall the financial advantage.",

Taaki was even regularly featured as a Bitcoin expert in British mainstream media (many appearances on BBC). Good old days.",
