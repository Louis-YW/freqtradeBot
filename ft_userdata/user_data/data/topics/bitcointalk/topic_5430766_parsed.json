Every NATO base and its neighboring cities are potential targets for Russia's nukes.A non-NATO country which isn't in Europe would be a good idea but there isn't many of those countries. Maybe in Africa... But then there will be other problems.",

You might be safe if you live somewhere near the north pole or south pole because there won't be anyone who will gonna fire some nuke there because obviously, they are wasting some Amo. But today's nuke is not really the same as before and it would be much stronger and deadly if they happened to fire even a single one.",

But understand -- if the world bursts into a nuclear war there is no safe place but an underground bunker with a large food supply. It's not that you would be killed by a nuke or the nuclear radiation necessarily, it's that global supply chains would be disrupted and your local grocery store has less than a week of supplies before the shelves are empty. If people panic buy, than the shelves empty out in less than a day. Under this scenario, there is no safe location where you live in luxury.

A non-align or a neutral nation would be the best place to find refuge if there is war in Europe and the US. Most of these nations are in the Middle-East and Africa. North Africa, Namibia, South Africa, Uganda and Cape Verde could be potential countries to seek refuge in. These countries have to a large extend good facilities and favorable weather conditions.",

I do not want a very serious war to begin please, but if it turns out like that, relocating to an island country that is safe with little population may be good. A country that no affiliation with either the United states or Russia incase the war concerns them. If it is a full scale war, many countries will feel the effects, It is a matter of the side where the effect of the war will not be most deadly.

'Staying safe' means entirely different things to different people.

Â Most of people who think they might be 'stay safe' there are the enemy to those who call the shots.

Â Fool yourself into thinking that by unquestionably chowing down on their globalist bullshit you will be somehow favored for that reason alone at your peril.Australia is among the biggest theoretical risks to post-reset New Zealand. Â Relatively close by sea, and a technologically advanced people with a potential for a cultural understanding of New Zealand elite. Â I conjecture that it is why Australia eclipses even Canada in terms of totalitarian crackdowns and burgeoning human degradation/depopulation programs, and Freemasons are good at such things. Â I'm going to laugh loudly when the real powers in New Zealand slams the door in their face after doing Yeomans work in mitigating the future Australian threat. Â Most of the current globalist minions will be fed to the wolves in a giant and very bloody sacrifice.Now, every post-great-reset power center does need a supply of 'clean' children and body tissues.
