Would you use it?Honestly, I'm not sure who can really be the target audience, but as someone who rarely uses any of the popular social media platforms, I couldn't find a reason to change that habit with the platform in question [perhaps I'm missing something... It's not a decentralized one, am I right?].Quote from: SeeBiscuit on November 27, 2022, 03:23:55 AMDo you like the UI, themes, and overall appearance of Network Bin? We would love to hear feedback.I do know that the subject field says you were inspired by this forum, but this kind of style doesn't look very good for social networking platforms.",
