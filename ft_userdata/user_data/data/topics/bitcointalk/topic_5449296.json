      "body": "Hi,I wanted to thank you for this tool. I just now made my first confirmed transaction using this tool and I sent you a small donation to the address in the software. For a few weeks I have been trying to figure out a way to move UTXOs from an old legacy paper wallet without having to purchase a third party hardware wallet and I also really wanted to use an old air-gapped 32-bit netbook I have to sign the transaction. The netbook is running windows xp. I was finally able to broadcast a transaction and your software was instrumental in allowing me to do so, so I thank you very much. I was able to learn quite a bit about the btc blockchain and how to unlock btc on my old paper wallets. Many thanks!I am an intermediate programmer and I had to make a few tweaks to your code in order to get the signer to run on the netbook using an Opera v36 browser. I also found it useful to remove the \"disabled\" tag from the html input fields for the input and output sections of the create transaction tab.I don't know if it would be worth it but maybe you could add an extremely bare bones signer that might more easily run on older systems for people like myself wishing to use old outdated netbooks/laptops/etc to do the signing of the transaction.If you want more details on what I changed just let me know, I plan on doing some more tweaking to it.Anyway thanks again for posting this. It was the final key to a long search and many attempts using various approaches to getting my old netbook to sign a transaction.",

Even if the project is legit we should be really careful with our private keys and never trust a third-party software. I did actually transfer coins though. I signed the transaction using this software on an old netbook running windows xp that has the wifi and bluetooth modules removed and will never see the internet again, hence I am comfortable entering my private key into this software on that offline netbook. I then transferred the signed transaction to an online computer and broadcast the transaction successfully. Transaction ID:57b8cc7b35200b2003b16baf6cef4bf05845b05fc37c7083699bb378384314cbThis transaction was from a test wallet I funded expressly for experimenting with.I essentially turned my old netbook into an airgapped hardware wallet, I believe. A special nostalgic hardware wallet because I used to travel the world with it and it has my complete old movie collection, music, games, emulators etc that I used to play with back in my younger days, now it has my bitcoin as well.I was thinking about getting a passport wallet or something similar but opted for this route instead. With this tool and my old netbook I can now move individual UTXOs from an old legacy paper wallet without having to use or trust any third party hardware wallet or having to expose my private keys to the internet which as you point out is a bad idea.",

I may try and get in touch with OP over there.I wanted to quickly add one thing, for anyone who may follow this route.If you are concerned about any funny business going on in the software while signing the transaction on your offline device you can check the signed transaction hex before broadcasting it by using a tool such as this one:https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/decodetx/With the above tool you can check to make sure that your outputs are going to the intended addresses as originally setup. Once you know for sure the transaction has the intended inputs and outputs you can broadcast it to the network.",
