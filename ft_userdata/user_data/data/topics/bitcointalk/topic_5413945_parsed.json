Being greedy and quick to make money is a leading cause for the falling into scam. Many newbies still fall on this despite the information and advise all over the thread.",

I think it is greediness and being illiterate. Because of that, if you want to invest, be sure to feed yourself with necessary knowledge. Knowledge from experience is good but you can also take legitimate one from other people. Do not be greedy. Not everything that is being offered to you is true. Do not be deceived. Also, be careful who you are trusting.",

Are you contented on the current rate of the adoption that we have right now? It's not that low but the numbers are decent so maybe you will be contented with it but I don't think the rest are going to agree with that as they always crave for more because for them, more adoption means more price increase.Not only that actually, but the use of btc are going to be easier as many merchants are going to support it. There are many benefits so don't only focus on the negative side and besides, new people will also be educated and they can always learn if ever they did a mistake like us once we are starting on here.",

This is what we all pray for, how has this become a major concern? We all pray for more and more and more adoption, until bitcoin and cryptocurrencies become the major means through which we carry out transactions. If this is happening, why does it have to become a major concern? Quote Reason been that as more people get involved in the crypto business the more scammers are likely to increase their technique and the more scammers get recruited. There is no easy way to make money out there, ask the ritualist, and those who do all sort of diabolical stuff to earn money and they will tell you  the same thing. When a bird learns to fly without petching, the hunter learns to shoot without missing. When scammers increase or come up with new techniques to scam you, you make sure to always be a step or two ahead of them so you never fall a victim to whatever technique or style they implore. Quote  Staying off scammers path will require been well informed of their every new technique the can ever deploy against their potential victim.Exactly the point, nothing good comes easy.A mango tree full of ripe mango fruits attracts all kinds birds, flies and even bees, when you want to pluck a mango fruit from the mango tree, you have to implore techniques that will help you avoid the birds, flies and bees.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is this mango tree which has a lot of ripe fruits that needs to be plucked, unfortunately, it has attracted alot of bees which are the scammers, as this scammers work hard to find new techniques to scam you , you also work hard on finding techniques that will help you avoid falling a victim to their scam tactics, that is to always be a step or two further from them.",

As a result, they develop a unique scamming technique that differs from the usual ones. The majority of scam victims are newbies since they are so readily seduced, especially those looking for quick cash. To avoid being duped, people should recognize a red flag when they encounter one.To add to the list:- Enable Two-factor authentication for all your accounts- Using of firewalls- Installing an upto date anti virus software- Use strong passwords and yet easily accessible ones for your convenience- Stay away from malicious links or attachments you come across on the web- Make sure your private keys are well stored and in hard wallet- Make sure your passwords are not vulnerable online to attacks i.e don’t store passwords online or any website.",

This is the easiest scam to spot on and easiest to avoid since you can just say no to these brokers trying to force their service unto you and they'll be gone. However a lot of people still fall prey to these people albeit the warnings and the heads up. No matter how much you educate people on these things, they'd still believe that they will always know better than you and still follow their decision anyway. Greed is what drives these people to ruin and if they can't control their greed, then they'll eventually fall into a lot more scams.",

Being greedy and quick to make money is a leading cause for the falling into scam. Many newbies still fall on this despite the information and advise all over the thread.It’s important to always be on guard and to keep our greed in check, which in my opinion is the main reason why people get scammed on the first place, after all scammers know that people more than anything want to obtain profits on the markets and they want them now, and as such they make all kind of promises about the huge amounts of money you can get with them, but if you take your time to analyze what they are saying you will realize that what they are promising is impossible to achieve, and once you realize this and encounter the same promises time and time again then you will learn to ignore all of those offers regardless of how attractive they may seem to the untrained eye.",

It's a currency that should be used by anyone and everyone who has got the gadget, finds a merchant who can accept  and accepting it themselves for exchanges.Csammers should come, they should develop there own techniques and schemes to it. What should be obtainable of crypto investors is that, they learn. They learn how to remain secure on the network. Then, scammers can pry in vain as we know, they won't stop.",

The technology is new compared to technologies like internet television and more.Over the meantime we have gotten some means to deal with scammers. We are learning to live with the scammers but they become wiser everyday.

There is no how someone who doesn't know you would want you to make big money. Another thing is whenever they introduce a business opportunity to you and then hasten you in order make you take a hasty decision it's not  genuine, they are trying their best to make you to make a fast decision without telling your loved ones and friends who will discourage youIt is safer to  assume anyone you don't know, communicating with you is a scammer until it is proven otherwise.",
