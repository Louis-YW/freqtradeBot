Whoever has referred you here did right because here you will read topics in different sections that will be new to you and will blow your mind as things will be shocking for you when you will get to know that the creator of BTC (Satoshi Nakamoto) and other types of investments in the BTC blockchain took place on this platform.I was also stunned to know the role this forum has played, it basically promoted BTC, but let's just jump on some basic suggestions that I mostly give to new members. To avoid plagiarizing and abusing anyone, do not send phishing links on the forum (in topics, replies, and comments, too). You might be temporarily banned if caught doing so. But if you are caught doing plagiarism, you will not be given any warnings, and your account will be permanently banned.Try to be legit, do not try to pretend senior which might get you on someone's ignore list, and do not share information that seems off-topic and fake. And do not give anyone financial advice without giving a disclaimer of (DYOR)",

I want your guidance as senior members in the forum here. Thanks.Welcome to this forum, and keep growing in learning BTC and making money out of it. I suggest you ask that guy who introduced you to this forum, and I suggest you visit your local community because we have local communities here where you can find your native language-speaking friends, and they can help you in a better way about how the forum works and how you can remain here safely and for a longer period of time.And the positive side is that if you are not a native English speaker, then you can talk in the local language, but on your own.Other than this, I will suggest you read first and then write strategy. In this, you should read other people's posts and take ideas from what they are sharing and how you can contribute and learn new things. For example, if you are reading some topic and on the second page you find that this member made a wrong statement and you knew it because of your knowledge, then you should quote him and correct him, and that's called a contribution. You should help others with their problems, just as we are helping you with yours.In short, be supportive, be open-minded, do not be afraid to ask questions or give replies, and learn new things.",

Already, many threads have been advised for you to read. So nothing to add additional; just read them very well and learn forum culture first. So it will be easier to learn about cryptocurrency. You need to spend a lot of time learning from the forum. Because cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that is related to technology.

I want your guidance as senior members in the forum here. Thanks. Welcome to the forum. You are in the perfect site to learn everything about bitcoin. You don't have to read everything and take a lot of your time if you are eager to learn about bitcoin. For your information, learning in the forum should not be a pressure on your part, but just enjoy the forum itself together with the rest of the members. That way, learning becomes easier for you and just try to read and understand that catches your attention. Although you will find it hard at the start, but do also some researching on the words that you are not familiar so you will also be guided while you are in the process of learning.I believe that you also come here not just to learn to but eventually to make profits later on, and I truly understand you as everyone here started from a scratch. But for now, focus more on understanding bitcoin and all that are related in the crypto market. Don't rush on earning some profits because you will definitely reach that point when you already understand the purpose of this forum. Just enjoy your stay here, and if you do it more openly and with positive attitude, you will learn a lot easier and faster. Learning takes time, and if you want to maximize learning, don't be too serious but learn to have fun while learning.",

Thanks.You have a great start in your journey because you have come to the root of the bitcoin network and a forum that contains vast knowledge about the overall crypto industry. Now it is time for you to start reading about topics related to bitcoins fundamentals. Forum members discussions over every topic will give you valuable insight about the industry and diversified opinion which will increase your knowledge depth. One piece of advice I have for you is to read more and write less. What most of the new forum members do is start creating new topics frequently after getting some basic knowledge.",

Thanks.Welcome onboard, its always good seeing new members join the community but we have seen couple of new members join and claim they want to learn about Bitcoin but in the end they disappear and we don‚Äôt see them anymore. We know it‚Äôs not easy especially when you are interested in moving your rank here as a newbie so some newbies want to skip the learning process and try to impress others with good post and they end up breaking the forum rules and in the end they get their accounts banned or tagged. All i am saying in essence is for you to stick to the forum rules and regulation at all costs and never skip the learning process. I can see you made mention of reading a site, it is the best thing to do and it will help you alot in your interest in bitcoin, and also some links are being shared with you already make sure to take a look if really you are interested in learning about bitcoin as you claim. The forum is packed with lots of informative tools that will guide you through and don‚Äôt hesitate to ask questions when you need clarification.",

Your friend did a great job by referring you here. DYING_S0UL recommended some valuable threads for beginners which you should read carefully before starting. you will learn with time and don't need to rush for absorbing all in one day. I will also suggest being active in your local board where you could discuss anything about crypto in your local language. Every country has different situations concerning crypto and you should adopt a crypto strategy according to the specific condition of your own area. By the way could we ask what is your rank in crypto means how much do you know about crypto, btc and trading?",
