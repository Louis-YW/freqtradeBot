Algorand is one of the top projects, and even SEC got some statement about these securities nothing can stop the bll when its there. The only coin that worth watching is bitcoin, since altcoins depend on this. Once btc reach an uptrend direction regardless of the fud on the different altcoins then its gonna be unstoppable.",

I will not sell, will hold for now and buy more if it falls down to $0.11 which would be near its all time low. I believe in Algorand and if it does get through this it can see great returns next bull run",

What i also noticed here is because of the bear so most of the altcoin are affected so why not make another choice being that you already holding some Algorand though i don't know how much you stored in your wallet considering what few poster earlier said to focus on bitcoin since the is the mover of the market and it quickly bounces back to it feets than altcoin. At hard time like this the best option is to hold tight on bitcoin and few reliable altcoin.",

I will invest some money in some good coins. But if I invest all my money on one coin then I will get very little profit. So some good coins.  After choosing, I will invest and wait when the price will increase, then if I can sell, there will be a possibility of a lot of profit.",

      "body": "Within the tumultuous seascape of cryptocurrency, the storm of instability is the lifeline we clutch onto, wouldn't you say? The predicament you're grappling with regarding Algorand echoes across the crypto cosmos in this era of relentless disruption. The seismic shockwaves sent by the latest SEC verdict certainly upset the apple cart. Algorand finds itself in the eye of the storm, inducing a collective, nail-biting suspense among all.Yet, one mustn't mistake this narrative. The branding of Algorand as a security isn't the mortal blow you might perceive it to be. There's a whole plethora of securities that shine in the marketplace. The real pivot of discussion is the inherent usefulness and worth of the asset at hand.This transient plummet might seem merciless, yet recall the genesis years of Bitcoin. It danced its own waltz of peaks and troughs before it found its stride. Thus, the question of Algorand's mortality or survival lies largely in the beholder's gaze. If faith in the project remains unwavering, this could very well be a golden opportunity. However, remember, in the unforgiving world of crypto, guarantees are elusive as shadows.",

Therefore, we don't have to expect a miracle to happen in this project because that was impossible. I would tell you that it helps you to just forget and never mind it as this is the result of investing shitcoins because we thought that buying cheap coins would give us huge profit but unfortunately, this will give us huge losses and disappointments. I have had this experience before and so I can feel of being disappointed by expecting something huge.",

The SEC labelling is just a clown stuff and I think if they won't respond on the rulemaking petition from Coinbase then it's likely a personal thing that he's into anit-crypto. When Gary was still on MIT this wasn't his approach towards crypto, he's more like pro-crypto. Algorand has a future considering it's one of the top compliant for ISO 20022. DYOR!! The SEC suing big exchanges and labelling some crypto as security was likely a FUD.",

A project that still develop no matter what kind of situation they are in is not dead IMO. They may be performing low or full of FUD but atleast they still develops.

If you really believe in it, turn off news and don't listen either hype or fud. Listen to yourself. Coin isn't over just because SEC says it's a security, it just changes how it's been traded. Also XRP has been a security for 2 years now according to SEC. Has it died?When times are hard you need to have a thick skin. And you do realize that this has been hard always.
