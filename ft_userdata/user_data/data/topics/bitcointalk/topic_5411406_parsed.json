Not a bad idea, bad the downside is more users are likely lost access and will ask a way to recover his account. Since this make the email is really important in this forum where each time login need to input verification code, I highly suggest to remove email address show to public in order to make it more secure.QuoteWhile login, there should be option to trust the device for some days so that it does not affect user experience. Did you mean we're only allowed to log in with an old device? I disagree since each device has a lifespan where you will need to change device for every few years.",

The vast majority of others have never had such a problem because they know that each password should be unique and long enough to prevent someone from accidentally guessing it or breaking it with the brute force method.Those who use passwords like John1234 or ILoveBitcoin or store them in the cloud/email in unencrypted form will not be helped by any additional protection.",

So, someone can easily enter their passwords into an unverified website.",

Let us discuss these in this thread. I’m using Bitcointalk forum for about 6 years without experiencing any hack incident in my account. I think having a secured password and 2fa is enough to make Bitcointalk account safe because there’s no money that needs to protect on this account besides account reputation which can be easily spot if the account suddenly do shady activities.Hacking event usually happened on accounts that use a weak password or click phishing links.",

In addition, I only log in from one device that I consider safe, and I think that this is quite enough for my operational security to be at a high level.Of course, there is always the possibility that something bad will happen to me, like everyone else - but phishing links and some other common traps will certainly not surprise me.",

I don't if you would ask me. It would be way too stressful logging in considering the wait time and switching between mails and browser.Hacks or not, the forum has put in place es measures for an account recovery and that is, the staking of an address. There are chances that your accounts could be hacked on the forum bit when it comes to wallets, pretty much zero. Although, that's directly related to how private you go about the security of your private key or seed phrase.Your account gets hacked, password and mails changed and your kicked out? No problem.You create an alt solely for the recovery of the account, providing a signed message for the staked address of your account and you've got your account back. Rendering all the efforts of the hacker wasted.The downside to this is that, you must be active to know the moment your account was attacked to engage in recovery before any major damage is been done. Be a little more private and you would be safe.",

I am sure that many members have a fake/invalid email address associated with their accounts. There is really no reason why the forum will ever contact members via email, many of the traditional phishing attacks will be useless against bitcointalk forum accounts. So as long as the forum is able to keep passwords away from adversaries, and forum members practice general good security, the risk of getting your account hacked is fairly low.",
