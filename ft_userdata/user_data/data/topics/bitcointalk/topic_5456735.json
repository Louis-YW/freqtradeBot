It will still make outgoing connections, because otherwise how would it function as a node at all? Each peer you are connected to will be able to see your IP, regardless of what setting you use for listen.If privacy is your goal, then the only solution is running via Tor (or maybe a VPN, depending on your particular needs).",

      "body": "Listening lets other nodes initiate a connection with you. Both non-listening and listening nodes are vital for the network, but listening nodes establish more connections than non-listening, and therefore require more bandwidth. They're more important in the sense that there can't be a network without listening nodes (but it can without non-listening).",
