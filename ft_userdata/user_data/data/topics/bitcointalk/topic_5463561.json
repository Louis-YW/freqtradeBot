  "content": "Downloading the 577GB blockchain on a late 2013 MacBook Pro is impossible.  Even at 450Mbps internet, the processor slows down at 86% and never finished even 3 weeks later.A family member with a newer mac downloaded the blockchain weeks ago.I copied all 577GB from them today.They are using Mac OS 10.9 and an OLDER bitcoin core release from at least a year ago.Now the OLDER but completely up to date blockchain data is NOT compatible with the latest version 25.I get this error at startup:\"Error: Unsupported chainstate database format found. Please restart with -reindex-chainstate. This will rebuild the chainstate database.\"Redownloading the blockchain is not an option.How do I make this work?How can I restart \"with -reindex-chainstate\" when the version 25 locks up with that error message then quits after I hit \"ok\"?",

In that case, locate the binary (it should be called something like Bitcoin Core or bitcoin-qt) and use one of these methods to pass the -reindex-chainstate argument to it via Terminal.If installed by homebrew or some other command-line method, it will be in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, and you can simply run: $(which bitcoin-qt) -reindex-chainstate in Terminal.",

The hardware is old, but 10 years should still be doable. My laptop is old, but 16 GB RAM and SSD makes all the difference.Quote\"Error: Unsupported chainstate database format found.

I've never had any problems when upgrading Bitcoin Core to a newer version, so it could be something went wrong with your copy.QuoteRedownloading the blockchain is not an option.Just a heads up: -reindex-chainstate is going to take a while too.Are you sure you want to use Bitcoin Core if your computer has such a hard time with it? Electrum for instance is much lighter to run.",

      "body": "Keep in mind what I posted over a year ago: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399730Yes you can get it running on a 2013MBP but it's never going to be good. Just due to the way Apple did things the hardware in that unit was not the fastest out there. It will be a good learning experience for you, but it's never going to be a good way to run core.And running something like the reindex is going to take a long time due to hardware limitations.-Dave",
