  "content": "The world economy is recovering slowly, inflation is getting more and more serious, the salary of ordinary people is already difficult to be able to maintain a normal life, many people want to try to make some profitable investments. The real estate and stock markets are now very volatile, the time period for real estate investment is long, and the real estate bubble is now relatively large and too illiquid. Many people are now exiting the real estate and stock markets and entering the cryptocurrency market, which now seems to be going up very well, and I want to create a cryptocurrency discussion group to study the trends together! Or anyone who has such a group can add me whatsapp number and let me know, is it ok?My whatsapp number is +1 619 815 7151My Telgegram username is @lixue0815",

      "body": "I am eager to become a member of the group once it is established. It has the potential to provide valuable insights that can assist investors in making more informed decisions, particularly during times like these. I am presently a member of the Bitget exchange's English trading club on Telegram, where community members exchange informative ideas similar to what you are proposing. I find your idea very appealing and look forward to its implementation.",
