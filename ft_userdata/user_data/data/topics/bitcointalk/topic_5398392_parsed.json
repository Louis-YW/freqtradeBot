  "content": "Bitcoin Price Backup PlanAs i mentioned it before, that in the future we may need a Bitcoin price backup plan for merchants to hoard Bitcoin as securities for long term. I was fully aware of future Bitcoin price trends and its fluctuation. So, I designed ahead a secondary protocol for Bitcoin exchanges and individual traders. Which is for the Bitcoin price stabilization under a safe storage policy when the Bitcoin price will greatly fall down unexpectedly. This could provide a safety zone for the short term investors who might get panic in time of greater price dropping. How to be prepared when bitcoins price is falling ? As Bitcoin could become the real monetary medium of exchange in the near future the investors in Bitcoin must educate themselves about the hidden Bitcoin agendas in cryptography and in plain invisibility. In a clear sense, the merchant can convert or switch their Bitcoin holding to the secondary hard cash or asset which i has been prepared for them to explore first then move on to if they feel insecure because of price fall or crash. Why the investors need such safety Zone? I ask this question as practically because the production of new bitcoins is finite and its value will become too expensive in terms of time and power in the future, which is literally greater than last two or three years. Now if suddenly the price fall then some people will find it dificult for them to remain firm as they are not fully confident in the Bitcoin future price recovery or they might have to convert their Bitcoin into first currency for some other reasons. In that case they will lose some money but those who do not want to take risk but would love to move their Bitcoin into safety Zone can do so as they wish. For their recommendation I would suggest the Hard Cash or hard asset would be good for them. If they prefare to move their Bitcoin in Sidle Zone then that could be more better because they themselves can hide their Bitcoin from prying eyes or for any fear of price crash. Later they can turn it into Bitcoin to float back when the Bitcoin bull run start again. If you need further information how to use or get access to Sidle Bit Protocol please do not hesitate to PM me for further information.",

Haven't you learned from the 2017 ICO bubble? Just randomly slapping a token on a platform won't automatically make it better.",

      "body": "I think as long as you do not sell your bitcoins you do not loose anything. The day you sell at lower prices than what you bought at is your loss. I am sure we do not need to create any sort of zones or protocols to safeguard the pricing of bitcoin. This is just on going process, demand rises, supply goes down, surroundings are favourable, investors are happy, more investment into the market, more prices!In the vice versa situation, things go down in terms of prices. Thats typical circle of the bitcoin pricing or any asset in the market.",

What you are recommending is a garbage \"strategy\" that is the typical mistake that small investors fall into. They buy when it is expensive and at times like this they sell, when the opposite should be done. Not to mention that they are skipping basic rules of investing and personal finance, having an emergency fund and only investing money that they are not going to need for anything at all. Apart from the fact that as Bitcoin is finite in nature, the best thing to do is to keep accumulating, and not sell even when we have peaks or ATH, unless you have already accumulated so much Bitcoin that it is worth enjoying its benefits instead of continuing to accumulate.",

The only way to be prepared when the price of bitcoin falls is to hold on tight and not sell when the price of bitcoin falls or in a panic.In addition to that way, buying more bitcoins than before is a recommended suggestion so that the number of bitcoins we have increased.But if you decide to sell bitcoin at a time when the price is falling, then you will regret it because the price of bitcoin can bounce up after a decline and it has happened many times.",
