It loads just fine on the official onion link I gave above, though, so must be something to do with Loyce's particular set up.This raises an interesting question: For an address which has transactions of arbitrary numbers of inputs and outputs, Is the address loading a factor of linear space, or polynomial space?In other words, does this Mempool.space attempt to construct a UTXO set and final balances of all addresses at once, or does it just do static analyis of the address history from its first transaction to the last?",
