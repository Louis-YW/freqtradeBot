E get some people when no de even fit save because of the kind of work when dem de do.Saving money is a very good habit that everyone  should practice especially in a country like ours that experiences some different form of hardship every year. Even if your primary purpose of saving is to start up a business or upgrade your life,.  it is better to borrow from your savings than to borrow from an external source.",

      "body": "Normally it is best to save money because things do change from time to time. A person that doesn't have the habbit of saving will run into problem. But with the way things dey go for the country I wonder what will happen if our savings get exhausted. So here is my little advise, if the money you saved is big enough, you can take some part and start up something. Even if na recharge card business or pos business so that something can be coming in because any money wey nothing dey add will one day finish, and what will happen when this money finish? So instead of just using your savings to dey eat am on daily basis, just look for small business and start with it. Then you can be eating part of the profit you will be getting, while your capital will remain. This way you will be guaranteed that your money will stay with you for a long time.",

Have you gone to the market to buy an item, price it and then after making arrangements here and there, put the money together to get the item only to be shock that the price has increased? That happened to me when I want to buy Air conditioner about 2 months ago, I went to my customer to price one because I already had some in the house, wanted additional one and he gave me the price and a week a go, I went back to get it and I was shocked that it has increased so high but I sat down and do reason how the economy has been moving, I wasn't surprised at all because how do we expect things not to go up when our purchasing power is literally dying everyday.If you want to survive this economy and hardship, find extra way to monetize your time and have extra source of income because the way things are going, we may even go harder because I'm not sure if this government is prepared before assuming the office, they haven't show anything of their 6 months in office, just complain and complain and nothing good to show the public.",

You no fit dey do investment on empty stomach, e no make sense and e look very foolish to do dat unless you don’t value your wellbeing more than d savings you want to keep. As d cost of living don high now, price of goods even goods skyrocketing, e no go be bad idea if you stock up plenty food for house. The cost of lining an him don dey kill the living already, dis no be small matter for naija now like dis. E go better make I no save money and to dey see food chop everyday than me to depend on any savings in the future.",
