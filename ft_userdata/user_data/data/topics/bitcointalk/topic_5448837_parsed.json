A court case will always be in a manner that it helps both parties, so it is upto you to decide, dont be biased about it.While the best option here would be to buy bitcoin with that money, I believe you have made up your mind not to, otherwise you would not be making this question here. So beyond bitcoin, ETH would be the next best option to buy and then LTC and DOGE for long term.Why not divide the money into three parts and see how much each gives you in return, if you are willing to take the risk? Again not financial advice here, you could do something else, but perform this on paper as dummy trading.",

Not that much movement since the 2017 bull market. It has reached $3 but then it had never been back there again. But then, we don't know what's with the future of XRP, especially with the SEC case whether it will be clear or not but to have that optimistic thought about them that it should be cleared and clean, then I think that it will create that perfect moment that shall boost the price of it which is as usual in the market when good news comes to a certain project. But the main factor that will be affected is the bull run that we will see and I don't know if it's going to add and contribute to the price of XRP because that's what we've seen for the past years.",

I mean ADA and XRP can give you more than x4 return when the bull market starts, but on the flipside, it might not give you that return in the bull run. I mean anything can happen. If you're only focusing on that 2 coins, just go 50-50 on it. I'm holding ADA personally, but I'm thinking of selling already, and buy Ethereum on it. As for XRP, it didn't come to my mind to hold some of that coins for the long run for some unknown reason. Long term, I think you have a higher chance that you can get x4 returns because it already happened in the past. You are worrying if XRP loses? I guess the community behind Ripple is huge to the point that it will not go down that hard if something bad happens to them. As for ADA, their slow upgrades, and lots of hype is the problem with them, but whenever they release an upgrade to their project, there are little to no bugs or whatever glitches on it. Maybe try on adding some Bitcoin. ADA, XRP, and BTC.",

Try putting some at Bitcoin you will be surprised if it hits the bull run and I find it more riskier to invest in altcoins than Bitcoin but it also depends though if you know what you are doing. Try their suggestions as diversifying your investment so that you won't all in just one go. At least put some in the other basket 'cause it's either a loss or a win depending on how you will gonna play with your investment.",

I guess that if you can put your money in better coins compared with XRP. There are so many L1 and L2 coins in the market. Why don't you try to consider these kinds of coins? These coins will be mooning if bitcoin will be going even higher. ADA looks like a shit now. I got almost 6x from investing in ronin coins when it was dumping so hard during the bearish trend Q1 of this year. You were just making yourself become very complicated. There are a bunch of trusted coins in the market and you were picking complicated coins with low chance for mooning. Bitcoin is pumped right now. Think again with your choice. You can do better rather than investing your money in a coin with so many problems like XRP. So, did you try to gamble with the final decision will be taken by the court regarding XRP's case?",

P10k is quite good amount to invest so Op make sure you choose the best coin for you I am not saying that you need to buy a specific coin but what I'm saying is that you need to be careful because nowadays there are some scam coins so in order to be safe you need to make a research first what coin you want to invest if that's gonna be a useful coin or a scam coin that you will cry and loss someday.
