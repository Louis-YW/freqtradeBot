  "content": "It is very difficult to find people in the whole world who do not know the importance of Bitcoin and what its market value will be in the future. There are millions of users holding Bitcoins all over the world. Some bitcoin holders are holding millions of dollars worth of bitcoins in their wallets. I would request those holders not to disclose their identity online. The sole purpose of making this request is that a few days ago a news item was published in my local newspaper and there was a mention of this incident.The incident Regarding Bitcoin Millionaire Dr. John, suspicions arose when Bitcoin millionaire Dr. John failed to see him during office hours at Marchi Hospital in Missouri on May 21. After much searching, his family was forced to file a missing persons case with a local administration when he was not found. And a lot of news is spread through social media. But sadly Dr. John's car is one kilometer away from the hospital on May 28 Suspicion increases as one looks further afield. When they found his used mobile, laptop and wallet in the car, they doubled their suspicion and launched a massive search in the local administration. But Dr. John was later found dead on May 30 on a road an hour away from the hospital. The police administration found him dead with gunshot ,the police have not yet said anything about whether his death was suicide or murder, planned murder.Dr john Forsyth49 years oldCo founder of Onfo CoinHowever, many have commented on John's death, the most talked about being that his identity was leaked to everyone and that he was possibly kidnapped for Bitcoin or some other ransom and any information or valuables were taken from him. However, all bitcoin holders should learn from this incident and remain anonymous in public and tread carefully.See fulls: https://www.coinalap.com/bitcoin-millionaire-dr-john-killed/The link in the news is published in my native Bengali language. If you want, you can read it with Google translation.",

      "body": "There was recently a very good topic on the same subject: How important is it to keep your bitcoin investments secret from others ?     It's always sad to see people disappear and die in such shady circumstances.But is there really any evidence to link the possession of BTC to Dr. John's death? The translator doesn't give me anything really readable. In any case, I'd be surprised if you killed the person concerned. Who else but him could give you the keys to the wallet? Anyway, I guess that every situation is different. Do we have access to any statistics about the number of kidnappings, assaults or hostage-takings with the aim of stealing cryptos / BTC in some countries?I get the impression that it's all just like other reasons to do shady stuff as a fraudster/gangster. Unfortunately, people die every day for their jewelry, their belongings, their car, their money... So it doesn't surprise me to see this kind of incident every now and then, with the aim of stealing BTC. OP, where you're wrong is when you think it's all about big wallets and wealthy people. In some countries, you can get mugged for less than $200, and many people don't understand that owning a little BTC doesn't make you rich. Some people are pretty stupid about cryptos, and when they hear \"I'm interested in BTC\" they think you're directly rich. We've already seen people kidnapped because their captors thought they were rich, when in fact they weren't, just because of a few messages about BTC on Twitter... I'll try to find these cases and come back to edit my post if I do.",

What I have said is a cautionary tale because Bitcoin has become an increasingly important topic. No one can say for sure that this will not happen to Bitcoin in the future. But if Bitcoin holders keep this in mind and caution themselves, I see nothing bad.But I can't say in terms of all countries, but in my country, even for a small amount of money, kidnapping or hijacking is done.",

I guess being rich is not that easy though, as you have to completely secure your safety so that you won’t be harmed or put into danger by anyone. Same goes to bitcoin hodler that requires anonymity all the time, otherwise you are putting yourself in a dangerous situation.

You will find out that you will live a peaceful life as you only need to secure your funds from the bad actors over the net.The problem with the younger generations today is that they post whatever they think on their social media channels, that's where they are subjecting themselves to be a potential victim as predators are lurking around.",
