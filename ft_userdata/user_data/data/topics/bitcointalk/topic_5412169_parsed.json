Basically, what should I do to make my digital art an NFT?Basically, creating NFT is quite easy just like any money making app. It's just that you need to make a work of art first.For those of you who want to try making NFT, make sure you already have a crypto wallet or crypto wallet first and if you haven't, it is advisable to make one immediately and choose a marketplace like OpenSea to sell NFT works.You are also the official owner of the NFT-shaped artwork.Please note that before selling these digital assets, make sure you understand the working mechanism of NFT so you don't experience losses.",

Basically, what should I do to make my digital art an NFT?Well, the first think you should know is that NFTs are nothing more than links on a blockchain.  A string of text that links to where the image is stored.  That's it.  There's no magic there or anything you need to do to your image.  You just need to host it somewhere and put a link to it on the blockchain, which is the NFT.  A \"token\" that links to an image.Quote from: mr.relax on September 03, 2022, 07:39:04 AMGo to Opensea and create one, so you understand the process. Yes you can use your own graphics.As a beginner, better use a cheap blockchain, g.e.  Polygon.Learn how to handle sending and receiving NFTs.Buying an selling or even making money with that is a different story...Well, I don't think that using OpenSea to create an NFT will teach you anything except how to use OpenSea's NFT maker.  In reality, most people could learn how to issue their own NFTs in a day watching some YouTube videos.  It's isn't a difficult process and doing it yourself without using an intermediary like OpenSea might actually teach you something.  Once you've learned what an NFT is, you can start to understand what's possible.  Functionality will be the key moving forward.  People have realized the \"artwork\" NFT scam was nothing more than creative fundraising.",

      "body": "One could argue that an image does not inherently become an NFT simply by virtue of being an image. Rather, it is the act of creating a unique digital asset, or \"token,\" that is associated with the image and recorded on a blockchain that makes it an NFT.Some might argue that the concept of an NFT is based more on the underlying technology and digital ownership rights than on the image itself. Therefore, it is possible to have an image that is not an NFT, such as a regular digital image or a physical print of a photograph.Additionally, some might argue that the value of an NFT lies more in the exclusivity and uniqueness of the digital asset, rather than the image itself. Thus, an NFT image may not necessarily have any inherent artistic or aesthetic value, but rather derives value from its rarity and scarcity.Overall, while an image may be the visual representation of an NFT, it is the technology and the creation of a unique digital asset that ultimately makes it an NFT, rather than the image itself.",

Basically, what should I do to make my digital art an NFT?You can use any image to create an NFT. That is so simple like hosting the image and putting it into the blockchain. But if you can implement the real utility and the use case with the NFT, then it will get more value in the future. Eg: Property Deeds, Certificates, Tickets, and Vehicle Ownership as NFT",
