According to Chainalysis, only \"1% of the entire crypto market is involved in illicit activity.\" This is because there are alternative sources for these funds that are much larger than the crypto space.QuoteMilitant groups use different methods to move money, including cash, banks, shell companies and charities, and informal financial networks. Crypto is a small part, experts say.So how dare they blaming it all in crypto?Additional information related to that ;QuoteWHAT ABOUT OTHER FORMS OF ILLICIT FINANCE?Terrorist financing is a small part of the illicit uses of crypto, which include scams, ransomware and theft.Crypto crime hit a record $20.1 billion in 2022, Chainalysis said, calling this a lower bound estimate. That figure excludes when cryptocurrencies are the proceeds of non-crypto crimes such as payment for drugs.Cryptocurrency theft via cyber attacks is also a significant source of funding for North Korea, according to UN reports.Some banks in the UK have curbed customers' access to crypto because of a rise in crypto scams.Also, the article pointed out that setting up a cryptocurrency wallet is a piece of cake, and it's pretty tricky to trace the owner, even though all transactions are right there on the blockchain, which is like a permanent public record. To dig up who's behind it all, they'd need an account on one of those fancy, government-regulated 3rd party exchanges. That way, the government can just tell them to cooperate with the investigation. But here's the catch, those sneaky terrorists probably already know this stuff and might be one step ahead, making it harder for the government to trace them. Sure, the exchange can freeze the funds, but finding out who owns that wallet? Now that's the real challenge.SOURCE --- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/explained-cryptos-role-in-terrorist-financing/articleshow/104645274.cms",

The terrorists best friend is cold hard cash. Paper money. In other words, paper strips can be taken advantage of by criminals much more easily and they are way more suited for nefarious and anonymous purposes than Bitcoin or any crypto, really. So the argument of crypto being used in terrorist financing is laughable. We as a community should crack down harder on the haters. Otherwise unknowing people might actually believe in their lies. If we do not then we will only serve to stagger the progress of Bitcoin adoption by giving the haters free reign...",

I don't entirely blame them, because if there is really a way that terrorists can fund their goals without anyone knowing then it's generally bad for the world, attacks will take place when least expected, and many lives will be lost, it's ok to say that people are in fear of what may happen, but I will still stand on my fact that nothing is really hidden on the block chain.",

All those evil things come from human behavior and it is humans who are evil, no fiat currency or bitcoin is evil. Neither Bitcoin nor mixers have anything to do with crime or terrorism, but unfortunately, criminals use them and we have no way to stop it. Everyone understands that it's just human behavior, but people who hate bitcoin will always use it as an excuse to talk bad about bitcoin. But that doesn't change the fact that more and more people are realizing it so we don't need to explain further, Bitcoin has nothing to do with terrorism or crime.",

Except when it comes to privacy coins. Crypto and Bitcoin is pseudonymous (https://www.cloudwards.net/is-crypto-anonymous/)Many people say that crypto has a close relationship with terrorism and crime, but if you think about the strict KYC system on each exchange, tracking and intelligence, it is very risky for criminals or terrorists to access crypto and then disburse funds on the exchange. This will quickly reveal its activities through a transaction.Online prostitution or sexual content may have greater involvement compared to terrorism, drugs and crime activities.This is crypto transaction data related to criminal cases that I took from the CRYPTOPOTATO news website.https://cryptopotato.com/illicit-crypto-transactions-in-2022-surpassed-20-billion-for-the-first-time-chainalysis/?amp",

Such beliefs harm Bitcoin's reputation, even though physical cash is more frequently used in such activities, given its difficulty to trace. Regardless of the mud-slinging, Bitcoin continues to exist and grow in adoption because these accusations are baseless. The 1% figure is relatively small compared to the total money funneled into terrorist activities.I've read some articles in the past that suggest governments make a lot of money during times of war. So, I believe those who create fiat currency are potentially more corrupt than what they accuse Bitcoin of. Let's not forget that they can keep printing money endlessly, which, on its own, is already an issue.",
