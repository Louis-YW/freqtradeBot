I started trying the first service, which is https://app.chainedge.io/, and found that it is a paid service. There is no trial or free version for a limited time, and the subscription is very expensive.600 dollars a year or 50 dollars a month is very expensive for a beginner who is comfortable making a profit and after purchasing the package there is no profitable and guaranteed trading.DEXSCREENER seems like a good service, but there are thousands of new projects and it is not easy to know which of these projects has value, and many of the projects are similar.",

Everyone in the crypto space should consider himself a student. If  money must be made, then lessons must be learnt and  steady update is required.",
