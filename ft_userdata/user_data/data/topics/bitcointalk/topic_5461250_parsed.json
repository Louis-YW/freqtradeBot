Â Yes this depends on the wallet that you are using to send out your transaction. Their is Always custom settings available as you can use the amount of SATs that can be charge on the transaction. That reducing it will increase the time which it will cost for the transaction to be confirmed.Quote What are the factors that can influence these transaction fees?Block congestion I guess.

Assuming Alice sent you bitcoin one time, the higher the fee if the bitcoin is sent two times and you want to spend all at ones, making it to have 2 inputs. The second is mempool congestion. If the mempool is more congested, the higher the fee.Another is the type of address that you are using. Using legacy address will be of higher fee. Using segwit will be of lower fee.If calculating the fee in fiat, bitcoin price in that fiat is also among.Quote from: Agbamoni on July 27, 2023, 10:14:11 PMWhere can i track the recent bitcoin transaction fees rate?Use https://mempool.space/",

This is dependent the speed at which you want the transaction to be confirmed.2. You can edit the transaction fee field and put the amount you want to pay for the transaction. Lower fees gets lower priority to be confirmed. To prevent your transaction from stuck in the mempool, don't set it too low. You can also reduce the transaction fee by: Making transaction when the bitcoin network is not under huge demand.You can utilize the bitcoin lightening network.  Use SegWit addresses 3. There are a number of factors that affects the transaction fees. If there are more transactions to be confirmed, it might create a bottleneck.4. https://mempool.space is the site to use. An alternative is blockchain.com's bitcoin transaction fee/USD chart here: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/fees-usd-per-transaction",

If you use custodial wallets like online accounts, exchange accounts, you will not have control of your wallets (don't have its private keys).Next, choose good fee rate to use like I described in my topics.You can exploit times like weekends that usually have lower, cheaper fee rates and avoid active hours of USA.",

It shows the current fees for low, medium, and high priority fees. https://mempool.space/Quote from: Agbamoni on July 27, 2023, 10:14:11 PMIs there a way to minimize transaction fee?Yes, if you use a wallet that gives you manual control over your fees, then you can send it as low as 1 sat/vbyte but it might never confirm with the current fe rate bottoming out at around 6 sats/vbyte. I personally use Sparrow wallet (https://sparrowwallet.com/) because it gives me the highest level of manual control over selecting UTXOs, miner fees, fee bumping, and a bunch of other useful parameters. Quote from: Agbamoni on July 27, 2023, 10:14:11 PMWhat are the factors that can influence these transaction fees?Fees are largely influenced by supply and demand for limited block space but unlike traditional payments, fees are not a percentage of the amount being sent. Instead, bitcoin fees are based on the amount of data in the transaction. The more inputs and outputs you are using, the greater the fees. The fewer the number of inputs/outputs, the lower the fees.Â  Quote from: Agbamoni on July 27, 2023, 10:14:11 PMWhere can i track the recent bitcoin transaction fees rate?Again, mempool space is probably the best tool for this. You can use the standard charts seen here: https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool and you can select a timeframe that you would like to see by sliding the timeframe from one side to another. Here is the fee rate for the last month: https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool#1mBit Feed is another fun and useful tool to better understand how fees work. It's a visual tool that shows a live feed of transactions as they are sent. You can hover over each and every transaction to view the number of inputs/outputs, total fees paid, fee rate and a couple other metrics. https://bits.monospace.live/You might also find this resource useful for getting a basic understanding for how fees work: https://www.whatisbitcoin.com/learn/what-is-a-transaction-fee",

But it seems that we are back to normal, like 4 sat/vB might get your transaction confirmed in the next couple of hours.

But if you are sending from your own personal wallet into an exchange address, you can adjust/customize the fees. Mind you that the only way to make your transaction faster if you are making the transaction from your own personal wallet is to pay a higher fee.",
