Just letting it over to the community is pretty risk in my eyes.Facilitators are available but do not have owner priveleges, it will be governed through out the fair launch phase and then renounce ownership of the contract which is just a standard token with locked liquidity that does not need any further intervention from anyone with owner priveleges. Guidlines and facilitators are decided by the community members within the Telegram group.At least that's the plan. This is a social experiment where it would be nice to see what a crypro community can do.We'll wait and see. I myself see potential, I did create it but I am a participant (the most excited one though)",

It is still in fairlaunch phase on DxSale. The ownership cannot be renounced until the fairlaunch is finalized (As per DxSale instructions).Although it is not yet renounced, the privileges are not valid as there is no mint function and no disable selling function, also no tax to be set or changed.I am pretty sure anyone with the knowledge who takes a look at the contract code on bscscan will verify this.Nevertheless, I value your knowledge and precaution, if everyone does what you do then scam projects never succeed in what they do. Do join us in the Telegram group, building a community is the main part of this experiment and we would love to have you there.",

Btw, I personally deployed the contract if that is what you are asking, but I'm not here to convince people to buy in, not for a fake use case or promise that this is gonna blow up for whatever reason. I am saying that it is unique because it's the only one that says what it truly is. Just a coin that does not have someone behind it waiting for the right moment to suck out everything. I am doing this as an experiment, and I am not urging anyone to participate in it.I am just curious how would people react to something that they know they can't get scammed in (I invite you & others to challenge this by checking the contract). I have been a victim of a few clever and some not so clever scams myself and it honestly hurts me when I get fooled like that. So I thought, what if there is a big community where people can discuss and avoid that, sharing among them a coin that they know cannot be rugged.Join us in the Telegram group @Egg_Community , it is still small but hopefully will grow, with or without a coin though.",

After the sale, I am as everyone else but I'd be building a useful community that I can be proud of. All what is stated are my motives for this experiment.I invite everyone to be mindful of what they can be potentially going in to, this or other coins.  What I can assure is that there is nothing I'm promising about this coin because I plan for it to be an experiment within the crypto space, where I see people throwing huge numbers on fake projects that promise stuff that they do not end up doing. Why not a coin that you are sure that will not do anything fancy but will not steal your money, just a bond with everyone else in the community combatting fake projects.Anyway, I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, I'm happy seeing people's reactions about this (Negative or not) as it is what I intended from this post. Regardless if the coin fails or not.",

It might fail but will create the community.Having these people in one place, coupled with people with knowledge and sharing thoughts about any new stuff that come out, we can create awareness among them and more precisely, kill any hyped scam project at least decreasing any profit they get off people in this space.I'm using the coin to do that since its not easy to bring as many people in a Telegram group. It might not be the best way, I'm happy to hear your thoughts on how to advance on this. This could start in a Telegram group and propagate to other platforms but I targeted Telegram since its were all the scammy stuff starts.Plus, a coin is a fun thing for the community to play around with and create catchy stuff online and also speculate based on community interaction (so a toy). Also, to be perfectly clear, as the deployer I do own 6K of the 1M coins where the rest are going towards the fairlaunch and liquidity pool.Thank you for interacting on this topic, I'm loving this.",
