If he real, why not just posted it on (CNN) ? why in some random account ? ~XD.Anyway, it's easy to create these (Just go to CHATGPT). I just check the article on various AI-Checker some of them got 50% mix check and some of the result are (AI Detect) article.",

Stake.com have recently been hacked by a North Korean hacking team and they stole over $40 000 000 from their wallet, so things like this are real.  I hope law enforcement will take this \"death\" threat seriously and they will charge whomever are behind this. I also hope this is not some marketing stunt that are pulled for Halloween, because I see a photo has been posted with a person holding Eddie's head in a glass bottle under his arm.",

The crazy thing is stake don't just deny you from withdrawing on their platform, something must have happened that make them do that, stake is one of the most trusted online gambling platform out there and they are always transparent more than every other casinos.This online casino is also one of the few ones that don't deny you after winning several times in a role on their platform, some others will block you off their platform for winning several times but not stake.

Such a write-up is an indirect threat to the life and business of whoever is involved, which in this situation is Eddie.Anway's, I highly doubt that Eddie would even see this, except someone sends it directly to him, and by way, i personally believe that anybody who is running a business like a gambling casino, should already be used it such threat and hoaxes as this, so maybe just like you said, you may probably just laugh it off and forget about it when he sees it.",

I think it's obvious that the OP created this thread considering the medium/twitter account has no followers, otherwise, how would the OP have found out about it, and why the brand new account? I actually believed this for a second and was shocked, considering how many issues there are about Stake and the lack of attendance from Stunna / Edward in terms of complaints to date. The reality is that he's probably sitting in a very fine position somewhere and neglecting the problems with the business. I'm sure the OP won't come back but I think that they should be tagged for a severe act of misinformation anyway.",

Pretty sure that the person who did the article is a piece of shit but that doesn't mean that they're mentally ill because they can do that, cartel members that skin your face while you're alive are sane as anyone can be, how about that.Regarding the article, OP should've checked the author of the Medium article to see if it's a credible news, which in this case is not as pointed out by other members already. Maybe next time anything weird is happening on the new, check multiple sources.",

This kind of news is something that can’t even be hidden from the public without it even happening just an attack to his residents can trigger a reaction which few media could have taken note of, I will just advice who ever the person involved in this is to just take it done and focus on the right ways of getting their funds back that’s if the amount he claims is real.",
