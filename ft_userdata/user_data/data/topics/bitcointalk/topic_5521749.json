  "content": "The current Bitcoin rally has started since its inception in 2009 and people’s interest in it is constantly increasing. The possibility of Bitcoin’s price increasing in the coming days is the focus and possibility of a more concrete target. With Bitcoin’s new milestone and six-figure price increase, it is easier for analysts to feel that there is a possibility of getting more profit in estimating its price. This is more of an expectation for retail investors that Bitcoin’s price will continue to increase and the possibility of buying fractions in the race to hold. Small fractions are the trend of accumulating weekly or monthly (DCA) and buying more aggressively in the coming days. More rewards await regular bitcoiners as the bull run now beginning (present) next year and this bull run may become more pronounced in the coming years. Ready to buying Bitcoin aggressively ?",
