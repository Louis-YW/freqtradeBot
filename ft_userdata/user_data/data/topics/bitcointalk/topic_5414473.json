That being said, a bunch of wallet.dat files having a particular amount of rounds means they were either forged or all generated on the same machine, so you can only correlate wallet.dat rounds from different sellers to determine whether they are all fake, or not all of them.",

I had the idea to check the rounds (iteration) of these wallets as I saw some with values < 25000 and now we can say that these wallets are fake. The producers of such wallets didn't know that wallets with iteration < 25000 can't be generated with Bitcoin Core",
