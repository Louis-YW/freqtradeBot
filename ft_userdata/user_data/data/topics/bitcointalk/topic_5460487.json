At first when I read the op question, I was planning to choose Wasabi to Samourai because I have not heard of Samourai but this made me to do some research on it and the result is very much position. The review was conducted early this year, though I don't know if there is another review before this one. And from what see here on the review article. Samourai is more better than Wasabi Wallet.

I would keep sending satoshis even without coinjoin, if it wasn't for the reason that, sometimes, I don't want the receiver to know my identity in the forum or the balance I hold in my wallet. So, for me, the level of privacy Wasabi provides is enough.Of course, I'm also reticent of chain analysis companies, and I might reconsider my preference for Wasabi, but as long as data is only leaked in case of criminal offence (at least so far), I'm in no hurry to change wallet provider because, although I'm pro-privacy, I'm of course against money-laundering.I only report my own experience, and I'm not an expert, so please take everything I said with a pinch of salt.",
