This time the ANN looks completely professional and is well equipped with the required information. The color scheme used in the soothes the eyes also. Glad to see that you guys have made sufficient effort to enhance a gambler’s privacy. Moreover I also liked the fact that, you have clearly mentioned that No KYC. The deposit bonus also looks promising. I am definitely sure that many people will get attracted to the site by seeing the bonus. I am only in doubt regarding this call facility, as in this manner the gambler’s phone number can be exposed to the team right?",

I have talked with betcrypto a lot of times and I have to admit that I was convinced that they are not the typical casino who will turn into a KYC casino at the end when people will make bigger withdraw.

This shows how committed you are to render Services to your potential clients being here actively responding to enquiries and questions from your potential customers.If I may ask do you have regional or national restrictions? Or can a client access your site through the use of VPN without having any issues ie withdrawal and location issues in the near future if wining and wanting to withdraw their funds.Lastly is your casino licensed and if Yes under which jurisdiction is it licensed? Kindly let isy know the country you got your license to operate from.",
