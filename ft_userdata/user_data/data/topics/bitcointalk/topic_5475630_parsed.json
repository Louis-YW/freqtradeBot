Full node will store all blockchain data on your device.QuoteBlockchairAt blockchair.com you can download blockchain data at https://blockchair.com/dumps#database",

There is a table there with bitcoin balance (balances_bitcoin.satoshi_day), and there are tables with inputs, outputs and TXs, so theoretically, using these tables, and filtering the joins with date intervals and minimum balance values, one should be able to derive the information on the platform. I gave it a quick go, but despite using up some credits to use the middle sized engine, I kept on getting timeouts for a relatively simple query that tried to obtain all TXs with a current balance of over 2K BTCs and no outputs to date. It could be an alternative to explore further though, in case you don’t eventually create a custom solution on your own environment.",

That would put all funded addresses in chronological order of the first received transaction. That doesn't mean they're \"dormant\", they could have received more recent transactions too.I can think of a combination of \"comm\" and \"sort\" to combine those 2 lists. If there's any interest, I'll do it, but only once. With limited RAM and HDD, I expect it to take a few hours to sort this long list.",

You'll need the full blockdata.Correct.  I should have said something like address, input, output, net and final TX date.I'm actually trying to find a way to get similar output to this defunct google code project:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xTROekDerP1TPOB3SOD_1bbQr580BPqbhF3YHdO96pw/edit?pli=1#gid=189298223But that method looks useless without 2TB of memory.  So I was thinking to manipulate previously dumped data.Quote from: DdmrDdmr on November 28, 2023, 09:33:43 AMAs an alternative to having to download stuff, I took a brief look to see if it was feasible to do using dune.com.
