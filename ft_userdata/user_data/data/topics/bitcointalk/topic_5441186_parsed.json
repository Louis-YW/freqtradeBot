Not long ago, I lose my father (74 years old), it's been 3 weeks now, he was the reason why I was able to confidently continue my crypto journey with no hurry, he has never for once told me that I am wasting my time, I remember one morning in 2018, he called me and told me about a podcast he listened to on the radio, he said they talked about Bitcoin on the radio and this makes it very important. He said, do not give up, who knows? This could be the next big thing in the future. And his favorite quote is \" this Life doesn't wait for anyone, things evolves very fast\" ... I am able to be who I am today because of my father, while many people have a different story about their spouse when it comes to Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin, mine was different and very supportive. The only regret I have is, not being able to take good care of my Bitcoin Father, I feel like I never did enough for him at all, he will forever be missed.If you have families that support you on your journey, even when they don't entirely understand, consider yourself lucky and take good care of them before it's too late. And for those who don't have any supporters, do not blame them, older people find Bitcoin very confusing.",

Well there's something my people often say \"Whenever you sleep and wakeup that is where your morning starts counting\" meaning whenever you get the right information that's when you start making your findings and putting more effort to utilize the information, we must not wait to be gingered by people to venture into something rather praying for the right information to gets to our hands at the right time.",

I really wish I had one too. My own dad doesn't want to even here anything about cryptocurrency or even online trading he despise them alot. You should continue remembering all the advice your father gave you they will guide you in life.  You shouldn't have any regrets just stay put and strong.

I know first hand how unsupportive a parent can be so I can understand the bond you must have shared with your pop. A supportive parent would always have you back no matter how bad it would get.  He would surely be missed and would remain with you in your heart. People often wish they took more care of their parents while they were still alive.",

Like, for example, btc falls, if we talk about crypto currencies.On the other hand, if your relatives don't understand anything in btc, then you can simply not tell them about your hobbies. After all, it's your life and live it the way you want to. No need to wait for the approval of others and their guides. Especially if they are no longer young, which means they are at least distrustful of everything unusual and new for them. I have long believed that btc is not for the elderly. With the exception of a few, most will be hostile to it. What can I say, even people of a young and conscious age are extremely cautious in relation to btc.",

Losing your number one support system is just hard especially for someone who's taking a different approach in life. In any case, I don't want you and most likely your father wouldn't want you to beat yourself up for \"not being there for him\", trust me man, when you look back at all those things you did with your dad, you'd be able to say that you enjoyed every bit of it with no regrets whatsoever, although of course, the lingering feeling of missing what was lost will always remain. Take all the time you need to grieve and recuperate man. It's hard enough to lose your support system, let alone a father as well. You take all the time to heal, and keep up with your bitcoin journey, I'm pretty sure and the whole community could vouch for this when I say that he'll be proud of you if you carry on with it.",
