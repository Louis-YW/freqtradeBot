I'd like to test some simple rules like if MACD has correct value then sell/buy over the last 2-3years? If you do not know how to code and you do not want to learn how to do it then you could backtest your strategy by hand as many traders did in the past.I did this a few times and I am not going to deny it is time consuming but you will learn a lot on the process and I consider it a valuable experience.Another option is to use a spreadsheet software and calculate the MACD with its formula and then add on another cell a formula which has the rules you want to evaluate, finally you can filter the results and paper trade those signals and assess if they work or not.",

      "body": "Tradingview is pretty good. They have a number of already made scripts and strategies under technicals and community scripts. I can also see some MACD strategy though it would need some bit of modifications when it comes to time frame, risk reward ratio, etc. but running a backtest through such script is not hardTrading view uses its own scripting language known as pine script. I would encourage you to learn it. It's very helpful in the long run. I am personally learning it. I am halfway through the course online that is offered at Udemy for just $11 and learning it makes things look easier.",

You might find something that works in a trending market but won’t work in a ranging market and vice versa.Then you got the issue of slippage. When you backtest there is no slippage and your entries and exits are always perfect. This never happens in the real world. And a working backtest might seem profitable but in real life impossible because slippage hasn’t been considered.",
