  "content": "We all heard and some of you have experience weti dey happened in the forum about di Sinbad mixer and those participants wey been dey the campaign come dey use Binance and other exchanges to receive pay because the transaction fee if very high and dey dodge am because dem no wan pay. And now the escrow address wey been dey send di money and now dat FIODNederland come tok say di company been dey allow people wey dey thief money to do mixing work dey send the money go another places and all di people wey received money from the escrow e dey under investigation. And before you go clear yourself, you go tell Binance which business you do with Sinbad company wey dem come pY you dat money. And if you no fit express yourself well then you account dem go block am. So nai make I say make I come tell my country people say let dem no use Centralized Exchanges to receive pay because di exchange itself can freeze your account if there is a small mistake. And in this days Binance set dey hot. And dem dey on hot seat so small things na KYC na dem dey ask. But if you use non custodial wallet to receive your pay nobody go question you. Use Electrum to receive pay and send to Binance to sell and not to keep. To avoid wahala na be the best approach to settle cases. Be careful out there. Like this Binance don send messages to all this people wey received BTC from the Sinbad escrow address to do KYC and more information. Dis one na for your own good.",

Centralized Exchanges dem e no hard to use but DEX dey give tough time.The disadvantage I see in dex is the low trading volume as most people prefer to use centralized exchanges. Also another is the price that buyers and sellers with ads wants to sell their coins. The price is not favorable on decentralized exchanges, you can check the bitcoin seller ads on Agoradesk, not favoring at all.You do not need app to use Agoradesk. The laptop I was using before, Bisq was difficult to use on it, but good on a good laptop. I do not remember if it is a zip file, but if it is, you have to unzip the file before installation.I know Nigerians, what we go for most is the price, once you compare the price on centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges and seeing a significant difference, you will still want to use centralized exchanges, thinking of decentralized exchanges as a loss of money because of the unfavorable coin prices.Another disadvantage of decentralized exchanges is the limited coins, centralized exchanges make users to have access to more coin pairs.",

And now the escrow address wey been dey send di money and now dat.My brother you and I know that that the primary purpose of doing every business or invest is to maximize profit at a minimized cost. I won't blame people for using their centralized exchange address to receive payment for the work they did during this period of high Bitcoin transaction cost. People that did did work have no hand in whatever problem that is rocking the company so I don't see why they should be afraid of anything. If binance or any exchange they used in receiving payment ask them to for any form of clarification they should do it stating their official business with the Sinbad mixer company and it's escrowed account. I believe the signature thread is still active. They can put the thread link and those exchanges can verify the date the thread was announced and the date they received the payments. There is no hidden something there and one shouldn't be scared of explaining your own side of the story provided you have no wrong doing. We are all trying to make the world a better place if this is the way that they can use to fish out people giving Bitcoin investment a bad name and reputation I don't see anything wrong in that. They are called centralized exchange for a reason and before you signed up for those exchanges you agreed to their terms and conditions so we should also support whatever is just. I don't believe those exchanges will punish legimate people who received payment from that escrowed account for the signature work they announced here in the forum.QuoteAnd before you go clear yourself, you go tell Binance which business you do with Sinbad company wey dem come pY you dat money. And if you no fit express yourself well then you account dem go block am. My brother tell binance the simple truth, with verifiable evidence and facts. The one that will help you the most is the link to the signature thread. Point out the date it was announced in the forum and tell them the nature of the work. Tell them the day your payment is usually made to that account from the Sinbad escrowed account. This is very transparent. It is not the fault of the participants that the signature work was announced in the first place.",

Yes you can use a mixer to mix your Bitcoin from the Electrum wallet to any other address and no one can trace where the Bitcoin enter. And to use mixer is very simple. Though depends on the mixer and now that mixers are ban in the forum, you can search for a mixer in google search and select a good mixer and mix your coins. And the first thing wey you go do na to go the di mixer and in the recipient address box, type the address in which you want your Bitcoin to go and after den dem go send you di address you go pay di coins into for dem to mix. And you have to wait for some time for them to finish.If you follow those steps then you go fit send Bitcoin to your another wallet, or another people wey dem no go fit trace.",

Those affected should take this as warning to not trust exchanges especially centralized ones or any centralized Bitcoin service providers as anytime wey problem come dey go find way to throw you under the bus. And those wey no dey affected should also learn form this. Also avoid centralized wallet providers and only use non custodial wallets. We Nigerians aren't decentralized enough, we need to learn how to dey use more of decentralized services for this industry because we self no dey better country wey be say the government fit just wake up one dey wan ban every account that has a connection with Bitcoin through any centralized service wey dem fit get access to, to collect data wey dem go use work.
