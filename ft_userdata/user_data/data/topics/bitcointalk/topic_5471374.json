  "content": "Gas fees are what’s holding up sportsbooks from going from Web2 to Web3When you currently fund your sports betting with BTC or ETH, bitcoin or ethereum, you are funding into a Web 2 account. The source of your funds, the cryptocurrency you are using, rests on a blockchain, but you don’t put your BTC onto an actual chain.The sportsbook that excepts your BTC deposit is on Web2 technology. The reason that no online sportsbooks or online casinos have yet switched to Web3 is due to gas fees.Gas fees are the fees you pay to facilitate a transaction on a blockchain. The more congested the network, the longer it takes for a transaction to go through and the more we’re likely to pay in gas fees.Ethereum is a prime example of this. Ethereum works off a proof of stake model where validators create new blocks of transactions. For doing so, validators receive a reward.The reward are gas fees. Sometimes, depending on how congested the Ethereum Network has become, gas fees can go up to $100 per transaction. No sportsbook or online casino can pay for the gas fees and it’s impossible to pass on gas fees to customers.Transaction fees on Ethereum are expensive and Solana has security issuesEthereum appears perfect for blockchain sportsbook and online casino developments. But the gas fees on Ethereum are unpredictable. It’s tough to run an online casino when you’re not sure how much you, or your customers, must pay in gas fees depending on how many other transactions are going through the network.Solana’s gas fees are low, but Solana has reliability issues. Solana has had trouble pretty much since Day 1. Numerous outages, a hack that resulted in the loss of approximately $8 billion, and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler naming Solana in a suit against Coinbase have led to crypto investors cashing out and validators moving to other chains.Right now, it’s difficult to know Solana’s future. So neither Ethereum nor Solana seems like a solution for online casino and Sportsbetting.Read more→ https://n2g.io/0b04eb2",
