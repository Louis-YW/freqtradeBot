It's obvious you didn't create this wallet by yourself, and it's also obvious the real owner of those addresses didn't give it to you. So at best, someone created a fake wallet. There is no password to crack, the wallet doesn't contain the private keys. Give it up.",

That's not your .dat file and I even bet you bought it, so, congrats, you got scammed.
