The tournament above will certainly attract the interest of many gamblers, but only for those who consider gambling to be entertainment.",

      "body": "people addicted to gambling, are not addicted just because of money, and precisely because they do not want to lose. this Socialtournaments is something good only for people who are not addicted, those people who went to the doctor and the doctor confirmed that they are unfortunately addicted to gambling and the doctor recommended treatment in inpatient and rehabilitation centers for addicts, so these people should strictly follow all treatment, from what I know about addicts, because I have had some in my family and for many years we fought for them to be cured and unfortunately they always escaped from the hospital and died, gambling addicts should stay away from any game for many yearsIt is not 1 year, 2 years or 3 years that a person addicted to gambling is cured and can go back to gambling in moderation, it is much more than 3 years for the addict to cure, and in that entire time they should not gamble at all, even Although this game does not involve money, unfortunately addiction is a serious and very problematic illness, a total cure takes a long way and few people are able to completely cure themselves. I don't know what's in the TOS of this Socialtournaments, but in my opinion it would be good if their TOS made it very clear that anyone addicted to gambling should not use the siteanyone addicted to gambling should seek medical help and not use the site as a way to treat their addiction, they should put these rules in my opinion. because many people may think that since it doesn't involve money and they are addicted, therefore there is no problem using the site because it won't make their addiction worse because they are not betting with money. gambling addicts look for all possible ways to play even when they don't put money in, the desire they feel for the game is very strong and people need to withdraw them from games even if they are games that don't involve money",

How can it help gambling addiction when the gambler still plays like betting something? It's even inviting newcomers to gambling because it's a sort of training for them to play betting. We all have different views of course since this looks like a casino still.",

It's hard to replace a gambling session where the game is between the player and the house, or between two players by a tournament where the gambler will be competing against hundreds or maybe thousands of another players, meaning winning chances are too slim, therefore not being an interesting and exciting game.If you want to fight gambling addiction, you have to replace it by another activities which are healthy and don't involve betting practices, otherwise you will be still encouraging this kind of behavior on the addicted individual.",

There's a high chance that they will find it have no challenge at all knowing that there's nothing at stake and maybe the winning price isn't worthy their time. Though for the gamblers who really want to quit gambling without spending money, it is a great way to entertain themselves with the spice of getting profit with the benefit of quitting gambling. Overall, it's a great way for some people to stop gambling, we now have this kind of option to recommend to someone who really want to quit or for some gambler who just want to have the entertainment they get from gambling.",

I will even say that it will attract them to play more because what they get from the free tournament may attract them to play with real money. The same as the fun mode of slot games, it is being used to attract people to gamble and I also believe that the tournament provided by socialtournament is also to attract people to gamble.  However if addicted gamblers want to stop their gambling, they should start to stay away from anything related to gambling. Joining free tournament will not really work imo. Obviously, it will be based on how people deal with it.",

Not really sure that the social tournament you are referring to can prevent or limit cases of gambling addiction and will disappear, but maybe it could have a small effect as a preventive measure. I remember a slot site that provided several games that did not require complete KYC and the site gave prizes to visitors to play for free every day, but winning prizes could be sold at varying prices to people. Even though this game does not involve real money, coins are freely traded so that it is absolutely not a reflection for gambling addicts to stop.While I'm not sure that a high percentage rate will help active gamblers stop gambling while taking part in these tournaments, it may have a positive effect as a deterrent. The point is that in the case of gamblers who are addicted it is not an easy thing to cure, so for this kind of tournament is not one of the right solutions if no other education is provided for those who are addicted.",

This kind of tournament is also not in regular basis which means players can’t use this as an alternative for gambling addiction since you will need a consistent gaming to fight addiction,I start on playing slot games that doesn’t involve real money just to try it until I become curious to try the real slot game after winning huge amount of play money tokens hoping that it will be the same. My curiosity and ambition push me to gamble, same with other players that will join on this kind of tournament.I’m not aware with this tournament, Can you provide a the link for sample?",
