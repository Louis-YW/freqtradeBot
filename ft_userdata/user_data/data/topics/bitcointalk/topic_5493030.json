Wouldn't the level of adoption outgrow what it currently is at the moment?Do you think that altcoin is a major distraction to bitcoins adoption?",

Altcoins depend on Bitcoin but because they are very scam, people who are firstly exposed to altcoins, invest in altcoins and lose money through altcoins, will not have good thinking about this market.They will have wrong thinking about Bitcoin and think it is a scam but they must learn to differentiate between Bitcoin and altcoins. We can not stop altcoins and investors must prepare their knowledge to avoid scam in altcoins. Bitcoin has nothing to do with altcoins and what investors do.Altcoins can not stop Bitcoin adoption growth, never can do it.",

So altcoins indirectly have supported the adoption of Bitcoin.",

The last person that I introduced to crypto claimed that Bitcoin was too costly for him, so he went for altcoin and when he started making some good money he started using the profits to buy back some Bitcoin. He understand that Bitcoin is much more reliable than altcoins but altcoins have some nasty opportunities to bring some good amount of ROI faster than Bitcoin, you just have to be smart to make this work. Altcoins is the most risky play but it has the higher return on investment opportunities if you know how to play this out, but still I will advice people to focus on Bitcoin as their main target.",

Also these altcoins would not have survived assuming bitcoin does not exist. This is because most of them duplicated bitcoin for their own selfish purposes, and that is why you see that they keep it centralized so that the coin can be manipulated by the dev at anytime. Nobody created any altcoin to solve financial problems and to also give financial freedom to man. Those potentials made the value of bitcoin start increasing, and altcoin dev jump into creating all sort of shitcoins, which was an eye opener to people that altcoins are used to scam people of their money due to pump and dump. After so many investors lost to altcoin, because they think that all cryptocurrency are the same. It was then they realized that bitcoin is different and can be trusted if you invest in it for a long term. Altcoin made bitcoin to be more popular.",

There are new people that has been introduce to invest on altcoins by some people they meet on internet or maybe even in real life and provably on the way for trying to earn some profit from their investments they know that bitcoin is at the top of the chain on cryptocurrency and for sure with that they would do a research to know more about bitcoin.If your concern is they might get discourage if this people will get scam by scam altcoins then provably that's the case if the person is not really interested on cryptocurrency. But if they want to try other crypto then for sure they would start to learn on how to invest their time and money on bitcoin.",

It's like when you start a business but the business isn't what you expected and you start blaming the stores around you that are competing with you. That only shows your weakness and failure and only knows how to blame others instead of admitting your own fault. For me, I don't see any influence or connection between altcoins and global bitcoin adoption. I think if bitcoin really meets people's needs and desires, they will choose bitcoin, but if it doesn't have what people need, it's understandable that it won't be popular. But I see that bitcoin adoption is progressing very well and quickly, not stagnant or slow like you think.",

Bitcoin adoption is okay from my opinion and I don't understand why altcoins will stand as a distraction cause there's no distraction at the first place.maybe you're just making a vague statement here and aren't getting the point so well. I'm never trying to make any comparison between Bitcoin and any other altcoin cause in the first place thier isn't any comparison at all. Bitcoin had an ATH of $73k that's obviously 7× what any altcoin have ever attained and even the few ones that gained value over time all went up under the shades of Bitcoin. What I'm talking about is that because of the way the society mistake Bitcoin as just one of the cryptocurrency, whenever someone invest in an altcoin that fails with time, it somehow sends a wrong signal to the whole crypto ecosystem and you have different people that wouldn't even dream of investing into Bitcoin because they know someone that lost his investment in a shit project and thereby drawing the conclusion that Bitcoin is same as those altcoins. Some even make the mistake of holding on to altcoins that can't stand the test of time thinking that by so doing, they will be able have similar worth that comes from investing in Bitcoin.It's never a shift of blame of any sort but just a statement of fact that altcoin in one way or the other is a distraction to Bitcoin adoption in some sense.",

Those are often coins that have a relatively low market capitalization and are being pumped or dumped. If you want to look at them, you can sort coins on a website like Coingecko by price change over 24 hours and over 7 days.As for altcoins being a distraction, I'm not so sure. On the one hand, I think that the vast majority of altcoins are just rubbish. On the other hand, I guess thinking about Bitcoin and altcoins in that context is a zero-sum mindset (one's loss is another one's gain and vice versa), whereas I'm more supportive of a positive-sum mindset (we can all have gains). I honestly don't think that Bitcoin would've been doing better if there were no altcoins.",

Thus, the presence of altcoins can be seen as a competing factor that may be hindering the introduction of Bitcoin, rather than supporting the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole.I think the word popularity shouldn’t be used there because bitcoin on its own is already popular and sits alongside the general word cryptocurrency, if cryptocurrency is mentioned bitcoin is the next thing said close to it. The term to be used will be adoption, I think the adoption rate of bitcoin will maybe increase because many people wouldn’t jump into buying of this Altcoins. If you check the total market of cryptocurrency you will see that Altcoins take half of the which is still a large number if you ask me. Without them the market cap of bitcoin might increases. But it still seems a bit tricky to say that people that invested in Altcoins today will have moved to bitcoin if they weren’t any altcoin because some will have totally opted out of cryptocurrency at large. If you look at how people treat this Altcoins you find out that it is treated as a get rich quick scheme and since they might know that bitcoin wouldn’t give them such feature they would rather not invest into it. So I will rather say the true bitcoin investors are already in bitcoin and altcoin isn’t like a distraction, only the few are distracted",

      "body": "QuoteIsn't Altcoin a distraction to Bitcoin adoption? I think that altcoins are an obstacle for bitcoin's adoption. Here is my view. Bitcoin was a significant computing breakthrough in computer sciences to solve the “double-spending” problem in distributed systems. Real breakthrough ideas in computing are rare, I would say they happen once in a decade.  Altcoins are mostly derived from Bitcoin's code, but with some changes or additions that claim to enhance its functionality or performance. However, most of these changes are either needless, untested, or harmful to the security and decentralization of the network. Altcoins also create confusion and divert the attention and resources of others from the real innovation of Bitcoin. Instead of concentrating on the adoption and improvement of Bitcoin, which has the most reliable and proven network, altcoins mislead users and investors with false claims and hype, this is not my opinion, it is based on facts. In software engineering, I appreciate the Layered architecture style (system is organized as a series of layers that are seen as stacked on one another like TCP/IP stack)  So rather than being sidetracked by the “new” get rich quick innovative yada yada yada blockchain.. people could work on projects higher up in the layer projects like LN, Nostr, BitVM, etc.BTC>",
