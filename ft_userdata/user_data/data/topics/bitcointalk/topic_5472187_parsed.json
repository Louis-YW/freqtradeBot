I do agree that you need to solve that blacklist first before encouraging users to visit your website if you're serious about it. With how competitive exchange landscape has become, it is hard to see how you'll stay afloat with your current proposal.",

At least warn us. This seems to be an instant exchange where you can convert from Bitcoin to Tether or Bitcoin to Fiat (RUB) or vice versa. But it only supports the Russian currency Ruble.I would usually not trust any random instant or P2P exchange unless there are some good positive reviews and the site is trusted one.Just going randomly to the site, I didn't find the exchange rate to be of any value. Where for 1 bitcoin you will get less than 32000$ while the current bitcoin price is well over 34000$. Even if anyone wanted to use the site, the exchange rate isn't a realistic one.",
