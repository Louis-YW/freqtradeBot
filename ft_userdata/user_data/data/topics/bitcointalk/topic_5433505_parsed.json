Russia's modern military developments are nothing to sneeze at.Putin sends warship armed with hypersonic missiles into Atlantic, Indian Oceans as U.S. Air Force tests deadly new tactichttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-01-07-putin-sends-warship-with-hypersonic-missiles-atlantic-indian-oceans.html A clash between the U.S.-led NATO alliance and Russia appears even more inevitable this week based on new moves by both sides.First, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a warship carrying new Zircon hypersonic missiles on a mission that will take it into the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in what is a clear warning to the U.S. and the NATO military alliance not to escalate their support for Ukraine ahead of what is expected to be a winter offensive involving Russian and Belorussian forces.“The deployment of the frigate appears intended to make maximum possible public impact, given the announcement was made by Putin himself in a televised conference call with his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu,” Zero Hedge reported.In addition to Shoigu, Putin talked with Igor Krokhmal, the frigate’s captain which bears the name “Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov,” reminding that the ship is armed with the hypersonic missile payload — “again, in a coordinated message which unveiled the deployment to the public for the first time,” the outlet reported.“This time the ship is equipped with the latest hypersonic missile system – ‘Zircon’ – which has no analogs,” Putin said. “I would like to wish the crew of the ship success in their service for the good of the Motherland.”In addition, the warship is expected to traverse the Mediterranean Sea while engaged in the Atlantic portion of its mission.
