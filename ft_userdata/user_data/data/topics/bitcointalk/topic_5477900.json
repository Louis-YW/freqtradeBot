Even the ledger that was compromised I don’t think it affected the device directly but DApps connected to it, if one opens the DApps an unauthorized transaction which needed to be signed will be there, you only get compromised if you actually signed that transaction. This kind of things is one of the reason why the best wallets to store bitcoin are bitcoin only wallets",

There is news everywhere that Ledger is compromised and some dApps and not to sign ANY tranasctions until further notice. The incident wasn't about the Ledger hardware wallet itself but the Ledger Connect Kit (a Javascript library) which is used by many DApps. And since you really can't connect Electrum to those DApps while your Ledger hardware wallet is plugged in, you're safe using it. There's no problem in using it right now to make BTC transactions.Also as I've stated in other thread related to this issue, Ledger already fixed this issue.Quote from: julerz12 on December 14, 2023, 02:56:19 PMLedger already made an update about this.QuoteUpdate: The malicious version of the file was replaced with the genuine version at around 2:35pm CET. The new genuine version should be propagated soon. We will provide a comprehensive report as soon as it’s ready.In the meantime, we’d like to remind the community to always Clear Sign your transactions - remember that the addresses and the information presented on your Ledger screen is the only genuine information.If there’s a difference between the screen shown on your Ledger device and your computer/phone screen, stop that transaction immediately.Source: https://twitter.com/Ledger/status/1735298142118072512Quote from: adaseb on December 14, 2023, 03:03:30 PMIs Metamask also unsafe?Metamask stated that their users were not affected.QuoteAfter investigation, we determined that MetaMask Portfolio and SDK users were never at risk. As a precaution, we temporarily turned off transactions on Portfolio to update our dependencies.Source: https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1735378711619207569You can also learn more about this incident in the latest blog post by Ledger's CEO:https://www.ledger.com/blog/a-letter-from-ledger-chairman-ceo-pascal-gauthier-regarding-ledger-connect-kit-exploit",

Ledger and WalletConnect can confirm that the malicious code was deactivated. You are now safe to use your Ledger Connect Kit.

Keep your bitcoin safe and separate from those altcoins. You can get Passport hardware wallet.It depends on how you use it.For those who already have it, that doesn't mean you should just throw it away. However, for those who don't have one, you may still be free to consider any hardware wallet that fits the user's criteria.As long as I use Ledger with Electrum (for Bitcoin transactions), I have not encountered any problems regarding Software (Electrum) or HW vulnerabilities, even though I inevitably have to use Ledger Live for several Firmware updates.And if you want to be even more secure, you can use a multi-signature wallet between Electrum and Ledger Hardware wallet.",

Each hardware wallet certainly has its advantages and disadvantages. I even have the Nano X and Trezor T to learn more firsthand about both.Some explanations from Ledger related to the Ledger Connect Kit that was exploited some time ago.Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/blog/a-letter-from-ledger-chairman-ceo-pascal-gauthier-regarding-ledger-connect-kit-exploit– December 14th, 2023, Ledger experienced an exploit on Ledger Connect Kit, a Javascript library to connect Web sites to wallets.– The industry collaborated with Ledger to neutralize the exploit and try to freeze stolen funds very quickly – the exploit was effectively running for less than two hours. – This exploit is currently being investigated, Ledger has filed complaints and will help affected individuals try to recover funds. – This exploit did not and does not affect the integrity of Ledger hardware or Ledger Live.– The exploit was limited to third party DApps which use the Ledger Connect Kit.-snip-This was an unfortunate isolated incident. It is a reminder that security is not static, and Ledger must continuously improve our security systems and processes. In this area, Ledger will implement stronger security controls, connecting our build pipeline that implements strict software supply chain security to the NPM distribution channel.It is also a reminder that collectively we need to continue to raise the bar for security around DApps where users will engage in browser-based signing. It was Ledger’s service that was exploited this time, but in the future this could happen to another service or library.At Ledger, we believe clear signing, as opposed to blind signing, will help mitigate these issues. If the user can see what they sign on a trusted display, unintentionally signing rogue transactions can be avoided.Ledger devices are open platforms. Ethereum has a plugin system that allows DApps to implement clear signing, and DApps who would like to implement this protection for their users can learn how on developer.ledger.com. In the same way we saw the community come together today, we look forward to your help bringing clear signing to all DApps.So, using Electrum with Ledger is safe and not affected by the Ledger Connect Kit exploit case.",

What he is proving is that adaseb is not a newbie and likely not comfortable with me not recommending Ledger. But anyone that post about Ledger, I will still let the person know how Ledger is not a recommendable wallet.

I have gone through the features those hardware wallets have and I prefer Passport among them all. I also prefer Trezor before until they brought close source secure element with the Trezor Safe 3. For altcoins hardware wallet I still recommend Trezor Model T. If it is Ledger, I can never recommend such wallet. Ledger Nano is a wallet that do not care about their customers privacy and full control and yet becoming to be more of a wallet that can not be recommended.",
