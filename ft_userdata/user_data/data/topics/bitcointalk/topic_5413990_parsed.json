  "content": "Ok I have pretty much tested every exchange. Been using binance, bybit etc on mobile been excellent. I thought to finally give ftx try. Installed ftx pro but damn one of the ugliest app in crypto space. The interference is terrible and looks like just website created as app( which might be true i think). I was just shocked to see one of the most famous exchange with such terrible app. And the i decided to trade did level 1 verification thought it would be enough as they didn't tell about any limitations on trading except amount withdrawal limit. And then was unable to do trading because now it tells me i need next level verification for derivatives trading. And i also realised it doesn't have option to use usdt for trading( not sure about it)From every angle it looks so terrible but there maybe more to the story why it is still so famous. Can anyone elaborate it?",

One of the more pressing issues I have with exchanges are its verification processes with are seeming to get even tougher. Yes I know more and more news are coming out about scammers and other sort of vices, but compromising the decentralized nature of crypto-currency beats the aim of Crypto-currency being decentralized. Exchanges like binance aren't better when it comes to the incessant requirements of verification some of which demands details that I would consider private, If you ask be I am beginning to appreciate no kyc nor AML requirements exchange even more as they protect your privacy and some of them are very secured.",

Been using binance, bybit etc on mobile been excellent.I doubt this because of the reason being that, you can just download an exchange without being specific on which and which you've usedÂ  not by words but with your investments on them, moreover you aren't cleat if they were centralized exchanges ot decentralized exchanges that you have used, but base on your mentions of some CEX, i will encourage you to taste the decentralized ones too and feel the difference better, or better still, try afford buying a hardware wallet to avoid yourself from future embarrassments.",

I've seen a better interface on some wretched exchanges that went bankrupt or were closed. It was a little disappointing, given that they have a large user base and a good trading volume. I guess that's why I can't adapt to them and start using them more seriously, although this has been my intention for a long time.",
