The forum does not assign any positions to anyone, and your views look as if this is not a free forum where everyone has the right to vote, but some kind of closed prison, with its own strict laws.Relax, buddy.",

I wonder where did you get the idea of eafh description or you just based it on your own idea.I remember I did something like this but very close to characteristic and idea of a certain users lingering here. But anyway thats a lot of effort to post in.Â  Not sure though if others would agree with some description.",

      "body": "I think you've forgotten a big category of users : the spammers. People only posting for money and nothing else. They don't care about the topic they are posting on, have no experience with it but don't hesitate to create a fake one if necessary. They usually don't read the other answers of the thread except a random couple of ones they use to inspire their own posts which inevitably leads to repeat what it has been said several times before and to exasperate the legit readers. A part of them likes to write long posts with useless and off-topic details or one same idea repeated several times in a row with different words, naively hoping not to be spotted as a spammer by doing that. Many come from poor countries but not all of them.",

Well, I guess he had such a classification in his head and has created such a thread to see if he gets any merit.I see the ranking as somewhat arbitrary. To make classifications I would add those who defend privacy in Bitcoin to the maximum vs those who think that loss of privacy is inevitable (with more and more AML/KYC, blacklists etc.) and those who absolutely don't care.",

Anyways its cool to see how you put some efforts to write this since for sure it takes time before to write up this long statement towards each users classification here.",

I just saw, after writing my post, that the OP deleted his opening post. I suggest that if the OP has given up on the topic, he should lock this topic.",
