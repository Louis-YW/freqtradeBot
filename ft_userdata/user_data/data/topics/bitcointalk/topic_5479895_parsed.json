The price was earlier even below $1, and it took a gradual process to get to where it is right now, which is an amazing movement.¬†Bitcoin did not come this far on its own; the growth result has been a replica of how many people believe in it, and it has continued to grow, and it will still see more even with all the internal and external challenges that the currency does face from time to time, which sometimes leads to price drops and, after a while, a price correction.¬†$42k is among the highest prices it has reached, not its ATH. I believe after the halving we might see a new ATH, but that' won't happen immediately; it might take some time, and we might even see some drop in price before the initial price pushes up. We just have to hold what we can and see how it goes. Not having too much expectation will reduce the disappointment many might get as a result of them not seeing the price they believe it will reach at a certain time.",

From 2009 to 2024, that's a long journey Bitcoin have made in order to reach what it is today. It was not a smooth journey, there were ups and downs as well in it. Those who were successful of taking advantage of these ups and downs, are the people who are real bitcoiners. Thinking Bitcoin has a fine wine and keeping it stored not checking when to take advantage can be a foolish decision. Yes it is a fine wine but you need to have a test every now and then in order to understand how good it has become. You should never miss any opportunity if it's in front of you. We need to learn this as well if we want to be as successful Bitcoin user.",

As we know, its technology is unique and was created by Satoshi, which leaves a legacy for all of us. Over the years, bitcoin has kept on growing because it has a good road map and technology, and also because many people are believing it, which contributes to bitcoin's growth.As long as bitcoin is being mined and many people are still investing in it, it will keep on growing and give more opportunities to a lot of people. Bitcoin is complex and hard to study, but with effort and time, you will be rewarded. You just have to have patience and keep on growing. It's still not too late to invest in bitcoin, so beginners and those who are wary of investing should take the risks.",

But the thing with Bitcoin though is that it is the first, the prime mover and so everyone jump on the bandwagon and it's throughout it's young infancy, and as far as the price goes it has developed and now we are entering another block halving, and so for sure we will be looking for a new all time high again.Let's see in the next 14 years, and yes maybe it will really grow as we expected and the value itself will be like in the 6 digits, or as you describe it, a fine wine, a highest quality crypto.",

Bitcoin is indeed getting more valuable with time, although I'm not sure that it's working better than it used to (considering that the overload of transactions is sometimes leading to issues that weren't there before). Adoption is happening at a slow pace, but there's still a lot of potential there. The comparison is optimistic, but it's the start of a new year, so perhaps a good time to be hopeful and to expect Bitcoin to actually get better over time. Not just more expensive, but also better in terms of usability and reputation.",

I remember when it came on board as the first digital currency, people were very skeptical about it, many thought that it was a Ponzi scheme or a scam and after sometime it'll vanish with it's investors hard earned money. Today Bitcoin has proven critics wrong, many of them have turned believers and started it's investment, better late than never because they've seen that it's acceptance, adoption and profitability keeps increasing, and they can predict that it will keep getting better as time goes by. Bitcoin investment also gets better and sweeter if kept for a longer time.",

Sometimes the price fluctuates and reduces to a large extent but the good thing about it is that it will always recover. Hopefully, the price will beat its current ATH by next year and investors will be able to gain some profit. DCA strategy is the best if one intends to invest in Bitcoin because it is convenient and reduces the level of risk. But buying a lump sum when the price has dropped to a large extent will not be a bad idea if you have the funds to invest. Quote from: Nwada001 on December 31, 2023, 04:09:14 PM$42k is among the highest prices it has reached, not its ATH.

We just have to hold what we can and see how it goes. Not having too much expectation will reduce the disappointment many might get as a result of them not seeing the price they believe it will reach at a certain time. The Bitcoin market has never experienced the level of institutional Investment that the Spot Bitcoin ETF will attract. And this event might coincide with the halving which might make the market keep pumping. The market now seems unpredictable and it is possible not to experience any significant drop in price until we enter the bull run proper.",

It may happen that at the price you buy now, you will have to make the next purchase at a higher price instead of a lower price. so I don't think DCA will be more suitable now. no one can say anything about the future with certainty, but everyone has the same guesses that Bitcoin can prove to be an excellent asset in the coming time.",
