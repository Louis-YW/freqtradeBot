      "body": "USA Work Visa:Find a US employer willing to sponsor you. They must prove they couldn't fill the position with a qualified American worker. Popular work visa types are H-1B for skilled workers and L-1 for international transfers within a company.Once you have the job offer, the employer will file a visa petition on your behalf with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This could take 6-10 months for approval.If approved, then you can apply at your nearest US Embassy for the physical work visa itself. This step might take a few weeks. You'll need to provide proof of professional qualifications and take a medical exam.Once you obtain the visa, you can prepare to move to America! Your new employer will provide more info on migrating, from travel to arranging housing and insurance paperwork.",

      "body": "There are handbooks and guides that will help you get one and even agencies. But obviously, you just can't go there without having an employer so that's basically the cause why you're coming there.AFAIK, if you get a working VISA or any type of VISA from the USA, you'll also be able to visit Canada so that's like a double purpose if you obtain one.While Italy is good, you get more than one purpose upon getting a working visa from the USA.",

      "body": "Hiii !Obtaining a work visa for the USA or Italy involves securing a job offer and employer sponsorship. In the USA, your employer files a petition with USCIS, and upon approval, you apply for a visa. For Italy, your employer initiates the work permit process, and after approval, you apply for a work visa. Both processes require documentation, a possible interview, and adherence to specific rules. Research visa types, consider legal assistance, and be mindful of language and financial requirements. Stay informed about immigration policies, as they can change. Check official websites for the latest guidelines from USCIS and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.",
