Being responsible can be a big help, invest only what you can afford to lose and never use your life savings for the sake of Bitcoin investment, that is not safe at all.",

Let's keep it like other significant assets, I'm sure everyone has secrets and important assets, and we always know how to keep them safe.

That's why Bitcoin is fascinating. We have to choose the hard path in life, because the easy path is the way to hell. Putting all your trust and money in a centralized entity seems like a dumb thing to do, but in reality, this is the norm.Overthinking too much about small and insignificant details is a sign of insecurity(or maybe obsessing compulsive disorder). I kinda have OCD, when it comes to money. I'm too afraid to lose the money in my pocket, that's why I check them way too often.If I had 10 cold wallets, I would check them every day to make sure that the BTC aren't missing.",

But then you don't know what types of wallets to use.The only time I see using more than one wallet beneficial is if the other wallets serve different purposes. For example you could split your funds into \"long term storage\", \"day to day spending\", \"trading\". Each one needs a different type of wallet, for example the long term storage needs a solid cold storage while day to day spending can be done using a mobile wallet and for trading a hot wallet and the custodial wallet exchange accounts could be used. Obviously backup of the cold storage is the most important one that needs extra care.",
