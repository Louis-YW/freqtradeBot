Bitcoin has been doing just fine under Biden, going up 500% while he was president. Although there are tiny numbers of people (e.g. certain crypto businesses and brokers) that have been negatively effected by current US policy, the market overall for Bitcoin is essentially 100% free and open to any investor who wants to bet on Bitcoin here.2. It's clear that US laws won't significantly change under Trump in a way that will pump Bitcoin's price. Bitcoin is 100% legal in the US and anybody here who wants to can buy and sell it. Hence the only imaginable new laws would have to involve forcing people to buy Bitcoin, which is very unlikely under Trump or any other US president (forcing people to buy Trump's coin, on the other hand, might be something he will try to do ).3. Trump's policies involve a lot of new risk to the US economy. Trump has promised two gigantic changes to the US economy: massive import tariffs that will trigger a worldwide trade war, and the deportation of 20 million US residents, millions of whom work in key labor markets. Although it remains to be seen if Trump will actually implement these promises (the markets right now are betting he won't), this certainly adds risk that was not there under Biden.",

The idea was not to force anyone to invest in bitcoin, as far as I know, and I don't think those were ever part of the promise the newly elected president made during his time of campaign.The actual dictionary definition of \"legal tender\" is a law that requires that all citizens accept the currency as a form of payment whether they want to or not.Bitcoin is 100% legal in the USA to buy, hold and sell. There is no way for it to get \"legaler\". The only thing the US government could possibly do not to increase the price would be to force US citizens to buy it, either as individuals, or through their tax dollars when the government buys Bitcoin. That's what people are calling for \"legal tender\" and also the Bitcoin reserve: it's about forcing US citizens to buy Bitcoin to the price will go up, because asking the voluntarily has apparently hit its limit.QuoteThe only thing most people expect from his is a crypto-friendly policy and not to force American citizens to embrace what they might not; it's just a free will. If anyone wants to invest, then the door is open. A crypto-friendly policy will bring about more firms embracing it.Yep, that's the policy in the USA and has been for the last 15 years, and there's no sign that anybody is going to change it.Quote As in the line of making it a payment option, I believe as long as it's legal in the country, it's already enough for anyone to start using it for their business as an alternative payment option.

The US is different from El Salvador.I agree, but apparently a lot of people aren't satisfied with it just being voluntary (see people here on this very thread for examples). People seem to be pretty serious about forcing all US citizens to buy Bitcoin with their tax dollars, for instance. (If they actually do that--which I think is doubtful--that will truly be the end of Bitcoin as an entity independent of the US government).",

In my opinion the current US election climate is more nuanced and not quite an endorsement for stability. The market reactions this far tend to be indicative that the policy posture of Trump, with a possibility for laying trade tariffs and immigration reform, might further sustain inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions. For this, investors may take notice and change positions both in traditional assets and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In light of the key position taken by Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, these actions could actually increase its demand. Contrary to the assumption that a Trump win would hold no weight of great importance to Bitcoin.Historically, elections add a layer of volatility and may influence a shift in sentiment. That had been the case in the previous years, when both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin tended to be up after elections. A win by Trump could be a replay of the post-election rally of 2016, propelled by business-friendly policies. However, extended turmoil or uncertainty over his policies would keep Bitcoin more volatile. While Bitcoin has remained accessible, therefore, any economic policy change in the United States, whoever the president might be, is still likely to continue its influence on investor psychology within the given sector.",

I think it's better to find ways to adapt to survive than to complain about things we can't change.Unfortunately it's almost impossible if you want to prevent government to acquire and hold BitcoinYou must trade Bitcoin with people who're not related to government, trade via online make us never know who're the one we trade, however trading via face to face not necessary mean we're not trade with people who work in officials.So, it's not possible to adapt to survive, but if we trade our coins through DEX or No KYC P2P, it decrease the chance our coins will belong to them, since the government mostly use CEX specifically Coinbase.",
