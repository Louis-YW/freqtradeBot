P2P requires no intermediary.I wonder why Binance is the only exchange that most of us mostly and only referring too. Kucoin too is good. But there are other exchanges which I have listed before and probably there could be more. You can convert bitcoin and other crypto to naira and vice versa on other exchanges like Bybit, Huobi global and OKX. Trading volume for local trading between naira and cryptocurrencies on those exchanges are huge. Many Nigerians are still use exchanges like Paxful as well. For instant bank transfer and notification, Opay, Palmpay and Kuda have very low probability that they will disappoint. Opay and Palmpay has not disappointed me before. Kuda has disappointed me before, but error is rear now too on Kuda, it has been long that I experienced one.",

Since the time of Naira redesign, when banks in Nigerias were having several issues, these were the banks that mostly Nigerians were using to help fasten transactions. They don’t delay in processing and notifying the both parties. Till day, they still don’t disappoint and highly recommendable for p2p transactions. Even when other Naija banks are having network issue and you’re notified by your exchange about it, if you use any of this banks for the transactions, it’ll drop immediately but that depends if the sender is also using the same bank.",

This is where people usually have problems that do lead to appeals on the Binance or Kucoin platforms, but Opay, Palmpay, and Kuda banks have solved the problem due to how good their network is.",

As a matter of fact, this is what CEX p2p  platforms advise her members to do before releasing Crypto to their buyer. They advise everyone dealing ie sellers to confirm payment before they release assets so that they don't get scammed as they do not have control over p2p deals.  Be it same bank or otherwise, one needs to be very much sure before releasing Crypto because any Crypto that moves out of your own custody is no longer yours and if you make any mistake, you are on your own.",

It seems you are misunderstanding O.P when he said you don't need to check your bank app multiple times before releasing, because what he meant is that when you use Palmpay of Opay for transactions, the money arrives fast in micro seconds. Secondly, if you happened to have mistakenly released a coin without confirmation, you can equally report the trade to Binance and you will be asked to bring a statement of account, of which if you are able to prove that the money wasn't paid to you, Binance will freeze the person's account until he pays you back, because it once happen to me and I reported the trade, but just that it took 2months for me to get my fund back.",

Cex like binance and kucoin are in by all means trying to provide their customers with the best services they can offer and I would say they are doing a pretty good at that but am still weary about them as they are still centralized and won't feel ever relaxed to store my BTC or any other crypto there, I prefer just to sell or exchange my crypto in any of the CEX.",

      "body": "The Op has given a great suggestion which I think it can help p2p transaction faster and saver. No matter the delay in bank transaction, it is pointless or totally useless for one to rush to confirm payment reception without seen evidence. If some one paid into your account and the person notify you that he had paid and you are yet to Recieve alert or see it on your app, there is no point confirming the transaction just because you are earger to sell. Even though the Op has confirmed the fastness of opay and pampay should not make us use that as excuse to confirming transaction just too fast, there maybe unexpected technical glitches sometimes or they are upgrading or working on their network which may result to slow transaction process.If you engage in p2p and buyer message you that he had pay and that you should send the coin/token, don't trust the buyer convincing words as they may contain lies. Prevention they say, is better than cure. Doing the mistake then waiting for months before retrieving your crypto might have negative effect on your budget.As you engage in p2p, beware of fake alert, over-excitement can make one confirm transaction without noticing that the balance on their account does not accumulate with the new payment made. Some people will confirm transaction once they see message pop up on their screen without visiting their app for confirmation.",
