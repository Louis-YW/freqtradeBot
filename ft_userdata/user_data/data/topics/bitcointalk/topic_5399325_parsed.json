  "content": "Hi, so I think I have seen an opportunity to operate a sportsbook in a way that is slightly different and probably more user friendly than how the current ones are operating. I’ve been working in the online gambling industry for 10 years now and I know how a lot about betting markets and how the odds work so I’m not worried about that side of things.There seems to be a lot of scams out there and I’m looking for insight on how to be trustworthy. Not looking to scam anyone or steal, I just want to run a good, well respected sportsbook. I guess people will say to use kyc or licenses but I’d like to hold off on these. In my experience having licensing and kyc does not necessarily mean that you are a good honest sportsbook. Be interesting to hear thoughts on this as it may sound suspicious?So I’m looking for thoughts on how to gain trust and reputation, because I know I would have doubts depositing money into a brand new sportsbook that’s just appeared out of thin air.",

At the startup, try to take some methods to increase your user count (as well as attention to your sportsbook) via promos, advertisements, etc., and try to introduce your sportsbook as someone who actively interacts by answering questions from their users. Other than that, well, just give it time. It takes time for trust and reputation to grow, but if you're able to do it, you should be able to see a stable amount of users everyday. On the KYC thing, it isn't really a symbol of being a reputable sportsbook but rather most of the time it's just a requirement for wherever the sportsbook is hosting their, well, bookie. It's a requirement from the government of the country themselves or the license that the sportsbook use, so I wouldn't worry about that really.",

This is what I'm thinking too but I just consider that he might be working on gambling industry under the operation department and not on the marketing side since he will definitely not know how to operate casino if his line of work is not on that particular part of gambling industry. And also maybe he is just asking for suggestion in addition to his known knowledge since this is really the best thing to do gain more idea for his casino.License is the common things in gambling industry to become trusted here and the rest is purely marketing such as launching campaigns and promotion that will give incentives to all new comers that will try your the casino. The more generous means many new players will easily trust your company. You should give first before you can gain the trust of players. That's the typical formula of startup casino.",

I should maybe have been clearer, I have been making my living trading sports on the exchanges and betting with agents and 2 local bookies for the last 10 years. I have been planning this for around a month and don’t plan to launch anytime soon as the last thing I want is exactly like a Acroman08 said… be overwhelmed and fall behind on customer service, support and payouts as it would be hard to recover from this if it’s the first impression people have of your sportsbook.To expand a little more, my plans for the book is that I would have high limits and winners would be welcome. I’m totally comfortable with this side of the business, I just have little experience with starting up and gaining customers and a reputation.",

Get some money to fund a Signature campaign to get the name out there... and then honor the payments of the bets. Most \"scam\" casinos find ways not to honor the payments and that gives them a bad reputation. You have been in the gambling scene for years, so you know how to spot the \"cheaters\" and how to handicap them.",

I think those words are related to it because people will give trust to sportsbooks if they are doing it well, such as fast deposit and withdrawing. It is hassle free. Is it also obtained as a result of the majority of user feedback? It still perplexed me, but whatever it is, the simplest way to gain is to simply be honest, hassle-free, and the website should be user-friendly, and you should also listen to and act on what the users throw at you.",
