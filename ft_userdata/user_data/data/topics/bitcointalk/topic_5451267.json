Before now, the most appealing signature to me used to be the chipmixer signature.But from late 2022, there seems to be a new approach to signature design, and the guys behind the designs are excellent. What really changed?Are new design tools discovered or the designers upgraded. Although some of  these new signature designs seem to have issues of responsiveness, but in the end the issues are fixed and they look great.Below is some samples of nice signature designs as opposed to what we used to have before now.This is coming from the newly launched signature campaign and it is a product of a design contest.Coinslotty:https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FSEBNJTS.png&t=649&c=L8dqxjjtEriKLQWhirlwind recently launched by Hhampuz came with some cool design here:The trend seems to start from the period Livecasino.io arrived.

Maybe it will improve the brand image for a bit, but if the service itself is poor I don't see the point of spending their budget on making a new signature. I believe the broken sig on different browsers mentioned above is more important to solve for a signature designer. AFAIK this is related to BBcode problem so I'm not really sure how they can solve it. This is where they should be more creative and make sure that even if the signature is broken the relevant links and brand info is still visible. When I use my phone some signatures don't even show the service name and the links are being pushed by the background(?), hence it is impossible to click it.",

      "body": "For some companies, it's not necessary to redesign their signatures to keep the brand, while the others need to update their signature with newly added features and/or upcoming events. Honestly, the most important thing they want for the signature design is, how many people click the sig, no matter how beautiful it is and how complicated the logo. It would be useless if you have beautiful and outsanding signature design but no one bothered to click it or at least visit the website after see the sig. That's why I always try to figure out the way to make people curious on every design I create, rather than just make it beautiful. For these companies that still keep their current sig, they feel it's important to keep the brand and probably it gives them a stable traffic from anyone who clicks it. Redesigning the sig might make people hard to recognize them anymore and could change the traffic too. In the other side, some companies keep redesigning the sig so people can see these companies growing and improving time by time with the new features and events they add. There is always a strong reason behind of their decision to keep or change their sig.I agree that Livecasino sig is so eye-catching, and thanks to Trofo and cryptofrka, the Cro2 team really gave me a clear guidelines at that time, then I just followed and created the sig with some improvisations. icopress also has so many great ideas to create a fresh look of signature & avatar design. So it's not just only because of the designer, but also the manager can contribute to produce an outstanding design. However, my sig design skill got improved rapidly when Hhampuz and I created sigs in multiple versions for FortuneJack and Roobet. It challenged me to do some researches and experiments by using multiple methods, to find the efficient way on make an attractive sig under the 4,000 characters limit. For the ascii art itself, the main challenges are to create a football club icons, and I did it for the first time when designing a sig for Sportsbet, which I had to create logo of Watford, Southampton, Arsenal, and Sao Paulo in BBCode. You can see my other works of football club logo on BK8 #1, BK8 #2, and Duelbits.Regarding the browser compatibility, it's been always the main issue since the first time sig design launched. We signature designers are still figuring out the best way until now to make it compatible, but there are some dilemmas on it. If you want to make the sig design more attractive, then you have to remove some parts so the space could be used on its styling. In otherwise, if the project owners want to put the contents as many as possible, then it forces us to ignore the style aspect and focus more on putting the contents. Then when you want it mobile-friendly, you have to reduce both of the contents and the stylings, so everything could be fit on the mobile screen. The problem is, how to make the sig design looks good on both of mobile and desktop, but with many contents and info on it, yet still looks beautiful.",
