The site has faucet that you can earn like 4 sat after solving captcha every one hour, the value inversely varies probably on the price of bitcoin, it was around 21 sat per each captcha solved in 2019 when bitcoin price was below $10000, the last time I checked was 2021 when bitcoin price was over $50000.",

Instead, players can get some free coins for solving a captcha or a similar easy-to-do task. Of course, you won’t get a lot, but just enough to take your favourite game for a quick spin.  I manually checked popular crypto casinos to provide the Bitcointalk community with a good source of free faucets. I searched if they had a free faucet or not. The results of what I found can be seen in the table below.I have not checked any crypto casinos with negative feedback on Bitcointalk, so I am sure more could have been added to the list. If you know of a good gambling platform with a free faucet, feel free to share that info in this thread. I will include it in the table, but only if the casino doesn’t have a negative reputation.Let me know if this thread can be improved in some way.|Name|Faucet Amount|Requirement||BC.GAME|Up to 1 BTC|Claimable once a day.

That's how they built it. During 2017, this was still a thing, I thought that it was so low when I started because I correlates it with the USD price but as time passed I realized it was worth it if I have just keep it rather than betting it on their site. The only thing that I hate is that I can't be there every hour.",

      "body": "@qevokemusicYOSHIE already answered the best way possible by pointing you to my thread that shows multiple options that are available. But you should know that the faucet amounts are very small and you are not going to get far by claiming them. They are a good way to test a few games to see how they work though. If you are thinking about multi-accounting and abusing the faucets, don't waste your time. Casinos have ways to detect such activities and they will ban you.Quote from: Solosanz on September 04, 2022, 02:15:37 PM...I don't think there's a sportsbook who offer faucet that you can use to bet various sports since you need at least $1 worth of money in able to bet There was betja.com that had a faucet you could claim every hour. The claimed amount matched the minimum bet that you could make on sports. Unfortunately, Betja disappeared without a trace and no one knows what really happened. Looked like an exit scam, but I doubt they had many players. I also don't remember seeing scam accusations against the site from players who failed to withdraw their coins. Quote from: cabron on September 04, 2022, 05:16:55 PMSo far there's fortunejack.com and bitsler.com that has sports.  FortuneJack has a faucet and a sports offer, but the faucet is only for dice. So OP would have to win at least one round of dice to get some sats in his account that he could then gamble on sports or other games.",

There aren't many events to bet on, but I think it can be considered a sportsbook anyway. If you check their betting tab you will see all the disponible matches.
