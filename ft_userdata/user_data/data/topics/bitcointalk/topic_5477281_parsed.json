It is an upliftment to the world and we have to follow it but not just that way, not the negative ways that it presents to us but the positive ways. We have to look at the positive that comes from social media like the opportunities that it presents, the jobs opportunities that it creates, the entertainment and information. However, we just have to guide the younger people against the social media negatives, the pornography and all the corrupt tendencies that comes from it, underaged need to be protected.",

Be careful and patience out there happy Christmas in advance  this is a very interesting topic although I feel that you've actually not done the right justice to it.The social media has greatly eaten deep into the lives of most people and has almost taken a great portion of our daily experiences out of us. Most persons can't even bond well with there family members as they now spend most of their time on the internet and have few or no time left that they use to carry out most physical interaction.The fake lives and false narrative on the internet has destroyed most marriages and families because most of them are trying to copy what they've seen on the internet into their normal lives without understanding that they are mostly impracticable in the real world.",

People are making money from social, and promoting their business in social media.social has always been a very good medium in which people spread information to the world. I don't blame social media I blame people who use for the negative things ,people are the one controlling social media and using it the way they want, people use social  media for good and people also use it for bad.  Should we also blame people using it for good?",

In nutshell whatever you are doing with the Media innovation make sure it's impacting on you positively.That's true. Many people use social media to make money while others spend money for nothing, only to watch people making there money. Sometimes I have issues with my woman because she always burn my data on watching content on Facebook. There is always an opportunity everywhere we go but it only requires your in er eye of foresight to take advantage of it. Just like me whenever I stay long here and don't have something to say, since I dont make money from Facebook I learn from people and make a meaningful contribution here sometimes and also get information. So there is always an opportunity on social media but we really need to discover how to use them wisely.",

You have the choice to make in using social media right or wrong, but some use it negatively because they feel that is the best way to use it to make money from people and, it has send many people to prison because they use it wrongly in the society. I love the way bitcoiners are using it to make cool money from BTC investment or signature campaign and it will make someone to grow faster in the area of finance.QuoteShould we also blame people using it for good? You don't need to blame people that are using social media in the right way to finance their home or business which is the best thing the government want from their citizens and it can make a country to develop more in the future.",

And those youths that doing religion things and against social media will not benefits from most of these things we are doing. They can't do it and benefit from them. I know many people wey graduate with me at the same time, and I know say they can't do am. So if children are doing social media things, I will be very happy to  teach children social media because it will help in their future. There are some parents who have laptop in their houses, but refusing their children to use it. And that is very bad. Those who are active and using social media very well can use forum too though, many can't do it because of the writing and fear. Social Media dey help oh.",
