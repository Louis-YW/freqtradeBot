I'm a bit confused here.  How exactly would Binance getting hacked have anything to do with CZ stepping down as CEO? Those seem like completely separate issues to me.  Maybe there's some logic I'm missing connecting those dots and  i know exchanges can definitely get targeted by hackers, but unless CZ leaving made their systems more vulnerable for some reason, I dont really see the correlation.",

Many people see Changpeng Zhao a superhero of the crypto space. They think that because he manages the biggest exchange in the world he is clean. I have heard people say that Binance is too big to fall. However, they fail to understand that all centralized platforms are the same. There is no difference between FTX and Binance. If a proper investigation or audit is carried out everyone will see the dishonest practices that go on behind the scenes of these firms. I suspected that something was wrong with Binance when some top officials began to resign. In less than ten months about eight top officials have resigned and most of them cited CZ's handling of the DOJ's Investigation as the reason for their resignation. I just hope that his stepping down will save the company from further investigation. This event is also a reminder that \"not your keys, not your coin\".",

That of course doesn't mean that people should store their crypto on exchanges, but chances of loosing your money are not the same on all exchanges.CZ just released statement via his twitter profile and named the new Binance CEO Richard Teng.Quote from: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1727063503125766367Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for myself.Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run. I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has.I’m pleased to announce that @_RichardTeng, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO of Binance today.Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth.Prior to joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore.With Richard and the entire team, I’m confident that the best days for @Binance and the crypto industry lay ahead.As a shareholder and former CEO with historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency resolutions.What’s next for me?I will take a break first. I have not had a single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years.After that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at DeFi.I can’t see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs, privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do.On that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S. agencies they:- do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds, and- do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation.Funds are SAFU!edit: Binance leaves US market! I thought that the whole point of this deal was to continue business in US, not to leave it completely.  Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/11/21/binance-to-make-complete-exit-from-us-pay-billions-to-fincen-ofac-on-top-of-doj-settlement/Crypto exchange Binance will leave the U.S., pay billions in fines and appoint a monitor for five years to settle charges with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the U.S. Treasury Department's money laundering and sanctions watchdogs, according to press releases shared Tuesday.The exchange will pay $3.4 billion to FinCEN and $968 million to OFAC as part of these settlements, which saw both agencies accuse Binance of violating the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions programs. Binance had already said it will pay $4.3 billion in fines and forfeitures to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle charges it violated sanctions law and failed to maintain a proper know-your-customer program. Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, the exchange's founder and CEO, is resigning from his role as part of that settlement.In addition, Binance will make a \"complete exit\" from the U.S. as part of its settlement with FinCENand appoint a monitor for five years who will oversee the exchange's sanctions compliance program. The U.S. Treasury Department will have access to Binance's record and systems during that time.",

He pleaded guilty as a result of knowing that that's the only option that he had left, since she has been making some sort of noise, and pleading no guilty because he believes the US doesn't have any strong evidence against him. When he realises there is no other way of escaping and keeping the business running, he needs to play smart and accept the only option left. off because no one said CZ was a saint from the beginning. We all know those who are in charge of crypto exchange, especially those big names, are not clean, but only those who have been caught are the ones who we call names, and they really need to get their hands dirty in some sort of market manipulation in order for them to double their profit. How else do you think they are standing out among the highest holders and their crypto net worth, which is always undisclosed? The crypto market is already dropping a little, and I believe this news has some hands in it, as there are holders who react to every bit of news like this as they panic sell with the fear of not knowing what will come next in the crypto market.",

And the condition that's probably part of the deal given to CZ just to save Binance from the stink that it's given by the US government shall come to an end with this decision. Aside from the resignation, the settlement that they have to pay. Well, it's a win for the US government for having that much fine and Binance, CZ and everyone who's part of it just agreed to pay for it so they can continue going on that market that they have established their presence already.
