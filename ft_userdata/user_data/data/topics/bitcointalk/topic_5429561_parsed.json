This allows for a truly decentralized and player-driven economy within the game.Valireum also offers the option for players to host their own matches and earn cryptocurrency rewards for doing so. This allows players to participate in the network as node operators and be part of the game.For players who prefer a more casual experience, Valireum is also free to play. While certain in-game items and skins can be purchased with fiat or cryptocurrency, the core gameplay and features of the game are available to all players at no cost.Valireum also offers a wide range of customization options, allowing players to fully personalize their characters and weapons to fit their playstyle.
