  "content": "The billionaire Ray Dalio who is successful investor in the Uber, has recently been interviewed on a podcast and has mostly spoken negative about the bitcoin and it's investment. The guy has mind set where he advices to keep blockchain and crypto currencies as different roads because one of them is technology while the others are just medium to invest your money. Basically what he suggest is: crypto currencies as an asset can be replaced by any other means of asset, for example a newer form of asset and thus there is no guarantee for it's long lasting existence. According to him it would be better if all the crypto investors find another form of investment for secure future.  One of the weirdest point he was making is: Crypto do not replicate anything and thus they are \"ineffective store of wealth\"This is not at all up to the point analysis and anyone would disagree about what this guy has said or trying to convince others. I have literally laughed about his analysis, because he is trying to segregate investment based on a technological advancement VS vehicles that run on it. I mean it is same thing as stating that you should not be investing into Dubai but you can invest in Oil which is getting dug out of their soil(!)Ray DalioQuoteDuring a recent appearance on William Green's \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast, hedge fund legend Ray Dalio expressed his thoughts on the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin.The uber-succesful investor stated that he believes there is a distinction between blockchain technology and digital currencies. While the former is an excellent technology, the latter is not a good bet for investors, according to the billionaire.  Dalio commented that digital currencies do not replicate anything, which makes them an ineffective store of wealth.  He also pointed out that Bitcoin's total value is a fraction of Microsoft's stock. Hence, in Dalio's view, it is a preoccupation by people that is disproportionate to its true reality.Dalio is convinced that in time, there will be better digital currencies, such as those that provide the equivalent of inflation and buying power. He noted that most currencies are debt instruments that offer poor returns relative to inflation, but a good digital currency is yet to be created.The legendary investor acknowledged the technology behind cryptocurrencies, he believes that the hype surrounding them is disproportionate to their true value. As an experienced investor, he emphasizes the importance of looking for effective stores of wealth and being cautious when investing in digital currencies. The hedge fund manager also spoke about the current economic environment, saying that creating debt and money is becoming increasingly problematic.He commented that people will need to look for alternative stores of wealth, and he believes that understanding the five key forces of the economy, including money and credit, can help investors navigate difficult situations.Billionaire Ray Dalio Destroys Crypto Hype",

While he acknowledged the uncertain fate or future of Bitcoin, he also admitted that having a certain percentage of your portfolio allocated to Bitcoin is also a reasonable thing. I don't think the man is particularly biased for or against it. And I also largely agree when he distinguishes the technology from a certain crypto project; blockchain from DoggyStyle Coin, for example. We cannot just justify our investment in a certain shitcoin by citing the underlying technology that it uses.",

Every financial asset can be replaced.Bitcoin isn't supposed to bring security to it's investors, because BTC was never secure in terms of price stability. BTC is always will be risky and volatile as a financial asset. The same thing applies to almost all altcoins.",

Nobody will say bitcoin will stay forever but is a long term projects that will Carry's many generation along.In as much he's not interested that's a personal reasons to him but it should influence the public with question of if bitcoin will be a lasting projects, after all even humans can not tell when your life sperm will expired from the earth. Bitcoin is here to stay for longer period of time than expected weather any country, individuals, billionaires or not bitcoin will fulfil its time.",

Altcoins have no usage and what was said here is correct about them. Bitcoin on the other hand is unique and provides a real world utility hence the statements make no sense about it.Lets seeQuoteBasically what he suggest is: crypto currencies as an asset can be replaced by any other means of asset, for example a newer form of asset and thus there is no guarantee for it's long lasting existence. 100% correct.We have seen this over the years. One altcoin is replaced by another. If you look at the coinmarketcap stapshots you can clearly see this. Although I'd argue that altcoins are not assets, they are gambling tools.QuoteAccording to him it would be better if all the crypto investors find another form of investment for secure future.  100% correct.Altcoin investors are fooling themselves and shouldn't \"invest\" in any of the altcoins. Only bitcoin is a viable investment for the reasons I said at the start.QuoteOne of the weirdest point he was making is: Crypto do not replicate anything and thus they are \"ineffective store of wealth\"100% correct.Altcoins are the stupidest store of wealth since they get dumped and eventually disappear which is because they are useless and will eventually be replaced by another useless altcoin.QuoteHe also pointed out that Bitcoin's total value is a fraction of Microsoft's stock. Hence, in Dalio's view, it is a preoccupation by people that is disproportionate to its true reality.This is bullshit.For starters Microsoft has been around since 1975 (48 years) whereas bitcoin has been around since 2009.Besides Microsoft is not attacked by literary everyone spreading FUD about it, restricting access, shutting down bank accounts, banning its usage, etc.QuoteDalio is convinced that in time, there will be better digital currencies, such as those that provide the equivalent of inflation and buying power.That is not possible to do globally since the inflation is not a global matter, it is local. It is also not possible to achieve with decentralization since inflation is again centralized.QuoteHe noted that most currencies are debt instruments that offer poor returns relative to inflation, but a good digital currency is yet to be created.Good thing bitcoin is technically money not currency.QuoteThe legendary investor acknowledged the technology behind cryptocurrencies, he believes that the hype surrounding them is disproportionate to their true value.100% correct.The hype surrounding altcoins is all fake and the price they have is not a representation of their value since majority of them are worthless.QuoteHe commented that people will need to look for alternative stores of wealth, and he believes that understanding the five key forces of the economy, including money and credit, can help investors navigate difficult situations.100% correct but I should add that in the current economical situation people should find a store of value that is not directly affected by the dumping economy, credit bubble, inflation, ... that makes bitcoin the only choice.",

And if we do that, he is correct that new assets can appear, attention to some other investment opportunities can replace attention to Bitcoin. Where I disagree is in the part that Bitcoin is just an asset while blockchain is technology. Bitcoin is a revolutionary type of money, a currency that isn't issued by any authority, that can't be faked, the price of which cannot be regulated, and where there is no limit of who can participate in issuing new coins as long as a person has financial means to purchase equipment with which mining would make sense nowadays.Apart from all that, it's unfair to disregard how successful Bitcoin has been as a long-term investment option, how much it has grown and from what sort of lows it managed to recover over and over again.",
