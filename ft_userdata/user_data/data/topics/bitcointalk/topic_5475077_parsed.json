It is just of recent.As for me, I can never use anything like Heco chain.I wonder where the money to pay back for deposits is coming from. I'd sure as hell get my funds away from these platforms. As of HECO, it's a blockchain based on Binance Smart Chain's principles, just for the Huobi (now HTX) exchange tokens. It was very popular in 2021's bull run and remains popular with Chinese users, as does the exchange. All these projects were running without major hacks before Justin Sun purchased HTX and Poloniex. Begs the question if it's oversight or malice at this point.",

Yeah, it's likely that the hack could be attributed to incompetence instead of malice, but... So long as I don't see the hacker returning the funds I don't think they've really got his identity confirmed. It was also reported that Justin sun used an ethereum block explorer to send messages to the addresses of attackers in multiple language. Source: https://en.coin-turk.com/justin-suns-statement-on-poloniex-hack-funds-safe-and-hackers-identity-confirmed/Sending a message in multiple languages seems contradictory to knowing someones real identity. Just one of the many contradictions here.",

Let's see if other open messages will be sent as well.Justin Sun is making the headlines for the wrong reasons. This is the third time his crypto exchange is getting hacked in recent months and it doesn't look good. He's yet to recover the stolen funds for Poloniex hack, and now this? I wonder how he's going to sort himself out of this mess.If the hacker was under his trail and he's about catching him, he wouldn't come out and publicly say this. Which makes me want to conclude that this could be a mind game to scare the hacker into returning the stolen funds.",

By now and given how many times Justin Sun has been hacked, TRON is probably the only coin he's left holding in his own business' wallets. So given his large stake in TRON it would make sense that they're keeping it as the only active coin. This gives an incentive for people to buy it in the exchange in order to withdraw with TRON. Maybe even deposit. But it's an early sign of collapse so no wonder people are trying desperately to get their money out.",

OMG I hope you're wrong, but what you say is very frightening for all Huobi/HTX and Poloniex customers but also for the whole crypto community because if Justin Sun is ruined, the crypto ecosystem could collapse again like what happened with FTX, given Justin Sun's involvement in the area. He was very close to CZ and Binance AFAIK, but since his coin TRX is used by many exchanges, casinos and other crypto platforms it could hit them too sadly.",

I am also flabbergasted with how this guy's stole funds that cannot be spend. Stolen funds will remain vulnerable to the public without been unable to spend them, why steal it in the first place. Normally, when a DeFi protocol is launched, they do actually pay a hefty fee to external auditing firms to look through their smart contracts and provide advice on resolving potential security issues. However, these audits are expensive. Checking even a single contract can cost up to 10k if it's a large one. Bridges have hundreds of contracts. But in Huobi Bridge case, the compromise doesn't seem to be a very dedicated one in terms of smart contract security. Somebody probably just got backroom access and abused it to drain the funds. It's not unlikely that the security at the organization managing these addresses slipped and they got hacked in a more traditional way. For example malware being installed through social engineering or a rogue employee. As of the hacker being unable to move the funds, where did that come from? So far I've seen the huobi bridge compromiser moving a lot of funds.",

I put forward the thesis that it might be a way to launder money, and now that I see that hackers are \"rewarded\" with $10 million to return what they stole, there is definitely something wrong with that story.Does Justin have any other services that haven't been hacked yet?",
