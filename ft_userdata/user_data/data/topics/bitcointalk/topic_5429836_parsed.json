  "content": "Thought I might just share this to keep any Bybit users on high alert.Today I tried to withdraw some profits I had made from Bybit but to my dismay, a notification came up asking me to face verification. Please note that my account is Level 2 verified.This is so weird given that I had entered the 2FA codes, both for the authenticator and the one sent to my email. I made a quick chat why their live chat support, and they claimed that the \"security check\" could have been triggered by an unusual log in activity in my account, of which I have been logging in using the same device and browser for a very long time. I asked them if the password, 2FA codes, IP address logs and Device ID information wasn't enough to prove that I was the actual owner of the account, and they had no answer. All they kept referring to were the terms of service as though they were programmed like a robot.Now imagine if one is in an emergency, and they needed the money ASAP and the device they are using has no camera for facial recognition, I wonder what someone would do  This is so irrational and stupid",

We are heading to this verification requirements so traders and crypto users should prepare for what's to come. Use centralized exchanges that you think are worth giving your personal details as well as your facial identity.Limit your exposure to these exchanges as much as possible. We have no choice with their requirements but to comply if we have money on their vaults.We know a long time ago, that transactions involving stable coins would really ask for kyc verification, so not a surprise if they are asking for your kyc.",

Are they going to move coins into and off the exchange every day or every hour they want to trade?  For example, I keep the biggest percentage of my coins off the exchanges but when I need to trade, most especially derivatives, I end up using the much loathed centralized exchanges and this is how i ended up with the above situation.",

The same pop-up appeared as in the OP. I realized that am not the only one experiencing the same problem. It seems to be a way of forcing someone to keep their money in their exchange, which I am not ready to do, and that will be the last time I use Bybit.If you are a reader of this thread and are planning to buy coins and withdraw all of them to an offsite address. Bybit will frustrate you and inconvenience you with their stupid facial verification on your already verified account.

I always log into Bybit using the same device, same browser, same OS, same Internet service provider, same location (Home), trade with the same pattern etcMore to that, what is the point of my password, email verification code and 2 factor verification code from my Authy account then if I have to do an unnecessary facial verification in order to withdraw?Indeed, I have decided to use alternatives now.",

That's really bad. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the programmers messed up and make the trigger for extra verification become stricter or something similar and then was too ashamed to admit it. Be careful if you're looking for another CEX. So many of them require personal data and keep requesting you resubmit every few months or so. Some even ask you to submit a passport and claim your national ID is expired even if the government stated it is valid forever. I believe collecting user data is probably necessary for them so they can 'share' it and earn extra income. It's unfortunate that there is still no great platform for altcoin trading that doesn't rely on a centralized party (by great, I mean with great liquidity, fast order, etc).",
