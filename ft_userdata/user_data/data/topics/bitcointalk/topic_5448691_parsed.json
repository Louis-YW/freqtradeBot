Is it trading, aidrops, writing articles, marketing, etc ?I personally use crypto as additional source of income by just holding long term and take profit during bull run like this. I believe most of the response you will get here mostly a testimony about earning through signature campaign because that’s what popular source of additional income here in the forum because it guarantees profit on weekly basis unlike trading that there’s a lot of risk involved.Anything that is services in exchange for crypto is the best source of income because it doesn’t involve risk and just pure man power required.",

There are large fines for this, and it is impossible to stress-test projects without users.

Earlier before now, I managed a cyber cafe that was giving me huge earnings. I am proudly the owner of one, but I barely visit the place because I spend most of my time on my crypto jobs because they give me the highest pay. Over to your question, the answer is yes based on your skills and the kind of crypto job you have at hand. And no, if you don't know anything about crypto,",

Is it trading, aidrops, writing articles, marketing, etc ?Choosing crypto only as full time is not good advice to me, multiple sources of income is always better any time any day. Multiple sources from one field is good but not still the best (e.g engaging in trading, investing or hunting airdrops are all under cryptocurrency). Multiple sources from different fields is best (that is being engaged in other things that bring money like Real Estate etc just as you are involved in crypto). If you are just into cryptocurrencies and depend on it, be ready to face rough times when they come.",

Ideally, I would love to be a professional trader, capable to living off it, but realistically it takes much time and some natural skills to overcome the feelings which lead to people to close losing positions. In my eyes, one should be very careful when comes to considering crypto currency as main source of income and analyze if one's situation is stable enough in the long term,  so we do not have to face times without work.",

      "body": "My answer to your topic head is No, you cannot earn from cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency and not an employer and literally cannot pay you. If you offer whatever services you’ve got to offer and get paid in cryptocurrency, you’re earning from your services rendered and getting paid in and not from cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency(bitcoin in my opinion)is seemingly the most preferred option of paying for goods and services rendered cause of the ease of transaction and of course the convenience of having to do without a third party in the entire process. So if you’re asking if you can earn in cryptocurrencies for your services, then yes. You could offer whatever service you could do online and you could get someone that’s willing to pay for your services. And what better and faster way to get paid from someone a million miles away than to get paid in bitcoin. You won’t have to wait for any third party to “verify” your funds before releasing them to you. Perhaps you had meant trading?",

Is it trading, aidrops, writing articles, marketing, etc ?OP as you can see this board is all about bitcoin and Crypto currency activities. So therefore you should know mostly 99% of members here earn bitcoin and other Crypto currencies in one way or the other.Down to your question,  I must say blockchain is an institution on its own and therefore bitcoin and Crypto made available full time job cutting across all divide. This gives has created lots of job opportunities for people some see it as a full time job and some as a part time job to earn extra source of income. However, there are lots of well paid jobs on Crypto and they varries in dimensions.Let me start by giving you hints as I make a brief description of the following as you have mentioned;Trading: this involves one taking advantage of the market situation to making profit when they buy and sell  a token or coin ie when a particular coin price is down one buys some of it and when it is up one sells it. This can be done every day to make profit.Airdrops:  New projects do give out their tokens to increase the numbers of holders and to create awareness of their project through airdrops. With this, the publicity and holders tend to increase and making the project for which the airdrop is given being popular and we'll known.Bounties: This is a strategic pattern or way of making a project popular. It is a job done by bounty hunters to promoting a project. This involves, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Article writing and lots more  marketing processes involved. This aspect of marketing is managed by a campaign manager here and tokens allocated for each section of the campaign to be paid depending on agreement between the two teams involved in promoting the project. There are other jobs like; community moderating, graphics designing, web Developing etc all these jobs  are full time and part time job one can get engaged in to make or earn more Crypto currencies from.OP this is just  the minimum explanatory so you could understand how it works. Atleast now you know the Jobs involved here and about Crypto jobs and payment.",

Is it trading, aidrops, writing articles, marketing, etc ?Well, over the years i have read people's claims that all they do for a living is crypto trading, i find it difficult to wrap my head around it because i know how risky it is to depend 100% on crypto trading, but my conclusion on the matter is that these people didn't just start trading crypto to make money, they were already prolly rich or had enough money from another source, and rather than just sit idle and spend money, they found a hobby (or a job) in crypto trading. I don't think it is possible for someone who does not have enough financial strength to depend on only crypto trading.Having said that, i can only speak for myself, every earning from anything crypto is an additional source of income, i'd be standing on a very thin rope if i made a living solely on crypto, life is so demanding in the country where i live and the cost of living is quite high, thus a single source of income is somewhat unfeasible.",
