There are currently literally more than 10,000 useless altcoins, that's why people call them shitcoins. In my opinion, none of those have anything to offer to the community apart from Monero, which adds some attributes that Bitcoin lacks and make it even more private.Apart from these 2, I don't think any of the other coins are beneficial. They just exist because some people earn money from inventing them.",

There can be another coin that may be invented that will not make use of blockchain but decentralized and deflationary which will also be called a digital currency. But such a coin will have most characteristics that bitcoin is having and people may still call it an altcoin.

They would surely get some attention but eventually die in the long run. It is not possible to sustain the value and rank as Bitcoin has done since its inception. I doubt there will be another coin like Bitcoin in the future and it can grow as Bitcoin has grown in a quindecade.Â  The only thing that is causing issues now is the NFTs that are using its blockchain. If the developers do not do anything then we would need to wait until they cease to exist in the future. Then only we would again witness the transaction fees and network congestion going down. At the moment it is still not looking good and I felt in the past that it might go down but I think now it won't.",

But to answer your question, it depends on two things. If you are referring to a coin or currency that has another technology, I mean a coin created with a new technology and not driven to blockchain, then I don't think there will be something like that that will emerge. Maybe there is a possibility that as the technology gets more advanced, there is a possibility of new technology emerging. But if you are referring to a coin that will have the same equivalent in terms of price, like bitcoin, well, we will hope for that because more coins like bitcoin, which have a lot of potential and opportunity, mean a profit for us, again another possibility that we hope will happen.",

Bitcoin dominance is nothing to compete with.We can't predict the future, friend. Bitcoin has proven itself as a top cryptocurrency to invest in, but it's not without flaws. Over time, important features like privacy and decentralization have been gradually reduced. We can't guarantee that Bitcoin will always be the best, but it currently holds a strong position, even though many altcoins haven't surpassed its features. The idea is investing in the most profitable and that which provides us with more features and for now, none. We'll have to wait and see if a new coin emerges with more to offer.",

But in my opinion such coins will not be another discovery.What is yours opinions?Not sure I understand what you mean. Are wondering that they will create other currencies with limited supply? The advantage of Bitcoin is that there is only a fixed number of coins to be mined, and no person can just decide overnight decide to print a large number of coins. There are already plenty of other alt coins that have the same characteristics. Or do you mean also a project that is going to be as widely accept and successful as Bitcoin? For that I don't think it's realistic at the moment, because bitcoin is just too dominate. The profit all the early investors made with bitcoin is not comparable to other crypto currencies, and which is why all these investors wouldn't switch quickly into another project that wants to overtake bitcoin.",
