  "content": "In order to satisfy their needs and wants people need goods and services. They need food, clothing, energy, furniture, a roof over their heads, clean streets, medical services, etc. However, when they join a number-based payment system, such as banking, they give up goods and services for banknotes or deposits - something that cannot satisfy needs and wants. If you traded your house for banknotes or a deposit you gave up a good that can satisfy a lot of basic needs, and in return, you got just numbers on paper or on the screen. Something like this: \"234,899.95 USD\".For that reason, if a payment system is legit it has to be able to protect people by ensuring they get goods and services back. Banking payment systems do have such a protection. The proposed alternatives to those systems, known as crypto payment systems such as Bitcoin, do not have it.If a US bank issued a loan or if the Federal Reserve subscribed to a government bond that gave rise to dollars, that is numbers. For example. Granting a loan to a person means that a bank created numbers out of thin air and put them in a deposit account of that person. The person then goes to the market and trades the numbers for goods or services. Let's say they trade them for a house. At first sight, this looks crazy. How a person who had nothing yesterday can have a house today just based on numbers issued by a bank? Why would anyone give up a house for a number? But it is not crazy because that number must be returned to the bank. Moreover, returning it is so important that in the case of default, the bank will foreclose the house.Essentially, what that means is that the banking system forces loan beneficiaries to work for those that hold dollars, or to sell them goods and services. Only in this way can they get the dollars and return them to the banks. In other words, via the system of pledged collaterals, loan contracts, credit assessments, etc. the banks protect dollar holders and ensure they get goods and services back. For instance, if loan beneficiaries default on their loans and fail to return dollars to the banks, their property will be foreclosed and sold at auctions. Who will have access to those auctions? Well, the dollar holders. Banks issued dollars via loans and must accept them to liquidate unpaid loans. So if dollar holders don't get goods and services from loan beneficiaries on the market, they will get their foreclosed property at auctions. Of course, government bonds don't ensure getting back goods and services but they give the ability to fulfill a tax obligation. The government must accept dollars as a tax payment to be able to pay off their bonds subscribed to by the Federal Reserve.But let's now go to Bitcoin. When someone says that bitcoins are just numbers on the screen, the automatic response by the Bitcoin proponents is this: \"So are the dollars\" or \"so is fiat money\". They are basically saying that if you trade goods and services for the numbers issued by the Bitcoin system this is like trading them for the numbers issued by the banking systems. But this is of course not true. Unlike the banking systems, the Bitcoin system doesn't protect holders of its numbers.The so-called Bitcoin miners who initially receive numbers from the system and then trade them for goods and services are not like loan beneficiaries in the banking systems. They are not forced by the system to return numbers to the system. So they are not forced to work for Bitcoin holders or sell them goods and services. Even if they received enormous amounts of tangible property in exchange for the numbers, they have zero obligation to return anything to anyone. The whole Bitcoin system is just a giant decentralized database showing the past and current number holders. There is literally no one and nothing in the system to protect these holders by ensuring they get goods and services back.If you gave your house for Bitcoin, the only thing that can save you is someone's goodwill to enter the system and give you some good or service. But if people get bored of bitcoins and don't want to invest in them anymore, you are left with nothing. You gave up a house, and in return, you can't even get a haircut. And no decentralized system can help you.Of course, people mostly don't trade goods and services for bitcoins. They trade numbers issued by the banks - dollars, euros, pounds, etc. Bizarrely, they give up numbers that are good for them due to the said protection, to get numbers that are bad for them because they lack such protection. And they do that because someone or something convinced them that such bizarre trades will become massive in the future and earn them a lot of bank-issued numbers. Or they believe that because someone in the past achieved such earnings, so will they.",

That's why the public must be educated. I respect your opinion, I think everyone has the right to their opinion, right or wrong what they say, but they have the right to their opinion. Now it seems to me that you are forgetting one thing:You can't have bitcoin out of nowhere, for example I ask you: do you have bitcoin? If you don't have bitcoin, you won't sit down and say: \"Bitcoin appears now\" and bitcoin appears. That's not how things work. For you to have 1 bitcoin you only have a few options:1 - buy mining equipment: you will have to take your dollars and go buy the mining equipment and mine, this will involve paying for electricity so that the mining equipment works or mines the bitcoin2 - work on some bitcoin exchange or crypto casino or signature campaign and get paid by bitcoin.3 - deposit your dollars in the bank and buy bitcoinsee in these first 2 options you are providing a service and are being paid for that service, because bitcoin has value. If you deposited $1000 into your bank account and bought bitcoin, that bitcoin is your property that you keep in your wallet. When you sell depending on the price, you can get your $1000 back. For example, I buy my refills using bitcoin as a payment method.you need to separate hate from knowledge. You can hate bitcoin, and that's your right, but you need to be impartial when talking about bitcoin and dollars",

We may not be experts in finance or economics, but I think we know enough about bitcoin and what we're doing without anyone teaching us. Good or bad Bitcoin, the best way is for the whole world to judge it. Just because you say it's bad doesn't mean it will be bad, just because I say it's good doesn't mean it will be good, looking at how the world treats it is the most accurate answer.If I remember correctly, you are the only person left on the forum who still has a negative opinion on bitcoin. I don't know the reason behind it but if you really don't like bitcoin, you just ignore it and never pay attention to it. Just continue your love for USD, why do you like to attack others, what benefit does it bring to you?",

If you study how the world economy is played by governments or certain groups then you will come to the conclusion that authority and control is a bad system. Dollars, Euros, Pounds and other currencies have control and they are distributed through systematic agreements with various pretexts. So just focus on the goals and targets because what we need is not a system like before but a process that can work, because we seek profit from any process as a step towards financial freedom.",

Bitcoin isn't widely accepted as a direct form of payment, but it has high liquidity and can be exchanged for fiat fairly simply. Also, Bitcoin is often used as an investment rather than as a payment method, so it's okay that Bitcoin isn't as widespread as the USD.Speaking of the USD, you can't use it directly as payment in most countries in the world; you'd need to exchange it for local fiat. That makes it not that different from Bitcoin because you need to exchange Bitcoin as well.Money doesn't require banks or authorities to do anything, as long as people can agree on its value and trust in its value.",

In the midst of the financial crisis of 2008, the creator of Bitcoin left a message in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis Block, quoting the headline of The Times: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" His idea was to create a fairer and better monetary system, a decentralized deflationary money in digital form that no one could control or print indefinitely.During the financial crisis of 2008, central banks released massive amounts of newly printed money to save the banks. The cost of that bailout was paid by ordinary people like you and me because our money and savings lost value. The value decreased because the money created out of nothing and given to the banks devalued the money we earned through work. This injection of money into circulation causes inflation, which we can describe as a decrease in purchasing power. It is clear to everyone and felt by everyone that 100 euros today can buy much less than what the same 100 euros could buy a year ago. This is inflation, or a hidden tax that we all pay together. But we pay it with money we have to earn, while governments and banks pay it with money they create as needed and in whatever amounts they require, just like the creators of altcoins.

So if I may ask who told you that by investing in Bitcoin people can't have value for it in terms of goods and services offered? Because if that's the perception you have been having, then it's a wrong perception, because ever since Bitcoin was created as a digital currency, it's investors has always been able to equate it's price to the current value of goods and services in the market, just like in the case of Lazio who bought 2 pizzas with 10,000 Bitcoins 14yrs ago. Hence, the value of Bitcoin that can be translated into goods or services is a factor dependent on time. QuoteFor example. Granting a loan to a person means that a bank creates numbers out of thin air and puts them on a deposit account of that person. The person then goes to the market and trades those numbers for goods or services. Let's say they trade them for a house. At first sight, this looks crazy. How a person who had nothing yesterday can have a house today just based on numbers issued by a bank? Why would anyone give up a house for a number? With this statement, it's evident that you lack knowledge about how the principle of money works, because if you had an atom of clue you must have known that money either physical (i.e Cash) or digital (i.e electronic numbers) all have the same value, and can be used to acquire whatever item dime fit buy by the investor.",
