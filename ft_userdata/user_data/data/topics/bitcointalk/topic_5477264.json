Since a lot of people are dumb and will stick with the headline, let's hope it unleashes a bit of fomo, albeit on a false basis.",

Qatar is known for affluence and whatever they consider looking at takes a differernt turn. The Arab world has so much finance to throw around whatever they focus on, they do not want to be relegated to the background in any space they find themselves and if they have considered crypto as a worthy financial instrument then we can only say \"the bullrun is yet to be upon us\" as they will secure laods of asset with their reserves.The way they spend money in acquiring players in the football space speaks volume about how they pursue whatever they believe in",

Bitcoin isn't going to reach $100k anytime soon because so many people will sell Bitcoin at $67k to $75k and that would be a tough point to break anytime soon. I know that in the full intensity of this bull run $100k will surely be crossed but not right now. I believe that those writers are showing wrong information because they want public's attention and nothing else.",

Since for sure they will look for another options and might throw only a small percentage for bitcoin. But eventhough with that still this is good news to hear since there are government officials in the world still considering to invest with bitcoin and that will be a good development to happen especially if other country leaders would see what Qatar officials do.",

Yes, huge profits are possible, but so are severe downturns. Can QSWF handle this rollercoaster? Their huge investment raises a issue: will it stabilize Bitcoin's value or worsen market fluctuations?The trend of institutional investors eyeing digital assets indicates a wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Acceptance comes with unknowns. How will regulators react? How will this affect traditional finance? We celebrate the potential of digital assets becoming popular, but we also face promise and uncertainty.",

Although I generally agree with what you say, I think that at the moment we are in the 2023 ATH, 4 months away from the halving and in an upward trend, it is not bad for something like this to give a little push. In bear market the opposite happens, any FUD bullshit, even if it is false, can push the price down.",

There was a joke when I was young- It is true that Ivan Ivanovici won car at the lottery?- Yes, it's partially true, but it wasn't Ivan Ivanovici but Piotr Petrovici, and it wasn't a car but a bicycle, and he didn't win, it it was stolen from it! But the rest is true!Same here, first the whole fund is $475 billion in total, second they plan to diversify it in a ton of areas, but most are technology investment, aka things that produce other tech things, and the cherry on top of that is that there is actual no plan whatsoever in buying Bitcoins.As for the visits it's pretty simply and again nothin to do with Bitcoin, it's about gas!!!, Salvador has just increased it's LNG import capacity with the new FSRU ship, so guess where it plans to buying the extra gas from?",
