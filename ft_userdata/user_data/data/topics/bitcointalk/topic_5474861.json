  "content": "Ten years ago, so-called 'cryptocurrencies' appeared on the market. First Bitcoin, then real inflation followed, which today counts over 20,000 of them. But what are cryptocurrencies actually? If we ask their authors, they will say: \"digital money\". Each of the authors will present their crypto project as modern money in the form of digital coins or tokens that are transferred quickly and stored securely using innovative blockchain technology. Let's mention right away that this technology is nothing special, but a method of storing data in peer-to-peer controlled databases. For example, one buys that digital token and then instead of some centrally organized system, the data about that purchase is managed by a network of computers.So, according to the authors' stories, as well as the stories of those who believe the authors, cryptocurrencies are modern and advanced money, i.e. the money of the future. But are these stories true? Well, we can say that they perfectly fit the saying \"If something seems too good to be true, it is not true.\"Let's start with the following question: how do the crypto authors actually create this 'money'? It's simple - they imagine a number and write a protocol for attributing units of that number to online addresses. The units are initially attributed to system maintainers ('cryptocurrency miners'). They send the units to other users registered in the system, who then send them to each other. And that's basically it. So this 'money' is created by arbitrary declarations. The authors come up with some numbers and that is the 'supply' of cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin, for example, one unit of such created number currently costs $35,000.Anyone rational would now ask: how can something like that cost so much money? Seriously, by what logic does some invisible and intangible token created by a mere declaration of an anonymous author cost the equivalent of a new car?Crypto units do not represent shares in ownership of a company for the size of the company's equity to serve as a value reference for market price fluctuations.Authors of crypto protocols do not redeem these units for a predetermined amount of money, goods or services, like issuers of casino tokens or gift cards do, for this amount to serve as a value reference.These authors often compare themselves to banks. They say their units are like bank units, but way better. However, that is not true. Banks issue their units as debt - as loans to individuals and companies or as the purchase of government bonds. That is why the units must be returned to the banks. An individual who received 10,000 units from the bank and used them to buy a new car on the market will have to return goods, services or labor equivalent to that car to the market to get the units and return them to the bank. Otherwise, the bank will seize their car, offer it to the market and return the units by itself. Crypto units are not issued as a debt that must be returned to the authors of crypto protocols, so that during that return market receives goods, services, labor or seized property - for this to serve as a value reference.Finally, crypto units cannot be drunk, eaten, built into products, worn as jewelry, viewed as a picture or movie, or listened to as music. In short, they do not have an intrinsic value that creates a certain amount of benefit through the fulfillment of human needs, for this benefit to serve as a reference for the value of these units.Â Why then does one unit of bitcoin cost a whopping $35,000? What serves as a value reference? What can a bitcoin buyer get from a bitcoin author or a bitcoin unit itself that is worth in the range of that dollar amount? Well, the answer is, nothing. The value reference does not exist. Rather, the buyer pays $35,000 only because they believe they will sell the unit at a higher price. There are a lot of such buyers globally, so sellers keep putting higher prices. With such purely speculative behavior, prices went from zero to a high of $69,000.So what the authors of cryptocurrencies create is not money. Money must have a value reference so that market participants can determine how many monetary units are worth accepting as payment for goods and services. What these authors create is a record of membership in self-governing pyramid schemes. Unlike traditional pyramids, these do not have operators who collect and distribute funds. Instead, individuals pay into schemes by giving funds directly to existing members. The protocols then mark or update them as members by changing numbers next to their online addresses. Finally, members await the entry of new contributors. Without them, they cannot get their funds back - which is how all investment pyramids operate.As we can see, the story of cryptocurrencies is actually the story of an innovative technology for recording participation in good old pyramid schemes. This technology is significant because it kicked out fraudsters like Charles Ponzi or Bernie Madoff from such schemes. Consequently, all profits remain in the pockets of the participants themselves. However, blockchain technology does not manage any digital money. That money is only simulated with protocols, just like paper money is simulated with the game of Monopoly. So the whole story about the money of the future is just an urban myth and a bait for attracting contributors to modern-day pyramid schemes.",

But this take clearly ignores how fiat money is literally called 'fiat' is a sense 'let it be' because the price is whatever the issuing authority says it is, as long as they can keep it as that level with various policies and people trust in it. And when that fails, the price goes way down, and we have a rapid loss of value.",

If you say that Bitcon is ordinary digital money without any economy in it, then you are very wrong and what you write has no meaning whatsoever. Instead of whining like the 13 year olds on this forum saying that Bitcoin is nothing, you better wash your feet and go back to sleep.You treat Bitcoin as a person or God, and then get insulted when someone criticizes your behavior with regards to it. Let's me repeat. Bitcoin is a network of computers that manage the units of the number 21 million. Nothing related to economy exists in this. The network just simulates bank deposits (which represent debt - an actual economic resource) and in that way attracts users. The whole thing is a digital version of the Monopoly game. The only difference being, of course, that the properties traded for simulated money are real - which makes Bitcoin a pyramid scheme.it depends on what you say because everyone makes their own assumptions,How do you say pyramid scheme?As far as I know, in a pyramid scheme, the top level is the one who will win and make a profitI don't see a pyramid scheme herebut I don't want to argue with small children, let's study together again so that we know more and don't just talk about bitcoin issues",

If you are not happy with Bitcoin, for us it is not a problem at all because many other people around the world are interested in Bitcoin, including people with big positions in real life. So, OP doesn't need to educate other people because what needs to be educated is yourself because I see you are experiencing unhealthy thoughts.Bitcoin does not force anyone to use it as an investment but its a people's own decision therefore if someone does not find bitcoin as a better source of earning then he should leave this asset because there is no one who will force another to must buy bitcoin. If someone does not accept bitcoin then it does not mean that bitcoin will reduces in price because there are lots of others individuals who already have bought bitcoin in large number. I think no one will be here who bought bitcoin and never find profit from it but actually it is those individuals who have no patience and without knowledge they are buying and selling bitcoin therefore they put all blame on bitcoin and spread wrong informationÂ aboutÂ bitcoin.",

Since then, you've been on a marathon of creating countless accounts â Snowshow, Antikvark, Antithesis, niwrad â all to cover your tracks. Yet, despite the effort, your ignorance remains impressively intact. Time to break the cycle, maybe?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2239552.0Relevant thread: Ban evasion (account fxsurfer)So, you're stalking forum users critical of bitcoin and then accuse them of being some banned dude. Hilarious. I'm not stalking forum users, especially not someone like you. Why on earth would I bother? You keep coming back to this forum of your own free will. Unless, of course, someone's got you on puppet strings. I wouldn't know that. I'm just laying out the facts relevant to the discussions. If you're so keen on pretending to be someone else and hiding behind a constant trolling spree with new accounts, well, buddy, that's your mess to sort out, not mine.",
