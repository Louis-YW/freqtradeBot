      "body": "Huh? initiating a refund after more than 2 years!? sorry but that's not how it works. You can't just return a product after 2 years when you don't need it anymore otherwise why would anyone do business? It doesn't matter whether you have used it or not, the point is, you bought it and were able to access it if you wanted to.Most importantly, the price of bitcoin has changed since 2020. Sorry but it looks like you just found out your money back then has nearly doubled. You need to accept that you have spent your bitcoins and can't get it back anymore. It happens op.",

How about this:You used their service for two years and now you don't want to use it anymore. Since you don't want it anymore you are asking for refund. Am I correct?My understanding that you are not good at English. It's better to use a good translator or ask someone who know better English to help you.",

      "body": "This is one of the weirdest scam accusations I have seen in a while. You purchased some service back in 2020, and you are now (after 2 years) asking for a refund because apparently you never had access to what you paid for. That is something you should have complained about (if it's true) the moment you bought it. What were you doing for the last years? Were you hibernating like a bear?You have no case here, you were not scammed, and no self-respecting company would refund you.Maybe there were problems with the Discord channel you mentioned, but that's something that you should have handled immediately. You can't just buy something and come back after 2 years and say: you know that thing I bought, it never worked. I just never mentioned it until now.",

It's got nothing to do with the company that sold it to you. You bought something, they delivered, you never used what you bought and you didn't complain it didn't work. End of story. The email correspondence also shows them telling you they have no records of you ever buying anything from that particular email. You are two years late with this complaint and scam accusation.",

If something wasn't to your satisfaction at the moment of purchase, why didn't you say anything back then? Refunds are not provided for services not used. Sorry but you sound like you are 11 years old, and I am not going to continue discussing this manner with a person who wants a refund for something he bought 2 years ago and only now complains that there is a problem with it.",

Even if you got scammed (which I don't think you is the case here), they don't have account here so its not even possible to leave them negative feedback and that way try to help you (and others). Based on those screenshots that you provided, you bumping this topic and demanding refund won't do absolutely anything. Just accept the fact that you won't get your money back and that's it. And since you paid for it, you might as well start using that service. Question that still remains unanswered is why you waited for 2 years before asking for a refund?",

      "body": "Bro. Just stop. Unfortunately you waited too long to ask for a refund. multiple people here, and in customer support emails have told you the same thing. you are not listening sir. the refund policy is 72 hours. most places anywhere give you 30 days for refund. you PURCHASED the indicator more than 2 years ago, If you did not use the indicator that is no ones problem but yours. you are not getting a refund back sorry man. you are not understanding. you cannot buy something and then 2 years later ask for a refund just because you \"did not use it\". imagine if everyone came back after 2 years asking for a refund. can you buy a car or a phone or a computer and get a refund back 2 years later just because you didn't use it? no you can't. so i don't know why you think you are entitled to a refund after you clearly purchased it more than 2 years ago. you are wasting your time. posting here is not going to do anything. How are they scammers? YOU purchased the indicator, and you CHOSE not to use it, and ask for a refund 2+ years later. that is not how it works. don't waste your time.",
