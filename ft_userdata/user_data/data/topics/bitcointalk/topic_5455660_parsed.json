There are also other multiple decentralized exchanges too. But if you are looking towards avoiding exchanges at all then you might have to consider physical P2P for your conversion",

I don't think they support USDT, but you can always convert that to BTC.Additionally, op can use p2p providers here the only thing needed is just to locate their local board and trade with someone from there, maybe he may send usdt then they pays directly to his bank account without going through centralized exchange. I have also used this system of p2p, what i did was to locate our local board p2p provider here in the forum that is trusted and reliable, so i think this might work for op as well.",
