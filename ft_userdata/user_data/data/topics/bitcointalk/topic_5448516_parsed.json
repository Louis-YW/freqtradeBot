  "content": "Source: Tutwa Consulting GroupBRICS nations are advancing at a fast pace to eliminate the U.S. dollar-dominated financial system. The first step is to bypass the U.S. dollar and the second step is to create a new currency to settle international trades. While the first step is already in practice, the second step could be put in place after the BRICS summit in August 2023.The alliance countries have already taken measures to bypass the US-dominated global financial system. The aim is to move away from the dependency on the U.S. dollar and provide an alternative global financial option. BRICS is an alliance of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.BRICS: The Next Step To Eliminate The U.S. dollarcurrencySource: UnsplashJust recently, BRICS nations overtook G7 countries in global GDP while taking purchasing power parity into account. Russia announced that it would pay with the Chinese Yuan to settle trade with Asian, African, and Latin American countries. China and France completed the LNG gas trade using Yuan, ending the dollar’s reliance on energy trades.Therefore, BRICS are currently successful in their plans to eliminate the U.S. dollar to settle global trades in native currencies. However, if the alliance countries agree to a mutual currency to settle global trade in the upcoming summit in August, the dollar may face a significant drop in demand.The U.S. dollar might lack potency if the BRICS countries fully eliminate it for global settlements. Over time, many other countries could join the bandwagon and distance themselves from the USD.The development could make the dollar weak and make way for a new financial system not dependent on the USD. The success or failure of this development now only depends on the next BRICS summit in South Africa.The transition to settlements in national currencies is the first step. The next one is to provide the circulation of digital or any other form of a fundamentally new currency in the near future,” said the Deputy Chairman of Russia Duma, Alexander Bobakovhttps://watcher.guru/news/brics-advancing-to-eliminate-u-s-dollar-financial-system",

As long as there is a mutual agreement between everyone, it is not impossible to even create new currency to be used or change the financial system in which it won't be dependent on USD. In regards to changinf currencies, we are all aware that there have been mamy issues involved with USD even from before, and there are so many countries who are already waiting to be next reserved currency.The currency alone is easy, but the agreement is the one that seems possible. We know that before it reaches some sort of agreement, there're various procedures to follow and it is also possible that there will be debates and arguments to follow.",

There will be no much effectsRight now there may be no effect or significant effect but if other countries begin to buy into the idea one at a time, it may be troubling for the USD. These kinds of things take time. It doesn't just happen overnight. Alexander did not conquer half of the world in one day, Rome did not rule most of the world in one day, and Britain did not colonize their colonies in one day. Even America did not become a world power overnight. This is just the beginning of the plot between Russia and China. China has been looking for ways to make the yuan a federal reserve for a while now. Personally, I don't believe in their idea. China is not a country I can trust. They're no different from the US. They're both looking for ways to make their countries and their economy stronger. Another reason why I'll always pick the USD over the yuan is that I'll choose capitalism over socialism anytime, any day.",

      "body": "Well, people who understand how the system works wouldn't be talking this way. To understand things clearly, imagine the World as a Human body, USA is the Head while the rest of the body are other countries. The one who controls the body, the Head, controls other countries and systematically imposes its currency ( & will) on them for global transactions.It is going to be really hard for China to sustain the use of its currency globally. Russia could, but I noticed it's not too interested in Interfering or imposing its will on other countries. You need to back the currency militarily which I believe Russia already has considering it military might.The dollar is currently weakening because USA the Head of the body has become weak due to lack of strong and intelligent leadership that could sustain it, but this is temporary...the BRICS's or any other currency can't survive it in the long run even with Russia behind them militarily unless maybe it breaks away from the current system & become decentralized(and hard to stop) or is allowed by US to thrive. But there cannot be two heads on one body even with decentralization. They will always find themselves under the power of US somehow unless the role as the head is taken away from US and given to China for example, but China doesn't seem to meet the requirement as it's not a Multi-Racial/Multi-cultural society (Babylon). Babylon is typically the Mini-world inside the World for a reason. Another way to be independent is to have the yolk broken, but no one else but the CREATOR of Heaven and Earth can do that.By the way, Russia is currently acting as the head of the body until the true king of Babylon is awoken from sleep. Russia could easily have the world use its currency and be able to sustain it for some years, but she is not too interested.",

I mean before anyone could trade among these 195 you need any of those currency to be able to travel across, and if only 6 countries decides to breakout from USD how do you think it will affect the US dollar? There will be no much effectsThe USD accounted for about 60-70% of international transaction in the global economy (let's say 65%). Now BRICS accounted for about 23% of the Global economy, current BRICS countries estimates 85% of theirtransations in USD. If all of this will be converted to a new BRICS recommended currency(assuming 85% is equivalent to the economy meaning economy=international transactions) So 23% multiply by 85% equals20%. So this 20% will be taking out in the 65%, I mentioned earlier. USD will be left use by 45% only now BRICS still holds the 23%. Going back to your statement \"Noeffect\", thats 1/3 of the USD used transactions.But wait theres more, there are some countries have the intention to join BRICS, even Euro like France consider settling some trades with China in Yuan. And dont get me started in the Middle East. SEA, South America?Please correct me if Im wrong.",

Nothing bothers you? In addition to the rather stupid formulation of the task, and in euphoria, all these fighters with the dollar do not notice how they are killing their economy, moving away from the international settlement standard, and become totally dependent on the low-liquid yuan, with which they will be able to settle ONLY with China.And France is such a France  A classic theme when the country is in crisis is \"The United States is to blame for everything, Long live Great France!\". Are you hearing this for the first time? I recommend reading the story - how not to drive yourself into some kind of another big problem, this is how this speech sounds! PS And I repeat once again - \"from all sockets\" at the same time, as if on command, they began to write about the \"global rejection of the dollar\" and other \"heartbreaking stories.\" When such a media howl accelerates, it means that someone wants, wants very much, to distract the masses from something really important. For example, from the realization that those who abandoned the dollar, such as the unfortunate BRICS countries, will soon be monopolized by the RMB, from which they will not be able to get off, and returning to the normal world economy with the dollar will be sooo painful and difficult! Not understood ? Ok, even simpler - there is no departure from the dollar, there is a special economic operation of China on \"guinea pigs\", to save its economy, through the transit of yuan problems to other countries, which will be forced to conduct all transactions in yuan. But China has not refused the dollar and is not going to, moreover, it is increasing its reserves, at the expense of those not very smart comrades-in-arms \"in the fight against the dollar\"",
