But a situation whereby in every occasion somebody will will continuously reporting another one discussion for delection, i think it's improper. You people should take a look in my profile and check if my response to someone discussion is not tangible and reasonable. I don't know the person who is reporting my comment everytime.Moderators should not give attention to everyone who reports a Post, because sometimes people hate each other without any reason, and kicking against the person, within four days i have notice that somebody is busy reporting my quote to another person and many of my posts are being deleted. If i respond to your comment with harsh manner information me than deleting. I'm not a newbie to make or react to someone unreasonably.Moderators, please check my profile if I'm making unwised and unreasonable comment before deleting my comment, i don't if everyone will start reporting posts.image uploader",

And another thing is that your spoken English language might not sounds good to your understanding.I think every Post deserve an attention to read and understand what the writer is narrative, and we know that some is not perfect of using English language even though it's your native language, some mistakes will be made, it's a something we supposed to know, before i put this in writing i have taught about it severally, and this mega deleting of my posts just started recently.

And it is not because of your poor English or lack of proper grammar, but rather because most of your posts are of low quality and do not meet the forum's standards.This post, for example:Quote from: dataispower on September 07, 2022, 10:18:46 PMNobody is sure if 1xbit and 1xbet is from the same parents because the prove has not being given to us.I will say that the difference between 1xbit and 1xbet is that 1xbit is for casino related gambling game why 1xbet is for soccer game which is be play or bet manual with fiat currency. So talking of the 1xbit where we have experience a lot of scam from the company by playing casino with them, why nobody have state 1xbet have scam the before or run away with their fund.It is clear that what you wrote is complete nonsense, and that you are only posting to fulfill your weekly quota in the signature campaign. Please remember that this forum is not your day job and do not post here just because you \"have to\".",

Well, I've been looking at some of his posts from his post history and deleted posts and in general I don't think his posting is mostly spam, what I do see is that he probably ends up writing some of the posts like the deleted ones to meet the weekly quota, that can appear as quality posts at first glance, but in some cases they are pure garbage. That happens a lot on the gambling section, With the amount of garbage you see out there, many of those who write to cover the weekly quota know that if they write short posts they are more likely to be deleted than if they have a certain lenght. So they lengthen the garbage. OP, the most likely scenario is that someone has identified you as a spammer and is reporting several of your posts. So worry about writing constructive posts, to the best of your ability, because you will easily get reported if you write garbage posts like some of the deleted ones. Moderators can sometimes make mistakes, but being several posts deleted, the problem is not the people who report them or the moderators, the problem is that they are garbage.",

Instead of complaining about Mods and blaming them, you should consider they may be right. To start: have you read the Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ?Since your screenshots have a terrible resolution, I'll only check the first post:It's posted on page 4 of \"The Lower-Risk Gambling Guidelines\" Is this a joke?If I would have Reported your post, I would have written: \"generic shitpost\". Let's analyze:QuoteI want to tell you that you can not engage in gambling without the knowledge of your children or your familyThat's BS. You don't need to ask your children or family for permission to gamble.Quoteit's unstoppableThat's BS. Many people have gambled once or a few times, and most of them stopped.Quoteit's not something you can hide for long timeAlso BS. It varies per person.Quotebecause your mood or feelings when you lose the money you are not suppose to lose with the improper explanation you will give to conver the money you lose will make your family know what you are into and what is bothering you as a gambler.A BS word salad.QuoteI understand that gambling is something you will do on secret.That's not what he said at all.So yes, this post deserved to be deleted. I'm pretty sure more of your posts would get wiped if someone goes through the hassle of reporting them.Quote from: dataispower on September 09, 2022, 07:20:01 AMAssuming that it's a few posted deleted i will agree that it's a low quality, but this person deliberately visiting my profile frequently to report what i have written.

However, that doesn't change the way we handle it. If the user that's the reporter is correct, and the poster is violating the guidelines, then it'll be removed all the same. However, we don't just assume that because a user has a grudge against a user, and has been right previously, that all their reports must be correct. We review them on a case by case basis. There's plenty of reports that get made each month that are marked as bad, and quite a few of of them are from users just reporting a user simply because they disagree with what they've said. If you're subject to this sort of behaviour from another user, simply change your posting habits for the better, so even if they do have a grudge against you, there's nothing that they can report because you've cleaned up your habits. Obviously, that's assuming someone does have a grudge against you, it's quite possible that someone just thinks your posts are low quality, and what reporters tend to do is investigate the user if they're found to be making multiple bad posts, and therefore report a few more of them.",

But some of us don't know that altcoins make bitcoin relevant and also bring many investors to market, because bitcoin is already existing before other discoveries of altcoins. For me i may not like to invest in bitcoins again because the profit can not use to compare to the profit new coins will give me if i invest, to summarize it all. Every one values altcoins instead of bitcoin and if you watch carefully you will see that many of the altcoins is having same credit of bitcoin By the way, did you buy an account?

I have seen you jumping from topic to topic, making posts a few minutes apart, without even reading the posts that came before. And on top of that, a number of your posts do not make any sense at all, like in these examples:Quote from: dataispower on August 12, 2022, 07:30:06 AMI will advice someone who wants to take load for something else to be very careful before taking a loan and some people will give you loan and you won't be prosper for the loan. Because some people do take loan but they will not use it directly to what motivates them to take the loan. ~Quote from: dataispower on August 11, 2022, 05:10:23 PMActually it will never be easy for someone who play a bet or gambling and the bed disappointed the person by losing the game, any gamber who loses again from bet or from gambling never have peace of mind because of the money he lost from me and my experience of losing money in gambling I don't feel comfortable whenever I lose money but I hope that one day I will win then I will continue to predict another game after such moment so I noticed that not every gambler have the same feeling or have the same comfort whenever they lose again from a particular website.Quote from: dataispower on August 05, 2022, 06:05:21 PMI believe that everybody will give it an opinion based on what mean or her understand and they know about I am not after any country who is playing a blame game either it is good or bath but I believe that whatsoever any country is doing concerning blame game is off the benefits search particular country because there is no country that will do something that will hurt them or that will make the country economy to be shallow so you can not blame them actuallyI found this just by looking through your history, and those posts haven't even been deleted by the moderators.
