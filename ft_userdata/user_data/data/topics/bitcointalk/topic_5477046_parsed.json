I admire that you know your situation and your appreciation for your father, so invest in bitcoin because that vision is not wrong, or, in short, could lead you to a better life or a fair profit. But the thing is, I also would like to remind you that even though bitcoin investment is profitable, there is always a risk or bitcoin is a risky investment. I get it, you want to earn immediately to help your family, but if you rush things in bitcoin or cryptocurrency, then it will turn out bad as you could lose money in this investment, and I know you can't afford to lose money with your current state, so I advise you and encourage you to study first, give time and effort in studying about bitcoin and how to earn in it, for example trading, faucet, or you could start growing your account here and join in a signature campaign for starters to calculate the amount for your investment. Anyway, good luck on your investment journey. I wish you all the best. Just always remember to be safe in this field and think before you take action because every decision and move could cost you.",

So that I can benefit from here, so that I can help my family financially and put a smile on my parents' faces. Sadly, we don't even have a house of our own at present.Your intentions are not bad at all, but a wise decision about investing in Bitcoin is having to invest the amount that will not disrupt your financial plans or budget in the aspect of later-arising needs that could force you to sell your coin at a cheaper price than the price you bought. I want to remind you that Bitcoin is a volatile asset. You might buy when the price was $43k, and it can drop to $30k and stay in that price range for some months. If, in the future, you have urgent financial needs during the period when the Bitcoin price is low and your investment is your only option, then you might be forced to sell at a very cheap price. So, while investing in Bitcoin, you should have other sources of consistent income and also have some saved funds for emergencies. Invest the amount you can hold until the maturity of your investment (basically, when you have seen your infested amount yield enough profit you are satisfied with.).",

With Assface16678 I agree above all that I think the best thing you can do at this time of your life is to focus on training so that you can have a good income in the future. If you have to study and work in order to be able to provide for your family, make every effort you can. Investing in bitcoin can be part of the plan but not a priority. And if you are going to invest, it is better to have an emergency fund before you do so, so that you are not forced to sell in a bear market, as Dr.Bitcoin_Strange points out.",

Try to utilize it the most to improve your standard of living, take my suggestion it has worked for me, please start accumulating Bitcoin throughout the year except during bull run and in few year you will see you funds getting multiplied. Few important things are you need a job which gives you freedom to invest into Bitcoin hence give your best to get a better paying jobs to meet your end needs and invest even if it's as little as $10 a week. There are lot who don't have own house and there are people who sleep on street hence don't let any negativity impact your goal.",

We have bad times and we have good times. Human being we need to navigate through those are knowns and make ourselves stand in the crowd. But if you really want to invest and grow your money in a secure way, invest only a portion into Bitcoin. But you should never invest all money that you have into Bitcoin. The way Bitcoin can go up similarly it can go down as well. As per your situation, capital protection is something that you should look for. Always have a diversified portfolio so that you can spread out the risk of investment. All the best!",

Sadly, we don't even have a house of our own at present.Hmm OP that is a good idea to invest in Bitcoin but the main point is that the cryptocurrency market is based on high volitality. Here you can lose if you don't make up a proper plan for the future and gauge the dynamics of the market. Because this Bitcoin are totally different from other things. Right steps and good knowledge only can help you survive his assets in the market.But anyway I will will suggest some basic points that will allow you to gain some profit and fulfill your dream as well as family necessities. But I am not a financial adviser. It is just for educational purposes.Here are the following steps that will help you a lot if you use them at the right time.1. To avoid volatility, you need to diversify your investment—I mean DCA.2. Invest the money that you can afford to lose.3. Long term investment (hodl) can bring a lot of profit as compared to trading or short term investment because newbies don't have much more knowledge in terms of TA.3. Store your funds in a cold wallet because no exchange is trustworthy. Etc.........",

But today, hard work isn't enough for you to have a better life. While people see hope investing in Bitcoin and have a better life, you'll go back to the actual problem which is about money. You need to have money for you to be able to invest in Bitcoin because without such, it's always just hope and desires without having the actual thing you need to be part of it. As you study, can you work for part time to at least have some budget to yourself and be less to the budget of the family? I think that's the best way that you can do aside from studying very well.",
