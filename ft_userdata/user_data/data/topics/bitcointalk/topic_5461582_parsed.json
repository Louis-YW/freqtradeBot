  "content": "Hi everyone, today I stumbled across a problem that I’ve been trying to solve for hours.I have a few Innosilicon T2T-26T that I got for cheap some time ago, they are as good as new, anyway all of them restarted in the night, when checking them in the morning everything was fine but one.When accessing the one with the problem, the main page (miner status) never loads anything, but is weird because the miner is responsive, I can access the other web pages: overview, firmware upgrade, pool configuration, etc. But in the pool it shows as not hashing.I’ve tried everything I could think of: rebooting the miner (from the web page, and with the button reset), factory reset (from the web page, and button), changing pools, changing the Ethernet cable, changing networks, trying to update the firmware (it already has the latest one). Nothing works...Has anyone ever had this trouble? Were you able to solve it?Thanks in advance, I really don’t know any more ideas for solutions.",
