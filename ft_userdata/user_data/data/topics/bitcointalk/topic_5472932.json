Wine Is Not Emulator. It is in the name! But even if it would be, then still, port forwarding from a VM to a native system would solve it. But in Wine, you don't need even that, because Wine is just WinAPI implementation for Linux, so if you open some TCP port, then using Wine-wrapped WinSock is the same as using raw Unix sockets.Another reason could be that Wine has a nice UI, similar to Windows 98 or systems like that. And some people like that more than Linux GUI. But then, changing UI in native Linux installation is a better option than running everything from Wine.And if the reason is something else, then I have no idea, what it could be, because those two are probably the most obvious ones. It is definitely not something like \"I want to run x86 applications on M1 processor\", because Wine is not about that. Which means, x86 is used in both systems, if Wine can run it.QuoteWhy use Wine at all instead of just running Windows virtually?Because virtualization is slow. And if the architecture is the same, then there is no reason to use VM, if it works in Wine. I would understand it in cases, like \"I want to run x86 Windows applications on Mac M1 processor\", but this is a different story. And even then, if some transcompiler would be available, I would use it instead, to translate x86 instructions into M1 ones, and then execute them natively. Why? Because of performance. And if you talk about games, then this is a place, where performance is important.Edit: I can add one more thing. Emulators are slow. And I hope, that in the future, they will be much faster than today. How they could do that? For example, by translating binaries, and storing them in native architecture before using. Emulators are great at dynamic analysis: you start from some processor state, execute things instruction by instruction, and then... then, emulators often do a huge mistake: they drop that native instructions, and they are never stored anywhere.If emulators would perform opcode translation during first execution, and then use native executables in the physical architecture, they would be much faster than today. Then, only the startup would take a lot of time. But if some huge loop would be translated once, for example from x86 into M1, then it could stay in M1, and be executed natively in M1. And that would bring a lot of speedup to the whole emulation.Also, after initial translation, there should be more phases to do some opcode cleanup, but well, saving executed opcodes is a good start, and I hope emulators will go in that direction. Some of them, like QEMU, can already dump input and output assembly, the only missing piece is capturing all of that, and producing well-structured executables, instead of for example loops expanded into all iterations (which means, emulators could get brilliant performance, but native approach just consumes too much space, because then there are no loops).",

      "body": "Quotethat he could have a Windows partition, a dual boot solution, boot on an external SSD etc...,No matter what you use, if you have more than one main operating system, then guess what: you will need a way to move files between them. Having Windows partition is good, as long as Windows cannot see the Linux one. External SSD is good, as long as it is attached properly, and if the system will not remove it in the middle of your work, if it was inactive for 5 minutes.Quotebecause I don't know if he'll be able to allocate enough ram / CPUThis is one of the reasons, why virtualization is still not good enough. And when it comes to games, it is probably also some GPU, and some additional drivers, probably with closed sources, designed specifically for games, and other closed source software. Guess what: people made emulators first, that's why Wine is called \"Wine Is Not Emulator\", and not the other way around. VirtualBox is not called \"VM Is Not Simulator\". The name can tell you, what happened first, and what was created later, as well as explain some reasons, why it is what it is.So, the whole thing is not only about security. It is also about habits. If someone is used to Wine, where Linux is the main system, and where everything is built around it, and it works, then switching to multi-OS-based environment is hard. Because then, you want to synchronize between different OSes. Switching things then requires rebooting the whole system (which is hard for people who run their machines 24/7 for some reasons, like full node owners). Also note that if something works in Wine, then moving that program into Open Source land, or writing a replacement, is much easier, than if you use VM or dual boot. Also because then you have to make things tick on Linux, even indirectly, for example by configuring PulseAudio properly.Edit: One more thing: if you have some old software, for example designed for Windows XP or Windows 98, then guess what: using Wine is much easier and safer, than running some VM, or some dual-boot installation. I wonder if you ever tried using dual boot with Windows 98 in 2023. You may be surprised, how hard it is. You would see a lot of strange messages, like \"not enough RAM\", if you use more than 128 MB RAM, and other very strange things, for example related to MBR vs GPT partitions, not to mention drivers for old systems, and going through the whole installation, without accidentally wiping out your whole disk (and you have to support \"large volume\" feature, where \"large\" is greater than \"512 MB\"). Don't even try to attach it to any network, if you don't know, what is Wireshark.Edit: I guess in the future, you could even run some apps from a browser, instead of using Wine. Which means, we are more and more away from bare metal installation, and dual boot solutions, or even Virtual Machines. Here is why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urF9SRtrImg",

Wine website clearly state it's compatibility later,Quote from: https://www.winehq.org/Wine (originally an acronym for \"Wine Is Not an Emulator\") is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, & BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.Wine does not perform sandbox at all,Quote from: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ7.5 How good is Wine at sandboxing Windows apps?Wine does not sandbox in any way at all. When run under Wine, a Windows app can do anything your user can. Wine does not (and cannot) stop a Windows app directly making native syscalls, messing with your files, altering your startup scripts, or doing other nasty things.You need to use AppArmor, SELinux or some type of virtual machine if you want to properly sandbox Windows apps. Wine doesn't protect you from malware either,Quote from: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ7.4 Is Wine malware-compatible?Yes.

Aftercleaning all this mess, normal wine operation has been fully restored.     With regards, Pavel TrollerAnd after that the wine wiki update their FAQ with the question: Is Wine malware-compatible?Quote7.4 Is Wine malware-compatible?Yes. Just because Wine runs on a non-Windows OS doesn't mean you're protected from viruses, trojans, and other forms of malware.There are several things you can do to protect yourself:    →Never run executables from sites you don't trust. Infections have already happened.    →In web browsers and mail clients, be suspicious of links to URLs you don't understand and trust.    →Never run any application (including Wine applications) as root (see above).    →Use a virus scanner, e.g. ClamAV is a free virus scanner you might consider using if you are worried about an infection; see also Ubuntu's notes on how to use ClamAV. No virus scanner is 100% effective, though.    →Removing the default Wine Z: drive, which maps to the unix root directory, is a weak defense. It will not prevent Windows applications from reading your entire filesystem, and will prevent you from running Windows applications that aren't reachable from a Wine drive (like C: or D:). A workaround is to copy/move/symlink downloaded installers to ~/.wine/drive_c before you can run them.    →If you're running applications that you suspect to be infected, run them as their own Linux user or in a virtual machine (the ZeroWine malware analyzer works this way).So, if the wiki suggests using a Virus Scanner, then it's vulnerable.",

You can replace any DLL with your own version. You don't want a filesystem access? Just use your own DLL, where all of those WinAPI functions are empty. For example, if you see, that some EXE is using DeleteFileA, and you want to deny access to it, then your own Kernel32.dll with an empty filesystem implementation will do the trick. Because DLLs used in Wine are Open Source, you can just use their code, and disable what you want (or even mark it as \"not implemented\", as they do for many functions, before implementing them).Quote(e.g. reading file on /home)You can clearly decide, which user can run Wine. And if you run it as a separate user, created only for that, then user from \"/home/wine\" cannot access files from \"/home/vjudeu\".What you said is correct. But people who're not familiar with Wine wouldn't know how to secure Wine or even know how insecure is Wine by default. And many people who have some security concern is more likely to choose convenient option such as using VM or running Wine inside Docker.",

Maybe I spent too much time on exploring unknown EXE files to notice that. Because in general, if you have some unknown executable, then it is normal to start with \"deny by default\" approach, and provide all DLLs with empty implementation (or even skip loading them entirely, and replace all calls with NOPs), and then enable features one-by-one, to ensure that we know, how does that unknown program work, and try to write a replacement, without even trying to decompile its code.",
