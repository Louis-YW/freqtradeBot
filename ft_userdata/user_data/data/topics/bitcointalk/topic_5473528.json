  "content": "Yes, another fee topic, deal with it!  I know, nobody likes to pay fees, nobody! Me neither!And if there is an exception for sure it doesn't want to pay high fees, so it's pretty understandable that everyone is unhappy about it!But at the same time, why are you angry at the same situation everyone was believing in it and predicting it?Every single time a newbie asked what would happen when there would be no mining reward he got the same response over 10 pages, miners will live on from fees, and the security of the blockchain will be generated from fees! And here we are, although the fees are not quite high enough yet!The last block:https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000002745f5dc332c3f8373773c05f3507c51bbfb4e402359bgenerated :QuoteTotal fees   ‎3.257 BTC$119,069Subsidy + fees   ‎9.507 BTC $347,557so in order for the fees to replace the reward, you would need twice as much already, even despite this:QuoteFee span   280 - 8,206 sat/vBMedian fee   ~299 sat/vB $15.31To make it as short as possible, for the network to have the same security as now without a block reward we would need each block to have twice as big fees in the future, that's how things work!So, are you angry with high fees? Yes, we all are, but, wasn't this the design?Before anyone comes up with some myths about this, let's clear some things1) More efficient gear isn't making the network more secure alone, what's making the network secure is the amount of $ to invest to generate that hashrate, so if you think more efficient gear will mean the network will be just as secure but cheaper, it's delusional.Right now the network is guarded by 400Exahash, which alone doesn't mean a thing, you must translate those into 4 million $2000 a piece machines to understand the security right now, as it takes 8 billion to launch a 51% attack. This also doesn't mean that because the hashrate in 2013 was one million lower you could attack it at that time with just 8000$  2) Cheaper energy or solar or renewable or anything else, again won't solve a thing, even if we run our gear on 0.1 cents per kWh if the reward per day is just $1000 you will only be able to afford 1Gkwh, so anyone willing to spend more than $1000 on energy will have the upper hand!So, as a conclusion or encouragement or whatever, don't be angry at the fees, they help secure the network, and this is how it was designed to be in the first place, otherwise, we would end up like Bitcoin Gold or Ethereum classic, shitcoins getting 51% attacked 3 times in a row.And of course, for now, we could actually start using LN rather than complaining, but that would be a solution that involves doing something!",

If you can use other top alts to trade, better look into this matter rather than look for such reasons why.There will be no benefit of digging why, just find your other options to avoid such fees.This maybe just another phase in btc, sooner or later, the fees will go down again.",

How About the safest option, leave off transaction with bitcoin for now and use fiat except on cases you are obliged to, this will soon die down",

Any form of NFT is disaster for any legit crypto network. We have seen the madness in ETH and now we are seeing it in Bitcoin. Is there a way to ban this nonsense entirely from Bitcoin network? Due to this high fees, Bitcoin is slowly becoming outdated compared to the innovation that are happening in mainstream financial world. Bitcoin transactions are becoming expensive to an extent where it is becoming irrelevant and if not solved immediately, might become irrelevant as a payment processor. It will then remain as an investment asset only!",

The way you explained really changed my mindset, for good security what we need is to pay back better. At the same time over time, it will inflate as well, No one forcing those who care to be willing to pay, and those who do not want to can move on.To the end on the bright side, it's beautiful.",

It doesn't matter to them that they are now paying $100 more every month, because their pay rose by $500, so it's understandable, after all they have more money so there's nothing to complain about, right?In August, September and October of 2021 the price was reaching all time highs and the fees were lower than they are now. Lower prices with higher fees = failed expectations and angry crowd with pitchforks. You say the fees were expected, I say the negative sentiment was expected as well.",

They make sure that each transaction transmitted is received and goes from the sender to its receiver. They should not call 100% of the shots but they are technically the backbone of the network. They are a substantial part at that. While I agree that the fees should remain economical to a lot of people, I can't also help to think that maybe we are really headed for a future wherein fees are high in order to compensate and motivate miners to continue hashing and help keep bitcoin safe from 51% attacks. All I can say right now is, I don't have a choice but to wait until everything subsides before I start using bitcoins to move my funds again.",

Me, I was not expecting bitcoin transaction fee to increase because from the white paper bitcoin can be used to buy things online and of the fee is high then that purpose will be defeated. Because it is not nice for you to buy something in the market with bitcoin and you want to pay with bitcoin And if the fee is high then will affect your transaction so instead you use fiat to pay. If Miners need fees to keep the system running they have to consider that not everyone has enough bitcoin to transfer from one wallet to another. So they have to know that.

Also, since it's the ordinals that are causing the fee to hike now, in the future, what else could cause it to spike if not the ordinals?This is not the first time I have experienced this high fee saga; as a matter of fact, the last fee spik, I spent like $10 trying to withdraw Bitcoin worth $60. It's not funny, though, but that's what we agree to, but it's going to discourage new Bitcoiners.We do say that one can invest a small amount in Bitcoin. What if the person wants to invest $10 in Bitcoin and is going to spend that amount just on a fee? Ah!!",

YES!I just used the current mempool situation to describe the future scenario, because if I had done so when the fees were 1sat/b nobody would have paid attention, now, things are different! Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on November 09, 2023, 11:10:15 PMWhat surprises me is that you say that this is how it was designed to be. Whereas, just as Odohu has said, I thought it's the ordinal stuff that is making the fee hike, or are you, @stompix, suggesting that since the system was designed to be so, it might even be worse in the future?Exactly, it was designed to be like this, the network will run on fees once all the coins are mined!Remember? We had 21 million topics about this!So when this is going happens it will be pretty much like a security company, if the fees it gets from transactions are 5$ it will act just like a police officer who is paid the minimum wage on his retirement day, if the fees are in the millions, then you can afford one full battalion of bodyguards. Quote from: Zaguru12 on November 09, 2023, 07:48:02 PMDefinitely this is predicted to happen but why someone like me is angry about this hike is because we are not paying for security of the network that will benefit us all but we are paying such high fee because some folks created garbage and some naive folks thinks they could make profit out of it. We are bin disturb with something worthless which will soon die down. If it was as you stated out for security purposes which won’t just happen out of the blue like this one, but will be gradual process and we would well informed of that. Well, technically even now we're paying for the security, since more fees mean more miners, but a bit irrelevant.And yes, I know pretty well the change will be gradual, what I'm trying to tell people is that the image they chanted so easily when they were typing what will happen when all coins are mined is this one!So it's not going to be a walk in the park, oh miners will live on from fees, and everything is fine, but it will be more like what we see now!Some really need to understand that the reason why they can send money to another country is completely secure with no chance of transactions being reversed or censored does not happen magically, it's possible with $30 million being spent each day on that security!Bottom line, prepare to pay up once the money printing is done!",
