If truly there is recession as the internet claimed, I can say there is no best way to profit from recession but there are ways of profiting from recession. The word (best) is what I disagree with. There are a lot of things to do that can profit you during recessions but I don't know your perspective weather cryptocurrencies or general, generally speaking investing in things like health care services,  consumer Staples, Utilities etc this sectors resist recession the most. No matter the situation people most eat, be healthy and so on. So investing in this sectors will make a lot of profits. For cryptocurrencies, the one and only advice is BUY MORE BITCOIN/ INVEST MORE ON BITCOIN that's another way to profit from recession.",

I'm as bullish on bitcoin as anyone else, but I'm also a realist and it hasn't yet achieved safe-haven asset status.  In a crisis I wouldn't bet on bitcoin being any less volatile than it traditionally has been.  If I had cash, I'd be sitting on a pile of it off to the sides just waiting to see what exactly is going to happen and where the opportunities are when it does happen.  When in doubt, ask yourself: \"What would Warren Buffett do?\".",

Apart from real estate, which is good to do, I think it is also good for Canadian citizens to know the programs that their government has so they can make money.And aside from investing wisely, people in the country also need to increase their emergency savings. Then they should also reduce the debt so as not to add to the problem,  instead, if there are still debt fees, they should be gradually reduced until they are paid for less stress. Therefore, in these situations, the citizens need to handle the budget strongly in that regard.",

Im not following much Emerging Markets these days since I don't hold any equity here, however, Canada is filled with cheap fiat duat massive QE period from the Covid pandemic when they printed a ton of money to save businesses from bankruptcy and from consumers themselves to be able to buy stuff as they were locked. This can has been kicked for a while but as interest rates are raised, you can bet that sooner or later recession will hit once all this debt gets updated to said interest rates. With good timing there is when you would short the market, or just wait in cash to buy in cheaper. Will BTC perform in this environment along gold? who knows, personally im just looking forward to add up on an SP500 position as well as hopefully get in on overbought individual stocks like TLSA and NVDA which should crash the most given current PER ratios.",

Besides, in the last 94 years since 1929 recession has happened in Canada (exactly 13 recessions of various sizes). From what I heard from my family members living there, those who are living in Toronto and Vancouver (and some surrounding areas) are experiencing a significant rise in rent, but outside of those areas, it is pretty much fine aside from the rise of prices of food and utilities. As for how we will profit from it, we have to see first if this is true and how the market will actually go to make a definite decision.",

I completely agree with you, shorting a currency no matter how bad it seems is very risky because you never can tell when it will reverse and start going up, the few times I've tried trading futures in cryptocurrency, I've made more profit going long than shorting, so from this , I learnt never to short a currency that is going down but rather , wait for it to go down then long it when I feel it's already in the deep and ready to shot up ..This same scenario I believe applies to the forex market as well, and besides, speaking about Canada and recession, no matter how bad it seems, I think the country will come out of the recession pretty soon, so personally, if I wanted to make any profit off this, I would rather wait for the deep, then long CAD, rather than shorting it .",

The best example of it is United States and despite all the odds they have significantly decreased the dump of USD by increasing the interest rate.The interest rate in Canada is currently at an ATH in the past 20+ years. So if you wanna short CAD wait for the interest rate hike to fail or to reverse then do it.I can't comment on the stock market though.",
