  "content": "Risks: minimumProfit: near 10% from on one spinIn this article I will show how you can earn on the difference of exchange rates on the Crypto-platform Coinlive using as an example the currency pair ETH/BTCTo work we will need:1. any cryptocurrency exchange2. Passed verification (takes 10-15 minutes on average)3. Equity (minimum 100$, it is desirable to have at least 1000$ for stable earnings)Let's go to the essence of the scheme, as I mentioned above, we will earn on the difference of rates, namely BTC to ETH (you can pick up any other links, my example will be on this one):We will trade exclusively on the spot.To begin, we need to buy bitcoin on any exchange, then we need to put bitcoin on Coinlive, then proceed to the currency pair ETH/BTC and see the difference in the rate of $200, through which we will earn. Then we simply buy ETH for BTC, and get ETH for BTC below the market price, then we derive our ETH and sell at any marketplace, or sell at Coinlive and derive our USDT;)www.coinlive.pro - this is the exchange where we do everything (not advertising)",

      "body": "The strategy that you've explained is arbitrage, as far as I know, this strategy is hard to apply these days. It sounds easy when you're explaining it and why there's a need to use that platform you probably own. It's still a new website and any amount that's deposited there can be gone into dust because it has just been made since last month. For someone who has found a huge difference on the pricing of any crypto and sees an opportunity to do arbitrage trading, he doesn't have to go through any third party and just go with the two exchanges involved.",
