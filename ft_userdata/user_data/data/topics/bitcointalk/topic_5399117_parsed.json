I wasn't interested in retrieving the wallet file. I just wanted to make sure it was permanently deleted. (For sensitive files, I usually go to the Recycle Bin and delete it again to make sure it's gone forever.) But in answer to @PawGo, yes, I did use Electrum file->delete. This could explain why the file got deleted instantly without going to Recycle Bin.",

In the words of Satoshi:Quote from: satoshi on October 03, 2010, 08:54:07 PMSigh... why delete a wallet instead of moving it aside and keeping the old copy just in case?  You should never delete a wallet.Quote from: LTRippley on May 18, 2022, 05:10:32 PM(For sensitive files, I usually go to the Recycle Bin and delete it again to make sure it's gone forever.)As has been explained above, data is only truly deleted if the sectors of the hard drive it is stored on are overwritten. Deleting a file only deletes the small bit of code which tells your OS where to access the data, and essentially says \"these sectors can now be used for something else\". But until you actually use those sectors for something else, then the data still exists. Simply emptying your recycle bin is not sufficient for truly sensitive data.",

I had heard that a hot wallet could be hacked so I decided to delete that wallet file. Aren't hot wallets more susceptible to hacking? Correct me if I'm wrong. That's not a very safe way to get a hardware wallet seed.  If I were you I would use the hardware wallet to create a completely new seed phrase that's never been on a PC, and send the bitcoin to that new wallet.  The very point of having a hardware wallet is having a safe backup that's never been in a position to have possibly been compromised.  Only then can you have complete confidence that your coins are safe.The other thing that strikes me as odd, you had an Electrum seed and restored it using a hardware wallet?  It's my understanding that Electrum seeds are not compatible with hardware wallets, which use Bib39 seed phrases.  Did you confirm your coins are accessible with the hardware wallet?As for the other issue of safely deleting files, I use BleachBit.  It's free and open-source.  It overwrites the sectors with random noise, so there's no way for them to be restored.  A combination of file encryption and file-shredding tools is a good way to keep the data and keep it safe.",

It is true that a hot wallet is more susceptible to hacking. For example, Electrum servers themselves were compromised a few years ago  to show a fake update message to a copy which, if downloaded, swipes your entire balance after you enter the password.At least there's no need to worry about file recovery.

      "body": "Yeah, DireWolf is right. Importing an insecure hot wallet in to a hardware device does not make it suddenly secure. You can never be more secure than the weakest link in your chain, and for you that is the fact that your seed phrase was generated and stored insecurely prior to being imported in to your hardware wallet. It would be like downloading a document from your email, encrypting it, and then storing that encrypted file on a USB drive locked in a safe. Sure, the encrypted file might be very safe, but the data contained within still exists on your email account and so isn't secure at all.You need to use your hardware wallet to create a brand new wallet with a brand new seed phrase (which you keep permanently offline and never enter in to any computer, phone, website, etc.), and then send all your coins from your old wallet to this new wallet via a standard bitcoin transaction.",
