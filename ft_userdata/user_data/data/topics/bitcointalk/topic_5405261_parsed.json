  "content": "SOLANA experienced a 100-fold increase in value between November 2020 and November 2021, making it a popular growth story. Then, after a short period of time, it had fallen by more than 85% from its peak. Two network outages that Solana experienced in May and June added to the downward pressure already felt in the markets for cryptocurrencies and stocks.Solana (SOL) has been trading just below the 20-day EMA ($35) for the past few days, but the bears have not been able to profit from this weakness. This suggests that at lower levels, there aren't many sellers.The buyers will now attempt to push the price above the 20-day EMA. If they are successful, the SOL/USDT pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($40). If this barrier is broken and closed above, the windows could open for a potential rally to the psychological level at $50.On the other hand, if the price moves away from the moving averages, it might indicate that traders are still selling during minor rallies and that the market sentiment is still bearish. The bears will then drag the pair below $30. If they do that, the pair might fall to $27 and then to $25.",

This sounds like what a short term trader would say, if not I don't understand why sol reaching $40 would be mythical if you know this project and it's previous ath.Am not a short term trader so my response will solely base on long term goal, and long term I know sol will do way more than what you give it credit for, price wise.",

Right now it's $35 but once the market is up again.Those SOL holders are likely to celebrate as that could be the time that you'll see it on the top again.",

If this barrier is broken and closed above, the windows could open for a potential rally to the psychological level at $50.It is really hard to profit from this bear market but it might be true that the case of solana is quite different because there are coins that still continues to fluctuate because there are demands that keeps on coming from them while from solana, the investors are distancing themselves because they are aware that the coin have some on going issues and I think that was a critical one.What they are doing for now is just monitoring the coin and they will watch out the news to know latest the updates or to know if the issue have been sorted out already or not before they will start on supporting this coin again. It's better to be safe than sorry though.",

So if you look at the series of blackouts this sounds even more concerned about what Solana can't do going forward. Remember blackouts are not trivial things that can be covered up with positive news flows and may hit investors and traders slowly and no longer want to drop their money. The Solana project has not released any new news yet, which means that the problems faced are quite serious.",

Even though it is very clear that Ethereum has always been more difficult to beat by other altcoins in the past and also today. So there is nothing worth comparing because the two are very different.",
