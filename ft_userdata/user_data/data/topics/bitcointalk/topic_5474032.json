If you can not control your emotion, greediness, you will lose money.If you use all money you have for trading in this market and use leverages for trading, you will lose all your money soon.Not only advice but also my warning.Don't tradeNever use leverage trading or futures trading.Buy Bitcoin and hold it in your non custodial open source wallet.",

Actually I was already taking losses due to the start of the bear market and the Luna crash wiped out my full portfolio because I was doing DCA by hoping it would recover. I stopped trading after that and only held projects I liked for the long term.",

I bought my first bitcoins at around 80$ and started trading them a few month later until the price rallyed to about 1000$ in 2013. This was the time when I stopped my trading activities back then. However, as I was a complete novice in this area at the time, the losses in BTC terms were also quite high - but quite bearable in dollars at the time. But I would still very much like to have the BTC now",

The most important thing is not to despair, to start now. Bitcoin is considered a long-term investment.

And by the way, you don't need to trade in order to invest. There are other ways to grow your money in cryptocurrency apart from trading such as investing or staking. So if you're not comfortable with trading, you can still build wealth without it. Although, trading can be profitable if you are very skillful in it but you need to dedicate your time to learn it very well and how to handle your emotions and greediness while trading.But staying away completely from trading because of the risk involved is not the way forward. I think it's more advisable to encourage people to learn about and not rather trading blindly. It's another opportunity to make money if you can do it better.",

This isn't something easy that I could make sure that easily, it is something difficult to know beforehand to be fair. I get that some people may have some sort of approach to it differently and I can understand that, it is not an issue, but that doesn't mean that I can remember it.Plus, just because we got into it early doesn't mean that we made a lot of money, I got in when it was under 200 dollars, at that time I had some money, if I put all my money in, I would be rich, but neither did I invested that much, nor I kept the bitcoins that I got during those times, it went up a little, I made a little profit and I sold it. So getting in early all by itself is not really equal to getting rich.",

The main thing on my mind into those times or moments is that i've been engaging on airdrops, bounties and signature campaign and other things which that could make me able to earn Bitcoin or other coins which i could really be able to hold. Trading interest had just that become that possible on the time that i have experienced that first bull run on which it didgive out that kind of interest for me to tend to make some snipping out some profits with market volatility but of course those are on the time that i have made out some moneyon the things that i've been doing. Getting some capital for you to trade would really be that mainly needed because you cant really be able to start up on the time that you do lack capital which it is of course common sense. lol",

I made few trades without any knowledge how to thread Bitcoin or even used to buy or sell option to do spot trades. I got better at it eventually after few tries, but that wasn't ensuring me with profit. I took a huge risk and put half of my assets into buying Bitcoin and then it fell down to $29,000. It was a big loss for me because I got panicked and sold everything taking a loss. After that I moved on to holding and learn trading in that process while I hold. I'm not going to say that I'm a good trader right now but I have learned a few things here and there with which I can make some profit nowadays. But I have taken a break from it.

Afterwards, I just continued buying more and more coins and hoarded them. Back then I thought $300 was the highest price bitcoin can do after that $1.1k peak back in November 2013. I thought that I missed the train, and all that's left of bitcoin are remnants that will no longer take off simply because it already had its time. Yet I still bought, and fast forward to 2017, I was one of the lucky guys whom held through it all and made a fortune keeping bitcoins and selling them at the right time.Had I known that bitcoin will reach insanely higher highs, I would have used every single penny of my paycheck in buying bitcoins to maximize my profit. Then again, there's no way of knowing that, and I'm still contented with what I got right now.",

It's fascinating to see how far we've come since we first stepped into the world of cryptocurrencies.The question today is how much was the price of Bitcoin when you started trading?Not all traders will remember how much they used to kickoff a trading journey, what matters in trading is that do you make a profit in trading because the primary concern of a trader is to make a profit because when a profit making is not manifesting a trader will not summon a courage to trade more.A trading is a something of risk and its something someone will weak up and join without knowing the rudiments of Trading, most of the people who loss out in trading or ventures into trading without understanding the concept, is because they have heard of trading and they think that trading is a short cut to make money without knowing the output and input of trading. Quote from: hd49728 on November 14, 2023, 10:16:35 AMIf you use all money you have for trading in this market and use leverages for trading, you will lose all your money soon.That's while I stipulated that someone have to know the advantages and disadvantages of trading before venturing into it, it will be more better and encouraging for someone who don't know rudiments of Trading to venture into buying and selling of bitcoin either for short-term investment or long-term investment base on its financial strength",
