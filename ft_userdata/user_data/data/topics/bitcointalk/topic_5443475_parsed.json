But in any case this is my personal reasons1. profits, obviously, when you trade or simply hold bitcoin for years, it will give you a huge ROI2. and with that, you gain financial freedom, as you have the money right now to buy things that you wanted3. it's the wait, the delayed gratification, in the beginning, I don't have this kind of mentality, but as I mature in this market, I developed this ability, and so I not only apply it in bitcoin, but also in other facets of life4. Investments, again it's the same, although I have stocks investment prior of me joining the market, but still I learn to diversify my money",

But of the long term, I really believe on Bitcoin.I agree with what you said, we need to know the features and uses of bitcoin. But unfortunately, from the earliest days, bitcoin was turned into an investment tool, and it has spread to this day. Except for some early bitcoin adopters who see bitcoin as the future technology, as a means of P2P payment. The rest, market participants in recent years have always treated bitcoin as an investment, nothing more and nothing less. What they care about is profit. And I believe if bitcoin suddenly becomes stable, the market will definitely calm down, and there won't be many people interested anymore.",

It is a digital asset that is capable of forcing global financial institutions to innovate and provide their customers with a more modern transaction system and there is nothing cooler than that. While many people are pessimistic about Bitcoin and think that it will disappear in the future, I still love it and am very optimistic that it will continue to exist in the future.",

I didn’t knew Bitcoins can be mined or traded. At that time some casinos were there where Bitcoins were used, so I thought i can earn Bitcoins through playing in those casinos. In a similar manner, when I was exposed to true capabilities of the coin, I got involved with the coin and made great investments in it. This is my story.",

Quote from: JamesBorn on March 05, 2023, 06:40:06 PMI just want to make you laugh small but below is today price not impressed.Because you have some unrealistic ideas and deadlines. I'd like to remind you that we're still in a bear market and as long as we're above 20000 everything is good. Most of us expected the bottom for bitcoin to be at the top of the 2017 bull market and if not for FTX bitcoin would have fulfilled these expectations. There are many reasonable predictions for the near future and for me they are as follows:-no new bottom for bitcoin in this bear market-the price slowly creeping towards 30000 with the target for that price being reached before the halving-a bull market in 2024-a new ATH in 2024 or 2025.I don't care about small ups and downs along the way.",

Apart from that, nothing to be scared of. Just hold on tight, be patient, and trust the movement of the bitcoin price. The green light would surely come and you and I will enjoy the profits it comes with. There is this popular saying that says ''your health is wealth''. Is he who has good health enjoys his life and the benefits of the investment he made in the future. Sipping garri till the rainy days come doesn't make you wise but rather an unwise being who does take his health for granted just because he is hoping for the future he is not sure of what will happen next",

Were exactly are you holding money, actually it's good to invest in cryptocurrency and it's also good to have fiat currency but it's dependable on your policy. Do you know that sometimes online banking fails and when you are in the need of fiat currency you can't access it, at moment, so instead of putting all your money in online banking or cryptocurrency use some parts of the money to establish business that will been giving you a daily return.",

That's what we have to do if we want to profit from bitcoin. Maybe now is still a good time to buy bitcoin, especially since the price of bitcoin is currently declining again. We must not waste this running time if we want to change the future and have a better future later.People can still use their savings or free money to invest in bitcoin if they can manage their money properly.
