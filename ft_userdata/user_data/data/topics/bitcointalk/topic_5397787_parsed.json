      "body": "At first I didn't understand what stock exchange they were talking about, but then I realized that it was probably the peculiarities of auto-translation. I looked at this token and I can say with certainty that it is a scam. The token dropped from $9 to $0.02 in a year. 99% loss in value suggests that the project was aimed at making money quickly. Most likely, the developers abandoned this project and started some other project, the purpose of which will also be to raise money, then a large token release to the market, price collapse and so on.",

It's going nowhere. It died a long time ago, once you look at the coinmarketcap chart.The 24 hours volume used to be in millions of dollars, but right now it's just $30K",

Is it a good idea to buy?First, you ask to review your own token and try to shill here.Second, in crypto to see an opportunity, not only from the price, but from the product side, what product does your token offer?After I looked at your token website, I found out that the utility of your token is about copy-trade, I don't think this is a utility that will last long, besides I also know of a token with copy-trade utility and it's not growing. If you're asking if it's a good idea to buy $ALPHR tokens, my answer is NO.",
