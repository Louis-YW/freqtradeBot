It was on a mining rig so nothing to steal but it made me be more cautious about downloading software from people who are newbies on this forum.Another was basically keeping coins on exchanges and these exchanges got hacked or went bankrupt. Had a few of those throughout the years. Basically get a hardware wallet if you want to be safe.",

The lesson that I learned from that was to double check the address that I paste in a sender wallet field to see if it is the actual address that I copied as the destination.  It is something simple.... but it can happen to anyone, if you are in a hurry and you do not double check your destination address.",

There are a lot of such stories of people who have Bitcoin in their assets, their devices, or their inattention when saving seed phrases, as well as their inattentive attitude during transactions when the stealer is working. I believe that if you sort the stories of people who lost their Bitcoins, they will be somewhat similar. So, OP, I don't think you'll hear anything new here.For there to be fewer such stories each time, accuracy is required, as is distrust of all centralized places where they supposedly provide reliable storage.

In the early days of the crypto world, there were several online wallets that provided storage for not only Bitcoin but also several other coins, and this was often the choice because it was easier without having to download and also because of a lack of knowledge regarding the importance of private keys.It was a lesson that online wallets are not a safe place to store our Bitcoins, either for the long term or for the short term because two possibilities can happen, the account is hacked because the level of security that we use is weak or the online wallet is down due to being hacked so that all the assets of the wallet user experience the same thing and are lost without being able to be recovered because the wallet developer is not responsible.",

For me, I always try to secure my holding with a non-custodial wallet and don't connect my wallet to any untrusted sites. If I really need something and connect my wallet anywhere, I just create a new wallet and connect. I care about my private keys and seed phrases. For Bitcoin, I use a Ledger hardware wallet that is quite impossible to hack without compromising my seed phrase. Remember, don't click any popups from any sites with greedy offers.

So before connecting your wallet to any site make sure it's trusted. What I use to do is that I have a separate wallet for the connection because I do not trust any site. It is not what I do often, I have only done it two times before. I recently bought wsm, on their telegram page I asked a question and people started adding me to scam me in a way they want me to think that they are helping me with the question. Thanks for this forum, maybe I would have be scammed. Someone among them even sent me a link on telegram that is the real link to the wsm, I copied it and paste it on a word editor and checked the URL but it was a scam link.

      "body": "My story is about Ethereum, not Bitcoin, but I think it's still relevant because something very similar could happen to a person who's holding Bitcoin, especially to a newbie. It's from my early days when I was largely ignorant of the risks, wallet differences and other important matters. I bought 1 Ethereum at a very cheap price (below $20) and chose an online wallet to store it. That wallet was very popular back in the days, but it was a centralized platform, a custodial wallet. Everything was good at first, but then Ethereum rapidly grew in price, and so many got interested in withdrawing their coins to sell them for fiat. That centralized wallet platform declared that they were hacked, but that they'd do partial reimbursements of funds. I filled in my application and got 60% of my Ethereum back, which I immediately withdrew to a non-custodial wallet. In the end, taking into account Ethereum's growth, it was still a very profitable investment for me, so I got lucky. But I never got the rest, and many people didn't get any reimbursement. The platform went silent, stopped responding to any messages, and many consider it an exit scam. I remember there was a collective action against them, a big cybercrime victim report to some US authorities. I filled in my information there as well, but it never led to anything. I think it was to the US because the owner of that online platform was a US citizen, but I'm not sure. I don't think it led to anything in the end. It's just a simple personal story of why non-custodial wallets matter, why being the sole owner of access to your funds matters. Even if a platform has a good reputation now, it doesn't mean it won't eventually perform an exit scam, mismanage funds or be a victim of a strong attack from which they won't recover.",

We have to  be careful on how we chase airdrop projects or avoid them if necessary. Some of those will require you to have a limited amount of a certain cryptocurrency in the wallet you are to use for connection to be eligible to receive the airdrop on their given date, and you're prone to a possible draining of your wallet if it's a scam project.  If you must  for such, you should always use a whole new wallet to be on the safe side if you can afford to lose the specific amount of cryptocurrency required for such airdrop eligibility if you eventually get hacked and wallet drained, you won't have to worry as you would have if it were to be your main coins holding wallet.",

Maybe OP wants to hear these stories first hand.  Not everyone shares stories of bicoin hacking in online communities. Most often, because people are ashamed to tell such stories. All the same, this is in a sense a fail, most often made by mistake of the bitcoin user himself. We (people) always willingly share success stories, but we try to keep silent about failure stories.For example, I know one such story that happened to a friend of a friend of mine and therefore not all the details are known to me. All in all, he lost several hundred dollars. After the incident, he immediately changed the laptop to an old old laptop, with the hope that this device is so old and has not been used since the Internet was clean and safe.  In this way, he wanted to avoid modern viruses, which may not be on such an old device. I don't know if it helped him in the end.If anything, I told this in confidence and the hero of my little story didn't agree that these events were reflected in OP's article.",
