What kind of currency has one-half of transactions (46%) associated with illegal activities?https://freepolicybriefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/freepolicybrief_jan212019.pdfThe reason is straightforward. Bitcoin conflates trust and honesty- its nodes lack absolute security and its users are not trustworthy, giving some benefit but preventing true larger-scale adoption while everyone applauds its greatness. Crypto complacency feeds a system where the rich and criminals consolidate wealth and the poor remain marginalized... financing terrorism, money laundering, dark web dealings and ransomware attacks. Yes the underprivileged benefit from a digital decentralized autonomous payment system and access to investment opportunities otherwise out of reach. But this falls short of a world where consistent appreciation generates massive enough wealth to end poverty, end war, cure diseases, and end mortality. A decentralized 3rd-party system of Universal Trust is necessary to protect crypto users, secure total worldwide adoption, and rescue the world from material hardship and financial slavery.Read On:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5513980.0",

During the early stages of Bitcoin, as we see, many people have taken advantage of it for illegal activities, but bitcoin was not made for illegal activities, so the situation will not remain. The fact that Bitcoin has been involved with illegal activities does not make it bad. Bad people find a way to take advantage of a good thing.",

It now depends on what you use your Bitcoin for and that's left for your conscience to judge you. This is where more stiffness and regulation come in where possible and I've always been an advocate of the regulation despite the decentralization of the coin and people's opposite view. Many users here have fiercely rebuked it but I stay firm with my disposition because we can't be in the name of freedom aiding and abating frauds and other illegality. We should balance things and I hope for a day that the name of Bitcoin will be cleaner from these perpetrators.",

But, of course, since governments created fiat, they’re not going to broadcast that info...they want to keep things under wraps. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is all about transparency, thanks to decentralization. If the percentage of illegal use in crypto goes up, don’t blame Bitcoin - blame the government. They’ve started regulating crypto, so if you’re unhappy with those numbers, it's because they’re not doing their job right.",

Many transactions in Bitcoin are, in fact, legitimate and grow year over year. Just last month, Chainalysis reported that the share of illicit Bitcoin transactions dropped significantly, at around 0.15% of all transactions in 2023, an indicator of a shift toward more lawful uses. Also, Bitcoin was engineered as a hedge to traditional financial systems that leave so many behind. Because it is decentralized, people in countries with unstable economies could preserve their wealth when local currencies fail. While there are problems, Bitcoin is also giving lots of people power by affording them financial options they never had. Again, that may not be an ideal solution in any way, but it is in its evolution and continues to play a role in financial inclusion, which isn't small.",

Unfortunately for him, he will have to carry out more of his investigation as this article right here posted by op is just full of trash. I wonder why alot of people just keep bringing up more reasons why they hate Bitcoin. If you don't like something, you let it be for others whom Understand what it is to enjoy it's benefits.
