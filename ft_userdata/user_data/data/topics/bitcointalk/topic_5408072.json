  "content": "People like to think of Bitcoin as a super-dollar and compare it to fiat, but I like to think of it as a metric ton of gold. That would mean each satoshi is the equivalent of a centagram of gold.According to the USGS (The U.S. Geological Survey), about 244,000 metric tons of gold have been mined. That is about 537,927,920 pounds of gold, so Bitcoin is already rarer than pounds. Accounting for gold on the 16 Psyche asteroid and other planets, there seems to be a never ending supply. Do you think this would make Bitcoin more precious than a metric ton of gold, especially considering it cannot be confiscated and travels at the speed of light?",

They would simply buy more Bitcoin after they sell some of that gold. That's because the market value is determined by supply and demand. And right now the marketcap of gold is way higher than marketcap of Bitcoin, so gold is more valuable than Bitcoin.",

Your statement doesn't make any sense! Gold and bitcoin are inherently different asset class and must not be compared to each other. Bitcoin has a different group of takers which is very different than gold. It may be possible that bitcoin may break the price barrier of Gold, but that doesn't prove anything. Bitcoin is an investment asset for the high risk profile investors and for gold, it is usually the risk averse people. Both are very different and it doesn't mean anything at all if bitcoin's price suppress the price of gold.",

If I was offered the amount of gold that is worth the same in dollars as one Bitcoin, I'd undoubtedly take Bitcoin. But if we take 1 BTC vs tens of millions of dollars worth of gold, then gold in he obvious choice. You can't equate Bitcoin and its denominations with grams or tonnes. Weight and number are two quite different things. Overall, I think Bitcoin is way more practical and has more prospects than gold, but gold is way more stable in terms of value.",
