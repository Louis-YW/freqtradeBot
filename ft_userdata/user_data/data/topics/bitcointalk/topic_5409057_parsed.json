But if there is no analysis/proof how does Rollbit get away calling itself \"The Most Rewarding Cryptocasino\". Just fluff and marketing with no proof? They do give back a lot but just wondering if anyone has verified that in fact their rakeback, rollback, etc is truly greater than the daily, weekly, monthly etc that other casinos offer.",

Rollbit has its own player base and they could give more in one area, but not in the other.Likewise, there's a gambler here that gives his own honest takes on casinos he's played on. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335097.0Could check his list and see which one suits your fancy. His review on our 500 Casino is pretty positive if you're interested",

You should take that out of your equation.If it's above 94% then it's good. 94 or 98 won't make any difference to you. You won't experience a return equal to advertised RTP unless you play it a million times.And RTP is deceiving in a few slot games. For example, if a game has progressive jackpot then its true RTP will be waaaay less than advertised RTP. You should focus on volatility. Play low risk slots",

What's the point of someone losing 1 million dollars every month and having a VIP account that gives you 100$ every month and a weekly bonus of 10$? Wouldn't it be better for the person to focus on winning and making a profit?",

It is one thing to display 99% RTP on the website in text, but a whole other story when you actually play it.  In any way, most of the casinos with a slightly better RTP, will offer you better reward options or a better rakeback percentage or a good support team, because they have the extra money to fund it.
