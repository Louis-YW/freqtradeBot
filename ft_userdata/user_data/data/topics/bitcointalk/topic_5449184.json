Maybe some of you have noticed that we are quite active on the forum, trying our best to offer bitcointalk gamblers interesting promotions. We at MegaPari got used to a format of a lottery - we ask players to fulfill certain requirements and collect their IDs in order to pick winners for rewards.First they were some bonus offerings, now we are also giving away \"physical prizes\" - a luxurious vacation or even a Lamborghini crossover. (details in our ANN thread, btw).But here what concerns me - I think we need to move to a more engaging way of communicating with the audience while  running such campaigns.",

Your post may have violated some rules of the forum which might be the reason for the lock. I have also seen threads like this in which the moderator suddenly comes online and gives answers to questions. So you might fortunate to attract the attention of a moderator because I am sure they visit Meta often. Or you can use the personal message option like LoyceV suggested.

That is why it is advisable to use the search option before creating a new thread to avoid duplication. But we are just speculating there might be other reasons why such action was taken regarding the thread.",

You're right because this may actually be part of the reasons why his post was locked, there could be many other reasons associated while sometimes they delete a post or move to topic base on how they see the necessity, this is their role and we cannot question them for acting appropriately, instead we should be more careful from allowing a reoccurrence later in future, we also have the right to lock our created thread as we pleases aside the moderator doing that while theirs is most likely irreversible.",

If we talk specifically about the Gambling section, all the more reason to do so. Yes I agree with that but there should be an exception like the boxing discussion it's hard to lock it when the fight is not yet occurred because when it comes to this kind of sport there are a lot of new updates and changes coming in before the actual fight, there's a lot of contradiction and debate before the fight, but going back to the topic mods is right in locking it, the topic becomes redundant, OP should have created a poll so even those who don't want to post can cast their vote.",
