However, the implementation of SegWit allows for more transaction capacity by separating some of the transaction data. This has helped alleviate some congestion on the network.I thought this stood true:QuoteA 300-byte transaction is 300 bytes on-disk and over-the-wire. Segwit just counts those bytes differently toward the maximum block size of 4M weight units.If not, someone would have to correct the bitcoin wiki itself here:https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units#Misconceptions",

For signature campaign payment this might also become a problem if this goes on.A manager will think twice to push a transaction to 30+ recipients if it takes too long to confirm because of sudden fee rise, this might become costly at some point.",

Nobody cares about your opinion on whether or not ordinals are NFTs. Besides, we are not discussing the validity of science-based theories, we are talking about what words mean to the people who use them.Let's look at the words themselves:✔️ Non-fungible: yes, ordinals are non-fungible as they are individual units of account.✔️ Token: as applied to cryptocurrency, yes, they are distinguishable, named units or subsets that reside inside of a blockchain and can be transferred from one owner to another.I think the main problem is your understanding of NFTs is limited. Even in the face of a decade of mounting evidence that you often have little knowledge of what you're talking about, you remain overly self-assured with what little knowledge you actually possess, which is why nobody takes you seriously.Fungible tokens are even referred to as NFTs, as are Namecoin names, which are non-fungible but not really tokens.
