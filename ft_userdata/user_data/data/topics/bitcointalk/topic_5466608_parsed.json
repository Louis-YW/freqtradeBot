I am less active here and I think my spendable merits will expire soon. In this case, you have to apply wisdom, don't just go and dump merits anyhow. I don't see a good reason to merit at other people's requested merit thread, do yours in your own way.If you are reading posts often, you will definitely see quality posts that fit your interests. By this, you can be meriting them regularly as they come your way. It's random that way and it's the best I would suggest. Also, going to sections like trading and speculation and other sections that are often under-merited might be a good idea that will make an impact too.Lastly, you might also want to open a new thread in the Beginners & Help section (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=39.0) to ask for people to submit their highest-quality posts. It might be 2 of their best posts each to be merited by you. It will be fresh in this case, benefit more accounts and will save you time as well.",

I see this as very arrogant as if there are few topics and posts on the forum where you can reward someone without seeming to be doing a favor. When I see such topics, I always want to ask whether your posts for which someone gave you merit are so valuable, and whether are they better than all others?",

The next thing he'd go for is applying to be a merit source..  hehehe, that's me going too far, I know.Some of these guys feel they need to instate their importance and give themselves some form of credit as the forum is not giving them that. This act is not arrogant but a childish way to seek attention and I'm not annoyed, I'm just disappointed that he wasn't creative enough.",

Good offer, although if you follow his activity in the Indian local section, you will see that he was last there in 2018. https://ninjastic.space/search?author=krishnaverma&board=89In addition, the OP is too narcissistic and once wanted to give away his merits, but in the end, he did not deign to bestow his favor on many. Quote from: krishnaverma on February 23, 2018, 05:38:41 AMChecked posts of all members who posted above and none qualify. Do not give up, keep trying. You will certainly improve if you have a positive attitude.but successfully assessed plagiarismQuote from: marlboroza on February 02, 2018, 11:45:36 PMWhy are you giving merit for plagiarism?And now he asks that we take his posts into account. I took the time to look at his profile, and I think either the OP is not the real owner or he has some serious memory lapses regarding the merit information. He, like no one else, explained all the subtleties of the topic louder than anyone else, but in the end, we see another stupid topic. Quote from: krishnaverma on September 13, 2023, 06:51:37 AMIs there a way to know how many spendable merits are going to expire soon ?¬† If not, it should be included in profile if possible. Quote from: krishnaverma on January 25, 2018, 09:53:47 AMQuote from: zenrol28 on January 25, 2018, 09:51:11 AMThe merit system got implemented like 10 hours ago. So expect different kinds of reactions. Either negative or positive, those reactions will add to the improvements of this system.We will see how it goes for the coming days.How about giving incentives to an active member who is always giving his / her sMerits to quality posts. Like +1 Merit for every 50 sMerits given. So a member will not only make quality posts, he / she will also read and give sMerits to those who deserve it.That will be very difficult to track for moderators. So far as giving Smerits is concerned, there is no point in storing the. It is mentioned that they may be nullified if not used for long term. Although not even the only one. Quote from: Sandra_hakeem on June 21, 2023, 09:53:51 PMQuote from: lovesmayfamilis on June 21, 2023, 08:33:14 AMPretty funny situation. After reading all the posts, I got the impression that the OP just decided to draw attention to himself, not at all thinking that people could easily check if the password was previously changed or not. Topic from the category \"just to write something\"But the situation now is that the OP has created even more fuss with his account, and people are demanding that he prove if the OP is the real owner or if the cheater is trying to protect himself from future claims.As a result, always think about what you write about; sometimes innocent stupidity can lead to serious consequences. Exactly!! The same thoughts was risen in me... the reasons?? I'm yet to know.Was that account an active account before the passcode got resetted? Cus I haven't been seeing that name around very often.Maybe OP didn't just wanna seek attention; he also wanted to make publicized the fact that his passcode has been changed, so peeps won't even bother using it against him when they get to realize that for themselves....so he decided to frame a fake story to convince the community beforehand - but, HTF is it even possible to deceive a whole community of gurus like this?...lolSo he finally came, on his own - without being interrogated - to report his ignorance on how passcodes are being managed.... I believe if that's the real owner behind the OP, then he shouldn't be creating lame stories like this.. now answer this; WHO TF HAS AN ACCESS TO YOUR BTT ACCOUNT AND YOUR EMAIL TOO TO HAVE CHANGED YOUR PASSCODE 2 GOOD TIMES BEFORE NOW ??Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
