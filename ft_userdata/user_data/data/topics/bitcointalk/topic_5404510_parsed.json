Can't say as I don't follow, I'd be coughing blood to buy 0.48 BTC hahaHere's one chart I found from here. You're right that out of all the buys it's pretty insignificant, looks like another \"loose change\" buy, roughly 10% of quarterly earnings. His strategy isn't really DCA in the context of buying the same amount each time, it's simply based on buying as much as possible. In this case, just a bit of revenue by looks of it. Otherwise known as a \"hopium\" buy looking at similar small purchases.",

But hope give good impact with added 480 bitcoins as investment assets because many people and new company will trust allowed what did by MicroStrategy. Right now just brave company and people want to re invest with bitcoin after price drop drastically from $30,000 become $20,000 on this post created. Will bitcoin back later to higher price and make MicroStrategy reach much profit with bitcoin investment? or have another bad thing with bitcoin will back drop again to lower price.",

His buying is very stupid as per the norms of an institution.Won't lie, I have some better buying's as an Individual than his whole org. I wish I had enough money lol.Not really. He bought consolidation, dips, rallies and tops. He bought it all. He's not buying for price increase this year or next, but for the next decade. If you notice MSTR bought 69K (over half) between $10K and $22K. Apart from a dodgy 19.5K buy above $50K, in 2021 with price above $50K he only bought small increments. Late 2021 he bought 13.5K more, which was probably a bit too optimistic, but as was the market.The fact that he's currently underwater with an average of $30K while price is undervalued I very much doubt is a concern for him. It's like having an average of $6K in 2018 or 2019 before price drops in half twice after. In the long-term, multi-year time-frame, having a average of $6K was/is pretty decent. Notice that MSTR has been buying Bitcoin for almost two years (since August 2020). The 2 Year MA is around $37K, so he's actually outperformed DCA considerably.",
