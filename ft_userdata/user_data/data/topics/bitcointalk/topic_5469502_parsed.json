Many people are scared of Bitcoin because of volatility... their fears is justified. By the time we have institutional investors getting heavily invested in Bitcoin, the liquidity will be huge such that it becomes difficult for few buys or dumps to drastically cause price fluctuations. For a coin with low liquidity, a single buy or sell of less than $1000 can alter the price significantly and this is not healthy. So, just like you have already stated, institutional investors is good for Bitcoin and until we have more of it, mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and Bitcoin becoming a legal tender in many jurisdictions, will continue to linger.",

They can also help to legitimize Bitcoin and make it more mainstream.what you think about this as a crypto guy ?  Institutional investors are already here, you may like it or not.They are basically looking for long term investments and thinking in bitcoin like a digital gold, a commodity. I don't think that  is bad, neither that it wasn't predicted long agoHal Finney mentioned banks coming to bitcoin long ago, acting as a second layer Quote from: Hal on December 30, 2010, 01:38:40 AMActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the \"high-powered money\" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211",

As for liquidity, those institutional investors only trade in centralized exchanges, the liquidity in CEX is already very high and you don't need to wait the buyer or sell. We need a liquidity in decentralized exchange or no KYC P2P, but I already know they will not trade here due to so called fighting against anti money laundering.",

They can also help to legitimize Bitcoin and make it more mainstream.what you think about this as a crypto guy ?  Bitcoin is not crypto.When large and small institutions are interested in investing in Bitcoin, the impact can be significant. Because the level of institutional trust means that the money they put in has agreed on the future of Bitcoin and is confident that it will provide profits in the future. A class of companies will not be careless in investing their money, so when they choose Bitcoin it means they have done a fairly in-depth review.Try to set aside the volatility. Regardless of the level of volatility, I think large investors already know the risks of playing or investing in assets with high volatility. So I think the institutional view of Bitcoin as an asset with a limited supply will decrease in value and the level of scarcity will drive the price higher. Gold can be added and never ends, Fiat can be printed but Bitcoin cannot be duplicated in any way. That is the strong reason why institutions are now starting to pay attention to Bitcoin as a viable hedge asset.",

We might actually be saying the same thing as I do not notice any difference between your narration and examples from mine. The involvement of institutional investors will bring some form of stability and liquidity in a way that one person selling will not have devastating impact on the price like we notice in the case of Tesla. The more the institutional cashflow Bitcoin enjoys, the less the chances of price fluctuations and market manipulation.",

These institutions are the reasons when there's a bad news, they're the ones to quickly spread it through FUD that they say. Although they can really help to legalize Bitcoin into a country but there's no need for that. I know that there's a big impact for the adoption and price of it but it's just going to break what the purpose that it's been serving for the long time and that's about decentralization. The very impact that they can give to people is about introducing it. Most people don't want to believe anymore with such magic internet money as they say because of the proliferation of internet scams, so that's how they'll get in.",

When that time happens, it would be hard for most of the people to have short term investment to Bitcoin since the market is stable and has less volatility. It might be a good thing as it could be a used digital currency worldwide but the investors and the traders wouldn't be happy with this one since volatility is one of the factor for them to have profits as they take advantage to it. But for sure mass adoption to Bitcoin would literally took years cause despite the technology and mass media, there's still few people acknowledging the potential and benefits of Bitcoin.",

So in terms of stability, I don't think they make a difference.

More global adoption does us more good in everyway because we get to get more opportunities to not only Invest in Bitcoin but spend our wealth globally without having to convert it first to fiats.

The main reason if instability is that there is no approximation of how much Bitcoin should really be worth. So when it goes up or down by 10-20%, the market doesn't know if it's a good opportunity to buy/sell, or if the movement was justified. If institutions merely hold Bitcoin and don't actively trade it in a way that would stabilize the price, then they would have no effect.
