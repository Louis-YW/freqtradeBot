Compare to number of nodes, bitcoin has the highest in numbers and is in PoW in concept compare to PoS which most new tokens are now in use. They should learn more on bitcoin instead.",

People debate that mining pools are controlled by few pools that pose 51% attack on the network which raise concern about decentralisation but in reality miners act at the interest of network even when they had over the required to do such attack.",

Like many other investors, I also regularly follow market news but I don't see any projects claiming that they are more decentralized than bitcoin or better than bitcoin. At least you should tell us which project you are referring to instead of being so vague.",

Because why they keep on using bitcoin's name as for its technology, blockchain, features, etc. etc. It's because the popularity is already in there and they're trying to fetch some from it instead of working just alone and for their own sake.",

Since the inception of bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies have tried to compare themselves with bitcoin and always want to have an edge over them but all proves abortive and bitcoin continues to stand undefeated and untouchable when it comes to decentralization as a whole. So don’t waste your time on these projects that are showcasing and trying to compare themselves with bitcoin, they are just waste of time in my opinion and should be avoided.",

But when BTC doesn't have a company that regulators could attack to, it's isn't centralized around it either, unlike some altcoins, or even worse, altcoins with private source code.",

Everyone is trying to imitate the original and failing because there will be nothing like bitcoin or at least not in the next few years.The thing is those projects who claim to be the next bitcoin or to be better than bitcoin most likely did not even spent that much time developing their project.

Moat new projects which are altcoin said that they are decentralized but alloted a lot of tokens to team so this is quite a buzz for decentralization. Honestly no one can match bitcoin on that aspect maybe there are some projects but cant match bitcoin. There are some with no team alloc like memecoin but theres no pure utility there o why compare.",
