  "content": "Can you make more money participating in bounties or airdrops? I made the most money doing airdops so far, like the one from Uniswap, but long term, I think bounties like the one from candlelabsdotorg will pay off better. What do you think? Which of these methods of earning free crypto should I pursue? The candle labs bounty program involves following them on social media and beta testing their DEX, which is quite easy. Sometimes the tasks involved to receive airdrops, like the one coming up from Metamask, are actually more complicated and costly than bounties.",

A person who participates only in bounties and airdrops, and surprisingly receives a good income in our time, wants to advance only along this line. From here we see his rank, although if he wanted to, he could have had much more a long time ago. This is standard behavior for a bounty hunter.Quote from: 2stout on June 21, 2022, 04:06:28 AMAlso depends on how much privacy you are willing to trade off.  I would say you’re better off going with bounties as the airdrops over the years are requiring more and more info, some even request or require the rather invasive KYC which seems quite a bit much.If we talk about KYC, then I am sure that such old-timers with 5 years of experience or more, who have experience in participating in bounties, simply buy other people's documents on other forums. Today this service is very cheap. They don't care about moral issues.",

During the time I joined airdrops and bounties, I earn more money in bounties than airdrops. I earn about $2 - $10 per airdrop where in bounties I earn a total of $129 (duration - about 2 - 3 months). As of now, I don't think I can earn an amount like that and to tell you honestly, I know a friend who joined a bounty campaign then after the bounty ends he only earn around $18 - $20 for about 4 - 7 weeks. Would you still join bounties?.",

The strict requirements for the airdrop was a must these days. People do know how airdrop was playing on and the only thing that can be done is creating various requirements to be eligible for the airdrop. I guess if you are joining on various airdrop and these airdrops had different requrements. that makes it become even more complicated than bounties but getting a real job is the best way.

The only one I ever did, Candle Chain, payed out 25k CNDL and didn't require KYC. I'm hearing that other bounty programs either don't pay out at the end or require KYC before you can claim your rewards. Some people have been waiting years to receive their bounties and never got them. They essentially worked for free and got scammed. I would agree 100% with the other poster that said to learn how to do something like blogs to make money but at the same time, I did get a lot of money from some airdrops in the past, like 1inch, so I think there is an opportunity there. For example, if I lived in Turkey, just one 1inch type airdrop per year would be enough money to cover my living expenses, so I do think it is worth the effort.",

Why waste time on shitcoin bounties where you can earn bitcoin from signature campaigns. I really dont get the point of the craze behind Bounties or Airdrops in this generation where altcoins are no longer the get-rich-quick thing that they had started as.Besides giving your KYC to something like an anonymous group preparing a shady bounty only means getting your email spammed with malicious links and possible identity theft. What you get in return is a bunch of coins that will be of zero value in the coming few months when you are ready to sell them.Probably the only obstacle I can confirm here is having a high ranked account, but we all start from zero and grow on it - so every newbie needs to go through the grind. If you have skills there are freelancing opportunities too.",

I think both of them are a waste of your time honestly, i can only advice you to make better use of your time in the forum and on the network, Airdrops were quite popular before, and then they could give you something, though little, but now many of them are scams that more or less want to steal your personal data and info for little or nothing in the end. Bounties are quite similar and one of the major cause of spam in this forum, mind you that there is nothing long term about bounties, quite a lot of them do not pay and if you are active here you'd see their participants always complaining of breach of contract (no payment in the end), so you'd also be wasting your time if you take up bounties as something you want to do. What should you do? Learn about Bitcoin, that is the advice every reputable user would give you in this forum, learning about Bitcoin will help you to earn in the long run, or if you are really skilled in something, you could advertise it and see if users will be interested.",

Of course the one that you have mentioned from Uniswap was a whole different story but that was also not a \"normal\" airdrop i would say because they gave away tokens to everyone that used their platform before and i know that some people got a huge amount of money that way which is absolutely crazy. The reason why that airdrop had so much value for the individual was, that no one knew that a airdrop was coming otherwise thousands and thousands of airdrop hunters would have also participated and would have brought the token price down immediately after the distribution of the tokens.In general i think you can make more money with bounty campaigns, even though it is hard to find a good one.",
