  "content": "Hi everyone,I have recently been interested about cryptocurrencies and its applications and started reading about DeFi today. In order to establish a credit type system without a centralized authority, we need to ensure that the person who is borrowing crypto from a particular lender (both of whose real world identity is unknown), honestly provides money back with the interest rate. In a centralized system this is ensured through collateral and if the person doesn't repay the loan he is punished by the existing centralized financial and legal institutions. I was wondering how this system is implemented in the case of DeFi as when basing the DeFi application over a cryptocurrency protocol, the protocol only ensures whether the lender to borrower transaction is valid and verifies it but doesn't tell anything about whether the borrower will pay back or not. How are we ensuring that the borrower does indeed pay back?",

How are we ensuring that the borrower does indeed pay back?Existing loan services share data with financial networks (credit chex) to compile a credit score representing loan risk for individuals. This credit score number determines the interest rate and terms of the loan.Financial institutions that offer loans partner with various firms and bureaucracy to execute loan default events like car repossession or debt collection.

In extreme cases, prison sentences can sometimes be incurred for lack of debt payment. Historically they are known as \"debtors prisons\". There was some controversy over the practice years ago around the time of the 2008 economic crisis. But to be honest, I have not heard anything at all about it in quite some time.",

      "body": "The collateral mechanism is also applied in DeFi. There is a thing called Loan to Value (LTV) where a borrower is only able to borrow some percentage amount of their collateral. If some asset prices fall and the loan value gets below the LTV threshold, it gets liquidated and there is a penalty being charged. So within Defi, collateral is a prerequisite and that is one of the ways that ensure the loan mechanism works.You can see more information regarding it at https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters, and also at https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/introduction.",

Collateral rating is usually from 130 to 150%, which means that if you want to get $1,000 in stablecoins, then you need to lock Ethereum for $1,300 in a smart contract. If the price of your collateral drops to critical values, closer to $1,000, then the smart contract will sell your collateral and the contract will be terminated.",

Again, an agreement is presented before you, so you should sign it in case your loan date is past due and you are not able to repay it. You either have to reinstate the loan for another period of time or your collateral will be taken if you are unable to repay the loan. So, in terms of Defi, the last time I took a $500 crypto loan (I can't remember correctly), I deposited $700 in Bitcoin as collateral, and before the loan request was verified, I had to agree to a term/policy that \"if Bitcoin price falls below $25,000, my collateral will be sold to cover my loan and the interest.\" (Then Bitcoin's price was still about $48k+). QuoteHow are we ensuring that the borrower does indeed pay back?Every loan (centralized or decentralized) has a collateral component, and the collateral will either compel the borrower to repay the loan or lose their collateral. A loan that doesn't only have atarched collateral is a case of P2P if perhaps the borrower and the lender have a mutual relationship.",

Something which had never been done before in crypto.Home and car loan markets were markets that crypto had never been able to penetrate due to lack of infrastructure support. It appears that could change in years to come as crypto credit chex limits the capacity of scammers and begins to rollout more reliable services.",
