If your seed phrase is on the phone and you do not have the backup anywhere else, that means you have lost your coin. Backup on phone is not safe and secure at all, the best way to backup is offline which can be on paper or steel sheet, in different locations.You can still be able to recover your email to access your coins on the gambling sites and exchanges. But never leave your coins on exchanges, all you have to do is to just backup the wallet seed phrase offline in two or three different locations",

It seems the best option that you have (like the above said) is to contact that gambling and exchange customer support and ask to freeze your account or investigate the login information if there is something like an IP address changed. For now, there's nothing you can do but just try to recover your email address or accept the possible consequences of losing your fund which can't be recoverable if your fund is in theft hands.Lesson to learn never leaves any valuable information in your phone. Encrypt your phone with high security so that if it is stolen, theft can't open it.",

I hope your efforts will be successful and I think that's why it's important to use KYC so you can verify your real identity to apply for asset freeze on binance accounts due to loss of access of account data stored on stolen phones.I have anticipated this risk for a long time even though I have not experienced this case, so I have prepared several steps to solve this problem:- every email registered on the exchange must be linked for recovery to the primary email.- never save and login your main e-mail on a phone or PC browser if it is not necessary, make sure you can remember the password because all other e-mail accounts can be recovered using the main e-mail.- must save important files on an external hard drive, including code phrases, seeds, google authenticator codes, etc.",

Maybe you have millions and a five figure amount is peanuts for you.I guess it's not, otherwise you wouldn't ask here... well, not the best argument.A mobile phone is not a very secure device, because it's easy to loose or get stolen as you now know by first hand, especially with a PIN that's in the top ten of worst choices. And your phone had basically no protection at all...You tied account recovery details (your phone number) to a device that you can easily loose or get stolen.Sorry, that's not smart at all.

If you don't succeed, perhaps you can take solace in the fact that most gamblers lose everything sooner or later...Finding a device with an IMEI device can be done with the condition that you first complain to the authorities (police) to request a loss letter for the device used with some important data that is really needed.Then the police will have the authority to carry out tracking with the help of cellular operators who will trace the last location of the cell phone.But in fact, at this time, it is not easy to do this tracking, there will be several parties that must be involved and it is not that easy for operators to accept and track.But the problem is, if the cellphone is stolen and the data is reset, the search effort will be in vain because the data must have been lost. There are many methods that can be done to reset data, especially on Android devices, and for iPhone devices, some iPhones with lower iOS versions will be easier to break into their security.It's very sad when someone loses a device that contains a crypto wallet with thousands of dollars but no backup whatsoever.",
