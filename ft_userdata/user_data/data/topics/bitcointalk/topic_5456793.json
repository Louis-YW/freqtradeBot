Easy... They don't want you to know about their stash. It is never a good thing. Maybe you mean no hard to him but you are definitely going to talk about his wealth and some other people with bad intentions might wanna hurt him. Your friend was wise to hide this information from you and other people. I am saying \"was\" here because obviously he isn't a wise guy anymore because you know his involvement with crypto now. Rich wise people don't show off with their wealth. Doing that will only bring trouble.",

You dont need to feel that way after all Bitcoin is all about privacy and may be ypu should learn that too, not to be overly open and vocal about your bitcoin involvement and the question is that have tou ever try to jntroduce him to the forum or he just an investor?QuoteToday I get to know from a relative of his, who thought that we are into Bitcoin investment together, a coincidence that brings up some suspicious thought, now I am left with thoughts of why he was hiding this all along from me?

We live in a very dangerous world where your best friend can harm you. I heard a story of a guy who was having a good time with his friends at a bar bragged about his crypto investment. Few weeks later, armed rubbers paid him a visit at his home. After beating him for a while they asked him to transfer his crypto assets to an address they provided or they would kill him. Now... Do you need a soothsayer to tell you that one of his friends was responsible for the rubbery? No you don't. So don't take it personal if your friend choosed to be discreet with his bitcoin investment, I believe he has a very good reason for doing so which could possibly be security.",

Well after 1.5 years, like the previous month, i came to know that he was involved in crypto at that time and he was running ads for getting students to teach them about crypto the previous month. So i was like, why would he not share it with me, well then i gave up my thoughts because either we have spent 1 or 2 weeks together i have no right to ask him neither you have any right if your relative or friend wants to hide that information from you it must be due to something.We all have that kind of friend who never wants to share their success with you, which sadly indicates that they are not true friends so tret them like they tret you and do not sadden your heart. Keep growing and never thought to become like your friend because your nature makes you real, so keep growing and keep that spirit up of teaching others. Because this will make you more educated and that is more important than in being a competition against your friend in terms of knowledge in crypto.",

However, the reason why your friend chose to hide this information from you remains known only to him. It is possible that he did so to safeguard his privacy. By not disclosing his holdings to you, he avoids the risk of you inadvertently sharing that information with others, potentially exposing his financial situation to a wider audience. Similarly, I personally engage in Bitcoin discussions with my friends but refrain from revealing my own holdings. This approach is driven by a desire to prioritize my privacy and ensure my safety, rather than any other motive.",
