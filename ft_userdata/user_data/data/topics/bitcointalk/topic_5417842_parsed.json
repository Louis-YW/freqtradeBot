      "body": "In all things you're scaring children at a day care center. A daycare, caring for someone else's child and the responsibilities fall into not having fear.This goes beyond bullying and frightening children. Some of these kids are traumatized and the parents will require training on how to cope with their childs aftermath and find a new daycare provider. Definitely, they all should be charged, fined and taken their license so that they not work for caring for children. To be accountable for their behavior is absolutely the right thing to do.",
