That's pretty much the same like a forking version from twitter. Calling it as decentralized and permisionless was actually BS.Quote from: yusrime on November 29, 2022, 02:01:32 PM Founder is Yoginth & patnership with reputed organizations.What organizations? I don't see any interesting organization partnered with it. Are you still taking partnership as something useful here? Quote from: yusrime on November 29, 2022, 02:01:32 PMDo you have lens account & how is the experience.What do you think about that project future please share here.Bunch of social media that based on crypto already developed, this one was also pretty similar with twitter. lol. They must be more creative. Is there something special from lens?i saw none.",

Can't find any documentation in regards to Lenster partnerships though but I get it's best to try a new one social media, besides, GitHub seems to have nice activity.",

Is it some kind of social media that only acts as a means of information about your personal data? what for? does it have a function on top of a platform policy that is just trying to be considered decentralized?I wasn't too interested and indeed the concept was not very clear and we didn't even know who Yoginth was.",

But have we seen a web3 social media project that is going well? I think not yet. In fact, I know of a project whose development stage has not yet been completed, let's call it Solcial, LOL.",

But the fact that in the height of the ICOs, there have been projects like this that claimed they're decentralized social media but none of them went far and I've not seen any of them that are still in existence as of today.You'll get to have the idea that not every project that attaches \"decentralized\" to their tagline is near perfection and success. Investors are wiser this time and the market is getting more experience from past events. Although, there are more newbies too that are curious to know more about these projects that they have seen for the first time.",

The Main post was repeated x times the number of replies so it's a REALLY big loop unless ofc it's not it and I'm just mistaken, which just proves my initial point which says that the people there are just shills. Seems like they're new but honestly, nothing so far has been very productive in helping decentralized social media, if there ever actually would be one, so I don't think this would differ.",

I think their page is fine, almost same with Twitter and has connect functiom when signing in via some non custodial wallets. However, I dont think this will create some threat on social media like Twitter. What I was wondering is this kind of sequence might happened on Twitter but still to early to adapt that rather than use the idea of it being implemented on Twitter.",
