Signature campaigns will pay for posts in some areas and not in other areas.I make lots of signatures and I am always well past what I need to be but if you are in a campaign that does not pay for alt coin posts this move cost you as it now resides in alt coins.I also simply don't understand if a mod moved it or if the op moved it. Lastly I do no see why it is in alt coins and not btc.What am I missing as to why it was placed here.Could there have been 2 or 3 or 4 other posts in it that very very heavy alt coin based. As I do not see them if they were there.",

      "body": "In my view, if a poster later realizes their post was posted in a section that wasn't appropriate, it's not their responsibility if those that responded didn't notice while it was in the 1st board. And hence shouldn't be liable for simply moving their own thread to the appropriate section, or making a mistake initially (we're all human, shit happens). Those wearing a signature are the ones that should be careful making responses in the appropriate section, and that includes reading the contents of the post thoroughly as well as reviewing the section.Well, in this case though, it does indeed seem as if the topic was moved to the wrong section indeed. Perhaps the intended goal was the speculation board under bitcoin discussion, and not under the altcoins section. Bitcointalk gets a little confusing for having so many otherwise identical sections mirrored between bitcoin/altcoin discussions.",

Yeah I need 40 posts a week and I am over 100 for the week. As I always posted a lot and it never was a big issue to write a lot of info on the internet. The thread he did was very much in tune with my '2015-2017 pattern Is matching current 2023-?  pattern thread.' It is why I read it and realized it was moved around quite weirdly.

It is very likely that the OP is responsible for moving the topic.Thanks for the short and accurate go-through. I don't know why the OP would move this topic around that much; maybe he was playing around with the \"move\" button and wanted to see how many times in 1 minute or in some specific time we can move a topic. He might not be aware of the forum rules, as according to the above members, he has been banned due to plagiarism, which is the biggest sin here.Anyway, I think this topic should be moved back to the place where it belongs in the BTC discussion because this topic has nothing to do with the ALTs or even with speculation, but it is also ok if it is moved to the speculation section either.Thanks for noticing this thread, dear OP. If it were not for you, then maybe this would not be captured, as most of the topics here are new and come in front of me. I can judge after reading it that either it will stay here or not.",

We are met on a great battle field of that war. We come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow, this ground The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.It is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"as my work yeah its quality, but its not mine it is  president Lincoln's Gettysburg addressThat thread was was a quality thread with a good point. but it appears he did plagiarize on another thread.",

I tried to say that when an OP moved the topic his name was written in the name place of \"OP\" and this all I was talking about was in the Telegram notification bot, I also added a picture for easiness. And when the Moderator moved the post, his (moderator's) name was written in the \"OP\" name place position. Even if Cyrus is known by all as a popular moderator but in my opinion it does not matter whether he is popular or not the thing that matters here is moderation rank, if he is a moderator his name will be replaced by the real OP's name otherwise not.",
