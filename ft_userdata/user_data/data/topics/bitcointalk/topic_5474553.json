Whenever a client send payment upfront for a campaign, the coins are stored in that 2 of 2 Multi-Sig bitcoin wallet. So chances of losing the funds are slim. Besides, I have enough bitcoin in my possessions stored in the cold storage to cover any loss of fund from the escrow address. Your funds are safe and secure in my possession.",
