Holding during this period and wait for the next bull run would be great. Some people will trade and lose, trading is risky. Even if anyone wants to trade, the person should use little amount of money. Anyone that wait until bear market and invest, holding is enough for the person, but it requires high amount of money.All I am saying is that not everyone can trade. Some people can trade and lose instead.",

But that doesn't stop me from doing other things and strategies in trading.It just so happen that holding is a better passive strategy and all you have to do is to keep on adding more bitcoins if you can.",

      "body": "HODLing may not really be enough, but it is definitely the easiest and safest way to keep your portfolio intact. The sad thing about mere HODLing is that your asset doesn't increase. That's something that is quite frustrating to many of us who won't ever be satisfied with the amount of Bitcoin that we own. If I HODL 1BTC, I'd still be having 1BTC after 5 years. This is one of the reasons why many try trading or, worse, get into staking, lending, investing, or whatever risky thing they could do with their Bitcoin in centralized platforms. In the end, instead of having 1 whole Bitcoin, they have less, or even nothing at all if they end up becoming victims to exit scams or rug pulls. There's a reason why HODLing somehow becomes a classic.",

Everyone can take once 36% profit or even more, in your case this is trade from February, but what is the average for the whole year? you confidently present a trading technique based on one successful one, some beginners may think that this is the right way so they will risk money for that.at the same time, you offer the possibility of creating wallets and swaps on your website, which runs WP with the default theme. it seems quite frivolous and much closer to attempted fraud.I can't say that there aren't some potentially useful tips on how to find an adequate pair for trading, maybe you should just stick to that.",

Holding and continuously buying in a form of DCA will make a very safe strategy to grow crypto portfolio in long term without the risk of losing crypto balance due to failed scalping and day trading.I personally preferred holding and DCA in times like this because the market is on the rock bottom and it might pump hard anytime. It’s very hard if you missed out the first huge massive pump just because you want to have a small gain on scalping.",

We should have a goal or target to increase our cryptocurrency portfolio. You said it all, both trading and hodling requires some level of skills, though that of trading is more challenging than hodling. For traders they need to know the chart movements, they need to be sensitive to the fundamentals, they need to have worrking strategies and tools and they also know the possible bottom to buy and where to take profit.While the above steps are hard to master, a hodler doesn't have much stress to pass through. All a hodler knows is to hodl the right coin and then be patient over along time. But, there is one important skill, which is to know when to sell. You don't hodl for life. You don't hodl at $70k and hodl at $18k and keep hodling when bitcoin is making its cyclical movements.",

(On a $20 000 bitcoin price it is $150 per transaction when it is 0.75% transaction fees) You also do not want to keep your bitcoins on the Exchange, so you withdraw and deposit the coins for the trades and they charge you for that on some Exchanges too.
