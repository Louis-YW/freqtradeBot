You can read the details here if you are interested. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409934.new#new I filed a complaint on several sites, like GURU and AskGamblers, but none of them gave any results. However, I don't want to give up, as casino representatives behave dishonestly towards me. I want to try to file a complaint against the license provider. In other threads with fraud accusations, I have seen similar advice. Could you help me with this? Tell me how to do it correctly. I will be very grateful for any advice and details.

It might be more prudent to seek help from a lawyer or at least warn them about the lawyers incoming lawsuit action. If they don't start sweating with a warning then the moment they get your lawyers letter, they might take things more seriously. A lot of unprofessional online gambling casinos think they can get away with not paying up or prolonging the cash out. It's very unethical but a practice which is becoming common, unfortunately.Good luck to you, hope you get your winnings",

This is what can be said if it's your opinion dude, You mentioned in the other thread section that you have proof of evidence that what you say is true, can you show it here in the screenshot that proves that you have 16k plus dogecoin?Then I also read something that one of the members here in the forum said that since 2019 the Mbit casino is no longer active and the last time it opened was 2020 if I'm not mistaken. Can you also show that your account was blocked by them? it is not clear why the verification of your identity was denied.",

Why all these crazy requirements in the name of KYC verification?The thread is about CloudBet casino that asked one of their users for KYC verification with a street selfie. Really, that was the first time I've heard of KYC with a selfie in front of a building name or street name sign. As if taking selfies and holding ID cards and today's newspaper isn't enough. This is certainly becoming more of a hassle and it seems to me that some casinos are using excessive KYC verification as a method to default on payouts. I hope it doesn't become a trend.",

They said that they did not commit fraud and followed the wishes of the casino. But still, in the end, the casinos block their accounts and refuse to process money withdrawals from their users. We also can't do anything if it happens to us because they are more powerful than us and can do anything to our account.This is a valuable lesson for us and we also get lessons like this from other gamblers with almost the same problems we face. Maybe we can just let it go instead of making it difficult for ourselves because I'm also not sure if we can get that money without using other money to get justice. Because if we want to hire a lawyer, it also costs money that can sometimes be greater than the money we want to withdraw.",
