      "body": "Another big lesson indeed! Well, thank goodness that I already know BTT, I would have been a victim of such as close as early last year. It's so bad to hold one's crypto in any centralized/custodial exchange/wallet, this is part of the repercussions. For those looking for trusted wallets, @theymos advice here will do a lot of good: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5421039.msg61293646#msg61293646And for clarity, this (Wyre) is not an exchange but a payment platform, it's clearly stated in the article. Can you imagine having $20,000 in such a payment platform and waking up to the news as shown in the image below:It's just yesterday's event, so new. This is a company that was founded in 2013 and has built the trust of many, only to swindle them with their money when perhaps the amount to gain through it is now much. This is preposterous, unfortunately, such would continue to happen unabated. And see what I found on Google while inquiring about the Wyre company with some search words.The company has processed over $1 billion as of October 2020, how much more thereafter?This is why I like to advocate for more regulation of cryptocurrency, particularly the centralised ones so that anyone would not just cheat people under any guise and go away with it.",

They should call it a bail-in, that's what banks would do.This is a really strange decision, especially since the platform will officially stop working after offering to buy it from the Bolt platform, as most reports indicate. On the other hand, the decision seems somewhat absurd because the procedure applies to the rate of daily withdrawals, meaning that the user can withdraw 90 percent of his savings, then within the next 24 hours withdraw another 90 percent of the remaining amount, and so on until there is nothing left. But the situation will be more complicated if the daily withdrawal rate does not exceed a certain limit, meaning if you have 5 bitcoins and the daily withdrawal limit is 1 bitcoin, you will be able to withdraw the full amount within about a week. This is very suspicious.",

If I am one of the people who use it then I would be worried about the platform when they announced that they are modifying the withdrawal policy which in my opinion is kind of a negative review for me. 10% is indeed quite a lot if someone deposit huge amount and they can keep 10% and add all the 10% money from every customer they have then that would be a lot.",

Just imagine how much Wyre can earn from these seized funds from all of its users, so this should be alarming for all Wyre users as they are slowly stealing our funds, and this 10% will eventually grow more in the months to come.
