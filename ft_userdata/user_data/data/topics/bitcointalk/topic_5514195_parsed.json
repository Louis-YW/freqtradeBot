If Satoshi wasn't, things could've turned out very differently, with other cryptos possibly giving Bitcoin a serious competition. I can’t predict the future, but I really believe Bitcoin's success is tied to Satoshi staying in the shadows.And honestly, that’s what most forum members are saying too, Satoshi should stay anonymous.If you’re interested in reading what others have to say, or maybe even sharing your own thoughts, take some time to check out this thread.What is your message to the real Satoshi?",

Satoshi remain anonymous because he wants people to know that they are Satoshi if they they have impact in the development and progress of bitcoin. Also he wants bitcoin to be more similar to assets like gold and others because no man created them. I am not saying bitcoin is not different from gold but I hope you understand what I mean.",

Can this anonymity be considered an asset or a drawback for the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency?Knowing that Satoshi's wallet has not been assessed for a long time gives the confidence that he didn't create Bitcoin just to become rich. His anonymity also proves he wants the system to be truly decentralised. Trusting a system that runs smoothly without the identity of the creator is better because a known inventor can easily influence the product. So Satoshi's facelessness is an asset to Bitcoin.",

People become curious and so it contributed to the popularity of Bitcoin in the last 10 years or so.And with that, it become so legitimate that the price keeps on reaching new all time high every 4 years. There was even a infamous person who lay claim to be Satoshi, but obviously he was fake.To add to the mystery, even HBO produces it's own documentary and identified another person, but we all know that is not Satoshi.",

They can not request Satoshi Nakamoto to halt Bitcoin blockchain, or make a network 51% attack, whatsoever. If you understand it, you will no longer be fearful about stories of Satoshi Nakamoto.QuoteCan this anonymity be considered an asset or a drawback for the legitimacy of the cryptocurrency?If there is anything like an assset or drawback, it's for Bitcoin, not cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, as it is itself. Cryptocurrency is about altcoins, shitcoins, meme tokens, and personally I don't put them at a same level and importance of Bitcoin.",

Every time there’s news or a documentary hinting at the \"revelation of Satoshi,\" it always ends up disappointing. The whole point is just to hype people up to watch it, but it never actually reveals anything real. I mean, no one really knows who Satoshi is, and all these documentaries do is tease without delivering any real answers.",

It's one of the mysteries of why Bitcoin succeeds. If it's known that he held a million supply of Bitcoin and then they're revealed, no one would trust the project, and no one will stick to Bitcoin.But that added flavor to Bitcoin from its infancy up to this point. Their identity not being revealed has given decentralization and trust from the people. Yes, Bitcoin is all about trust by the community and the value of it relies on that. First time in history I guess or one of if there are other existing to have this trustless project that has grown in value and it's an asset. to be considered.",

I think all members of this forum are thinking based on the value and development of Bitcoin so they can give various opinions. I agree about security for him and of course for the development of Bitcoin. I imagine that if he is found out then there will be many relationships that will continue to put pressure on him. The state, the media, the community, even people as criminals. I think let him be unknown, not look like an angel who continues to be able to see the development of Bitcoin. IMO",

Bitcoin project would have been long dead, buried and forgotten if he or they were not anonymous. This forum would have been confiscated by the authorities or archived, if he or they were not anonymous. El Salvador would still be a shadow of its former self, if he or they were not anonymous. These are all my assumptions which I know are most probably what would have happened. It is because he or they are anonymous that is which we trust the bitcoin network. We have checked it out, there is no one in the person of Satoshi lording over the network. And it grants greater credence to its legitimacy.",

I know a lot of people who will want to make their self open to the world just because of how they will want people to acknowledge them for this amazing innovation.And we can not tell if is still alive or what ever reason will be best know to him so leaving things this way will be better, for the sake of everything we are thinking, is not important we should focus on how to make our investment better.",
