Omo bro this one burst my head oh, this issue of fuel is definitely making everyone stay home. But omo he touch everybody,¬† I believe that everyone needs to start controlling their movement.

Returning to the OP, everyone is doing great and we are all just hoping for the best. However, since you started the thread, I believe that you should be the one to announce the location.

Op am definitely waiting for location.This all ball down to the same thing, economic crisis, this subsidy removal will ushar in a new inflation rate that will most likely since the nation economy into another recession, the best form of storage right now is bitcoin and gold so I advice everyone to stock up their bitcoin and continue to hold until the aim is reached, so even if the domestic economy is messed up, you still have an alternative that is under. Your control.Because, the way things go, in no time the cost of basic essential needs will skyrocket and this all balls down to more hardships to the mase.",
