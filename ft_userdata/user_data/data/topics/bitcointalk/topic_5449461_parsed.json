Meanwhile, China's population is expected to decline slowly and reach 1.10 billion in 2100. However, this projection may change depending on factors such as birth rates, death rates, and migration in the two countries.[1] https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-have-29-mln-more-people-than-china-by-mid-2023-un-estimate-shows-2023-04-19/[2] https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/india-s-population-overtakes-china-to-become-world-s-biggest-analysts-estimate#xj4y7vzkgwhen we see that several countries are experiencing population decline, China and India are competing to dominate the population in their countries, but i believe that in the future this needs to be regulated in such a way that the population distribution throughout the world is evenly distributed.",

Except there is a bilateral agreement between two nations, no nation can be forced to accept immigrants to balance their population quota. Racism will be another reason why it might be difficult to facilitate the distribution of population among different nations. Most people will never want to see Africans in their neighborhood because they can't t afford to live around them.But there is population distribution going on currently. Nations like Canada, the UK, and the US always open their boundaries to immigrants to help in contributing to the workforce of the nation. Most nations use immigrants to cover up areas that have shortage of labor. The only difference is that they usually attract the best brains, rich or skillful. While those that cannot afford this immigration process have no chance of moving to these nations. But it will be ideal to have a world where there will not be restrictions on movement from one country to another. This will be possible if many nations achieve economic development.",

There should be some kind of sensitization to the rural dwellers that they don't need to be making babies that they cannot take care of and this falls in the hand of the government to implement.

Many people will relate the population effect to religious views. Some religions believe and claim that the earth is a huge place intended for humans to live in, and that there will never be a day when the world will be so crowded that it is not conducive to live in. But this is about more than just a place to live; it is about having adequate access to resources needed for survival in abundance to support the world's population.

Looks to me like some of these partnerships failed because of the cultural incompatibilities but others might speculate differently as to why. Chinese males settling in parts of Africa would be a shock.My observation are that maybe 2% of humans are 'born different' in a way that they feel uncomfortable being followers.  They might be viewed as 'freedom loving' so to speak.  In my experience, this rate seems very uniform across 'races'.Culture certainly pressures the 'fat middle' of these types of people in one direction or the other.  I would say that Asian culture generally pushes that middle toward the 'follower' expression in life ways, and not always in a very gentle manner.  On the converse is my situation as an early gen-X'er from the West Coast of the U.S. were individuality was a virtue and there was not such a selection of pre-canned identities to choose from, more people kind of had to roll-their-own identity.  Basically if you take a sample of 1000 typical Chinese born in the late 1960's and 1000 with my life history, you would end up with, say 40 naturally born non-followers in each group.  Where 30 might end up non-followers at age 50 in my group, only 10 would remain so in the Chinese group.But with 1,000,000,000 peeps, 0.5% is still a lot.  A lot more than the CCP would probably like to go up against so deftly integrating them into success or leadership positions, and/or encouraging them to leave the country, is probably the best option.A complication is that Chinese culture (if not biological wiring) puts economic success at a much higher focus.  Striking out on one's own is very common even among Chinese who are naturally followers in a lot of cases for economic reasons alone.  We see that all over the world and especially in S.E. Asia.  A good friend of mine was in this category and he called the Chinese 'the Jews of Asia.'  He also was counciled by his father that good success is more likely in out-lying regions of the host country rather than in the larger trading centers.  It had to do with competition I believe, and dynastic family lock-in is pretty universal across almost all human societies.Anyway, I do believe that there would be plenty of Chinese who have the various characteristics needed to make Africa workable.  S.E. Asia is not necessarily always super friendly to the Ethnic Chinese either.  Maybe in Africa they would tend to just drop the ethnic/cultural/intellectual supremacy baggage, focus on up-lifting everyone, and basically avoid some oft-repeated mistakes which lead to anticipatable personal dangers.  The last pogroms that I am aware of were in Malaysia in 1999 which isn't that long ago, and as far as I can tell the power dynamics between the 'native' oligarchical families and the Chinese tycoons are almost indistinguishable from country to country. I don't believe that there have ever been flat-out anti-Chinese pogroms in The Philippines, but I would note that the Chinese seem a little more integrated and not as prone to focus on 'preserving their pure bloodlines' and that sort of thing.  Doing so is begging for trouble, and well deserved trouble in my humble opinion.  Beyond that, I'd suspect that in their heart-of-hearts, most Filipinos recognize that the 'native' politicians are at least 1/2 of whatever corruption is underway, and in the case of The Philippines especially, the U.S. and Globalist powers will pick up whatever 1/2 is dropped by the ethnic Chinese tycoons.---Edit:I worked in Silicon Valley with a lot of Chinese, Indians, and generally smart people from all over the world.  It used to blow my mind that a government policy would allow a 1-in-a-million person from, say, India who had been educated at significant expense to just pack up, do great work for some ultra-fascist global entity in Si-Valley (e.g, ABC) for 20 years, get their now-American kids the best education money could buy in the new country (a LOT of money), then run out the clock in American opulence without a dime or any future benefits going to the home country.  At best they might buy their in-laws a home or something.Now I understand!  Getting rid of 'the best and the brightest' in a home country is to the leadership of said home country, as I often say, 'not a bug; it's a feature.'  If these people would stay home or return home they are, to the leadership, a liability and a threat.  At least in a general way.In trying to 'do my part' as an expat and as a dissident, I really do bend over backward to try to pick out local people who have some potential and focus my efforts on giving them the tools and opportunities to realize their potential.  It may not serve the current leadership of the country very well but I am confident that it will pay dividends to the society at large, and that is what I do care about more.",
