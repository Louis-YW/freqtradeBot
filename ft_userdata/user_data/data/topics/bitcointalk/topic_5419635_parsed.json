  "content": "Don't know how many of you are aware that I am writing Fantasy column for Sportsbet this season and keeping chat sessions weekly on ClubTalk. Anyway during the Wold Cup when club leagues are on the break I will switch to Wold Cup fantasy which brings us to this topic. Together with Steve from Sportsbet.io we decided to include bitcointalk members as much as possible in this league so this will be the main discussion topic for all things ‚ÄûWorld Cup Fantasy‚Äú. Prizes:Sportsbet has been kind enough to sponsor this league with 5000$ for the end of league rewards. This time prizes will be paid out directly from Sportsbet so funds will not be escrowed by me. I see no problem with this since Sporsbet has a name on this forum and league will be free to enter anyway.1st place: 1500 USDT2nd place: 750 USDT3rd place: 600 USDT4th place: 500 USDT5th place: 450 USDT6th place: 400 USDT7th place: 320 USDT8th place: 240 USDT9th place: 160 USDT10th place: 80 USDTHow to join:Visit official World Cup Fantasy promo page on Sportsbet site and join the leagueStep 1: Go to official World Cup Fantasy page and create your account.https://play.fifa.com/fantasy-classic/Step 2: Now you have to create your team, you can use auto pick at this moment, you have unlimited transfers until first game starts anyway, and save your team.Step 3: Visit above promo page and joinThis is discussion thread so please ask away about anything Fantasy related that comes to your mind. Good mind banter is also very welcome.",

It says right there in OP, you have to fulfill at least one of the following. Just kidding added it now for clarity, you have 2/3 so I am waiting for that PM.You can find my articles on Sporsbet under news section. I would recommend reading GW previews if you are fantasy player while GW review is mostly geared towards those that do not watch PL games.",

It'll be a nightmare to pick a team with so many good options across every position...I did not check the rules this season but if they are like in past few seasons it is much easier then Premier League Fantasy. You can make manual substitutions every day after the matches finish and even change your captain. For instance you give captain band to Neymar on day 1, he gets one point you throw him to the bench and give a captain band to someone playing on day 2.Much more forgiving then giving Cancelo captain band this week in PL, like I did",

No point in doing it anyway since I am manually adding each of you in my spreadsheet when sending the link. If you aren't in spreadsheet you will not get the reward as simple as that.Small change regarding rewards. I will be getting funds from sportsbet, probably tomorrow, so they will be escrowed. Prizes will be in BTC so I will recalculate and post exact numbers after I get the money and see how much BTC we will get for 2K.

There has been some misunderstandings so I will clear up everything with Sportsbet and then update the OP. As it looks now, that league on Sportbet will be official one and open for everybody with Sportsbet account. We may still have 2 leagues maybe, or I will just return the funds to Sportsbet or use them on some other promo. Hopefully I'll let you all know before the end of the day.In the meantime i have a Fantasy chat session on Sportsbet in couple of hours (6PM GMT) so drop by guys if you have the time.It is final now. There will be one world cup fantasy league Sponsored by Sportsbet. You can join it trough promo page on site. If I already sent you the link you are already in. No point in sending me PMs anymore, just go to promo page and join.I talked to them and they will set up some sort of form to link your fantasy and sportsbet account. Be sure to do that step before cutoff date as well.And now for the best news, this league is sponsored with 5k$ and has rewards in USDT, which is much better than initial 2k in BTC that I was promised, especially with all the blood in the streets.This will serve as discussuion thread for wold cup fantasy and there could be some extra prizes or free bets for forum people as well. I will change the OP later today when I get home.",

It is usually quite difficult to get yourself into national squad once you are on the fringe. Lots of players from Brazil left behind and disappointed with selection, that is just how it must be in country blessed with so many great players. That being said I like Firmihno way more than Richarlison but I am not the manager If you guys want a real shocker, Moutihno has been left out from Portugal selection. That one baffles me much more than Firminho.Game has just been pushed up to the net, it isn't even finished yet. Lots of players missing, understandably so since we are still getting line ups from different countries. There was always accompanying app and I expect one to be this season as well. Will probably go live in a day or two.",
