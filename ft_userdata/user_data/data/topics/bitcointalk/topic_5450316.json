  "content": "Hi. I wanted to share my new project Preturnio - a full text search engine for Bitcoin. With Preturnio you can search for text inside every OP_RETURN, Coinbase transaction and ordinal transaction since the genesis block. You can play with it over at https://preturnio.comBlock explorers can search for transactions, blocks and addresses but searching for arbitrary text is a challenge. Data is stored in the blockchain natively in hexadecimal format and not easily readable by humans. Preturnio solves this with an easy-to-use search interface. Simply enter the text you’re looking for and Preturnio will return highlighted results found in any OP_RETURN, Coinbase or Ordinal transaction. See when the data was created, which block it was confirmed in and other relevant details.You can search for anything: source code, names, quotes, brc-20 tokens – any plain text you can think of, you can find in the blockchain with Preturnio. You can also share transactions with a direct link or even a preview image. Posting to Twitter will automatically create a Twitter card.Ordinals are of course supported. Each inscription can be previewed inline or full screen. The platform support all transactions encoded with text-supported MIME types and we categorize inscriptions into two buckets – text and HTML. You can toggle to source code view with a familiar search interface to find the text you’re looking for inside the inscription payload. When you share an inscription, Preturnio will try to include a preview of the inscription whether it’s text or HTML. Once you’ve found your inscription, you can then search inside it with a familiar ‘Find’ experience to look for specific text. Naturally each search result can be verified with a single click to on one of several public block explorers as well as ordinal explorers for inscriptions. It's also easy to copy the TX ID to verify on your own node.Preturnio has also cross referenced all transactions against a published list of all known English words (more languages coming soon) so you can browse individual words stored somewhere on the blockchain. This is actually a lot of fun!Check out the https://preturnio.com/docs to learn about other search features supported. Feedback is encouraged and appreciated. Thanks for listening!",

I guess that's positive if people think it looks more professional  Regarding search results: that's good feedback. The label above the marquee says 'recent searches' when this should really be 'what are people searching for?'. It sounds like the concern here is one of privacy which is valid. I did think about a dropdown in the search text field similar to what Google does with 'recent' / 'trending' searches but I didn't think that made sense until I have a lot of search query history to work with, but I will think about how to improve this.Plans are to optimize speed and improve indexes - for example, consider the following OP_RETURN: https://preturnio.com/8bbc96506afcee124600c94dcdc85c619db96f825a2d065bccd0b3129962ed3cIf you wanted to find this transaction, you could search for the entire string or just '2565C53636AB9239157C9F7D2E97656866393A004DE00BAB742FD4F57DC66CB7' - but let's say you wanted to look for the last few characters (e.g. 4F57DC66CB7) - you won't get any results. So it would be good to add some options for more powerful searching. I also wonder if some people would find value in searching for the raw hex instead of the encoded data. Obviously the result set could be much bigger but would that be of value? I would also like to support adding search to the mempool - just trying to figure out how to do that with reliable infra. The initial index was built using my home node but now I use Quicknode for each new block. Handling the mempool would, I think, require my own node and that's actually pretty expensive to host in the cloud so trying to figure that out. I am of course open to other requests from folks who have ideas to help improve the concept. Thank you for the feedback and for spending the time to take a look at the project. I really appreciate that.",

But so many questions...Dark Mode - yeah. I'm really bad at CSS and while building the UI I found it very frustrating to continually tweak two different CSS fields but I really need to do this. Regarding the other three suggestions, can you provide some more details?1. OP_RETURN used in Bitcoin history[1]: can you be more specific here?2. So you can search for details related to a mining pool because I'm indexing coinbase transactions but the 'problem' here is performance. So let's say you wanted to find transactions with the word 'USA Pool' - you can search for that but Preturnio will find over 20,000 records and these searches are typically very slow. In fact, the word 'mined' is in my stop word list (try searching for the word 'mined' and you'll see what I mean).3. Not sure what you're referring to here - can you give some examples? Remember that Preturnio is about searching for plain text - so if you're looking for specific 'types' of transactions that don't include plain text, I'm not indexing those transactions. I hope that makes sense and answer the question but an example would be helpful....",

For reference, there are 687 results when i use keyword \"sex\".Thanks for these suggestions! Dark mode: working on it. This is a limitation of the search index engine and how it handles individual tokens. There are multiple 'strategies' to use and the one that fits most use cases looks like 'size' and 'sizze' as two different words. There's not much I can do about that without significantly changing the index configuration. I believe the solution might be to up the 'fuzzy' settings and I'll take a closer look at that - I do need to do better in terms of getting closer to a UX that folks expect from Google. That's a tough one. I actually agree with this concept but I worry that any type of messaging opining about content can put a lot of Bitcoiners off. Transparently: I am removing a bunch of 'inappropriate' words from the search marquee at the bottom (you won't see this if you're using Safari due to marquee performance issues on that platform) but if someone types in a word and that word is somewhere in the index, it will come back with results. Luckily I'm only dealing with text and not images. Additional transparency: I have a censor flag I can flip on a tx in case there is something that is clearly 'very very bad' - if I flick that switch for a tx, the encoding results won't be shown in the UI - so you'll still get a result - you just won't see the decoded text.

If $X$ is not the product of an “intelligent cause”, then it is a product of an “undirected” cause.# A Priori, the Default Position Should Be Agnosticism## Artificial Intelligence is a Program to do ScienceThere are certain areas of unclarity in the question of how science can be done.We believe that in 2023 the philosophy of science should be informed by reference to artificial intelligence.That is, artificial intelligence tools do *****science*****.However, unlike humans, in order for a computer program to do science, it has to follow a specified procedure.Thus, artificial intelligence programs force us to specify science as a procedure.When humans do science, because the “software” for doing science exists in the human’s brain, a human being doing science does not need to *******consciously******* be able to explain optimal science.Humans have been doing science since the first appearance of language.But, the ability to describe science as an algorithm dates only the 21st century.Thus, it has long been possible with **do** science, without exactly knowing what that actually means.However, when a computer does science, because it is following a specific program, either the equations implemented in the program work, in which case artificial intelligence succeeds wildly, or they don’t, in which case the program can predict either nothing, or else nothing impressive.Practice has shown that neural networks are trained by the maximization of certain equations.## Maximum Entropy TrainingChatGPT is trained using cross-entropy using the principle of maximum entropy.The principle of ***************maximum entropy*************** is:- principle of ******************************maximum entropy******************************    - find the most uniform distribution consistent with available informationIn other words, given a data set, the principle of maximum entropy dictates we should pick the probability distribution that is the ************least biased************ ****************between predicting alternatives that the dataset does not support.## AgnosticismIn the context of the debate between intelligent design or undirected evolution, ***if there were*** no evidence to choose between alternatives, the default position should be one of agnosticism.However, in 2023, we do have abundant data-driven reasons to doubt whether undirected evolution is possible.# The Necessity of Falsifiability in Science## The Burden of Proof in ScienceThe way that science is ********supposed******** to work is that, in order to introduce a significant new theory, the proponent of that theory should make:- clear, falsifiable predictions- predict more than it mis-predicts## Research Program versus Falsifiable TheoryHowever, there are certain cases in the history of science, where something else is able to arise: a ******research program******.A research program is the *project* to look for a falsifiable theory.A research program cannot be falsified.## Chomsky’s Minimalist ProgramChomsky wrote of his “Minimalist Program”:> It is important to recognize that the Minimalist Program (MP) under development in this work, and since, is a program, not a theory, a fact that has often been misunderstood. (The Minimalist Program, 2015, page vii)> In other words, *******nothing******* can falsify the minimalist program, because it is not a specific theory.As the old saying goes:> It’s good work if you can get it.> The idea that a scientist can be at work and taken seriously without a falsifiable theory is a deeply corrosive and[/qoute]",

I'm curious about it, so i decide to search few keyword related to those and it seems you haven't update your word stop. For example,1. \"orc-20\" keyword return \"32,355 results in 5.00 seconds\".2. \"deploy\" keyword return \"30,181 results in 4.57 seconds\".3. \"send\" keyword return \"699 results in 0.59 seconds\".4. \"ordi\" shows message \"Your query took a little too long to process - to manage our limited resources, queries that take longer than approximately 5 seconds will time out. Please try a different query.\".Thanks for going into detail here. The explosion of ordinals has definitely been a bit of a challenge for this project - especially these BRC/ORC-20 tokens which have been inscribed so many times (as you probably know the provenance=timestamps are the key). So good catch as I had not run the stop-word analysis script and those terms should definitely be in there and have now been added.When the project first started, BRC-20 wasn't a thing so looking in a block with ordinals you were going to find a nice collection of interesting stuff (text/html) - now (IMO unfortunately) if you're not doing a search for something specific and you just want to see what's in a particular block, you're not going to see those interesting text/HMTL inscriptions because you're going to be bombarded by BRC/ORD inscriptions. I should probably look at a filter so that you can find/browse the interesting stuff.Thank you again for checking out the site and providing valuable feedback!",

Question: does it hide text with asterisk for the safety reasons or for example out of copyright law to protect the breach of data?In the result viewer shows data hidden with asterisks. (Many things to learn about this tool tbh)I appreciate you exploring the site! To clarify your comment - Preturnio didn't 'associate' anything - there is an inscription that was made in a specific transaction (e.g. 754f52551d5168972874cc9249ca0a5a4741cc610a3f48cdf0551e445a4ad1cc) where someone embedded that entire block of text inside a witness script (i.e. an ordinal) - that is the literal text that was inscribed. Preturnio is doing a text-search - i.e. pattern match - and it will return all Bitcoin transactions where it finds a match/partial match (see the Docs page for more details). Preturnio doesn't mask any data - if you're seeing asterisks in the text, then they are literally in there. This is why I added the 'Verify' section of each result so you can go look at other Ordinal explorers to see the same result. You can also click on 'Inspect Inscription' if you wanted to look at the raw hex of the transaction.",
