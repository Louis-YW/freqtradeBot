We must have to learn from others , have to share unique information, make constructive posts. But some newbies like to spam here , ask donation etc. They never think that they can grow here.

Life is a gradual process, phase by phase process so therefore, it is same applicable here. As a newbie, you will have to get acquainted with the platform first by knowing the rules and regulations before possibly posting and before that, it is pertinent that you must have read through the platform to seeing you posts are made by members more especially established members of high rank.Let me just give you a key or possibly an adopted motto by me ¬†if you must grow and learn ¬†here\"Passion and Patience\"",

      "body": "Totally agreed, i have also stated these facts so many times which i learnt in my time here, for example at start i afraid to make thread so first time i made a thread/topic about market sentiments and many seniors (not regarding to only senior rank members) pointed out many mistakes, and by time i tried my best to overcome that, so after that i made a second topic and then third.Even some members do not really like my topics (just to clear i do not think there is any haha), and share some reviews which looks like bad reviews to me, so what i just do is, not ignore them, try to learn am i really bad at it. So if the answer is yes then i don't make it again. The point is you should not be afraid if you really wants to learn and always look for your pwn mistake before pointing out of others. And i think it would be nice if members take posting as competition because in this way, they will increase there post quality.",

      "body": "Well, this forum is just like every other conversation platform where people from different parts of the world meet. The only difference is that, just as the name implies, it's a Bitcoin discussion forum that covers every other aspect of valuable ideas needed by any individual in a society. Perhaps there is still an off-topic board where other aspects of life can be discussed. Any newbie that is more concerned about feeling insulted by the comments of other high-ranking members is only going to end up not learning so very well. A newbie should just develop a thick skin because, definitely, those insults or criticisms that you are avoiding will come, but your ability to overlook them will make you grow in the forum.Cheers ü•Ç, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange üë∫üë∫",

Here at BTT, You can contribute to topics, learn massively and also share different ideas. And there are different sections in ¬†the forum, be it cryptocurrency, bitcoin, trading or politics. Discover your niche in the forum and make the most of it.Quote ¬†I've come to understand that the forum is not a competition and everyone here have a say so far you're not going against the rules guiding the forum.

Because if you easily faint and be discouraged from their negative comments, then you‚Äôre actually agreeing to their negative criticisms towards you. So focus on your goal and stick to the rules. That way, if you continue to acquire additional knowledge and information, then you will surely grow in the forum.

But they might got turn off on situation on things they don't understand them they quit.That's why we can say that crypto is not really for everyone since not all have big patience and hard work to spend time to seek for different sources of information to help theirselves to improve. Some just want to get spoonfeed since they don't like to research for info's because they are lazy about it and just want to earn quick bucks.",

This is a place to learn and share to the topic that you are interested. You don't need to learn all the aspect of crypto.
