      "body": "the gas increase caused by something else than syncswap, I mean most of the transaction going in syncswap happens in zksync blockchain and moreover the zksync contract in eth isn't the highest gas guzzler, but it's opensea that caused massive increase in gas, I just can't wait to see many more L2 coming up so that the fee problem will gets solved.",

      "body": "Ethereum has no relationship with the sync swap. So many protocols got huge tranffic right now. Just because sync swap was announcing its token and it doesn't even mean if sync swap will able to trigger huge traffic. It's for all of people who were using zksycn the fees is quite normal. it's not so cheal or expensive. I think that the token will be launched through loyalty program. think about that. It's not any annoucement will be triggering the gwei to be so highits 24 gwei now https://etherscan.io/gastracker",
