There are some people in the society that want to invest in bitcoin and saying it to your hearing sometimes but they don't have money to invest, but you see those guys changing women every week like the way we change cloths in the week. Why can't they used that money given to the women just to satisfy themselves for five minutes or one night stand to invest in Bitcoin so that anytime when bitcoin rise they can see profit from the money. Though to satisfying the body is good but that is mainly meant for married women and men. If you carry 2 or 3 girls in a week, you will spend a lot of money that you can use to top up your wallet. And one thing we all know about women is once you have exhausted your money they will not come again. They are coming because of the money so earlier is the best, if you are in this forum and still carrying women to your bed and hotel rooms, you have to refrain from it and use the money to invest in Bitcoin. To be a rich man you have to discipline yourself. I have heard some guys saying that \"testing them will make you to know the right one to marry\" my brothers that is not true, good woman is a good woman by their character we shall know them and not by bed and hotel rooms.",

      "body": "Well op, somehow I don't see how this topic relates to Bitcoin though and it best fits in off topics. But I do know that sometimes, satisfying personal desires is natural and it's crucial to strike a balance and exercise discipline when it comes to spending. Just because you are into Bitcoin investment doesn't mean that others who spends their money don't know how to use it. Yes it's true that those people could actually save up these money spent on sluts and invest on Bitcoin instead, but not everyone is interested in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large, so you should not bother your self that much over them. You can as well preach them a word of Bitcoin , but it's up to them to go into investment.",

You should be more concerned about your own finances than that of someone else’s. It crossed my mind that perhaps you’re just envious you can’t afford that lifestyle yourself.

The same thing can be said about any addiction - drugs, alcohol, hookers, whatever it is. Spending money on it all is just a short term pleasure and nothing else, while others enjoy your money. The question is are you willing to give something up for BTC? I wouldn’t give my beer up for a BTC because I drink it occasionally just for enjoyment. I just know that by giving up some of the stuff I most often consume, I won’t feel life as enjoyable anymore. You could also give up eating the things you like, driving the car you want, drinking soda, going to the pool, going in vacantion etc. But while your BTC wallet grows, how will you feel?",

You need not be humble about your profits and you are free to spend it on hookers if that suits you. It does not mean that the one who enjoy hooking up as a regular thing are bad people, its their choice and bitcoin is about free world and the ability to make free choice. You see how you are contradicting bitcoin's own principles by your own doctrine?Let them be, besides the more they waste money, the more profit for you because they become poor if they spend too much, you should cash in on that.",

Some are addicted with alcohol and some are in others. Obviously it's a bad way to lose your assets and that won't help anyone to grow more. But surely we aren't here to convince every addicted persons to invest in Bitcoin. Who have passion and want to be a part of the future currency will surely invest in it.

Point is, either youngester here or in any country spending money on there girls only then there girls will be with them otherwise not and its just a waste of time. Because those who think they will earn the loyalty of girls whom they love only by spending money on them are the dumbest ones.I am not talking about those who are after hooker or whores, at least they are not buying the loyalty instead the fun of short time. But point is they should not do that instead invest that money, use that money for other moral or social works. But why did they do it? They need a reason. We say you could earn money but they say we already have enough to buy more BTC or invest more. All we could say, is tell them the side effects of spending so much money, energy and time on such things. I am a religious person and i am against such things.",

Everyone was sent into this world with their own separate destiny so if your think one must emulate whatever it is that you’re doing before they can succeed then you’re still living in a dream and you should wake up to reality.

If they are our family members, we can watch them and be ready if they need our advice but mostly it's none of our business too.",
