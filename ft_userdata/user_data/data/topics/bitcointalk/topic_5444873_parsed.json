Geez, just this week they have been more than three threads from newbies lecturing others about how to gain more merits when they haven't been able to acquire any for themselves. Here's an example \"UNLOCKING THE POWER OF MERITS: STRATEGIES FOR GROWING YOUR ACCOUNT\"",

If you understand the indepth of what this means you will understand why you need to work for everything you may deserve from the forum.Anything outside the forum's rules and regulations is void and null.Quote from: Zele365 on March 14, 2023, 12:56:22 PMtry to help others and the results will come.Try help yourself first.Quote from: Zele365 on March 14, 2023, 12:56:22 PMWhat will 1000 merit you if you didn't deserve any, you shouldn't be greedy, it didn't bring anyone anything good in life.Maybe you don't know, having upto a thousand or more merits shows hiw serious, active and being committed you have been on this forum and the more you keep getting signifies that you maintain such steadfast.",

I just wanted to pass on my knowledge and opinion to others and that was the intention of my post, could you please explain to me the intention of your post now?Thank you.P.S. If my post is inappropriate or inappropriate, please remove it from the administrator. That's all from me.topics like the one you started almost appear on a daily basis here. a new member and someone who has just registered and opens a topic where he advises newbies about merit, its values, how to earn it and etc... it repeats itself every day and seems like some kind of twisted begging for merit. hence this kind of reaction, you'll see for yourself when you spend a little longer on this forum.This post is not inappropriate, it's just that it's been discussed this way so many times that it's completely useless. Newbie and merit are probably one of the most written topics.",

      "body": "Quote from: Zele365 on March 14, 2023, 12:56:22 PMImagine what this forum would be like if we could all buy metrics, or send them to each other in excessive amounts, be there, be good, help others and it will come back to you double.I guess your question is how will the forum be of merits can be bought and used at will.  I don't wish to be in a forum where advancement will be based on financial strength. If merits can be bought, only the rich in the forum will be able to acquire them. Ranking will now be based on financial strength and not on the knowledge (merit) and time (activity) of members. If such a rule is introduced this forum will lose its value because many high-ranking members will lack the requisite knowledge and experience because most of them might be newbies that can afford to buy merit. If you produce quality posts you will gradually increase in rank and in the process, you will keep learning and unlearning. You don't need worry about merits because it will naturally. You also need to be aware that buying or selling of merit is an offense in this forum. Hence you have to perish every thought of merit buying or selling.",

That's all from me.Maybe it can be categorized as inappropriate for a newbie to lecture about how to get merit on beginners because you personally don’t gather enough merit to testify about your statement. Asking question and discovering things here is enough to get a merit rather than post like a pro on things that you are new just to get merit.Be a natural newbie and be creative. This kind of post is nerve wracking for forum members that read this same post pattern over and over.",
