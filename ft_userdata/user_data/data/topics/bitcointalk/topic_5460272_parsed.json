  "content": "My name is Mx. Felicia Freeman-Hadid-Blutarsky. I’m a professor of women’s studies at Barnard College, and my pronouns are indecipherable without the aid of a Turing machine. I’ve recently published a new book titled Men: Worse Than Hitler?, which presents a rational argument in favor of grinding all men into a fine paste that will be used to lubricate the wheels on plus-sized POCs’ Rascal™ mobility scooters.  I’ve been promoting my book on all the mainstream news outlets: NPR, PBS, The Village Voice, People's World, and Trader Joe’s Fearless Flyer. I was apprehensive about appearing on Fox News, which I understand is run by people who are too racist to join the Ku Klux Klan, but felt reassured when I saw a photo of the … man … who would interview me. He wears a bow tie just like Louis Farrakhan, so I figured he couldn’t be that bad. I thought the interview was going great. But halfway through explaining why NASA should build a rocket ship large enough to contain all men and then shoot it into the sun, that man asked me a question I had never heard before: “Why?” He then made this inscrutable expression – eyebrows lowered, mouth slightly agape – and for the first time in my life I questioned my beliefs. It was the worst thing I have ever experienced – even worse than when I attended the premiere of An Inconvenient Truth while I was tripping on mushrooms. I’m here to tell you not to buy Tucker Carlson merchandise. If you do, then so help me Goddess, I will get so triggered that you will never hear the end of it.Don't get Tucked – check out our gear!",

      "body": "Am right to call you a feminist? Or could that be a worst form of feminism known as feminazi promoted by those who seek to wipe out the male gender from existence by destroying men or turning them into genderless humanoids? Well, I know that part of the reason for the hatred for men is due to their nature as the stronger vessel which the enemy sees as a difficult nut to crack. To conquer Earth and fully control it the enemy has to weaken or destroy this gender. Or have as many weak genders in leadership positions in order to easily manipulate them.Well, women ought to be women by serving their natural roles and being submissive to responsible men/heads. This is what really makes them beautiful and attractive not applying heavy makeup or exposing their private body parts. Beside, it brings order and harmony in family or society.",
