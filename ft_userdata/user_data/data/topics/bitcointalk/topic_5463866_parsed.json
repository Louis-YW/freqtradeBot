  "content": "I set up a Ledger device a while back. Then I put the Xpub from the Ledger device on BlueWallet (set up as a Watch Only Wallet). I then used the receive address that I got from BlueWallet to receive some bitcoin.The transaction showed up in BlueWallet. However, it never showed up in Ledger Live. I imported the Xpub into Electrum, and the transaction DOES show up there.However, it does NOT show up in Sparrow when I import the xpub.I'm thinking that somehow the receive address that BlueWallet generated is not one that either Ledger or Sparrow would check. I've tried turning on the \"extended account search\" in Ledger Live, and also increasing the \"custom gap limit\" in Ledger Live to what I believe is the max (from 20 to 999), and the transaction still doesn't show up (even after I clear the cache).Any thoughts?",

My immediate guess is the copied xpub isn't related to any of your account in Ledger Live.It can also be something like extended derivation done by Blue wallet to the provided xpub or as simple as different address type.The worst case scenario is if it's changed from your clipboard by a malware.As for Electrum, it derives the 'internal chain' and 'external chain' paths after the provided xpub,for example: your_xpub/0/receiving_address_0+ & your_xpub/1/change_address_0+In Electrum, the script type for \"xpub\" is standard P2PKH; in Sparrow, it depends on what you've selected.Quote from: ContourCool on August 19, 2023, 10:44:12 PMI set up a Ledger device a while back. Then I put the Xpub from the Ledger device on BlueWallet (set up as a Watch Only Wallet).Describe how you set-up your Ledger Device, the exact steps including the software used and which part of the client you've exported the xpub.You can also tell how you imported the xpub to Blue wallet because AFAIK, Blue Wallet follows whatever path where it found any related transactions.If it didn't find any, it wont let you import the extended master public key.Hope this provided enough hint before clarifications are provided.",

You can find the tool from the link below.- https://github.com/LedgerHQ/xpub-scanLet's hope that it can find the address generated from Bluewallet where you received BTC with the right derivation path so that you can later use that path to Ledger Live and Sparrow.",

      "body": "Thanks for all your input, very much appreciated.I think the only thing that was a little unusual is that I used Blue Wallet (with the xpub) to get the \"receive\" address. I didn't generate it or validate it on Ledger. I didn't think that was a problem, guess I was wrong. In Blue Wallet, in the watch only wallet, there's a Receive button that I clicked, no options or anything, it comes up with receive address in the format of a QR code and also a string.I just checked all locations (Ledger Light, Electrum, Sparrow, and Blue Wallet). The xpubs all match. To get the xpub from Ledger Light, I followed this process: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011069619-Extended-public-key-xPub?docs=trueElectrum and Blue Wallet have the same next Receive addressSparrow looks different, they start with bc1. It may be because of the current derivation path (m/84'/0'/0') which I've messed with a bit, don't really understand the derivation path but I do understand it's important.The next address on the Ledger ALSO starts with bc1, and is identical to the one in Sparrow. Neither Sparrow or Ledger find the transaction. Hmm...I went into Electrum and tried creating a new device, connecting to hardware device, etc. But it says \"no hardware device detected\" even when the ledger is plugged in.I will try the xPub scanner tool if I have to, it looks like it's above my head, though.",

OK, so all xpubs match and likely are the same as your Ledger hardware would communicate to a software wallet if you'd connect it to a wallet.

Hmm...If the addresses on both Sparrow and Ledger start with bc1 these two wallets use the native segwit script type and the Electrum and bluewallet used different script types.On both Sparrow and Ledger Live, you can switch the script type to legacy or nested segwit you can follow the guide belowFor Ledger:- https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9068401160221-How-to-add-different-formats-of-Bitcoin-accounts-in-Ledger-Live?docs=trueFor Sparrow, you can just go to settings under script type and change it to nested or legacy.Once you are done it should show the legacy or nested addresses and let's hope the addresses are the same as Bluewallet and Electrum.If it still shows a different address then your last hope is to use the xPub scanner to find the right derivation path and script type.Quote from: ContourCool on August 20, 2023, 07:44:15 PMI went into Electrum and tried creating a new device, connecting to hardware device, etc. But it says \"no hardware device detected\" even when the ledger is plugged in.Would you mind trying to plug it into different USB slots or reboot the device and test it again?",

I thought that generating receive addresses from the Xpub was something people did regularly. In Blue Wallet there's not a place (that I saw) to input the script type, when importing an Xpub.Clients take xpubs differently:Some have specified extended public/private key format per script type like \"xpub\", \"ypub\" and \"zpub\" which indicate the script type of the addresses to be derived.Like I've mentioned in the very first reply, Electrum take an xpub as indication to derive standard (P2PKH) addresses from it.Blue Wallet isn't strict on this when importing a master key but new addresses will default to whatever the format of the imported xpub.Some clients only take the \"xpub\" format and have their own way of identifying/setting the script type of the addresses to be derived.Like for example, Sparrow which uses descriptors.So based from your latest replies, I think when you imported it to Blue Wallet,it automatically detected your existing transactions which are for your native SegWit addresses and created a wallet based from it.But when you requested a new address, since you've imported an \"xpub\" instead of \"zpub\" it gave you legacy address type which didn't yet exist in you Ledger Live.",

I was thinking seed phrase is the mnemonic for the private key, but since private key is actually a bitcoin address, it's not. The seed phrase is the mnemonic for the MASTER private key. Right? So private key = one bitcoin address (which can differ based on script type)? Sorry for these basic questions.
