  "content": "HelloI have a number of seed phrases(eg 10 X 12 Words) and need to work with them.I need a software wallet, windows or android, which can support multiple seed phrase import.for example I need to be able to copy 10 seed phrases into clipboard(12 words for each line, 10 line total) and paste them into the software import form.I know I can have multiple wallet on Trust Wallet and some others, but when importing you need to do it 1 by 1. I want to be able to copy 10 seed phrase or more and import them at once into the wallet software.one last thing I need a multi Coin wallet not just BTC or ETH... Any thought appreciated. Thanks.",

Two problem exist there:1- electrum is not a multicoin wallet2- I have to import 1 by 1. I don't want this.",
