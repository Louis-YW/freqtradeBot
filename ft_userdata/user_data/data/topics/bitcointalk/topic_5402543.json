  "content": "Hi I am requesting for a loan of $750 either in USDT or BUSD , details below-Loan Amount:  $750 in USDT or BUSDLoan Purpose:  personal, but am open to discuss it in dm.Loan Repay Amount:  $925 in USDT or BUSD (please forgive me incase repayment amount isnt good enough, this is my first time of seriously requesting for a loan here, i dont completely know how it works yet, i am open for a slight negotiation incase repayment amount is not good enough, thank you).Loan Repay Date:  4 months from the date loan is granted, i am willing to be repaying on weekly or monthly basis(depending on lender's choice) for 4 months.FOR MONTHLY REPAYMENTi will send $231.25 in USDT or BUSD to lender's repayment address monthly for 4 months from the date loan is granted.FOR WEEKLY REPAYMENTi will send $57.85 in USDT or BUSD to lender's repayment address weekly for 16 weeks from the date loan is granted.Please note that i can increase the monthly or weekly payment amount to a higher amount to bring the 4 months payment period down to sooner than 4 months, if i get accepted in a campaign that pays higher than what my current campaign is paying.Type of Collateral:  Unfortunately, what i have as collateral isnt listed as an accepted collateral here on the forum(landed properties), if i had an altcoin to use as collateral, i would have just sold it and use the money to sort out my problem rather than requesting for a loan here, altcoin i have which is currently worth $500+ is staked and locked for 6 months on unifarm, and its just about 2 months gone, i can use my account as collateral but i fear its against the forum rule.Escrow profile Link:  none.USDT/BUSD Address: Â  upon request.Signed MessageCode:-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hi, This is Fivestar4everMVP from Bitcointalk.org, I am signing this message because i am requesting for a loan of $750 in USDT or BUSD on bitcointalk, to repay $925 in USDT or BUSD in 4 months period, today's date is 14th June, 2022. -----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----Version: Bitcoin-qt (1.0)Address: bc1qradlnp7tjnk4fke05ychyykfzhp7tdfwzqkm0gH8HKhzcGem5symzV2s2vQFxV/ZX6k8thW8+oJpvnLArlGJDyN/7gklQ6u16F2Y1JhUHYYrHKVrqWRk1JJKUJ1gY=-----END BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----",

It is preferable that you contact him in private before posting in his topic devoted to the service.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3243635.0Good Luck",
