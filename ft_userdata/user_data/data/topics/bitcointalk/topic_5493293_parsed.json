I don't know about ETFs though, I'm sure they're leaning more towards bitcoin than ETFs. I don't even see what's being pointed by OP in the post, it's PoW not PoS so they're not that easily controlled by Coinbase even if they're all consolidated together, bitcoin is and will always be about freedom, no doubts about it.",

Op, what do you mean by wake up and do the right thing, i know there is a risk of centralization when few pools control most of the hashrate and now their rewards is stored in a custodial service. But i don't see any reason to press the panic button yet, BTC is still decentralized, and the custodial service cannot control the network just because they have a large amount of BTC's. BTC can only be centralized and pro censorship if most pools start blacklisting addresses and censoring utxo's, but i don't think that is likely to happen.",

They did not do anything wrong because with their financial budget, not deep enough, they must to balance it to keep their mining operations continue after the halving.In contrast, if a Bitcoin mining farm is big and has good financial budget for their mining operation, they will keep their bitcoins and wait for higher price after the halving. Selling bitcoins like this will not help them to maximize their mining business but nothing is right or wrong, it depends on their business model and finance they have.After the Bitcoin halving, if price won't rise quickly, small Bitcoin mining farms will have to stop their mining because they will get negative net mining income. The rich will get richer and big Bitcoin mining farms will get richer with halving effects.",

Do you also want to say that Bitcoin is already centralized for people who hold their coins in CEX and buy ETFs? those services only hold customers' money, they didn't really own the coins. Even the those services went bankrupt, they might obliged to refund the money to the customers, just like Mt.Gox and FTX (although the refund is not yet started).https://explorer.btc.com/btc/insights-pools",

These pools are not centralized because they store their block rewards in a custodial service, i know it sounds 'weird' that all 9 of them chose the same custodial service, Cobo, but it is not for this reason that they can be called centralized. If a pool starts 'taking orders' from the government on addresses and utxo's that should be blacklisted, i believe that is when you can call that pool centralized.",

With PoS you pay once for obtaining a large share of supply and then can attack the network for free for the rest of history. Sure, you got a fair point there in favor of Proof of Work versus Proof of Stake, though, if we keep the approach of an attack on both system realistic, then it would also very expensive for an entity to own most of the stake of a protocol like Ethereum for the sake of ruining the trust on it. Maybe it would be the thing only a big government could afford to do and for the sake of ruining a \"decentralized protocol\" for political or economical reason. Even so, the protocol can be forked and start from the point before the attack. It would be the equivalent of buying a lot of shares of a publicly traded company like Amazon or apple and then, using that power to ruin the company on purpose. I am not saying it is imposible, but it is also very unlikely to happen. Don't you think?",
