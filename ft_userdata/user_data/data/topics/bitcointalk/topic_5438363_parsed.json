Also considering this might've been potential identity theft on the part of the faketoshis it's possible something like that wasn't valid in Australia to begin with (CSW was from aus iirc).",

This should be lesson to all those who keep digging deep down the history and try to impersonate the name of Satoshi.  I think it’s really disrespectful to get started over that conversation. I know there is curiosity since the beginning but if Satoshi never wanted to be visible then why the heck world cares about it. Let him be in piece and enjoy his millions of bitcoins that are in his wallet. There could be sad news about his life, why we should even try to get the matters in our hands. It would have been different if they were present and were open to discuss the bitcoin agenda.",

Additionally, many experts and members of the community have expressed skepticism about his claims. Thus, Gavin Andresen's position of no longer believing in Craig Wright's claims seems to be in line with the majority of existing opinions in the community.",

Yeah CSW is from Australia. Signing an NDA to not speak on the basis of a potential identity theft should be invalid because it should be a crime in itself, but as far as i know the court hasn't officially proven CSW to be an identity thief, even if all of us and any sane person knows he is one, so maybe that doesn't count.",
