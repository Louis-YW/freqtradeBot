I've been thinking if there's a promotion for lucky gambler that can hit 7 streak win by placing his bets with low chance to win e.g. 10%.Well I checked your casino, but why we can't adjust which number we're gamble since it's only have under and over button.",

A prediction on how many bets have already taken place in a specific date was likely a good contest too, you can also create an art contests or something, just my two cents.",

Other than that contests like \"hit the specific number, the highest win, the same number in a row\" is happening throughout the day, usually, admins start it and it lasts 20 minutes... more or less. Of course, with some symbolic prizes. Well, I am looking forward to seeing that auto betting and your setting...

Top 1, 2, and 3 will have the higher rewards, and then 4-10 with the same amount. For every cryptocurrency, there is a top wager. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Doge.

You should run some weekly wagering contest as Neodice is new to the gambling world and users wagering activity is very low there. Moreover, you should follow the weekly forum giveaways of Primedice.

I would put up a few numbers and see who falls on that Bet ID.... for example ... if your total amount of bets are currently 10 000 000 bets... then I will say anyone that have bets falling between 10 500 000 and 10 500 100 will each get $50 ...... or you can have bigger prizes... for example $500 for the person that have the bet ID of say $11 000 000. This way, people have to push the bets to reach those bet ID's and depending on your bet volume.. you could make it much higher ...say every 1 000 000 bets get a prize.",

Let a percentage of the amount they bet put in one storage or a bank and divide that for giving out prizes for those who gamble more. If you have an automated roll included, I am sure the site will be flooded with more dicers that will try to reach the top prize.",

Other alternative can be something like \"the most profit\" contest or maybe \"ROI\" contest. If you are going to have the contest in the forum, you have more options as you can run some various contests such as hitting specific numbers, specific multiplier, longest winning/losing streak with specific payout, etc. Wagering contest is not my thing because I'm a small gambler only, so I will prefer to other contests.",

I would like to see a different competition but with two challenges in one challenge, I mean the right high odds but more than two winning streak for example x10 won and so on x10 won again, the challenge will be more interesting and difficult. But it is better to focus on wagering contests only, of course with big prizes, will attract interest more gamblers. A free faucet is recommended, so that many people are active on your site.",
