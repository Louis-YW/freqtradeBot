  "content": "What Happened: My username is Kahleesi on Duelbits, 3 months ago I was required to complete KYC, which I completed. However they are still yet to withdraw 2k USD and are telling me that they are still processing my request and will have an update. This has been going on for 3 months now with still no update. The total deposit amount was $1600 USD and withdrawal was about $2100USD. There is 288k wagered on that account for mines and dice. I don't know what to do to get the money out, as Duelbits are obviously not planning on withdrawing and are refusing to explain why. I've reached out on both casino guru and trustpilot, to which duelbits have just responded that they are processing the complaint, but to no result.Scammers Profile Link:https://duelbits.comReference Link:https://www.trustpilot.com/users/643536d8ab6c6b0013f338fcAmount Scammed: $2100USDPayment Method: DogeCoinProof of Payment:Deposits https://postimg.cc/gallery/dQ7ht7CWithdrawals https://postimg.cc/ns7zS0P9PM/Chat Logs: 10th July Chat: https://postimg.cc/t1y35Zrb https://postimg.cc/B8gxwSyKhttps://postimg.cc/JDzbwwVd https://postimg.cc/7GtSwBqP  List of Previous Requests for Withdrawal: https://postimg.cc/jnWP5zjH",

      "body": "There was no need of creating a new scam accusation thread as you have already created one for this issue: Duelbits.com SCAM 2k USD,3months, Complete KYC. You could easily include the evidence by editing the previous thread instead of creating this new one. A forum member has already informed Duelbits representative about your issue. Quote from: SnowDust98 on July 11, 2023, 06:46:06 AMI've reached out on both casino guru and trustpilot, to which duelbits have just responded that they are processing the complaint, but to no result.Trustpilot isn't a mediator. You have submitted a negative review there about Duelbits, and the casino team has replied to you. The issue isn't going to be resolved on Trustpilot.I can see that you had submitted a complaint in Casino Guru, but you have stopped responding there. As a result, Casino Guru team has closed your complaint. Based your complaint on Casino Guru, you are from Germany. The residents of Germany aren't allowed in Duelbits.",

      "body": "Going by what Duelbits have written they have basically released the funds even though they suspect there is abuse. The reason seems to be because the funds are what they deem to be insignificant. Having said that, Duelbits took this step even though Casino Guru closed the complaint because of lack of co-operation by the OP.-----------------------If Duelbits suspected abuse I think it would have been better for them to have fully investigated the matter rather than not because of the small amount of money involved because the player accepted various terms and conditions when he signed up to their website.Quote from: acroman08 on July 11, 2023, 04:10:51 PMjust saw this new thread after posting on the first thread OP created.
