But this behavior also sometimes proves that users do not read all posts, but choose for themselves the most convenient way to post the next post, which should count towards the quota. I don’t know if it makes sense to re-read all twenty or thirty pages when the answer is already obvious in the first posts of the topic. It would be reasonable to close topics in which communication takes place according to the parrot principle; repeating the same answers, and paraphrasing in your own way is unlikely to be useful to those who are looking for advice or, on the contrary, giving advice.",

Does this happen a lot? Yeah it happens alot, most time I see it to caused by misleading topics/titles, some people use bot notification on telegram and this bot delivers only the titles and the first statement of the thread so people sometimes only read the title/topic having see the topic to be very interesting to them so they immediately write base on the topic or title. when posted or when the thread is finally read. They tend to find out the title is very difficult from what body of the thread is talking about. Thereby making the comments look stupid or off discussion before if looked at very well you might find it has little to what the thread of title of thread is talking about. QuoteBut not reading the first page, especially if the thread is only one page long is a cardinal sin. I'm about to send a PM to the manager so he doesn't pay him for that post. What do you think about this? Not reading the first page is very bad because it the foundation to what anyone should be contributing to any thread, but sending a PM to a manager not to pay a campaign participant is not really advisable for me because I believe the action it too quick. Before sanction can be implemented, caution must be given first at least the offender should be warn before carrying out any sanction thou it is to the campaign manager to decide.

If anyone does have anything else to say, he can create another thread for his issue. Most times I have seen senior colleagues commenting numerous list of threads that are related thereby correcting OPs of thread that such thread have been created already your suggestion that it should be locked can make same type of question repeat itself maybe in different forms.",

Does this happen a lot?Unfortunately, this is something that is a daily occurrence on the forum, because for some, reading other people's posts is obviously a waste of time. It's not just a problem in spam megathreads of 10+ pages, but also in threads of only 1 or 2 pages where you can see older members asking questions that were answered just a few posts above.There are several options that we can do when we notice such behavior :1. Report such a post to the moderator as repetitive content/signature spam - and hope that after the deleted post the user will realize that he did something wrong.2. Publicly warn the user to read what others have written before him in the hope that he will accept the suggestion and be more appropriate in his posts in the future.3. Report such a user to his campaign manager (if he is in a sig. campaign), although it should be remembered that each manager determines the rules when it comes to megathreads and to which page the post can be paid.4. Put the user on ignore and pretend that nothing is happening, which is the easiest option, but for me personally, it is also the worst because then nothing will change for sure.",

Does this happen a lot?It is practically impossible for all the comments in a particular thread to align with the opinion or views of the OP, hence, there are some comments that can be made to correct or throw more light on what is being discussed. If such comments are made, I do not see anything wrong because it is all about engagement and making the discussion elaborate. It only becomes bad if the comment does not flow into the discussion.

I'm about to send a PM to the manager so he doesn't pay him for that post. What do you think about this?Many signature campaign managers expect their participants to criticize, ask questions and contribute to discussion in this forum and this is what they are paid for as they show the visibility of the project they are promoting. If they fail to make meaningful contribution or deviate entirely from the topic of discussion, then they might not be paid and might be reprimanded for bad representation. Therefore, if the said comment does not correlate with the topic of discussion, your actions might yield results else it will amount to a futile effort.",

This helps maintain the flow of the conversation and prevents the repetition of points already made.Sending a PM to the manager might be a bit like calling for the referee in a game, but if it helps maintain the integrity of the discussion, why not?

They sees it as stress to them, saying who cares if I make a quality post or Read through the forum before commenting.4) always find it difficult to read a thread that is above 2 pages just as the op said.With my little knowledge that is what I discovered.",
