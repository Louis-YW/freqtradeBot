      "body": "tbh atp, Biden is just pulling a Biden here since he's just a frontman of 'his' administration who are actually the ones doing majority of the 'work'.Someone else on this forum has mentioned about Trump being all over the place but everyone can clearly see that the entire Biden Administration can't even get one thing straight.^ This comment is a barely off-topic but wanted to make a point to that one person who thinks that one knowledgable man's 'wandering off-point at times' is more embarrassing than an entire administration full of clowns screwing up everything LMFAO  (don't worry! This comment is it, nothing more!)I will admit tho, America being in a hell-deep debt, the Biden administration were tryna find a way to somewhat find a source to repay it, and seeing that Bitcoin being the leading revolution and gaining countless more people into it, I'm guessing the administration wanted to find a easy shortcut since the money pumping through Bitcoin is outstanding.Seeing that New York has already banned mining for carbon reduction reasons and several other states refusing to give out/renew permits for mining, it already seems like they're working on limiting crypto mining. But tbh, even if the government were to stop crypto mining for the general public they'd still end up producing just as much carbon when mining for themselves. I see it as they want more centralization over Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies which were introduced to be decentralized so that these types of things won't happen. idk, this is just the way I see it but if there is something I may be missing about this, do let me know, I'm still learning and open to other perspectives But anyways, like everyone else who's commented before me, I agree that the bill can't just be passed as it's more than likely negatively impact America in the long term. Living in America myself, I hope nothing like such bill will be passed since seeing how crypto has revolutionized, it would only be a minor obstacle that crypto can overcome easily but will have a negatively huge impact on America... plus it's already chaotic here lol",

      "body": "That high tax on mining is going to cause so much discomfort for the miners of the America. It's not worth it to pose such high taxes on miners, the reward for mining is already half and the miners may face more problems if they get another burden as extra tax that they will have to pay in order to continue their mining operations.First year tax is 10%, which is quite high for the miners who haven't yet covered the initial cost of the mining machine or ASICS that they have bought for the mining operations. And, the next years that tax will double to 20%, and 30% after that year. The miners have to move their mining setups to other countries if Biden or the government doesn't reduce that tax.",

They would lose a significant amount of tax revenue if they tried to drive the miners out of their country. To me, this news is no different than Fud, so it's not worth paying attention to.",

It may seem that it is just imposing quite high taxes on this industry, but it is like slowly injecting this industry to death from the country. Maybe this old man thinks that it has no impact on their country's economy and it will only add to the problems in their country, so maybe he quite agrees that imposing high taxes on the Bitcoin mining industry is a good move.

Why are such “privileged” conditions created for mining? For example, the oil production tax is 0.5% (Kentucky) - 12.5% ​​(Alaska). I assume that this is only part of the tax burden, but certainly not a total of 30%. 30% is an extortionate interest rate. Quote from: seoincorporation on April 23, 2024, 12:52:13 AMSo, the plan isn't to ban the mining, but with those huge taxes, no one will want to mine there.

If a country wants to develop (attract) business in this direction, then they set a 0% tax rate.

He repeats what he's being told by his staff who claim to know the technology and have a clear (negative) stance.Biden seems to underestimate how many people support bitcoin in the US and doing this will not buy him more votes, but I guess he wants to be in opposition to Trump who said some good things about bitcoin. Whatever happens, people will do what they always do - move the business elsewhere. Not all states will impose the tax if the bill ever passes (which I doubt it will) and states like Texas or Virginia will continue to support bitcoin.
