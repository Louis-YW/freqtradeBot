  "content": "Honestly, I like to mind my business, but I got it loose yesterday evening when a co-neighbour invited all of us to a birthday party. Normal, gist went on until this elderly neighbour working for CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) as a director in one of their branches stated that people now launder money in Bitcoin thereby making it difficult for the law enforcers to trace. This is where I took it personally, else I would have been a bastard of BTT.My first question to him was sir, have you ever tried Bitcoin before? He was like, what's my business in trying that devilish thing? I smiled, and I replied now, you are guilty of your words. How could you judge and condemn what you do not know? Why can't the so-called law enforcers stop being paper officers, gather intelligence and go digital maybe they won't catch some of the illegal flows, that's if your assumption is correct. Bitcoin is innocent of many allegations, it is just like your fiat money, it goes where you send it and is highly traceable if you have the resources and tech.He was like, no no no, something that will just disappear from the radar.I said it doesn't work that way, I will show you how it works tomorrow. Stop listening to the noise, act by proof and mind your own business and use your Bitcoin for the right and honest purpose. If you are indicting Bitcoin, fiat is not innocent also, or do you want to tell me that fiat is not being used for evils? So are you because of that going to stop spending money?Look sir,  I was once like you a while ago but I only missed a huge opportunity of making millions through this mindset. It's a lie if someone tells you that Bitcoin is evil, just perceive it as money, they can use money for anything whether good or bad, but money will remain money, let your conscience judge you on what you personally use it for. Bitcoin is now in the mainstream of the financial market and spending, there is nothing anyone can do about it, they will only miss out on the opportunity. I now know so much about it, it's not bad, and don't let the sentiment of working for CBN blind you to its blessing. I'm sure that some of your colleagues are using and investing in it, only that you won't know.Even the US government could not ban Bitcoin for a reason, it works within a network, and most of the transactions therein are linkable within the network.The conversation later got private, and below was the concluding part I remember;Me: Let what you use your coin for judge you sir, Bitcoin is a good investment, and not evil.Neighbour: Are you really sure???Me: 99.9999%.Neighbour: Your living standard shows this could truly be positive. My son and wife have disturbed me on this on several occasions, I am only stubborn about it. I'm in...I will use my son in the US for it, he knows about it, and it is against my work here in Nigeria.Me: Smiles, I know.Neighbour: Thanks man...I will start with 1BTC if only you show me proof that you have a sufficient amount in there.Me: I gat you sir...there is nothing to gain by lying to you. It's your coin, your money and yours to safely keep...I have nothing to gain or lose.Neighbour: OkayI couldn't believe it!!! Can you imagine like a play, I was able to convince a whole CBN man to do 1BTC? But I hope he doesn't change his mind. Even if he does, I'm proud to have stood for Bitcoin in such a situation.",

If you don't link your identity with your bitcoin address in any way, then tracing it back to you would be impossible, so he wasn't wrong there. As for using Bitcoin for money laundering - I don't think it's a good tool for that (depending on the local laws I guess). Laundering does not mean hiding your money, but making illicit proceedings appear legit, so using Bitcoin alone won't help here, as you'd still need to be able to explain where did you get all those bitcoins from.",

Well, if it's ever possible, I believe everyone should be told the truth about Bitcoin because there are a lot of misconceptions about it. Look how the man thinks Bitcoin is evil; even the fact that he works with CBN, who are in charge of controlling money, he just can't relate to it that even the money we talk about is being used to commit a lot of ill-conceived activities. The use of money, both faith-based cash and digital currency like Bitcoin, to commit illegal activities is inevitable; it can never be totally eradicated, and the only way to do so is to stop the illegal activities first.One thing most people fear about Bitcoin is its price volatility and instability, but Bitcoin cannot be stable. That's really why it's a store of value as well, because if one holds his or her Bitcoin for the bull market, they sure will get some profit, but when the same person holds a huge amount of money for like four years, they will be surprised that the value of the money has even reduced, and even the added interest will not mean anything. It's good you changed her perception of Bitcoin.",

I smiled, and I replied now, you are guilty of your words. Most people don't even get to know about bitcoin before they jump into conclusion, they just listen to what people around them say and they listen to what government feed them on the news and they will also start spreading bad news about bitcoin. Most of them do think Bitcoin is a scam, because how will you be spending a currency that you can't see or touch, I believe this is also a reason why people are scared of bitcoin, but most of them don't really understand what bitcoin is all about, and the main reason why government is scared of bitcoin is because they can't control it.

If he can lose his bitcoin, then he will confidently say it to you that bitcoin is a scam, but he won't know the mistake is from him.",

You’re right on this. He is just a victim of misconceptions about bitcoin especially that he works for fiat and not for cryptocurrency. But I believe this should not hinder him to know the truth and continue to miss opportunities just because he works in a central bank. In the end, when everyone around here is up to bitcoin, I don’t think he’ll stay dedicated to fiat and won’t jump for the opportunities that bitcoin has to offer. I guess he just needs to balance himself, enough that he can see both the positive sides of fiat and bitcoin.",
