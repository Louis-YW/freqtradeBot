I have come up with a landing page so far: https://www.giftbitcoin.app/Problem:The current ways to gift bitcoin are not great. They either require kyc or the gift recipient to download a wallet. Solution:I am prototyping a web app that lets a gifter load btc into a local-browser based wallet and send the gift recipient a digital giftcard that lets them then redeem the bitcoin. They would then be able to setup a wallet (if they wish) , buy an amazon giftcard, swap for another crypto etc. It would be a browser based wallet so I will be able to walk the user through whatever they choose to do with the btc with the gui. My goal is to be the easiest way to gift btc without app download or kyc causing friction in the process. How You Can Help: I have done research into past examples of non-custodial bitcoin gifting apps, but I wasn't able to find any. If y'all know of any I would love to hear about them.

I surely hope that this is implemented in a way that by default the funds go back to original sender (and not the gift card app developer) after that period ends.2. I would let the gift card funder decide whether the gift card expires or not (and the expire date, if any, has to be printed on the card). And I'll tell you why:* if I want to give out money at some conference maybe I'll set up an expire date because I don't want my money be lost by people not interested to redeem it* if I want to give it as a birthday present maybe I'll not set up any expire date because maybe my friend wants to keep it as a souvenirPlus, it has to be stated clearly whether it's custodial or not (if it's custodial you may have trust problems and maybe also problems with financial institutions).Quote from: dgoon on October 25, 2022, 03:49:43 PMMy goal is to be the easiest way to gift btc without app download or kyc causing friction in the process. Sorry, I find the existing paper wallets (if generated properly, safely) and collectibles good enough for the job.I mean that the recipient will have to install (and rather quick!) his own wallet, learn on his own to keep it safe (which is not gonna happen) and redeem that money. So one more level of complication.But yeah, I may find easy the technical bits other don't gasp, so maybe my feedback is not that relevant or wrong.

      "body": "Thanks alot for checking out the app SFR10. I'm glad you thought it was simple, that was one of my founding ideas for making this. The wallet is fully in ran in the browser. There is server that holds the encrypted wallet info for transferring between people but the information is encrypted with the giftcard and has ~128 bits of security. So its non-custodial as a local web wallet on the useres machine.   The gift recipient will be given the option to spend the funds as they see fit. They might choose to buy a amazon giftcard from me with the funds. I would make money from this transaction, but its not a required transaction for the gift recipient. They would be given other options such as setting up a wallet or swapping to another crypto that they can choose from. Once the wallet expires the funds will be refunded back to the gift sender. The server would hold a refund transaction to broadcast once the wallet expires. The wallet lives in the senders browser, so they can retrieve the funds at anytime they choose. Thanks for the great questions around custody, there is a lot of nuance to be had so I hope I was clear in communicating how this is non-custodial from the technical aspect. At no point can the service send your funds anywhere you did not sign a transaction approving for them to go. If the website goes down, the code is open source and runs locally. So the user can clone the repo and continue on their way. Feel free to ask anymore technical questions about custody with the gifting app. Also the 2 hours is for testing purposes, in production the gifter will set the refund time as long as its under 30 days.As far as paper wallets go. There are a lot of informed people who hate paper wallets and think they should not be used for gifts like andreas antonopoulos . I don't mean to appeal to authority but show that people have different opinions of the use of paper wallets. That goes to say that because you like paper wallets that does not mean that they are the best for everyone, and some people would like the convivence of an app to gift bitcoin. This app will be the easiest way to gift btc without app download or kyc, since a paper wallet requires an app to use. Even open dimes require an app to use. If you don't think an app download is a big deal that's is a reasonable opinion to hold. The opinion that an app download isn't too much to ask does not change the value prop of this app, you just don't find the value proposition of the app to be useful for you. If there is another way to give bitcoin without an app download or kyc I will gladly qualify the value prop. Thanks for feedback and questions also, I can see that effort was put into them.",

However you must forgive me but your proposal seems like a lot of mental gymnastics to come to the same result as giving someone the seed phrase to a wallet with the gifted Bitcoin on it?Either way they will have to download either a wallet, or on this case, your app? And you do not need KYC for Bitcoin wallets so that argument makes no sense.Really anything they want to do they already can do without your app. Perhaps your apps use case should be that it simplifies the process? So instead of going to multiple places to do things with their coin (trading, buying amazon giftcards, etc.), they can outsource it all to one app?",

      "body": "Thanks for the words of encouragement.  I think that the process for gifting a non-coiner bitcoin is not as easy(simple) as people think it is. I think its similar to the idea that everyone thinks making a peanut butter sandwich is easy until they have to write the steps down for someone who isn't informed about the process. I think it would be very hard to condense the instruction set for a no-coiner , with no crypto experience, to send a transaction using electrum from a mnemonic seed down to just one page. These instructions would take no less than  30 minutes to complete correctly if they did exist. So I know my app will be easier and simpler for nocoiners to get started with than any process that currently exist. I think that the easier for nocoiners value prop is hard for experts in the crypto space to value and appreciate, until they have to actually write instructions down for a nocoiner and have them go through the process without extra input.I mentioned kyc because when you google gift bitcoin, the first link is for coinbase gifting. Someone can argue if coinbase is a wallet, or if some bitcoin wallets require kyc. I know that the top google alternatives require and promote kyc so I contrasted my idea with those top alternatives.I encounter the lack of ease in a lot of bitcoin spaces and products. I don't think that decentralization and self-custody should be hard, require a printer or take an expert guiding you through the process. I like working on products that make things easier and more accessible than the status quo because crypto is competing against easy and centralized processes like coinbase, so I think decentralization has to get easier or it will loose to centralized forces. Decentralization is currently loosing in the gifting bitcoin space , since coinbase is the top result and the following guides also recommend exchanges. I think gifting is a easy win to have, since no one likes doing kyc to get a gift, so I'm pursing that goal.",

Feel free to ask anymore technical questions about custody with the gifting app.Does that mean cloning the site is enough to claim a gift certificate, or to claim funds from an expired gift certificate?Quotein production the gifter will set the refund time as long as its under 30 days.My opinion: this should be much longer. I gave someone a funded paper wallet 4 years ago, it's still untouched. That also means the gift certificate should contain all instructions on how to redeem it in case your website is gone.QuoteAs far as paper wallets go. There are a lot of informed people who hate paper wallets and think they should not be used for gifts~people have different opinionsBitcoin is all about freedom. If some people don't want to use a certain feature, that's fine. I don't agree, and that's fine too.Quotea paper wallet requires an app to use.Even though I don't think installing a wallet is a bad thing, your statement isn't true. ETFbitcoin already mentioned Coinb.in, which can be used to redeem a paper wallet without installing anything.Quote from: dgoon on October 28, 2022, 05:04:31 PMI think that the process for gifting a non-coiner bitcoin is not as easy(simple) as people think it is.\"Here's a piece of paper with Bitcoin. Safely keep it, treat it like cash, and if it ever becomes valuable, learn how to use it.\"QuoteI think it would be very hard to condense the instruction set for a no-coiner , with no crypto experience, to send a transaction using electrum from a mnemonic seed down to just one page. These instructions would take no less than  30 minutes to complete correctly if they did exist.This sounds like something to put to the test: fund a wallet, write down 12 words, give it to a no-coiner, and tell him to download a wallet from Electrum.org and use those 12 words to pay Bitcoin to a certain address. There, I put it in one sentence. It's not enough for someone who's never used a computer before, but an experienced computer user shouldn't need much more than that and his own reading skills.QuoteI know my app will be easier and simpler for nocoiners to get started with than any process that currently exist.Let's say that's true. Then what? They have an empty gift certificate, they have an Amazon coupon, and they still have no idea how to continue with Bitcoin.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on October 28, 2022, 03:47:55 PMyour proposal seems like a lot of mental gymnastics to come to the same result as giving someone the seed phrase to a wallet with the gifted Bitcoin on it?There's a different risk involved: by giving someone a seed phrase, they may actually start using that wallet, which means you have access to their future deposits. It's much better to teach a new Bitcoin user to create their own wallet, so they know for sure nobody else has access to their seed phrase.",

      "body": "QuoteBut this part makes me wonder: Can the giftcard still be redeemed if the server disappears?In my current implementation no, the sender would have to retrieve the funds. Your suggestions made me rethink the infrastructure and I think ill just have the server do the refunds and the gift certificate act more like seed phrase in its use. Thanks for the input. QuoteCan you share a (Bitcoin testnet) example of what data would be available on each step of the process, from creating a gift card to letting it expire or redeeming it. With the new design it would work similar to coinbin , but a serve would store a refund transaction to be broadcast when the card expires. I will create a technical spec sometime before I launch to mainnet. QuoteIs this transaction time-locked? And will it also be available for the creator of the gift card, so that he can still broadcast it in case your server disappears?Not by default but it could be if the sender wished for it be. Thats a good idea also. It would be stored in the senders local computer so yes. QuoteDoes that mean cloning the site is enough to claim a gift certificateThere is local data stored on the creators computer that would be needed, (or a gift certificate with the new design you inspired). QuoteI gave someone a funded paper wallet 4 years ago, it's still untouched.I don't think that creates a gifting experience that I would want to support with my app. I think that bitcoin should be used by new people not stored on paper in hopes it'll be worth something. My app will be secure enough for small amounts of crypto, but not for large amounts. 100 dollars of bitcoin today could be worth 1,000 dollar+ in 4 years and a paper wallet should not be used to store that amount (in my opnion). So I will keep the life of the wallet under 30 days. Use it or loose it type deal, but I see how people could want a longer life. I just don't agree. I also have a question since you seem to gift bitcoin alot. How do you manage your cards once you give them? Like if give 10 cards and track them for 4 years, do you just have a stack of paper wallets that you check up on periodically?QuoteEven though I don't think installing a wallet is a bad thing, your statement isn't true. ETFbitcoin already mentioned Coinb.in, which can be used to redeem a paper wallet without installing anything.Your right, i'll correct my statements concerning this moving forward. Quote\"Here's a piece of paper with Bitcoin. Safely keep it, treat it like cash, and if it ever becomes valuable, learn how to use it.\"I tried to redeem a paper wallet this way and it was much easier than I thought it would be. I think most people should be able to get through it, so thanks for bringing this method up. I still think the experience would be easier with my app, but easier is dependent  on someone's goals and opinions. QuoteLet's say that's true. Then what? They have an empty gift certificate, they have an Amazon coupon, and they still have no idea how to continue with Bitcoin. If they choose to buy a giftcard then thats fine in my book. They got to send their first crypto transaction and got some crypto exposure and education. If someone is interested in crypto Id rather give them a bitcoin giftcard that they can choose to convert to a amazon, ebay or whatever giftcard rather than just give the amazon card originally. Users of my app will feel the same way, or they can use another way to gift. No Hard feelings. Thanks for all the great input, the questions about the server made me ralize it really isnt needed for transferring info. Im going to work on the giftcard encoding directly to a bitcoin mnemonic then wallet vs using encrypted data.",
