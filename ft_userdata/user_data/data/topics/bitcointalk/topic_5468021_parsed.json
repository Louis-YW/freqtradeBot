      "body": "I like this thread, it is not about who won the election that self-centered people can post about without having the evidence of who won. But this thread is an advice about our future generations. It is not surprising anymore that talents are buried in Nigeria. And for our government, they are clueless and they do not know the way forward.Our leaders are not competent enough to make Nigeria a great nation and likely tomorrow may be worse than today. But what I noticed is that politicians and rich people let their children or some of their children to travel abroad, most especially to schooling. A good example is our president that schooled abroad.We depend more on what is coming from outside the country and services that are outside the country. People go for medical outside Nigeria, including the politicians. This advice is also about going to abroad which is the mindset of almost every Nigerians if they have the opportunity to travel out of the country. This makes me doubt again about how Nigeria can become a good nation when we all have the mindset of the politicians which will make all Nigerians say that you are right. Even if you can go through the mind of almost all Africa politicians, you are right will be their conclusion.",

I don dey hear say \"children (youths) are the leaders of tomorrow\" but those daddies go let us? Another saying nah \"change begins with you\". But if we want folo that adage, I no sure say e go apply for naija. You point out say even our presido school abroad and I dey ask why him no school for naija nah? He came from moni and him get influence to change tins but him run go abroad to school abi nah say naija no get good tins? I get say naija no good and if I understand what you are driving at, you dey try tok say make all of us no jus comot for d contri as nah the only one we get, but rather stay and build and make am attractive enough for those foreigners to dey come, bah?

Even if it is Antarctica that success is, you will see people there. You too can explore, leave the country and live the kind of life that you want. But this is not new, politicians and rich people have always been attached themselves with White countries, they have life and properties there as well. But the poor will likely always find it difficult to leave the country. The more we depend more on other countries, the more harm it will cause the country, the more the bad economy and the more people will want to leave. It would be like a positive feedback mechanism ad it is now. Although, our leader damage the foundation.",

We can't continue being quiet or allow this corrupt politician to keep ruling and spoiling this our given country that we are blessed in by God. They better we begin to speak for ourselves, they better for us. By God grace the youths of this country go collect the mantle of power from their hands one day. We are not given up on that. On the same way, I like how the things the flow for this country cos every body are beginning to wake up from their slump that ''Nigerians is ours\" not longer for a particular set of people that don't care about the future of the country but to themselves and family. This difficult moment we Nigerians are facing are somehow a lesson to us, base on sae, Nigeria election are not meant to be on religion or tribal thing again. We supposed to the vote for competent candidates for every given position, more especially for the number one citizen of the country. Ones the head no d good em go affect every part of the body. There is no two ways about it. despite all, we go survive am even if to sae everything decides to go more soar along the line, we go survive am, that makes us a conqueror in every given situation wey we find ourselves in the hand of people wey d rule us.",

Because this thing is no longer funny.But you take a deep look into the African continent, and you peep at some countries in Africa, like Egypt, Morocco Tunisia and south African, they are relatively doing well. How come we cannot take a lift from these countries that within us that are relatively doing well.Because of the high handedness of those leaders in power, that why you see military coup d'etat happening almost every month in the continent, because the military guys cannot just stay and watch their country go into the wrong hands.We just pray for the will of the Lord to happen in Nigeria.",
