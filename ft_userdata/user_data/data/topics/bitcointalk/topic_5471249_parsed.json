  "content": "I wanted to drop this topic in Local Board but I thought of it that it will be a beneficiary to many outside the local board. The main content of the topic is that, the upgraded version of Binance recently use two IDs to send bitcoin or USDT. First you copy or type the pay ID then after when you input the BTC unit or the USDT figure, you click next and it will ask you to type the last two digits of Binance ID and not pay ID so the recipient has to send the two IDs to the sender and make sure you should indicate Pay ID and Binance ID so it will not confused the other people. Both the Pay ID and Binance ID.Process or StepsFor those who want to send their Binance to people to receive Coins.When you login to your Binance, and you want to send your IDs. Click click on your profile and on the left top , copy the ID and save it in a secure place. Then you go and click on PAY on that the same page then you will see another ID again which is different from the former one, copy it and save it as well. Then you have to send the two IDs to the sender (the one who wants to send you the coins), And this for those who want to send Coins. The followings are the processes or the steps. When the receiver send you the IDs, copy the first one which is the Binance ID then click on your Binance profile, and click on PAY then click on SEND, and on the \"Send to Binance User, click on Binance and continue and in the next page enter the amount either in BTC or USDT l, any one the receiver ask you to pay, and click continue. The next step is the main reason why this thread is created. When you click continue, it will ask you to provide the last two digits of the Payee (receiver) ID, so you have to go and check the last two digits of Pay ID and type it in the box and continue. That is all. Many users of Binance are not aware of this and that is why I bring it here.",

But if you have updated your Binance to the new software then you have to use the two IDs. But if you are still in the old version then you can use one ID to make your transaction without stress. But that is risky. So I advise you to update your Binance. It is for security purpose.",

Are you saying they don't request for the two digits when making payment from second time to the same address ? Does it mean after first payment, subsequent payments to any address they will not request the second ID?If I understand you correctly,  you made first payment and they requested it and for second payment they did not.... did both payments go to the same address?",

And what you have done remind me of saying that when you watch a movie and you explain the movie wrong after watching the movie then those who have watched the movie would say say, \"you watch the BACK of the TV\", and even with book, if you misinterpret the book after reading we will say \" you have read the back of the book\".

The old method of Binance internal transaction through UID is not functioning again, although the option is still there, but once you initiate payment you will get this message belowIt was stated clearly that refund are not supported which means that if you do any mistake you money is gone.Is this new internal transaction feature a good thing for Binance users?I did not see anything that is wrong with the previous one because it is easy and safe why all these changes?",

Most times it's stress me it seems like some things got missing from the app so I don't usually preferred using it that way.

Maybe OP did it their way. Why I said so is that whenever there is new app update, the developers always have user friendliness  in mind while updating their app. The latest version should be more user friendly, if the reverse is the case, you know that one of the aim of versioning is defeated.Besides, the Binance interface is not complicated like the DEXs, so anyone can handle Binance pay no matter how often they update it.",
