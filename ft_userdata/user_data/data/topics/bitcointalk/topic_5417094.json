But I don’t think it will work that easily as of this time. Elon Musk hype is over and cannot be revived. It was short lived. We just simply do not know what kind of hype would that be this time around if we wanted Bitcoin to go to the moon again.Probably the next Bitcoin halving? Although no guarantees or promises that the pump after Bitcoin halving will happen, the best time to prepare is when things go quiet like what we have today.",

Others you read, watch or hear, they are not important and are not real reasons for Bitcoin price increases when it happen.Bitcoin will turn from downward to upward when whales test and find that most of weak hands are out and they (whales) can control the market. They will start to pump it with news that you will believe in. In fact those news released when price is up or down is not real reason. Reason is whether it is a time for whales to pump or dump the market.",

Speculators need hype but I'm really keen on the slow grind, building value on strengthening fundamentals. You can't \"build up in the ecosystem\" on hype, really. Look at El Salvador and where that's got them. Besides, the altcoin markets are readily available if you're looking for hype. Plenty of that poured on generously every waking moment.",

If something even small is widely covered in a way that triggers FOMO, people are likely to start buying more of BTC, get excited, increase the demand, ensure the growth of the price. It can be a country introducing favourable crypto regulations, some financial expert saying something positive about Bitcoin, some company starting to accept Bitcoin as payment. Sometimes things like that go without notice, but other times they grab attention and trigger something. I think the same, pretty much, goes for downward trends.",

People will always have what to say when Bitcoin move towards a certain direction, just like the above statement, because we have actually been in a down trend for quite a long while, of which there is every tendency for someone suggesting a further down fall. So for me, the best thing is to just be patient while we hope for an upward movement as its price break the $20k resistance up🚀",
