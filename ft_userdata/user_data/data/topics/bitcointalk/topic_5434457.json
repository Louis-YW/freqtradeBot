When you copy an address to send crypto to he/she is able to switch around some letters/numbers in the middle of the address & send to an address they are in control of which is very similar to the one you use. It’s commonly known as a clipboard hack.The only way to minimise the risk here is don’t go on shady sites using a device you use for crypto. Don’t download movies, torrents, files. Don’t use a VPN, don’t use the device for pretty much anything other than crypto. You shouldn’t be using the device you use for crypto for regular browsing & leisure. You need a seperare device for crypto, it’s the best way to keep it clean.",

I just read through the article and i have to say, that i am not sure though how high the success rate of those hacking attempt is. I would guess that it is extremely low, which is a very good thing of course. So the scammer sends you a worthless token from an adress that is identical to yours on the first and also on the last number but not in between. That is all.This means you have to make a few big mistakes at the same time in order to send the scammer your money. First of all you have to copy the address you want to sent to from a completely different location within metamask than you usually do and secondly you have to be completely blind at the same time to not see that the address is not the same as usual.",

To be honest, this happened to me when I copied an unknown address and I really can't remember where I copied it so I sent the funds to the wrong address. I'm not sure if I've been a victim of that scam or if I was just so reckless that time because of hurrying. It should be a reminder for us that we should always double-check every single character of the address that we will be transacting with.
