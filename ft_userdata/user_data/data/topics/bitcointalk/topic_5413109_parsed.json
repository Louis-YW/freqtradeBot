They have reputation to protect to just made up some skewed trading competition result . This is their 4th time of the competition i think . yeah of course trading always possess a risk .",

Unfortunately, it doesn't completely diminish the possibility that the results are not rigged. A good example is how even the top regulated exchanges are involved in wash and insider trading.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411917.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407225.0Again, I'm not accusing them but I would keep an open mind.",

      "body": "The issues with these sorts of competitions is that the results are likely rigged (by the competitors).If there was no minimum trading amount or if the minimum set was very low then things like this become more likely to happen because one person can.make many accounts, deposit less than a cent/dollar on them and convince the exchange they've made a good profit.A lot of copy trading strategies generally don't set stop losses too because it boosts the chance of their take profit being filled while also boosting their risk - the most successful of those can do 4000% in a few days - they're normally very unreliable to keep going and quite unstable - some traders can do -50 to -100% in a day after a few weeks of a seemingly steady climb up to the thousands%.",

You won't be able to get the \"ROI\" for this kind of competition if you don't have much capital, just focus on a realistic goal such as 10% profit per month or so.",

The site mentions the return on investment and does not specify the date, it may be the return on investment for all time.You are an ordinary investor. When you hear that someone has achieved 3400 % ++ ROI, do not expect to get the same return, otherwise everyone would be rich. The average is always much lower.Such good investment is too good to be true.",

The number one reason behind this is, competition could get on the nerves and when this happens it could lead to catastrophic decisions while trading. I would not want myself in the position where I am making decisions based on emotions and in the want of winning against my opponent. Trading is more or less calm based stuff. One must do it carefully, with perfect logic and without any burden on the decisions. I don’t think it will work so easily for the normal trader like me.",

If I’m not mistaken those percentage is in APY% because that’s the standard percentage use by exchange to measure individual profit to make the percentage huge and attractive. I’m not sure if I’m correct but those 3400% growth is just x34 profit and very manageable to attain on trading with high leverage but this will gonna be risky. Can you verify if the ROI is the percentage of growth of initial margin or the APY%.",

What makes me say that, it's just I've known Indonesian and Chinese players are very competitive when it comes to a game.Excuses if that's off or out of the topic but my point is they're always ready to pay just to rigged the game in order to gain the full control or full prize that they wanted. I don't know why they have to do it though maybe because they love/like the competition or there's something behind that we don't know yet.And with that 3400%++ ROI, I don't think someone would be ready to risk their capital since they were like bidding instead of trading and we don't know exactly if that's monthly or a year result of ROI.",

That can be manipulated but it doesn’t matter, they are the real traders and made a good profit out of it and beside it’s a competition so let’s give the benefit of doubt to them. Trading is fun and profitable once you already established a good trading plan and strategy, that can happen to any traders who are committed to win in this market. This is a proof that we can win against the market, though it may take a lot of work but still its possible to happen.",

Sort of winning and then have the badge and the bragging rights.
