  "content": "When I was growing up, I had a lot of experience gambling on games like:---arm wrestling---card game----PlayStation competition----dice ----animal racing----food eating gamble----playing soccerAnd so much more but its seem the world has evolved so greatly and many things we do before, have now been inputed in the internet and its now makes it access alot easier but I had some recent arguments with some folks in my locality that before, gambling physically with people was more fun than doing online in these recent casino that seem to cover all of our old gambling habits but I argued on the latter. So I thought I should drop here and here some of opinion of most advance gamblers with lots of gambling experience.",

      "body": "As what @Solosanz said, it's more of a PvP (Player vs Player), so of course there is this element of interaction and obviously it is going to be more fun. But if you are comparing like going to physical casinos vs playing online, it's really up to the individual itself.There are people who prior to the advent of online casinos, would rather play and go to traditional base casinos to play, insert their money on a slot machine, or sit on a table for a baccarat or black jack, or roll a dice in a craps game. And so it's more fun as there are also other gamblers that you might know in that casino or even had talks with the dealer itself.Or just stay at home, at the comfort of your living room or bed room, deposit some crypto and then play live roulette as if you are in the casinos. Or just slot games or sports betting.",

I'm a rather introverted type of guy, I'd 100% choose to spend the day in my house doing whatever the hell I want if possible compared to going out on trips and whatnot. Not to say that I wouldn't go out, just that I prefer staying inside, it's not really related to my gambling habits or anything, I reckon I'd do the same stuff whether it was online or not really.",

But as you said it's better to gamble online, because if I compare it to a physical casino it's a bit hassle and dangerous too.It's really different from online because apart from being at home, you can enjoy your time to the fullest as long as the casino you put your money in is right so you don't get scammed, it's that simple.",

However, for easy access and time efficiency, online gambling is very efficient. We can access anytime and anywhere.It's natural that physical gambling might be more fun, but for people who don't like crowds, online gambling is more fun. This goes back to each of us in my opinion, which place is more fun in our opinion, physical gambling or online gambling.",

Because maybe I feel that I am an introvert who prefers peace. I prefer online or internet gambling because that is not something that makes me not have pressure from outside my environment when playing gambling.I think more people in this forum like internet or online gambling because it's easier and doesn't appeal to the public's point of view.",

Online gambling is fun too, but not fun like while I am gambling with friends directly at that time. I even remember when I was in high school, we use to read the past questions for the exams that we are going to do to enter university, we even used it to gamble, like telling a friend that he can not get certain score when answering past questions, and gamble for it. This made us to be very serious and gamble with what helped us. Like I said, online gambling is fun, it also has its advantage, like no fight with who you are gambling with, but house edge makes it kind of partial, but well making the gambling industry to grow.",

But on my experience dominant card games on streets are card related gambling games simply because it is more accessible. Regarding online platform, it is part of technological advancements; a matter as well of adapting with changes. Most of the people nowadays are more into online activities and with this, activities we often do on the actual or real life instances also moved into the web. Other examples are mailing. But not to get far from the topic; regardless of the platform the activity itself is entertaining as long as you are able to manage the risks in gambling, it won't be stressful. Managing risk is simply managing gambling behavior.",

The physical casino gives more entertainment of course there are a lot of actual games you can play and get fun along with other players, also more than that they could provide other services so the players could really enjoy playing gambling like shows, drinks and etc. If there's a chance I could go to a casino like in Las Vegas ill grab the opportunity to come right there.",

They can gamble from home, using cell phones, laptops, or computers. Today everything has been facilitated by technology, and we must be grateful for that technology.

That of physical gambling is also risky but the fact that in an online gambling, you dont have physical contact with your opponent and when you win no one know anything about your money unlike the physical gambling where you may be attacked by your loosing opponent. That makes internet gambling more fun than the physical. Again, internet gambling goves you the opportunity to play more than one game.",

I may not have that much gambling experience but I've also seen those changes as a teen that have become a gambler and saw the traditional games up to the common and modern ones.

In fact, we can really use the advantages of playing at online casinos to help our economy or finances if you can play wisely and correctly.But all of that is just an expression because in fact every best choice depends on ourselves according to the needs we need.",
