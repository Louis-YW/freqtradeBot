I agree; it's great to see whether the forum has any additional features for that but I think there's nothing to worry cause we can just easily reported it to be merged.

But I don't think it helps a lot.Two pros I can think of this feature:1) Would save mods time from merge reports.2) Multi-quotes are pain on mobile devices, it's easier to just click quote and reply. This could make mobile users lives bit easier, if implemented.And yes, I agree with timelimit, would probably do better with less than 24 hrs tho.",
