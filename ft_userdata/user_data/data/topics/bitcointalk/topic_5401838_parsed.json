Anyone else notice a drop in quality from MicroBT?I haven't had any experience with the latest whatsminers, but I've noticed that many miners are pretty particular about what pool they're mining on.  What pool are you mining on with them?  It might help some of the sleuths around here get to the bottom of your issue.  I would also recommend trying out a couple different pools and seeing if you're having the same problem with them all if you have time to troubleshoot.  You might find that it's more profitable to mine somewhere else based on your hardware.  Just a thought of something to try to help diagnose the issue.",
