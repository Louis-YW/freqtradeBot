  "content": "Hi. We are trying to start using a multisig taproot address in regtest. We can create the address, and it seems to be a valid one. However, when we try to spend funds received in said address, we run into a problem: the witness script we are trying to use is apparently not valid. We are trying to build the witness script this way:        address_info = self.call(\"getaddressinfo\", multisig_address)        witness_program_hex = address_info[\"witness_program\"]        witness_version = address_info['witness_version']        witness_script = bytes([witness_version]) + binascii.unhexlify(witness_program_hex)        witness_script = binascii.hexlify(witness_script).decode()(this is basically Copilot code)where multisig_address is the created taproot address. However, when we try to sign the transaction using signrawtransactionwithkey, we receive an error:  'Witness program was passed an empty witness'. We are not 100% sure exactly what the error is, but we believe it is related to the witness script not being valid, since the \"decodescript\" command with witness_script gives us: {'asm': '85 OP_UNKNOWN [error]', 'desc': 'raw(0155ee431293f4e29678b294e48f96d5ac47678ccba2d7c33783f99014ddfa8fcf)#0tv3kpc7', 'type': 'nonstandard'}Again, any advice or guidance would be appreciated.",
