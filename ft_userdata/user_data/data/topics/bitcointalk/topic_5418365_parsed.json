So what will I do to like a post/comment which I like?Theres no like button here in forum, Its not like facebook or instagram. The forum is a hub for discussion and only merit is can be given on the post you like.Btw merit can be receive if you have some quality or helpful post that like by others.I think you should study first about the forum so you could know more about it. Try to read first all the pinned message here on Beginners and Help Section.",

By that I mean that Merits are really in essence and indicator to something that the meriter found interesting, although that in itself has multiple reasons that often go beyond a mere like. Nevertheless, it should suffice to reference the comments you found interesting, and comment on them, bearing in mind to go beyond the \"thanks\", \"great\" and \"cool\" short-type comments, over to something more elaborate in terms of content substance and depth.",

So what will I do to like a post/comment which I like?There's no function for the option of like here but I think you can also make it with your expressions in two ways, give a reply that goes along with the same taught to the thread discussion and secondly you can merit such post but i believe you know what it means to get merit and to send smerit, you need to work for it in other to earn it, in doing so it means you have received a meaningful taughts of ideas on that particular quality post to have deserve your merit.",

So what will I do to like a post/comment which I like?There are no \"likes\" or \"dislikes\" features on the bitcointalk forum as on other social media.If there is a post that you like and it's useful, I suggest bookmarking the post link. If at any time you need the information back, you can easily view it again or make it a reference in the future.Another alternative is to send merit on posts that you like.
