  "content": "Four weeks ago, protests erupted in southern Iran after the death of the student Mahsa Amini who was arrested by the morality police on charges of not wearing the veil and brutally abused her, which led to her death.Since the outbreak of those protests, and since Iran is a semi-isolated country due to the sanctions imposed on it based on its nuclear file, all the information we receive from official media hostile to the Iranian government or from countries opposed to Iran. I mean, the information is not from a reliable source, especially since international humanitarian organizations have no activity inside Iran.According to international media, the protests have reach their fourth week with the publication of videos of students chanting slogans against the Shah’s rule and martial law that restrict women’s freedom, while the official media reports that these protests are limited and have subversive purpose and are supported from abroad.In your opinion, is there really a large-scale protest movement that aims to bring major changes in the country? Or is this only media incitement aimed at inciting international public opinion against Iran?",

At that time, they became interested in the country, but the economic situation in most of these countries had partially halted international politics and the contributions of world leaders. In support of the Russian war, Iran has provided aid to the Russians. There is a need for Iran and Iranians to work together to restore democracy, and religious sentiment is also contributing to the divergent views on the issue.",

Where the media deliberately exaggerated the popular manifestations demanding the overthrow of the regimes, which later turned out to be among the strategies of the countries benefiting from that political change.Iran is a dictatorial country, as described by its enemies and as reports issued by it unofficially tell us, but no one can really determine the popular will if we take into account that the society is conservative and fundamentalist.The conclusion is that it is not possible to determine the popular will based on protests published by the media from countries that are in conflict with Iran.Personally, I support change in Iran, and I do not hope that the Iranian people will remain under the authority of religious sheikhs, but the current scene does not really reflect the reality of the situation.",

Or is this only media incitement aimed at inciting international public opinion against Iran?That is why we normally said, christian RELIGION is the best, you will never and ever hear that Christians kill another christian because one disobeys law of Moses or disobey the dispensation of GRACE (Jesus Christ)  or another Religion fellow because he insulted Christ. But we see these things from the opposition Religion. I don't know why. Because of veil a very brilliant scholar was brutally killed and the so call police is very happy and comfortable that they have done a great thing to be promoted by the authorities. It is very bad. Well I am not from Iran so I can't give the situational report over there but the freedom socialization must be giving to  the citizens. If possible Liberal Democracy should be practiced in the country. What has happened in Iran is the same thing that happens in my country.And only thing that can make a change in the protest is for the government to implement the request of the protesters. If the government refused to implement the outcry of the protesters then the police will be doing it as an habit.",

Although the Arab Spring didn't bring the expected changes in the Arab world there are few positive amendments in government. We cannot guarantee that this protest in Iran would lead to major changes in the government because a large part of the population is still held down by some religious beliefs that counter the purpose of this protest. Most Muslims don't believe that women should enjoy freedom and liberty. Another impediment is that Iran is highly isolated from the world which would make it very difficult for some Western powers to penetrate the government or protest. The protesters need financial and moral support for them to continue this protest. But we cannot totally write off these courageous and fearless protesters, maybe they might become the catalyst for the change Iran needs.",

Or is this only media incitement aimed at inciting international public opinion against Iran?I actually came here to see if anybody were talking about this.Let me first say that I have a bias because I have an Iranian wife, and I know a number of Iranians trough her. All of the ones I know wishes for regime change. The group around me is of course not representative of the population as a whole.I would also say it's extremely hard to make opinion polls inside Iran. If you call phone numbers, they can easily be scared to answer honestly, and if you use internet polls there can be bias in who takes the poll.However there is a data point that proves massive dissent towards the current regime. In the last general election in 2021 (Let's be clear, this is not an actual democratic election system) there were a movement among people that were fed up with the current regime, and that movement agitated for vote boycott. If you compare to the former turnout numbers plus the increase in blank votes, it's actually 32% of the population who participated in the boycott. On top of that, it is unknown how many actually already didn't vote in the former 2017 election, for  the same reason. which had a turnout of 70%. But it's probably a good share of the last 30%.This is already a big share of the population, based on the official numbers. This is of course if you even believe that the numbers are accurate and the boycott weren't even larger. It's very embarrassing for the regime and this is a country where the press is highly state controlled, and propaganda driven and you might be prosecuted for political view which the regime deems threatening.Official numbers show 32% boycott + N% of the ones already not voting (The elected president got 35% of the populations votes). I think the the number is most likely significantly higher but I can't prove it. No matter what it's a massive amount of people who actually very well could decide the outcome of a presidential election if they were actually allowed to vote for any candidate they wanted.",

To actually revolutionize it, the government have to be forced out in one way or another, or be forced to change the system fundamentally. There are several ways this can happen in a revolution.No doubt it's very difficult, the question is if it's within the realm of the possible or not.South Korea got it's democracy from the military dictatorship when 5 million people went on the streets. They simply surrendered to the giant sea of people.In other cases the pressure leads to an inside coup, though the Islamic republic has done a lot to avoid this scenario from happening.A general nationwide strike could also be something that could put immense pressure on the regime.Another question though. If revolution doesn't come now, does it come later by pure demographic tendency. The protesters are very young, many teenagers, where as the rulers are old men with the supreme leader being 83 years old. If the younger generations, generally despise the regime then the pressure might simply grow and grow over time.",

My question is, is this what Islam is about, or is it a religion of wickedness and heartless tyranny? It is always important to respect the laws of the land. Iranians have all the rights to make hijab compulsory if French/India can ban it. It is not a rule that should be ignored when it comes to torturing prisoners to death. It doesn't matter how many protesters there are, Iran is impervious to western hypocrisy.There is no such thing as a right thing when there are two wrongs!",

Human rights, civil rights are on a whole other scale better in the west, than in a country like Iran. This is not just about hijab, it's about general tyranny.What is hypocrisy is when we in the west talk about human rights, but go do business deals with dictators. Then human rights become all talk.The Iranian people have a right to fight for freedom and dignity, and not supporting this would be hypocrisy.Also this is not something the Iranian people have chosen. This is not a democracy where a majority can choose the direction. Is the legitimacy of a government in your opinion, just whoever have the biggest hammer to beat the population into submission, they should then rule?",

As long as this isolation continues, the Iranian people's chances of achieving change remain limited.",

On this basis, it is the one who is at the mouth of the cannon with every rebellion, whether it is subjected to violation or led the protest movements. Today in Afghanistan there are only women who are demonstrating against the Taliban laws that prevent them from entering secondary education institutes. Their demands may be limited and small that do not exceed individual freedoms, but they are able to mobilize public opinion against the regime to make the demands larger.",

This had nothing to do with \"wearing a veil\" (Iranian wear scarves not veils). This was a viral news about police beating a woman to death which turned out to be a lie. Imagine the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter movement in US but based on a lie since the footage is released from the moment she is arrested, moved to the station and her walking around healthy and untouched and her falling down because of her preexisting medical condition.The protests weren't only in Southern Iran, they took place in most of Iran but they basically lasted about 2 or 3 days since that was how long it took the authorities to solve the legal and privacy issues and go through the bureaucracy before they can release the video footage I mentioned above and other privacy invading information about the deceased such as her medical history (eg. the prior brain surgery that had created complications, her fathers statements about her preexisting condition, their troubles in acquiring the medicine she needed because of the sanctions that US has enforced that prevents importing said medicine and has significantly increased their prices which is the example of medical terrorism that none of those English outlets are allowed to mention).Over the past couple of weeks (after the initial days) all we've seen were some scattered destabilization attempts by either young idiots who are brainwashed enough to still not believe the footage that was released (like those who still think earth is flat) with trained foreign operatives and some terrorist cells trying revive a finished unrest by killing innocent people and blaming it on the government. Majority of such actions are neutralized like the woman who was caught carrying 50kg of explosive material trying to plant it in the Grand Bazaar, but sadly a handful of them fall through the cracks like in Shiraz: [Disturbing content ahead:] https://en.irna.ir/news/84924878/Sensitive-Content-Shiraz-terrorist-attackQuote from: Kavelj22 on November 10, 2022, 09:32:51 PMIt seems that the Iranian government succeeded in eliminating the popular protests after weeks of continuous pressure, in which more than 200 Iranian citizens were killed and hundreds were arrested on various charges.There is not yet any final official count but the last one I saw was 43 deaths with 30 of them being security forces.99% of the names they are reporting in foreign media (such as the London based outlets that are considered terrorist organization) are people who are either alive or had died long ago. In fact there is currently a trend in Iranian social media from people who see their own names in said lists like on BBC and post a video about being alive and demanding these outlets stop spreading lies. Or their families who are now forced to talk about how their daughter had died 6 months ago in a car accident or another family who were forced to reveal their daughter committed suicide 2 weeks ago by jumping off a building (the footage of it exists too!).Quote from: Kavelj22 on November 10, 2022, 09:32:51 PMThis strengthened the position of the Kurdish fighters in Iranian Kurdistan, but their cause is different because they want secession and the declaration of autonomy, and the issue of basic freedoms is not a priority for them.There are no \"Kurdish fighters\" in Iran's Kurdistan. There are only terrorist organizations in northern Iraq (not Iran) in a region between Iraq, Iran and Turkey and all 3 countries have been fighting them. These are the groups that are being introduced as \"Iranian\" and wanting \"freedom\" which interestingly enough have ties with both United States and ISIS. They have been trying to smuggle a lot of weapons into Iran over the past couple of weeks to create artificial bloodshed which are mostly seized and neutralized by the authorities. P.S. The 30-page long report released by the intelligence community is actually a pretty good case study of the biggest operation in the biggest and longest cold war that is we've been fighting. https://isna.ir/xdMFyKThe old Stanford University's 57-page article had also found a tiny part of the same thing (the part about brainwashing campaign) that is reflected in the above report too https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:nj914nx9540/unheard-voice-tt.pdf",
