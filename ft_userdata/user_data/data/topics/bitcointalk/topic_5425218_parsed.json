Have a nice night. Cheers, TREADAs far as I know they have physical security chip that helps you know the authenticity of the device. You can verify if the device is legit and if it has been tampered with or not. But still, since you will be holding your savings/investment, why take the risk or losing everything? Tell your dad to return it and order directly from the manufacturer. Might be few bucks for costly, but still worth buying from them. At least your dad won't be worried, paranoid and lose his sleep over the device.",

In crypto, you do not trust you verify.â€¢ Question how their products are closed source and it is impossible for buyers to verify the code which it runs on, leaving risks for hacks,â€¢ Also question the durability of their products.I personally don't use ledger and refrain from suggesting a hardware wallet to use, as it's a delicate business.Do your own research based on what you prioritize in a hardware wallet and make your decision.Quote from: fennic on December 03, 2022, 04:52:45 AMI think ledger wallet is for those people have larger money I mean from 100k dollars plus value.With a Bitcoin holding worth $1k, buying a hardware wallet is a shrewd decision, considering how much they are worth relative to it. If you go as high as $5k, then it becomes a necessity.",

It is better to buy directly from the seller to be 100% sure that you have an original device. In this case, even minimal doubts can do harm if they are justified. Technically, ledger is still a safe place to store crypto, but the firm's reputation has been called into question several times due to lost user data leaked to the network. For many, this is a reason to buy trezor instead of ledger, which is not inferior in terms of reliability and by now has a better reputation.",

I had the same worry when I was buying my Ledger, and decided to order it directly from manufacturer and guess what happened? Ledger data got leaked and my email (luckily just that, it could have been worse) ended up being spammed with bunch of scam mails. My point is, there is always a chance that you get screwed when ordering something like hardware wallet so even if ordering directly from them, try to order to one of those mailbox services so even in case of data leak hackers don't get your name.Quote from: tread93 on December 03, 2022, 04:41:03 AMCan someone tell me what is the currently the ledger wallet that is most secure?

A small correction: the Coldcard is based on open-source code but the final product does not come with an open-source license. That means, you are not allowed to modify or redistribute Coldcard code. You also can't use their code to create your own hardware wallet. The codebase is verifiable though, and that should be the point you should focus on if that's something that is important to you.@tread93A few things about the Ledger.- You have ways to check and ensure that the software and hardware of a Ledger is genuine. For instructions on how to do that, you go to the official website or read this support document.- Only a genuine Ledger HW can connect to Ledger Live (the native app for your hardware wallet) servers. The fake ones can't. - You can also physically open the device and check the hardware inside, but you should know that by doing that, you void the warranty. This is the link with instructions if you want to do that.Â  Â - When you first turn on your Ledger HW, it's supposed to display a welcome message of some sorts. I am not sure what exactly it says now. \"Hi Ledger\", \"Welcome to Ledger\", or the screen simply displays the ledger logo. Keep an eye on that. It only happens during the onboarding process and the first time the device is turned on. If it doesn't, you aren't the first one who has turned it on.Â To sum up. Never use a HW with preinstalled seed. Confirm everything with the information available on the official site. Download software only from the official site, not based on instructions given to you elsewhere. Verify if your device is genuine before using it. Stop and ask questions if you are in doubt, like you did with this thread. Ask the Ledger support or people on this forum if something is not clear.",

The price difference can start from 30 to 50%. It is probably not a problem if something like Nano S is your target though. I just wish it can be even cheaper.",
