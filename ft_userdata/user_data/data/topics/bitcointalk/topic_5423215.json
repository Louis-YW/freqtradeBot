  "content": "Okay so earlier I came across a site that claimed that it's possible to get bitcoins for free by just; playing offline and online games, watching ads and videos, participating in airdrops and so on. They also recommended apps that give out bitcoin for free Â like coinbase. Bitcoin, ranked as one of the most expensive cypto currencies can be earned for free by just watching ads? Nah I just find it hard to believe cause I've seen a lot of scam related schemes that claim to give out bitcoin for free. I don't know, I might be wrong cause I'm still a newbie that's why I brought this here, to see if I can get some clarification on the matter. Thank you.",

Both concepts are the same because Bitcoin is measured by its fiat value. Using the faucet example, the values per claim have mainly been in cents but BTC was only valued in cents as well. Now you'd only get like single-digit satoshis and a bunch of ads right in your face. And those courses from exchanges like Binance that give free crypto seldom teach on moving your funds to a cold wallet. If they get hacked one day, the cryptos you supposedly earn become mere numbers.For instance, if you were to complete a job that pays $20 in Bitcoin, at the current rate of $16,550, that's ~0.0012 BTC. Some fees are lost over conversion and network/ blockchain but they're like mere cents to a few dollars at most.",

Most will give nothing or will give worthless coins you cannot exchange anywhere.Playing games.. I don't know.Faucets and websites that pay for views/clicks do exist and many do pay out (not all of them though!!!), but if you take into account the huge amount of time that requires, if you also take into account that your computer is also consuming electricity you'll pay for, ... it's not worth it.Afaik the most known and reputed faucet is https://freebitco.in/, if you want to start with something, but I recommend you do something more lucrative with your time (if nothing else, then learn some skills that can give you a better paid job) and just buy bitcoin with your fiat.",

All you have to do is try to have bitcoin, whether you buy or play a faucet. Every satoshi now is worth",

Most often it is a miserable amount, but if you are a beginner, it is a very good way to get better acquainted with the way the network works.

You're still wasting precious time that you could be using for something else far more productive.Many people don't consider investing their time as an investment, I think the OP is primarily thinking about how to get BTC without investing fiat. I agree that faucets and various PTCs are very slow and poorly paid ways to earn BTC, although some would be surprised if this was the case in the past when BTC was only worth a few hundred $. Faucets used to pay 1000 to 5000 satoshi per claim, currently they pay 1-15 sat per claim, but the fiat value of those coins has not changed too much.What apparently no one takes into account is that these questions are mostly asked by very young people who cannot yet do anything \"productive\" nor can they legally buy BTC because they are underage. Sometimes it may be better to spend a little time on something than to invest directly, and besides, there are much worse ways to waste time, such as watching TV or playing games, which have become the daily routine of a large number of young people.",

Much better if you focus your time on finding a job to get stable income that you can use to purchase Bitcoin rather doing time consuming things in exchange for a penny worth reward. Newbie should stop giving away there time and effort to owner of this kind of apps that surely just using traffic for there own profit and just share small portion to worker like you that do most of the job.If you are just using free time, why not focus on freelance job that will reward Bitcoin. Thereâs a lot of freelance job vacancies available on LinkedIn from crypto company that in needs of additional work force for there project. Find a decent job and stop looking for free stuff. Free stuff like faucet, airdrop and etc is not worthy anymore because crypto market is already grow.It only works before because a penny back then is now more than a dollar now due to the price growth. A price growth like that is very hard to happened on current situation.",
