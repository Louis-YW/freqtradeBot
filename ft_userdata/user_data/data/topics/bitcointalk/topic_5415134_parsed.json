  "content": "First of all i try to avoid chit chat as this is my first post tho i read this forum for over 10 years but never actually made a decision to create account or i might have had one back in the day but forgot about it.As we all know there.s plentora of games based on crypto , i do play the tinyworlds one for around 6 months The game is based on BSC chain Bep20 here is game links docs and medium posts about the game mechanics and roadmaphttps://tinyworlds.io/https://docs.tinyworlds.io/https://medium.com/@tinyworld.gamefiThere is only 1 Bilion in Tinc that is going to be released in 5 years time and almost half of it is burned i noticed there.s not a single post about it so let me be first we hee The game is idle game has it.s own coin $Tinc, BNB is used for fees and BUSD is used for ingame transactions , it was recently promoted as supported game by Binance BABT token so it means a thumbs up for you to look at The thing is i know there are a lot of members in this forum that know how to check reliability and suggest if this game might have a future or no , i think yes and it might be sooner after my post hehe",
