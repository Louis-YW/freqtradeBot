  "content": "Today I watched a documentary that claimed the first thing Hitler did when he invaded a country. Was to visit their central bank and plunder all of its valuable assets. Nazis were able to seize tons of gold, cash, art and precious assets in this way. Sometimes invaded nations shipped their gold reserves and assets overseas to be housed in central bank vaults of safe countries. Other times they did not.Does anyone know where ukraine's central bank is located?Image link: Â https://i.ibb.co/fqKRQHw/ukraine-national-bank-location.jpgIs it safe to say that Putin invaded ukraine and went straight to the national central bank in kyiv where $28+ billion is held to make a withdrawal. Would ukraine have been better off holding $28 billion in bitcoin assets. It wouldn't matter the size of Putin's army. He could never steal the assets unless he had the private key.",

Plus there were preparations before Feb 24, lots of valuable stuff was moved out of Kyiv, like government servers and documents.Putin attacked Kyiv because capturing the capital is always one of the biggest strategic goals of any war. There's no economic justification here, the costs of waging war, the effects of sanctions are orders of magnitude higher than any potential spoils of war. This war has ideological roots, no the economic ones.",

      "body": "The reason may not just be for theft purposes or to carry away valuables out from kyiv. I watched sometimes when certain important important monument, statue, document etc were evacuated from the city. Attacking the capital city shows more seriousness for combat and to send a signal the intention to overrun the country. The capital city is important to capture in most wars because that is the seat of power and that will destabilize the government more than attacking less important cities of a country that has less important facilities to the government. Just as you will expect, Kyiv is important , it is more organized and has more of the educational facilities, cultural, industrial and the hob to technology in Ukraine.",

Of course, this is normal. The fact that the Central Bank is there, although it may be important, I see it as secondary, because apart from gold I imagine that there will be a lot of Ukrainian currency (Grivna). In the hypothetical case that Putin ends up taking power over the whole Ukraine I imagine that this currency would be worth 0, imposing the ruble as the official currency.Quote from: Hydrogen on September 02, 2022, 08:39:20 PMWould ukraine have been better off holding $28 billion in bitcoin assets. It wouldn't matter the size of Putin's army. He could never steal the assets unless he had the private key.Probably, but I don't see it as realistic today. I await the day when some central bank announces that it buys Bitcoin for its reserves, which I'm sure is going to be a very small percentage to its total reserves, on the order of 1% or thereabouts. If that happens, other banks copy it and it becomes widespread, we could see central banks acquiring more and more in the future, but that's a long way off, I think.",

Russia is still wealthy today after 6 months of war and sanctions so it's not thier very objective since they were very concerned about the security that an unfriendly president in Ukraine is inviting NATO. But it would be too naive not to think Putin is up to reclaiming the Soviet Union Region since he started with Georgia and Crimea.",

He is a miserable likeness of Hitler, although he copies many of his \"achievements\" - from speeches to the Hitler Youth, symbols and much more.Hitler's goal was to bleed, financially including the enemy. For classic Russians, theft is part of the culture. In Ukraine, they did not even steal, they were engaged in looting. What can be carried away - voprovali, what is impossible - destroyed. Or they showed the \"Russian soul\", and for example they shit in baby carriages, cribs, bathtubs and sinks. You do not compare Germanic Nazism with the bastard-cowardly structure of the kleptomaniac-deceitful-cowardly ideology of the Kremlin's under-furrers!",

And plus, a government can't wholly depend on putting the country's wealth into bitcoin.When the attack came, they can't dispose and liquidate their assets and put it into bitcoin. That's just too late.And as for the central banks, it's really where it's placed in most countries on their capital.",

Why would Putin rob a bank whereas he made sure other institutions didn't stop operating during the military operation. Workers were told to continue work under Russia military protection while Ukrainian soldiers guarding the facilities where released to go home and be with their families. Seems like a person who wasn't interested in sabotaging the economy. He even allowed them to export their foods",
