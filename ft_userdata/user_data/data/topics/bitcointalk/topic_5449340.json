If you really want to focus on the technical aspects of Bitcoin, basic knowledge also needs to be known. If you do not have initial knowledge of Bitcoin, it will not be an obstacle if you have to immediately learn Bitcoin Engineering and Development. This forum is one of the most accurate sources you will need. Getting involved in every discussion and discussing anything about Bitcoin technical developments will provide knowledge gradually. It is very rare for beginners to want to get involved in Bitcoin development and technical discussions.",

It's great that you have decided to go deep into the technical aspects of bitcoin. I have myself decided the same and have already started reading \"Mastering bitcoin 2nd edition\".As others have already mentioned there's already a plethora of information available for us to grasp.Fortunately, we have all the resources and it's just the time that we have to put into it to go in deep.",

P2P comes without middlemen. That's for centralized exchanges that creates fake p2p for their customers because they still act as middlemen, so it is peer to centralized exchange, and then to the other peer. If you want to trade without middlemen, there are good decentralized exchanges that allows you to trade directly with the other peer, without the exchange holding your funds, Bisq and AgoraDesk are examples of true p2p exchange that you can use.",
