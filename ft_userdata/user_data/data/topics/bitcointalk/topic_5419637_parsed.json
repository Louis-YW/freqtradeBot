You can't....Who's to say that someone didn't snap a picture of them when Mike printed them out?Or the original owner did? Â or I did?Are you planning on using the keys? I sure hope not.... Â \"Not your keys, not your coins\"Here's a picture of the VOID coin papers being laser cut...Â  could just as easily been the sheet of private keys:",

It's my auction. lol. Novelty/historical value. \"Better\" is subjective. If you're going to use a private key that you know that me and Mike, and now minerjones have seen, you deserve to get rekt. Someone retracted their bid when I didn't have them included. I included them, and it's another issue all over again.",

Now that you mention it, I will have one full sheet (16 pks) and two of the gold stickers (8+8), plus original envelope with Mike's handwriting on it. Will probably auction this all off in one go.",
