The entrepreneur named Bitgod , who appeared on the scene 2-3 months ago, took over the BTC chain.The transaction costs of the Mint was around 10 USD, as of today, the market value of OXBT has exceeded 100x, less than 3 days later...Even though it was one of the fairest launches of recent times, there were mischievous kids who \"multi accounted\" it, that's their career and specialty. Real alpha is hidden in one-sentence notes in between the lines. Don't let the multiplayer NPC's seize gems like this, I suggest you follow this forum very carefully üçÄWe will have other notifications for you too in English if I gauge good enthusiasm. There was a crazy OTC environment where even the whitelist was sold for 1000 USD+, ones who bought OXBT off the market on initial listing even before the public mint are also very happy customers now, only in crypto .",
