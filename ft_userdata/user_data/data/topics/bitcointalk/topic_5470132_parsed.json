Litecoin is the best example on why having the founder a round is bullshit because he sold his holdings at most during the bullrun while he still promoting LTC around.Bitcoin becomes a total decentralized blockchain because no one is leading the development but rather community decides on what to do next by approving proposals. I believe the decision will always be bias with Satoshi proposal if he is active around.",

About two years ago, someone was able to access Satoshi’s account in one of the forums, which Satoshi used when he published the code for the first time, and he was able to access that account via The email used by Satoshi.All these people know that no one believes they are Satoshi, but they get enough attention to continue this lie.",

A lot of question needs to be answer and obviously, the amount of bitcoin he supposedly have in his wallet is worth billions of dollars already.However, I don't think he will surface for the money though, I mean he could have seen it from the background, if he is still alive and yet would choose to be anonymous as what his project preaches.",

So, what is he waiting for not having sold it on ATH before?.I even hope this happens because someone holding too much of the bitcoin supply is not a good thing for the market. If he shows up and sells all those bitcoin holdings, it will be a great opportunity for us to buy them back at a low price. But I believe that even if he were alive and still owned that 1 million bitcoins, he would not sell it at this time. Looking at the development of bitcoin, we can easily see that the value of bitcoin will increase much higher in the future. So he wouldn't be stupid enough to sell it now or at a low price.",

Satoshi will not make any moves that would reveal his whereabouts, his name has become a legend among crypto lovers. It is hoped that his existence will only eliminate public curiosity about the figure who has changed world transactions with his creation, but he will still keep his identity safe by allowing Bitcoin to continue according to the original plan when it was first created.",

But, for emergence today, I'm the first person who doesn't believe it.Of course Bitcoin is public but it is not owned by anyone, but Satoshi .if Satoshi  is the inventor of Bitcoin and he has its source code, then after he returns he can do anything.There is no evidence that he  owns a large amount of Bitcoin but there is also no evidence that he does not own any Bitcoin.Maybe Satoshi has a true understanding of Bitcoin value, and is thinking much further than selling at $65,000.If we can believe in Bitcoin, which he invented, then we have to believe in Satoshi,because there is still no evidence of who Satoshi was.Was it a person or a group, and where did he go after inventing Bitcoin,There is no evidence of his death, so the fear of his appearance will continue to exist among people.",

Satoshi Nakamoto is a mysterious person... Ooh no... They are group of hackers. Satoshi doesn't use twitter... Ooh no... That twitter account is operated by Craig Wright. He is just somewhere, living among us, maybe using the same popular social medias, but we can't literally tell because he/she/they are mysterious.",

You see, people like to make \"gods\" out of people. They like to look at what certain entity says and follow that. If Satoshi were around, many would have looked to what he says and what side he stays on in any argument about any matter (like the block size war). And that goes against the spirit of a decentralized network.In other words Bitcoin is more decentralized without Satoshi Nakamoto around.",

Why are you using the word \"HE\" where in fact you don't even know if Satoshi's a male. Anyway to answer your question coming from a newbie, with how Bitcoin is right now, and how it works, I don't think that we need Satoshi anymore although it will be a good thing if Satoshi comes back, but what are the chances for it to happen? Close to zero. I know that you asked this OP because you're curious, and I have this type of question in my mind for a very long time as well, but I guess let's just assume that Satoshi will never come out, and help the developers anymore. I guess Satoshi is happy right now with what's happening with Bitcoin even though not many people sees it as a currency, but rather an asset.Next time, don't use he if you are pertaining to Satoshi.",
