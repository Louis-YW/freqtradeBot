Read the forum rules to make your experience here easierhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0#post_rulesI can’t say I’m surprised that more people are learning of bitcoin and bitcointalk forum, judging by the work I see on the forum about forum members in Africa spreading the bitcoin gospel to their family, friends and anyone who cares to listen. Even the newbies are in a haste to teach bitcoin to others so I can only hope the awareness you got was the right one. Quote from: Mr.suevie on December 16, 2022, 11:00:18 AMBitcoin is really pulling waved all over in Africa and most people who are exposed to it are really breaking out of the financial entrapment they have been in some many years by the government controled fiat currency. Fiat isn’t the cause of poverty just as bitcoin isn’t going to make you rich, you need fiat to buy bitcoin. Even though you say your friends are all saving their money in bitcoin, you should know that bitcoin is volatile, saving $1000 in bitcoin right now can turn to $990 or 1080 the next day.",

If the financial entrapment is about government control, then quite rightly Bitcoin affords its users the freedom and control of their funds that's in the network, but if your statement connotes that Bitcoin is making these people rich, then mind you that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, but a sustainable long term project, and except these people are early adopters, they'll have to be patient for quite a long time to reap ROI on their investments.Quote from: Mr.suevie on December 16, 2022, 11:00:18 AMMe myself i have been through hell trying to save money in my fiat currency and instead of the banks to be securing your money instead in my place here the banks actually cut your money and destabilized your whole plan you have for that money.Bank charges are somewhat normal, but btw if you intend to save your money in the Bitcoin network, ensure you do it the correct way, do not save it in a centralized exchange, but in a wallet that only you has the keys too, mind you: not your keys, not your coins.Quote from: Mr.suevie on December 16, 2022, 11:00:18 AMBut the awareness i have seen so far about this bitcoin innovation in my area is really something else its like everyone around me has exploded in saving their money in bitcoin which I still don't how its operate but am curious and interested in finding out more so i was directed here for more exposure by a friend and am hoping am going get everything right here about this massive awareness in my area about bitcoin. There is a rule of thumb that you shouldn't forget, and that's to invest only what you can afford to lose, thus as you save your money in the Bitcoin network, mind you that you should do so with a money that you can afford to lose. Having said that, Bitcoin awareness is becoming a thing, but people are not massively saving their money in Bitcoin like you say, they still trust the bank because many haven't acquired the knowledge of being their own bank, and as a noob that you are, it is much better for you to leave your money in the bank for now, and when you've understood how to use the network you can then gradually build up your Bitcoin stash.",

Very nice to hear from you. User adoption is growing in Africs, as Bitcoin just works and fixes problems. Bitcoin adoption will come from Africa and other nations of the developing world. Bitcoin adoption will come from the people deciding to adopt it, ditching their local shitcoins. Mass adoption won’t come from the top, not from an ETF, not from a bill in posing it as legal tender. Well done, and welcome to the forum!!",

It's a smart idea to consider joining people around to save money in bitcoin, but before you do that, have you tried to comprehend how volatile the cryptocurrency market is from them for an explanation? The price fluctuation of bitcoin price.Due to bitcoin's volatile nature, I wouldn't suggest that you join your friends to start saving your money in it, if not with your spare money you should invest.Since the market is unpredictable, Bitcoin should only be used as a tool for long-term investments rather than for storing your life's savings. Invest in what you can afford to lose",

Welcome to the forum and you're in the right place to learn about Bitcoin, just read all sticky threads (pinned post) here.  Just keep reading until you'll learn, as a newbie, it's ideal to spend more time reading than posting here in the forum. Understand what investment you've in because Bitcoin is very volatile and every now and then it will fluctuate and it might one day you'll confuse seeing your portfolio lose its value.  Bitcoin is the best investment, when it comes to savings it means it's a long-term holding and Bitcoin is very suitable for that choice.",

Compared to when I got involved in the space, truely bitcoin has had some massive influence in the way of life of every enthusiast that have involved themselves with the currency in Africa. Also on the forum the inflow of Africans and those willing to write about what's happening over here has increased as well. It gives me joy seeings all this which only points to one direction that Bitcoin is truely here to stay. As for savings with banks, I don't know much about other western world but in general it's not advisable to save your money with banks since inflation will eat alway all the profits you'll be expecting. African banks typically are horrible, at every opportunity they get they'll want to take money away from you even when you open an account with them just for saving of your money.Stick with Bitcoin buddy, you're better off hoarding money in Bitcoin than the banks, ignore the volatility of the price, long term you stand to benefits as Bitcoin is design in a way that the price will keep increasing provided the demand is present.",

This is the type of good news people what to hear about Bitcoin, because it was created to improve any government that make it legal and also help the citizens to escape  slavery of third party in the country which many bitcoiners wish to see all over the Africa. This is a welcome development to Africa, and I believe Africa governments will do everything possible to create a good environment for bitcoiners so that they will spread Bitcoin in all areas in the communities.",

At first glance, this sentence has a long term saving tone, but the end dulls the impression of hodling in bitcoin. Because the price volatility can as well destabilize your whole plans for a moment, and definitely restored the lost money after the winter. Unlike banks. I'd advise you to stick to saving long term with bitcoin, so that you'll profit more or better go for USDT. Happily, it's a perfect place you've found yourself. Soon all these financial challenges stated on your thread will be out of date, as you read the forum it'll unveil financial solutions; savings, asset management and most of all wisdom. Hence, it's high-time people enjoyed their sweat, and take full custody of their funds. Instead of working for the banks to invest on their businesses, and make profits out of other people's hard earned cash.",

Bitcoin as you have already been told is a volatile currency meaning the price rate of it always fluctuate and in a matter of seconds you can be affected greatly and also you can profit likewise from that same time range, so i would advise if eventually you  are going for any investments any time sooner you should go for a long term investment",

Some countries in Africa are rapidly using fiat currencies to purchase bit coin because of the growing population of bitcoin in Africa. So many merchant have now accepted bitcoin payment as bitcoin adoption grows and am very sure that the use of cryptocurrency will become a standard world wide.But come to think of it ,there are still countries were cryptocurrencies are not allowed which we need to look at.The reason some countries hesitate in crypto adoption in Africa and other part of the world is its volatility. This is actually because no one has control over the mining process. Most crypto mining process takes place on personal computers.Despite all this,the number of businesses accepting cryptocurrency as payment method remains high.I just hope that the issue of bitcoin volatility would be solved soon because many countries see crypto currency as a way to increase their wealth.",
