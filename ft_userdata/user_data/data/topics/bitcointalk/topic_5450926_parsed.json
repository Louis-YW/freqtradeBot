      "body": "Are you talking about overclocking tool? Most mining OS like Hive comes with OC tool in them, you don't need to run windows OS just to use MSI afterburner, I thought windows was the best for mining until I use Hive OS, it's way more easier to OverClock than using MSI afterburner.Â  Make sure you know what you are doing if you have never do such before because too much overclocking is bad for some mining hardware, even if you are using a Asic Miner. If you've never do this before simply go on YouTube and watch some videos first.",

You are in the Bitcoin mining section where most of the miners here are ASIC based.If you are going to overclock these units then you will need modded firmware like Braiins OS also it pulls more power so you will need to upgrade your PSU to give enough power to your miner if not then you are forcing your PSU to it's limit and die soon.",

Of course, an increase in hashrate leads to higher power consumption and overheating of ASICs, and in summer you can use settings for lower power consumption in order to save on cooling.",
