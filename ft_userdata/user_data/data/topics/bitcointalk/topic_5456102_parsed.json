No exception to this, women are also very interested in Bitcoin and current Bitcoin. The reason for interest is that when a woman works in an office, it becomes a bit difficult for her to juggle family and children. In today's society we see many working women leave their children with the workers and go to office, those children are abused by the workers. I think all the sisters who have chosen this bitcoin as their profession should not face such problems.

So choosing Bitcoin as a career can be a good decision for girls.As un_rank said, Bitcoin is absolutely not a career. In addition, in a sufficiently advanced and evolved world where people have access to Bitcoin - and therefore to the Internet - and where women work on an equal footing with men, this way of thinking makes no sense. Insofar as men could also be involved in raising children and maintaining the home, this is not an exclusively female problem. As un_rank said, flexible and remotely doable jobs could be a solution, as self-employment. But I don't see any link with BTC.This post doesn't make much sense in my humble opinion, Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, a great storage of value, but has nothing to do with the way people are working or not. Maybe for some traders, but we can't say this is a vast majority of us being professional traders.",

So choosing Bitcoin as a career can be a good decision for girls.First of all, Bitcoin is not a career, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. I mean yeah I get your point here since women can take care of their children at home and at the same time they can just do Bitcoin. Yeah, it was great but you're already assumed that all workers are abusive actually you could get a decent house worker to take care of your children with good pay they might taking good care of and needs of your children could lessen your load if your having difficulties with your child, Also when you buy or invest in Bitcoin you don't really need to work on it every day you could just buy Bitcoin and forget about it then occasionally just check the market It doesnt really need you to be on it 24/7 unless you want to do daily trading which is very stressful for women.You could easily solve this problem if the woman has a flexible job something like a work-from-home or remote job would work since they can take care of her children and at the same time do her job at home.",

You are probably a victim of false info in the social or neighborhood for you to consider that Bitcoin is a career. Bitcoin can be use as payment for a job but Bitcoin itself doesn’t offer any job to woman unless he is a developer or a miner which is not advisable on your example since you are describing a house wife. Bitcoin is good for investment for house wife though since they will just need to hold and wait until their holdings is on profit. It’s not a career but a good investment opportunity for house wife.",

In other words there is no match at all between the work of a woman who is ultimately focused on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a company and not a subject to work with. Moreover, it has to do with gender, I think the placement is not quite right. But the point is the point that you want to convey, I know it's just that in this context it might be more of a side option for a woman to get to know Bitcoin better and be able to invest part of her finances in it.",

And if you do, it doesn't mean you have to focus on bitcoin because using bitcoin can be done while working or doing other things and makes bitcoin a promising side income if you do it for the long term. So bitcoin is not a career that should be taken seriously and only buy when the price goes down and hold it for the long term, and sell it back when the price goes up high. And keep working to make ends meet, working at home or substituting someone else to take care of it when going to work.",

Even if someone studies Bitcoin, analyzes the market all day, and makes money from trading. I would still say they build their career by studying Bitcoin. In this case, Trading is their career, not Bitcoin. Even if someone contributes to the Bitcoin development, I am unsure how they make money by helping implement new BIPs. I don't think developers get paid for their contributions. So, I am not sure if Bitcoin can be considered as a career!",
