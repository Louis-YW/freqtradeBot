  "content": "MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has become a prominent player in the Bitcoin market through its aggressive accumulation strategy. Their recent purchase of 850 BTC in January 2024 signals continued confidence in Bitcoin's potential[1], especially considering their reported $4 billion profit on previous investments[2]. This stands in stark contrast to mid-2022, when the company faced criticism for incurring significant losses[3].Saylor claims MicroStrategy will never sell their Bitcoin[4], positioning them as unwavering \"diamond hands\". However, as a publicly traded company with profit-seeking shareholders like Capital International Investors, Vanguard, and Blackrock[5], the pressure to capitalize on significant price increases cannot be ignored.While missing out on 2021's peak proved costly, MicroStrategy's MSTR stock price has surged nearly 500% since their initial Bitcoin investment in July 2020[6]. However, some argue that failing to take profits during bull runs contradicts optimal investment strategies.While Saylor's personal belief in Bitcoin's future might be genuine, shareholder pressure could compel MicroStrategy to reconsider its stance if Bitcoin reaches significant highs, like the projected $160,000 in 2025, followed by signs of a downward trend. Considering the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market, with the next peak expected in 2025, it wouldn't be surprising to see MicroStrategy potentially offload some of its Bitcoin holdings then.MicroStrategy's significant holdings and regular Bitcoin purchases have generated considerable interest in the cryptocurrency market. If the company decides to sell its BTC in 2025, it could trigger various market reactions:Potential Positive Impacts: MicroStrategy's monthly disclosures regarding BTC purchases and sales offer valuable insights into their perspective on the market, potentially influencing investor sentiment. Selling alongside a major player like MicroStrategy could present an opportunity for some investors to align their own investment decisions.Potential Negative Impacts: A large-scale BTC sell-off by MicroStrategy could trigger significant fear and panic selling, leading to a sharp decline in the price. If a prominent advocate like MicroStrategy loses faith in Bitcoin, it could erode investor confidence and lead to a sustained price drop, potentially pushing the price below $60,000 by 2026.While Bitcoin's price fluctuations are cyclical, and Saylor and MicroStrategy acknowledged this, I would be surprised if they held onto their BTC during the anticipated crypto winter of 2026-2027.I would like to know your opinion on this issue:What are your thoughts on the possibility of Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy selling Bitcoin during the current bull cycle's distribution phase?If such a sale were to occur, how do you anticipate it affecting the price of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market?Do you consider the actions of individual entities, such as MicroStrategy, when making investment decisions?References:[1] MicroStrategy acquired 850 bitcoin for $37.2 million in January[2] Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Bitcoin Bet Tops $4B in Profit[3] MicroStrategy’s Losses on Its Bitcoin Bet Near $1 Billion[4] Michael Saylor Suggests MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin[5] MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR): Holders[6] MicroStrategy becomes first listed company to buy bitcoin as part of its capital allocation strategy",

If they sell their coins, there are many people want to buy it, so they're just the same like other people.MicroStrategy didn't even have 1% of total BTC supply, it's not enough to manipulate the market, but they could manipulate the market because there's a lot stupid people are following the self pro claimed professional economist, investor, trader etc.https://www.coingecko.com/en/public-companies-bitcoin",

It depends, if you control a sufficient percentage of the company you can influence or directly decide the company's policy, which can include deciding to buy or sell bitcoin. But the majority shareholder with almost 100% of MSTR's shares is Michael Saylor, so the company will do what he says. And it seems quite clear that what it will do is not to sell but to continue accumulating, perhaps with the exception of a small sale for tax reasons, as has happened before.",

That's not something we can know.I just hope they sell, the more they sell the better.

I think you getting it wrong They are buying the shares of Microstrategy not explicitly Bitcoin The shares are been bought because of Microstrategy holdings of Bitcoin This can be seen from the increase in their valuation of share since early last year. Now moving on to OP question1. Imo is their choice. Is their holdings they can choose to continue holding or selling, but we can't tell when that would occur. 2. If it's to take profit,  there wouldn't be much impact. The Bitcoin would be sold in smaller units that it wouldn't affect their market Don't forget their recent Soaring valuation is as a result of Holding Bitcoin Many investors are interested. If in case of liquidation, Then there would be a short term dip but the market would correct itself and the sold Bitcoin would be shared and reduce Centralization. 3. I don't really. If you swayed by their actions you would fall under market manipulation tactics that most usually employ.Quote from: pooya87 on February 20, 2024, 04:37:47 AMI just hope they sell, the more they sell the better.

If anything happens to the firm Shareholders would start withdrawing and Microstrategy would have to sell their holdings to meet up with their investors demand.",

Yes, I completely understand this. I know that they are “buying Microstrategy shares and not Bitcoin explicitly.” I know that selling a few shares of the company will certainly not make any change, but I am talking about the case if the company sells a large amount of shares and the new buyer obtains a high percentage of the company’s shares. Then new buyers will have the right to make important decisions in the company, such as the decision to sell Bitcoin, if they can obtain the appropriate percentage.",
