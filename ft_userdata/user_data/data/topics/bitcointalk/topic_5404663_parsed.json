Most reputable exchanges will keep operating and know the risks of overleveraging their assets (so don't do it). Exchanges know hoe to recoup money better now too with a higher amount of trades being executed at a higher price than before.If you are comfortable and happy to move them there, your funds are probably safer on your machine than on an exchange (but if you're really bad with security and often access a lot of random sites without knowledge of how to do things like segregating different parts of your machine via VMs then your funds might be safer on an exchange).",

But who will bother giving exchanges their assets? Always remember not your keys not your coin be responsible for your coin. perhaps Bitcoin can't fall to a price where exchanges will be tempted to halt withdrawals",

Only the coins that should be left should only be for trading.",

I would suggest using Binance and then moving your funds after buying to a hardware wallet, most likely a Ledger Nano S.Funds on exchange are a risk for sure. They say \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" Good Luck!",

Withdrawals will largely stop until the market is stable.\"Do you agree or disagree with above statement..Well, leaving you crypto assets on an exchange, whether centralized or decentralized exchanges has never been a good practice, this is why it has always advised to withdraw funds that you are not using immediately out of exchanges into your non custodial wallet(this is a wallet which you , the user have access to, and controls the keys).Like I said in on one of my previous comment on a post, Exchanges, mostly centralized exchanges are the number one targets when it comes to hackers hacking exchanges, it is no longer news that even top exchanges, in terms of security and other facts, like Binance, have one time been hacked with millions of dollars stolen in users assets plus KYC documents, (though Binance did refund all users fund), this and all are pointers to the fact that we all should never user exchanges as a means of storing our crypto assets, make use of non custodial wallets where you yourself is your own security.",

We know that it is not very safe to leave our coins in the exchange, is your statement based on this general knowledge or because of the continuous bear market. If the later is your assumption, I want to know if;The bear market weakens the security of the exchanges The bear market increases the hacking power of the hackersIt is therefore safe to leave your coins in the exchanges during the bull market I will be glad to know the perceptive you are coming from.",

Worse they can plan their own scam exits. We can not know they actually were hacked, bankrupted or just scam exited.We are only able to control where to store our coins. The best is in non custodial wallets. Even so, we must back up our wallet as it will be used later if we need to recover that wallet.QuoteWithdrawals will largely stop until the market is stable.Withdrawal can be delayed, halted for a while when a network is congested or with technical issues like altcoin blockchains usually have.However what you discussed is different, with bear market, over leverage and liquidations on venture capitals, institutional investors, many platforms are in bank-runs and some of them are going to be bankrupted. Hence they disable withdrawal and maybe not temporarily but forever. It does not relate to mempool, network but financially related to those platforms and their left-over available capital.",

It always reminded that wallet or non custodial are more safer than exchange. Alwayd put money on cex that arent too big for you to regret as it is centralized. Putting money for trading there and other activity is nice but make sure that you can afford it to lose since it could be freeze or hack anytime.With the current market right now and you are convenient putting on exchange then better pick major ones like Binance, this is the least that can stop withdrawal due to market situation.",

A lot but how many people actually care about it and how many people ignore this advice?Many people ignore it and they only recall about it when they lose money on exchanges. Prevention is better than cure but again most of people wait for cure and don't care about prevention at beginning.Not your keys, not your coins. It's your money, own itSecurity checklistDocumented timeline of exchange hacks and Exchange graveyard. I hope they are fearful after reading this but I know most of them will ignore it.",

Some just gives users a small window of 1 or 2 weeks to withdraw their funds and then just shut down on short notice with people's money.When you look at cryptowisser's exchange graveyard. The number of exchanges that go MIA is very worrying.",
