Any help would be well appreciated! and looking for partners if anyone wants to start that. Thank you!If you want to start an online casino with zero game development skills, no idea for the cost, and no idea for marketing there is only one way to do this. You need some money to make it real.You could buy a gambling license, buy a slots game license, and a good VPS. with that you could start your casino. Or other way is to post in the services section with a bounty for a casino",

IMO, you need to at least have some experience to created original-hash game created by your self. BANKROLL of the casino is the most important things you need to have for starting a casino.We need a guarantee, that the casino can pay for the win otherwise people are not gonna to play on the casino. IMO, BANKROL still one of your priority and for created a casino some of company provided a service to created a casino. You can use that service, and hired a few people to maintenance the site.",

IMO, you don't necessarily need to know the complete in and out of how an online casino starts and operates. For every startup most times, there is something called the \"mastermind\", that is someone who who may not necessarily know everything or how to get things done but has created the mental picture and has the ability to put together a team to achieve his goal as in the case of Henry Ford of the ford automobile who didn't know much about how to build a V8 engine but was confident that he could motivate his engineers to achieve his goal and they did. Learn what you must, and get a complimentary team to assist for the other aspect that you cannot handle. I presume you have the financial backup to accomplish this plan, because it needs money and without money, ideas die.",

He needs a team, at the very least a partner and they need to hire a team. For instance, he has some coding background, so let's assume he learns a bit and covers backend dev. He needs a front end guy, possibly another back end with experience in crypto wallets, unless they want to handle all deposits/withdrawals manually, in such case he needs someone trusted to manage the wallet. He'll need someone to handle all the advertising and promoting, someone to take care of support... That's not a one man job. Then we should talk funds. How much do you have at hand? If that's less than $100k it's going to be hard. You'll have to cut cost somewhere and limit bets to some small numbers like $10 so they won't break your bank, but by doing that your business will scream \"i'm low on money\" and it will deter players.",

Thank you!If you want to do such you have to research very well and the follow steps of others who has a a casino game platform in this community so if you are in contact with them at least they will educate you with some certain code that they will use to associate or to operate with so in this kind of development that you want to bring in you would have enquire from the above people who have the idea of casino gambling platform and they know exactly how they operate and how they manage and they're on their platform with the cryptocurrency so after being that then you can launch it. I know for you to bring this year many people will borrow you a wisdom to work or need but ensure that what you are bringing to the community does not find any way to relate with scam",

      "body": "In my opinion starting a casino implies having a lot of capital, do you have that much money to spend? you would need to create a beautiful casino, solve all issues related to the number of employees, issues related to payments because if someone wins a jackpot in your casino in the first few days you have to be prepared to pay that person who won the jackpot. And there's another big problem that is: with the huge increase in new casinos every day. you will need to have a good advertising budget for many months, for example i estimate that just to run a good signature campaign on this forum you would need to have a budget of 15000$ per month if you want to run a good campaign, not to mention that too you can pay for advertising on the forum and other sites. counting that you have to pay employees and expenses with the casino itself that. It will cost you a lot in the first few months and I doubt you will make much profit in the first few months. It is a business with a lot of money that you have to invest and it is very risky for these days",

Most of the gambling platforms initially start with only one game, and further increase the service with addition of more games.That’s a very low price and probably will have a buyer right away especially if they already have a good traffic on their site. I agree that doing gambling is not easy at all since its not just about the numbers and encoding the data, it takes a lot of team effort and of course will take a lot of funds. So OP, if you still have a limited knowledge about it, look for a team that can help you and willing to invest along with you, because you must create an interesting site to at least enter into the competition and attract gamblers as well.",

Its not a plug and play site, it requires a lot of work and a lot of money. OP look for a good team, those who are interested in gambling as well discuss your proposals and start working with it slowly but surely.",

These businesses will be easier to get into, will attract a smaller amount of risks, and will probably be profitable within the first year.Even then, a good casino business requires money, time and patience to grow and get bigger. You need money for buying licenses, paying staff, advertising and other expenses. But most importantly, you need money for the house bankroll.
