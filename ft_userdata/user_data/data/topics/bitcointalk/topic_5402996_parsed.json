Do you think Microstragy purchasing large units of btc will influence the price?• Yes, price prediction can be built on realistic assessment. This of course does not mean the price would reflect the expectations of any model, but it's possible to build your model on sound technical and fundamental analysis.The idea of having a model to mirror the price at every stage is impossible, but you can have something similar at different points.• Who knows? The only certain future event in relation to Bitcoin is the halving, besides that no one can predict what would happen.• Not really. Big institutions purchasing Bitcoin is a positive and can influence trader sentiment, but it's already so popular that no singular purchase should have a big impact on the price.",

A lot of times is the answer, for few years back many speculations has come out of bitcoin reaching $100,000 that same year but this never came through, I have always stood with not believing in speculations and predictions, honestly it doesn’t help the situation rather it can cause panic in form of making sales that wasn’t thought out properly or even buying the wrong coin.",

What major event do you think will usher BTC and the entire industry into the next bullrun?Adoption & Recommendation can work the magic. What is basically affecting the price at the moment is that there is massive panic and a reduced confidence from investors in bitcoin. The price has stayed too low for too long for some, to secure their money many are deciding to sell off more bitcoins with inflation increasing and recession looming. Binance and Celsius fueled peoples panic the more when they recently but temporarily stopped the withdrawal of bitcoin.If any major country/company can at this point Adopt bitcoin or perhaps a country, an individual who is idolized give some sort of recommendation about bitcoin, that can offer and boost the confidence of investors who are considering selling off not to, and investors who have left or reduced their portfolio to return and increase their bitcoin holding. A series of either adoption or recommendation will get bitcoin pumping again.",

All we need is time, and a steady pace of adoption. I'm talking about both user adoption, as well as merchants picking up Bitcoin, and accepting payments. As long as we continue how we're going right now, there shouldn't be too many problems going forward. There's no major events that I see coming up other than the halving, if you call that major, as it's predetermined, and I don't know if I would call it major.",

Of course it would, because buying anything always pushes the price up, but if you think that lots of investors would take it as a bullish signal - that's unlikely. No one really cares if a permabull buys more, it got old rather quickly. If Bill Gates announced that he's a bitcoiner tomorrow, that would cause a rally, but he won't.News of some more dirt-poor countries adopting Bitcoin as legal tender might cause a price spike, but it won't be enough to start a rally. Same for some institutional adoption.",

But it will not be enough as compare to the halving every 4 years as this is where the cycle starts for the next bull run. It might not be a quick effect and it might take months after the activity. But once it took off, it's really hard to stop the bulls and maybe that $100k that we all wanted to see will be in fruition come 2024-2025.",

This is just a prediction but with the current situation of Bitcoin, I think $100k this year is not possible. Whales are still not buying as of the moment, they still wait for the good price to buy because when they do, probably that is the start of the bull run especially if all whales come together to rescue BTC.",

Do you think Microstragy purchasing large units of btc will influence the price?No. Large institutional purchases do not affect the price of bitcoin, as institutional ones do not think speculatively. Anyone who thinks that if some major player buys bitcoin and this means rapid growth, he is greatly mistaken.Yes it's true as you said but the price cycle always changes when many buyers start buying their bitcoins again.But on the other hand bitcoin also needs good news about its development so that people are more confident in bitcoin's growth in the future.Because with the sweet issue that has thrown the world, the wider community has responded very quickly, especially the big investors, and that becomes a support for the increase in bitcoin prices in the future.",

Although it will accelerate once signs are showing that the red is over.3. It will but it depends on the quantity. But I don't like this. This will be like a bandaid approach. Let the price reach bottom and then rebound. Aside from MicroStrategy already owning a lot, this isn't the natural progress so to speak. And it has been attempted a number of times, but the effect is very short term. It failed to reverse the direction.If sovereign funds and institutions are interested in buying, the current price is already good.",
