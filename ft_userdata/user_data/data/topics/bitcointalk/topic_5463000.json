  "content": "So, four days ago this very uncle of mine called me saying that he's now interested in investing some money into bitcoin. And I was like what happened! I thought you rejected the idea when I introduced it to you months ago.Guess what he said, \"well I did thought about it recently, and did a few research and decided I should give it a trial like you advised I should\".Now this how the whole gist originally emanated. I had this long section talk with him about bitcoin more than 8months back of which he rejected the idea of investing with whatever amount he could use as a clinical trial of the digital currency for like 6months or 1year to see for himself the benefits of bitcoin but he refused and afterwards I never brought up the discussion again to him. But to my greatest surprise he called me on phone to come to his house, on getting there he shared to me about his interest to invest in bitcoin with the sum of #4.8million of our local currency, an amount that is worth around $6k based on current exchange rate.Although it's not the story that intrigue me to share this info  to the community but it's mainly the lessons I learnt from it that did, which I'll believe a lot of bitcoiners needs to know even as they talk to people about bitcoin. Which are:-1. Give people time; they will show interest when the time is right for them. Their timing may not be same with yours, if you've done your own job of talking to them about it, then that's fine. 2. The amount of energy and time you expend preaching to someone about bitcoin is not a warranty that he will accept what you're offering. Maybe not immediately!3. We should always tell people to go do their own research about bitcoin after giving them some preaching about it. Doing their own research from with what they  get online can strengthen their conviction about what they've have been told.What do you think about this?",

      "body": "sourceYou're absolutely right mate. Many people have talked about the same thing that adopting Bitcoin is a personal choice. Before I started using Bitcoin, I used to be afraid of anything related to digital currencies online or even trading online, because I worried about losing my money to scammers. Most people go through a similar experience before giving it a try and discovering a new way of handling money. It's important that others learn from this too, because pushing someone into investing in Bitcoin isn't the right way. it's a decision each person should make on their own, just like how they take all the risks alone without blaming the person who told them about it.There's something else I'd like everyone to know. When we're telling someone completely new about Bitcoin, let's not leave out the downsides. Bitcoin investment might sound appealing when we talk about making a profit, but we should also mention the possibility of losing their investment if they're not carefully secured or if the market trend downward, the value of your funds might not be as worth as your original investment.",

Giving insights about your investment and blockchain is good but it is not really our job to make sure that everyone we taught is catching up it, if they are smart enough they will figure that out on their own.It's my way though, everyone has a different approach.",

You start with the basics of the currency, the investment opportunity it offers, and the risk associated with investing in it. Then the most important part of the discussion should be to encourage the person to do in-depth research about investing in Bitcoin. There have been several topics discussed in this forum where members persuade some people to invest in Bitcoin. Some even go to the extent of showcasing Bitcoin as a get-rich scheme. These approaches are wrong because you will be blamed if anything contrary happens to their investment. But when you encourage people to do their research, they become knowledgeable about the sector and invest based on the information they gathered and not by greed. Also, you will not be held responsible for their action because they decided by themselves.",

It was that moment when he had it in his mind and after doing some research on it he decided to invest money into it by calling you to do so. It always works this way to introduce Bitcoin to someone who isn't aware of its existence and when they learn about it themselves by doing some research over internet then if they like the idea of it they would appreciate it and invest money into it otherwise they'll ignore it instantly.It's always advisable to let someone decide whether they want to invest in Bitcoin or not because if you invest in it on someone's behalf then that would not be a good thing at all. We all know that there are some risks involved in Bitcoin investments and someone who really doesn't have enough knowledge about Bitcoin can end up losing his/her investment by loosing the private keys of the wallet the have used to store their Bitcoin. Our responsibility is to promote awareness about Bitcoin, and it's always helpful to guide such investors about the problems that can rise when they don't get proper knowledge about Bitcoin before investing in it.",

Maybe he could have profited from any market rallies in the interim if he had taken more initiative months earlier.I consider saying \"Give people time\" to be rather accommodating. Perhaps they arent the right kind of person for Bitcoin investing if they can't recognize the chance when it presents itself. And to the second point, it is clear that enlightening someone does not ensure their acceptance. However, I dont see the point in expending so much effort on someone who isnt interested in understanding. And you must ask them to conduct research. Isnt that a given, though? Maybe they would be better off skipping the Bitcoin train if they are unwilling to make even that small effort.Though, Slackers have no place in the Bitcoin industry.",

It will make them feel like we are trying to scam them and they won't feel comfortable if forced. That just makes them hate bitcoin more than care about it. For us bitcoin is no longer a new asset but for many it is still a very new asset so it takes time for them to adapt and accept it. Furthermore, as you also said, the fact that we spend a lot of time educating someone about bitcoin does not guarantee that they will be interested in bitcoin. So don't waste your time and give them time to realize it all.",

Even if you ain't interested of a thing you just need to do some digging to have a clue while you stand your ground of not accepting it.

You cannot tell people what to do with their money, your consolation should be that you have played your part to let them know of the opportunities in investing in bitcoins. One good thing about giving people time to make the decision to invest on their own is that they will not blame you for anything that happens to their investment because they made the decision to invest on their own and not out of you pressuring them to do so.",

Those people who you have introduced the Bitcoin won't be interested right away but one thing you should have said to them is that you shouldn't be interested right away and must do some research first before investing or something like that. Just think of it as a way of giving them warning that will make them be very careful with everything that are introduced to them. Well, your uncle did good since he made some research first before he decided to invest.
