Go resteraunt kitchen see how much FOOD they just trhow away.The people that die from famine aren't the fat cows that live in developed countries, unable to walk up a flight of steps without being out of breath. It's people in developing countries that don't have the luxury of being able to go to a restaurant or grocery store which has a stockpile of food, resupplied by a functioning supply chain on a moments notice.The Germans and others in Europe will find out how important energy is when they're freezing during the winter time. Their green energy initiatives will bite them severely. I suppose relying on a senile dictator for cheap energy has its consequences.",

Donald Trump was laughed at by the Germans for his warning in 2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpwkeTBwgsI suppose the Germans will not be laughing so much during winter time. Says a lot about centralization too, doesn't it? Had Germany diversified their energy sources, there wouldn't be a reliance on Russia.I think you're right about China. Too much of the western world depends on their cheap manufacturing. It can't last forever.",

Greed also plays a part with the air pollution, who wants to spend the money doing the right thing when you can just bribe the locals in China and dump your waste into rivers and the air with no consequences in the short term. Follow the companies and where they built, they chase the lowest wage. Back in the 80's it was taiwan where cheap goods came out of, than it slowly moved to China where it stands today but not for long. Companies are learning to not stick all their base into one location finally.All those resort locations you listed, never ever was a manufacturing hub.",

Everything happened recently, one century ago. If you agree with me, you may ask: Well then, Germans haven't changed, have they? Probably, not. Some part of people think that Germans have changed but waitWhy did Germany start the world war? To conquer the whole of Europe. Germany got destroyed because it was fighting 360o and Hitler wasn't that smart, he was a bad decision maker with very intelligent people around him.Germany's plan was to conquer Europe. Do you think it failed? Germany got destroyed to death but quickly become the world's fourth-largest economy.So, think twice! In reality, Germany achieved 50% of its original plan. Germany united Europe. At the moment Europe is under the influence of Germany and France, this was the aim of Germany but recently they did it in a civil way, still didn't perform it solo but the situation behind the scene is different from the actual scenes. Britain failed, they did Brexit and they regret it. A lot of brits want to join Europe. In order to do this, they will have to throw away their GBP and accept the Euro, a currency controlled by France and Germany. Rule N1: adopting the euro is an important step of EU membership.Lenin was a German agent that made revolution in Russia. Well, Putin served as an officer of the KGB in the East German. This along with the fact that Germany linked its economics with Russia makes me think that the politics and aims of Germany haven't changed in reality but their tactics have really changed.Am I crazy for this opinion?
