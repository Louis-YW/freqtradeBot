  "content": "Recently ive been receiving huge electric bills, i was thinking running the AC 24/7 was the reason for that (besides my 2 RIGs) but then i started to see the bill increasing even morei checked here in turkey regarding the electric rate apparently its 0.07$ USD for up to 210 kWh/month then 0.11$ USD for exceeding 210 kWh/month !First my two rigs both are sucking 1100 Watts 24/7 in total, so how do i know my monthly kWh consumption ?? Because according to the power company i have consumed 3266 kWh for the past month, so how to check and calculate my actual consumption ??i used something like this:https://www.inchcalculator.com/watts-to-kwh-calculator/when entering 1000 in the first space and 720 in the second blank i get just 720 kWh for a whole month, wat less than 3266 !...thanks,",

With a wattimeter?AC alone is hunger for power, there is models alone that can use more than 1000watts",

Find a location where cool air is present.",

It's easy to have 32ºC or more.
