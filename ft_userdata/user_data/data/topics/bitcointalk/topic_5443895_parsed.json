There is a topic called Urgent red flag him this user. I read it and came to the conclusion that OP SeriousIssues was wrong. But instead of telling him that he is wrong - I see a bunch of trolls who troll using the stupid naivety of the author of the topic. If the author of the topic is wrong, then he should be told that he is wrong without any trolling.Example of trolling:Quote from: nutildah on February 09, 2025, 08:43:24 AMQuote from: Free Market Capitalist on February 09, 2025, 02:19:58 PMis there anything positive that he is contributing to the forum? I don't think so.I ask myself the same question about nutildah: is there anything positive that nutildah is contributing to the forum by his trolling? I don't think so. I see only abusing of the trust system by nutildah",
