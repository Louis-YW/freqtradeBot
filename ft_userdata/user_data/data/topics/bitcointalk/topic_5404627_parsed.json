  "content": "Vechain has been on my watchlist for a while and with this current dip in the market it is becoming quite tempting to start investing. Like other altcoins I own, I plan to hold for a few years till the next bull run comes along. I have seen price predictions by 2025 of $1-2 which would be a 50-100x from current price. Is this realistic? For those who know any thing about Vechain, it would be interesting to here thoughts on it, both good and bad.",

When I look at their projects, I see that they offer many solutions from carbon emission to product originality. I know that they have important studies on the supply chain. I would like to follow this project, which I will start to follow, in more detail, and if other friends have more information, I would like to follow up on this subject.",

      "body": "Investing in altcoin this period comes with a high level of risk due to the possibility of the value declining more or the project inability to withstand the bearish period. You'll need to consider the market capitalisation of the project as well as the usecase and performance so far before making your decision. No doubt, this could be the best time to invest and if you're willing to take the risk, so be it.",

      "body": "If you believe in a particular coin, there shouldn't be any condition, whatever the price is; it's just essential loyalty, IMO. That's how the project creates followers with it, and that will be the ideal way projects get support, and they will be the networks.I see that people need to have at least three years of diamond hands with whatever coin they hold. That's what I see in the long run because that's how the coins generally are doing. The high multipliers and rise in price could be a great goal, and know that it could be possible as long as many people support and buy it.",
