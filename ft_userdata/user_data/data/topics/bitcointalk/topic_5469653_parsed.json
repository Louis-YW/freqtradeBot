      "body": "If your posts are deleted because you comment on a thread that appears to be spam, and when they delete the mother thread, your own post is also going down with it, but it was as a result of continuously posting something that's below forum standard, and it happens that people who observe it reported it to the moderators and it got deleted. If such actions continue, I think there will be a higher chance of your account getting a Temban just to warn you of your activities. What's the point of making low-quality posts and later coming back to delete them? Well, if you realise that you have done some post that is not worth posting and you decided to delete it yourself, I don't think any DT will want to punish you by tagging you for that. Unless you have continuously been doing it over and over again where the action turns out offensive in the eyes of anyone who ever notices it, then I believe you might get a neutral to warn you and anyone who wants to deal with you of what your activities have been off.",

I don't know why that isUnless I'm wrong, if not, I don't see post length as what's being used to determine whether a post should be deleted or not.You can write a 1-line post that stays on topic with the thread and has a valid message that it's passing to the people, and it won't be deleted, but if the comment appears to be just some form of exclamation and nothing too serious to be located in it, then it can be wiped out by moderators as it appears to be a scam.Even lengthy posts get deleted; if they're not organic and look like shit to a thread, I think they will also still get nuked down unless there are some exceptions to how posts are considered based on rank, which I have not read about yet.",

If your post got deleted by mod it's assumed is a low quality post hence their is no bad effects towards it rather you are encouraged to make quality post, alternatively I can say that the post you made is either doesn't reflect to what the thread is saying and if mod or any admin finds them they could get those post deleted. If you keep deleting your post sometimes you are attracting eyes to your account because people can either sees it as account try to change hands or being controlled by other user. That is why you don't need to delete any of your post although this could be a kind of something that will be there for you in time to come to know how gradually you are making progress.

Your activity is minimum of 14*number of two-week periods in which you have been active and number of your posts. So, if you delete some of your posts and your post count decreases to 100, your activity wouldn't be necessarily 100. Your activity will be a number between 0 and 100.",

This tag serve as a   reminder  and doesn't harm your account. anyway deleting post is not good practice unless you have made any mistake.",

But if you erase a ton of stuff you posted, people might wonder why and the internet never forgets. Things you put out there are hard to take back completely.  Here on this forum, we have at least two archives keeping copies of posts even if you delete them from your profile. So once you hit publish, you cannot really hide it after that.",

I hope it is not because you said something to anyone bad and/or you want to back away from your point of view or any such controversial thing. Apart from that, deleting your own post will do no harm to you.Also remember that deleting a post yourself and getting a post deleted by mods are two separate things. If you get your post being deleted by mods, this means someone reported your posts and the mods found that they are not up to the standards. Getting a lot of post getting deleted by the mods could also temporary ban your account.",

Pretty much everyone does that as well.Deleting at a much higher rate regularly, or deleting all of the posts you have made will raise a few eye brows. Not enough to get a tag (negative), but enough for users to avoid replying to your comments cause you commonly delete replies you've made and break the flow of discussions. You will get on some ignore lists and get some neutral feedbacks too.",
