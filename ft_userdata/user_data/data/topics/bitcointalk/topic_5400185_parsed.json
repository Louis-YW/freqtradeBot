  "content": "I think I got this coin earlier this year and this evening I went through what was in thecollection to see this coin changing colour. Admittedly it did have a slightly differenttone to the other when I got it but it now has purple blotches forming.I know in the coin collecting world a certain type of toning is very collectible on certainand generally old coins or all - im not so sure.So for a very young coin to be showing this colouration I wonder if its \"normal\" given itsnot in circulation.....Also in coin collecting generally cleaning, polishing and messing with coins is frownedupon, what would be the communities opinions be about polishing this colouration out?Personally I would like to see what happens over the next few months.Has anyone else got any coins which are changing?",

      "body": "Many things can cause toning but nothing natural will cause an entire coin to tone on its own in a year or three. Most likely you had this on something that gave off certain fumes; cardboard, certain plastics with pvc, etc etc will cause toning. And most “desirable” toning for older coins is a rainbow or blue hued toning. I’d check what’s in your storage area of coins or what particular holder/airtite you had this in. This is all just my opinion though “attractive” toning is whatever you think it is",

      "body": "Aolain, I think you may have gotten that coin from me? I can't remember really, but I had a tube of them that I sold at no premium to forum members. When I shipped them out I took them out of the tube and put them in the holders. I do not recall any having toning when I did this. Yours has interesting toning. I have wondered if these holders could affect some coins (copper in this case). The foam covering should be benign to metal, but I have wondered. If it is possible then and someone knows, then I would be interested in hearing thoughts on this. Steeley",

      "body": "Yes Steeley it was indeed and it was last year didnt realise it was that long agoI found the original thread and in the image we can see the coin had already started tochange, you might not have been aware of it back then.I'm not sure its the airtite causing the change because the other side of the coin is perfectas are all my other coins which are also in airtites. Something came into contact with itat some stage in its short life and it will be interesting to see what happens in the future ...if I still have it and if it actually progresses further.",
