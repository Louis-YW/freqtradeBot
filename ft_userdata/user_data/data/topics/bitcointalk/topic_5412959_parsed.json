  "content": "Crypto degens have wasted no time after the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, flooding the crypto market with more than 40 new Queen-related meme tokens, and hundreds of new nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the same vein.New tokens launched on decentralized exchanges on the BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum over the past 24 hours include names such as Queen Elizabeth Inu, Save the Queen, Queen, QueenDoge, London Bridge is Down and Rip Queen Elizabeth.It’s worth noting that both Queen Elizabeth Inu and Elizabeth have just $17,000 and $204,000 worth of liquidity behind them, indicating a lack of serious backing behind and a potential for short-lived pump and dump, similar to the infamous Squid Games token that crashed and burned in October last year.Queen Elizabeth II passed away aged 96 and was the longest serving monarch of a sovereign country, with 70 years and 214 days at the helm in England. She received strong support from English citizens and held monarchy approval rates of around 90% at times during her reign.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

      "body": "True, it's just sad they crypto devs are taking advantage of the Queen's passing by introducing tokens with her name attached on it.So I agree that it will be short lived, and the only victims here are going to be those who thought that they can join in and have a quick profits. Of course they can, with this pumpers around, but it will be difficult to know when they are going to dump it, so that is the most dangerous because you might be left out when then organized this dump unless you are part of this p&d groups.",

The crypto market is seeing such kind of attacks since a long time now. Pancakeswap is a frontrunner here who allows to facilitate trading for such memecoins. This madness has to stop. Otherwise the crypto market will never be able to become mainstream due to its reputation.",

They have taken advantage of everything for profit, these projects should not be launched and people should not support them by participating in projects.

      "body": "Yeah so whatever it is trending nowadays, I have seen some new memecoins popping out in the market. Like the great Elon boy for example, there are tons of Elon-related memecoins emerging just trying to pump it. However, these memecoins are meant to be short lived and a bit of luck if you are in great timing for the token to reach all-time high before selling it. Same thing goes to the trend that we have in Queen Elizabeth, so memecoins in general doesn't have any long term use cases or fundamentals like it's for fun only.",

Queen Elizabeth is a public figure and if she's still alive, that's fine.But these devs don't give and pay respect to the dead. They're all for the hype and the money and I guess they've seen this coming before when there's a popular thing that has happened, hopefully, investors won't tolerate this and won't invest to these projects.",
