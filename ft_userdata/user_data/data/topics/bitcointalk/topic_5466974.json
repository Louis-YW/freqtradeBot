  "content": "I’m selling this house here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466195.msg62818398#msg62818398I really need to sell it fast, for this reason I was thinking about creating a referral program. On top of that the house is already being sold below market price at 545k eur.Whoever is able to sell the house I offer 5% commission, for example on the price 545k that’s a 27k commission.This means, you can share the house with your contacts and if a sale comes from you, you get 5%, i can pay you in Crypto and I can make a contract if needed.Here the steps:- Spread information about the house with your contacts- in case of an interested buyer from your contacts, you contact me with the buyer information- I will get in contact with the potential buyer by phone/email- The buyer can pay how he wants (bitcoin, eth, usdt or wire transfer)- After all the legals are concluded and the sale is done you will receive the 5% commission- You can receive the money how you want, either via wire transfer or cryptoI can make a contract for interested participants. DM if interested.",

Lately, AirBnB has been raking in loads of millions through properties that are with space, how much moreempty properties that can be managed by property firms and real estate giants. They can make a fortune for you while managing the property rather than selling it. You'd still have a property whose value keeps appreciating over the years.I'm not saying you shouldn't sell, but just have patience a little more and while waiting use it for business.",
