  "content": "OK my people, we actually passed out from one year NYSC on 2nd of March and my certification was held back due to accused absence from service for one month.What happen is that I did my biometric clearance on the second to last month of our passing out and someone I did have a clue where I must have match him or her reported me to zonal Inspector that I was absent since the whole month from my PPA (place of primary assignment) and that's how I was suggested to face panel and judgment is finally made in my favour because the reporter suggested not to be mentioned and my PPA Corp members and the head of department stood for me to have been faithful in my service.Today God has put my enemies to shame. I came back home to meet my grandma who took care of me since my mother die. I dedicate the certificate to her and I pray to make her proud. We celebrate together with joy and happiness as we slaughter chicken along. All thanks to God.Congratulations to me and grandma.",

I could remember my service year as the CDs President. I faced lots of challenges of people complaints and activities. It was by the grace of God I was able to make a good leadership without fear or favor but all through many recommendations and commendations came my way and my POP/hand over was a successful one too. Let me tell you the truth is was your own Corp member that reported you out of envy and greed. I have faced many panels of that nature defending people and to the glory of God non of them were held down nor victimized for any reason and till today many of them are my friends and they call me always. We have built strong relationship and some bringing business as well.¬†I will quote you so that your picture will be viewable so that others can see it.",
