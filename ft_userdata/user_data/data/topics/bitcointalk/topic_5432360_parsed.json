I wouldn't say so. The was was started by Putin and he could've ended it at any moment, but he was too proud and mislead by his generals who thought Ukraine was weak and they could launch a special forces assault on Kiev and take the parliament and presidential palace. Unfortunately the plan failed when their best soldiers were ambushed and wiped out by Ukrainians. There were many times to negotiate but Russians were to proud to take a step back and now that so much blood has been spilled it's much harder to reach consensus. IMO it's great that NATO supplied Ukraine. What would you expect them to do? I hate bullies and Russia is a one of the biggest bullies in the world. Definitely the biggest one in Europe.",

The US, NATO, Russia, or Ukraine?I've said it before and I'll say it again. The WEF/UN/Davos/Bilderberg elites that desire a one-world government. Both Putin and Zelensky were part of the WEF so they are taking marching orders for destabilization of all nationalized governments from East and West. This war is meant to starve the world as the Ukraine feeds both Africa and EU while Russia provides energy to Europe and other regions at cheap rate as the West ignorantly went green without a plan for replacing the energies used by fossil fuels while accounting for exponential growth in their populations both foreign and native born ie. \"The Problem\"). \"The Reaction\" is further incitements of war elsewhere which leads to destabilization of governments that have to fight said wars or were reliant upon those fighting. \"The Solution\" by our global elite masters will be total national capitulation to their one-world government where they are the true victors over us the plebs as they will leverage resources and \"peace\" although \"peace\" in this case will amount to modern day neo-feudal slavery.",

Russia wanted Ukraine to assure her that it would never join NATO because of the threat it poses to its security. But Ukraine failed to give such a guarantee because it sees Russia as an unrepentant aggressor. Thereafter, Russian Generals underestimated the powers of Ukraine and motivated Putin to invade her neighbor.Russia should get most of the blame for not using dialogue to push its agenda in Ukraine. NATO should get a portion of the blame for its passive stance when Russia invaded and annexed Crimea. The sanctions against Russia during/after the Cremia invasion were not enough to scare them from future invasions. With the development in Ukraine, I am sure Russia and its likes have learned their lessons. All the nations that are giving loans/aid, trading with and supporting both parties are benefiting or would in the future benefit from this war.",

If anything, this whole conflict started in early 2000's when Bush administration pushed Ukraine and Georgia in NATO to completely block Russia in Black Sea. North Atlantic Treaty Organization where \"North Atlantic\" countries are a minority. In 2008, in Bucharest NATO summit, Germany and France vetoed UA and Georgia application in fear of Russia's reaction. But USA ignored their veto. Putin said he'll take Crimea if UA continues NATO path. What happened in 2014? I mean, listen what smart people like Jeffrey Sachs have to say on this topic. It's not as Putin just woke up one morning and decided to invade Ukraine.I'm not blaming Ukraine for this just to be clear. It is evident that the west wanted this to happen and did absolutely nothing to stop it. Hell, if you want to be a conspiracy theorist, it's weird that Russo-Ukrainian negotiations conveniently stopped some time around Boris Johnson's visit to Ukraine. And in a month or so he quit from his Prime Minister position. Almost as if he said \"ok, my part here is done\".",

The US not only reaped huge profits from war, if viewed fairly, The US benefits in all aspects. In addition to the profits from selling weapons and energy, the unprecedented advantage is that they have succeeded in migrating Russia into the war because they have always considered Russia their number one military opponent. The fact that Russia is mired in war will make the Russian economy go back several decades and difficult to recover in a short time, when the economy goes down, everything will become slow. Previously they were ready to punish any country that bought weapons from Russia, and now they have no rivals in the arms market.",

Maybe I don't know something, but Ukraine or NATO dind't planned to invade Russia. And there is no battles happening in Russian cities like Rostov, Kursk or Belgorod. All battles is happening in territory of Ukraine and I'm not really sure how Russian defend their land by invading another country.Ukraine saw necessity to join NATO as Russia become security threat for for them.

As independent country they can decide themselves what to do. After all, I still don't understand why for Russia it's OK to have their neighbours Poland and Baltic states in NATO, while Ukraine would be security threat already.Good point about passive West reaction after Crimea and Easter Ukraine invasion. They imposed some sanctions, but it was more to make image that they're doing something and it had zero impact. And they continue to do like nothing didn't happened. Actually, some still continue to do it even after 24th of February. For example, they selling good to Russia, but they're doing it through 3rd parties like Kazakhstan.Quote from: Alisha-k on December 30, 2022, 08:44:41 PMIf this so then who is backing Russia?.

The Europeans found themselves forced by this alliance to confront Russia within the NATO alliance, while not all countries in that alliance are affected by this confrontation. On the contrary, it is noticeable that some countries are actually beneficiaries, such as the United States and Turkey.This calls me to remind about the insistence of the British to exit the European Union within the framework of the Brexit project, and the surprise was the outbreak of the Ukrainian war shortly after the ratification of the Brexit.",

I hate bullies and Russia is a one of the biggest bullies in the world. Definitely the biggest one in Europe. NATO's supply of weapons and aid to Ukraine will only make the war longer and worse, not make things better, and most likely World War 3 will start from here, I don't expect it. With Nato or not, the Russian plan is still the same, what the Russians are doing is just defending their territory and preventing Nato's expansion. They underestimated others thinking they could extend the block to every corner of the world. It was not necessary for Ukraine to join Nato, it was clear that there was an arrangement to make Ukraine a victim of the war.Yeah, let NATO stop the supply of arms and supplies to Ukraine and allow Russia to easily overwhelm and take over Ukraine. It seems you don’t like it when Ukraine defends herself against the obvious aggressor Russia. While it may not seem necessary to you for Ukraine to join the bloc, it is definitely not necessary for Russia to invade Ukraine. The Ukrainians are the ones defending their territory",

One of the reasons Putin gave for invasion was to demilitarize Ukraine. Ukraine on her own side stood up to defend her territory from the invading military and since then, the conflict has lingered till date. Nobody thought this conflict would last this long.Many countries are said to be supporting Ukraine especially the member countries of NATO. The US is also a major financiar of the Ukrainian side. Of a truth I am beginning to think that this war is being fueled by these supporters of both countries (Russia and Ukraine).This war is supposed to have ended but with the support they are getting, they have continued to fight.Who do you think should be blamed? The US, NATO, Russia, or Ukraine?We cannot blame any particular party as the responsible one for this war. In my opinion, everyone is equally involved in this. In this race to prove itself as a superior or superpower, ordinary citizens face the consequences of this war. Therefore, I think this should be stopped at once. It is hard to blame which side caused this war because everyone has their own reasons, but who is right and who is wrong, the war has entered its 323rd day, and the people affected the most are the people of the two countries, and then is us. As long as the war continues, inflation, energy crisis, and food crisis will persist, and we will suffer more just because of the war between the two countries. Instead of finding out who is right and wrong, we should pray for the war to end soon so that life can return to normal.",

      "body": "Well, I personally believe, Ukraine should be blamed. They weren't supposed to go to war, with a big brother like Russia in the first place.Whatever side Ukraine may have taken in the debate, they would have sought out a solution before things got out of hand. They would have recognized that Russia is their big brother and that, due to their superior arsenals and status as one of the world's superpowers, they are capable of annihilating them in a matter of seconds.Is just like Mexico, wanting to go to war with USA, we all know the result will be catastrophic for Mexico. Today, no Russian city has been scratched, but I cannot say thesame for Ukraine.",
