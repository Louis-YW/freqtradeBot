  "content": "SailWars is precisely a play-for-fun game, with SLG gameplay standing out among current blockchain games in the market. It boasts beautiful graphics and a Pixar-like style loved by many players. It has a unique advantage in “breaking the cycle”, first by creating real consumption needs, and quietly converting Web2 players into Web3 players. In this regard, SailWars greatly optimizes the user experience by applying no differences in registration and login compared to traditional games, and generating hosted wallets for players, providing a \"zero threshold\" experience for Web2 users. NFTs, airdrops, membership privileges, community credentials, and other Web3-related interactive behaviors will not affect players' gaming experiences.GAMEPLAY        1        City Construction  Players need to build their own cities in an unoccupied sea area and gradually expand their territory. The city includes several types of buildings:        •        Capital City: the core building of the city, affecting the level limits of other buildings         •        Resource Buildings: woodyards, grain warehouses, iron mines, gold mines, etc.;        •        Military Buildings: shipyards, repair shops, barracks, cannon towers, etc.;        •        Science and Technology Buildings: research institutes, libraries, astronomy stations, etc.;        •        Other Buildings: exchanges, diplomatic missions, supply depots, etc.        2        Resource CollectionPlayers need to collect and manage four basic resources to maintain the operation and development of the empire:        •        Wood: used for construction, repairing ships, etc.;        •        Food: used to maintain the population and crew of the empire;        •        Iron: used to manufacture weapons, ships, buildings, etc.;        •        Gold: used to recruit sailors, research technology, trade, etc.Resources can be obtained through the following ways:        •        Build resource output buildings in your territory;        •        Occupy sea resource points;        •        Trade with other players;        •        Plunder other players' cities.        3        Technological ResearchTechnological research is an important means to enhance the combat effectiveness of cities and fleets.
