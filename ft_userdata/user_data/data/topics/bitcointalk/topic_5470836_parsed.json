      "body": "You will not get a loan here without the proper collateral. Users don't just hand out free money to anyone who asks. You have nothing to lose, and nothing to make you repay a loan if anyone was dumb enough to hand you the money. Your story also makes me question you. You have no money, but hired someone to get you info? Info on what? Who bought the storage unit? You cannot pay for your storage monthly(which costs less than $100 monthly normally), but in 30 days you will have $2500+interest LMAO. Cmon man.You mention you have a car, but how will a lender get your car to hold from you?",

      "body": "There’s no need to be snotty, but at least you responded.  All valid questions. First, I hired a hacker to get the name of the person who bought my storage. Now, I have to pay what buyer paid plus some of what he would have profited if sold just  to get it back…$2,000.Second, I had saved up money to take off work for one month to another state to take care of him for a month after back surgery, but he canceled it.Third, I did have the money to pay storage, but they told me I had until 10/13 and it auctioned on the 10/11.Fourth, I have no idea how this works or what is needed for “collateral”.  I do have enough sense to know no one wants my car as collateral.  Just being honest.  As far as property, I don’t have much anyone would accept.Fifth, I did have money and I used that money that I had saved to pay off a couple of old medicalBills to get them off my credit report.  That didn’t hurt my credit as much as I don’t have a history over the past 4 years as I’ve not worked.  I took care of my Mother.  I’m punished for not taking out credit that I couldn’t pay back.  Stupid.Last, I bring in $3500 a month and I have less than $500 in bills and those are paid through December 1.  So, yes I can pay it back.   I’d be too afraid to screw over someone anyway.  I’m just grasping for straws, dude.  I have no other options and it sucks.  I can pay a loan but I can’t damn get one the normal way. 🤷🏼‍♀️",
