Why it is accumulating so much Bitcoin in an address would have to be seen, but the most normal thing is that it is an entity and not an individual.",

Maybe the reason that there's a dust amount is because they're moving their bitcoins and that there are stray wallets that have some dust amounts that they want to empty out hence the dust amounts.",

Very possible given the amount and the little effect on price.One thing is for sure; they must be a high level or very powerful individual/group/institution to be able to buy this amount of coin without regulatory constraint and the ability to remain completely private from social media and media outlets.

I doubt a gambling platform can secure such a substantial investment from a gambler. Although Michael Saylor has been consistently buying Bitcoin, it is unlikely that he could acquire such a significant amount in just a couple of days. To understand how he is making those purchases, it would be helpful to conduct a Google search. I believe it may involve an exchange wallet, likely associated with a major player in the exchange industry.",

The company will most probably recover its own investment during the peaks of the bull run and at the same time they will make profits as well. After that the wallet may hold the remaining coins for a very long period and way earn profits with each bull run by selling huge sums of the coins from that accumulation. Let's say that if the current worth of the coins is $3B then in next bull run's peak the amount will most probably be around $12B which is not a small amount. And, when that happens the address can easily sell half of the coins over a short period and leave the half in the wallet for next bull runs.",
