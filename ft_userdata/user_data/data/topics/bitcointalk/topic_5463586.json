So you haveÂ  to confirm from him directly to hear from him. It is better to deal with trusted people than those you don't know. Some members here might also be interested to sell but if only you know who they are,you would have contacted them too.",

Tie 1 KYC is limited to many features plus the amount to be withdrewn. So it will not make sense for a large amount of bitcoin purchase from exchanges that use KYC. And since the op is asking the local board to purchase bitcoin, it is better he uses p2p for that and if anyone here junsi go collect wotowo with red feedback enough ones for dat matter. Op since Igebotz has accepted the order then you don't have anything to worry about it again. Just dm and start the process. Good luck with good deal.",

Thank you for your response, sir Igebotz.I don't know the exchanges that I will use just email and phone number for stage one verification that allow me to buy that is why I am here; I thought I must submit BVN, NIN, Driver's License or so before I can be allowed to trade small amount of less than $100.Plese you can provide me with exchange link/name so that I can buy it there for some experience too.QuoteOp if you must buy from anyone from this board I'm ready to serve as zero-fees escrow for the deal.But if you want to get it from me send a PM and I will give you my rates. I was thinking there will be an existing Bitcoin to Naira exchange thread here that was why I ask, but the information you provide will be enough so that I cannot be bothering you with PM any time I will buy small amounts of BTC.",

If you want to trade on CexP2P, you will need to provide identity document like drivers license, national ID/NIN or international passport, or at least you will provide your BVN.Quote from: Abu-Naim on August 18, 2023, 07:13:03 AMPlese you can provide me with exchange link/name so that I can buy it there for some experience too.The option that you can go for is P2P (DexP2P). I would have advised you to go for Agarodesk, but I see people creating ads to sell bitcoin, no one that is buying. Also on hodlhodl, I just saw only just one person that creates ad to selling bitcoin, no ad for buying bitcoin. Or maybe you can create your own ad on those sites, but I have not tried that before.The easiest way is to buy from someone on this forum from Nigerians. Igebotz will give you a good offer that will also favour him to earn, not that you are disturbing him. It is an offer that he accepted, or look for other people with a better rate if you think his rate is expensive for you is what he is talking about.",

And that is the p2p aspect of bitcoin but since someone has volunteered to sell for you then you have to dm im and have the deal. He is a reliable fellow in the forum. And please if you are dealing with newbies in the forum or the local board, please take precautions because many of those guys are just coming na to make money so anyhow if you fall for their hands you will your own and nobody in this local board can help that. It was Brainboss that was doing that service and probably because of the low patronage he stop at the moment but I believe he will still resume work very soon.",
