      "body": "Despite their below-level usefulness, meme coins remains to be attractive a good level of interest from big and small investors or the buyers of the token. Now, there are so many of this similar projects right now in the market -and am sure many more can be coming in 2024 to take advantage of the possible bull run - all vying for the money of the people using different strategies to get attention even including posting in this forum. I am not against meme coins but I am just wondering how many of these platforms are really performing well and how many are now six feet below the ground. I am saying that the risks in crypto is quite high and with meme coins that risks can soar beyond the roof. Good luck to all who are convinced to open their purse.",
