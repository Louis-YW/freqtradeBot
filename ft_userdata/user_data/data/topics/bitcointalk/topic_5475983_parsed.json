In the dashboard it appears in rate stateabnormal, how do I test the hashboards one by one? the crc error is there any way to fix it?To test them one by one you need to disconnect two hashboards from the power supply and disconnect them from the control board or you can just remove two hashboards completely and keep one hashboard and let it run for a while before copying the logs do it again on the other hashboard and copy all logs.It's fixable and it is related to an unstable chip but let me ask what pool do you mine?If you're mining on Nicehash the pool might be the culprit.",

Now it only works at night because during the day the voltage when I plug in the antminer drops to 170v.. Should a stabilizer fix that?That's the reason why this unit won't work properly the source of power is not enough this unit requires 200~240v below on that the unit will run abnormally and sometimes cables melt if you force this unit to run at high power mode.Are you using an extension outlet? I mean from the wall outlet to the extension cord then connected to your s19 unit?I suggest plug it directly into the wall but if not then it might need a voltage stabilizer to avoid power drops.",
