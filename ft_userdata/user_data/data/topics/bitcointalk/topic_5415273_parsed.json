Here is some information for you guys. There I have 4 BTC put in the Vault to bridge via the following address and TxHash:https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/955954a53c8ddbcb02b59f28cc9dbf3834733a0030270aca4ddbf54c8eb199e5?from=trustwalletBitcoin / Transaction / 955954a53c8ddbcb02b59f28cc9dbf3834733a0030270aca4ddbf54c8eb199e5Check Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, value: 4.09994750 BTC, date: 2022-02-16 Address:bc1qc5t9hhaa4hk59t8vh2m28na285e6nxtukz4z4xWhat is the error: BSC address not confirmed, claimed - meaning the BTC should be traceable via smart contract. I am not able to reach out to the Badger Team or RenVM Team.Kind regards",

Fortunately, I had a power outage at that exact moment, so I was not able to claim the bitcoins on the BSC20.You mean unfortunately you had power outage?Let me repeat this again, any token on some centralized shitcoin chain is NOT and never will be Bitcoin.Using bridges is a very high risk, tokens can be hacked or exploited at any time, and I have no idea what0s going on with Badger Team.Quote from: concorde5757 on September 28, 2022, 10:37:28 PMCan someone please help me how to get my 4 bitcoins back? Here is some information for you guys.Bitcointalk forum is not Badger Team support team, and nobody hear can help you like that.Stop using bridges and fake bitcoins.",
