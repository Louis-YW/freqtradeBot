A transaction must be broadcast to the network via the internet in order to be verified and then mined in to a block.That does not mean, however, that each individual needs internet access. You simply need some way of getting a transaction on to the internet. Each person can easily sign transactions on their offline devices, and then save those transactions as a small text file. All you need then is some way of getting those small text files to a person/node/service who will broadcast them for you. If you have a public WiFi spot in your community, then you can travel there and use that. If one person has a mobile device or similar with internet access, they could potentially set up a service broadcasting transactions on behalf of other people. There are services which allow you to send transactions via SMS as pointed out above. You could even transmit a transaction via phone call or radio to someone with an internet connection who could broadcast it on your behalf.Since you are posting on this forum, you must have internet access somehow. Could you set up a method using whatever connection you are on now to broadcast transaction on behalf of your community?",

If you don't have the chain to verify, you need to trust someone else. So, if the members in your community don't have Internet access, trust is required. Their best course is likely, as described by o_e_l_e_o, to trust you for doing that.",

Many of them have expressed their concern to me. It all comes down to how can I transfer bitcoin payments to you without internet?I do not know if this possibility had been discussed before in this wonderful forum. But I need your help to see if all together we can achieve this.The only way I know that you can transfer bitcoin without the internet is with a physical device such as an Opendime or this new SatsCard product that is being released. Both are by CoinKite but they both require a certain level of trust.Another way that you can transact with bitcoin but not on-chain is with networked lightning nodes. They can be networked with either a mesh network for greater distances or hardwired for short distances but you would still need internet to be able to open and close channels. There is a group of bitcoiners in Berlin who are using lightning offline with a city mesh network (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freifunk) to transact amongst each other without being connected to the internet. The lightning nodes only need to be able to communicate with each other directly to update the state of the channels. When either party wants to close or open a new channel, they would need an internet connection but since you mentioned not everyone in your community has internet access, this could be part of your solution.",

If I have that, I can use ham radio to send money. No internet needed! However, this technology is new and the process is somewhat complicated (there is not much information about it) but I think I can do it. Thanks super geniuses!",

It all comes down to how can I transfer bitcoin payments to you without internet?I do not know if this possibility had been discussed before in this wonderful forum. But I need your help to see if all together we can achieve this.One of the ways to handle this is to have a trustworthy Bitcoin/crypto business that prints many private keys loaded with small amount of Bitcoin on multiple cards and sell them to people.It could be done this way:On the back of the cards, print multiple Bitcoin private keys that contain small amount of bitcoins and seal the keys with tough scratchable materials - > then write for example 6 digit codes on the tough seal and seal with another seal that's less tough . The card buyers will first of all scratch off the top seal to reveal the codes then verify that the card is genuine by sending the codes to the verifying company via sms. Once the codes have been unsealed the card may no longer be transferable.The final owner of the card can go ahead and unseal the second layer to claim the private keys.This should be done securely with a reputable company to keep the private keys safe especially during printing & sealing. I prefer private keys loaded with small amount of bitcoins to lessen the risk of losing a card with private keys that contain huge amounts of bitcoins. Your customers could buy many cards when they want to pay for goods/services that cost a lot of money.",

I'm afraid, all are pointing to one fact, 'it's not possible.' Bitcoin works with blockchain technology and this will always require the internet to validate/complete every valid transaction. And from what you have explained, it's reasonable, yet it will always cause delays in transactions which BTC doesn't naturally cause.",
