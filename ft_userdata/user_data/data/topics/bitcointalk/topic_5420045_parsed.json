      "body": "The story seems perfect with the above Elrond Binance Launchpad information. There is a memo required to participate in that, so it is a match with your recollection. One thing to verify if it is indeed a launchpad Binance's address is to try asking in the Elrond community, to see if anyone is remembering it. After that, try to approach Binance supports once more and give the proof regarding the address ownership. Nevertheless, just don't get your hope too high, there might be a term and condition or service that might prevent the funds from being recovered.",

Regarding memos, in BNB there are 2 payment methods.1. No memo2. With memoFor non-exchange wallets, generally the sending method does not require a memo. As for sending by memo, it is generally required if you are sending to an exchange. If, when you send the BNB to an exchange and there is need a memo, then it is true what it says, that the recipient did not receive the BNB that you have sent. If that exchange generate different address for every user, it should be no need memo, and they can refund it. Since the exchange is not online anymore, i'm so sorry to say, you are lose your BNB already.",

I also searched the address that has been given by the @OP, get a few result as well. Not only from the research you're doing, but the address is also being used for scammers as well for (Doubler any fund by sending to this address) the different only MEMO.It's clear the address was created by \"Exchange\", potentially by Binance. Because a few reason1. Bingbinglee is a user: He using this address for the tips jars.2. Elrond using this address for Token SALE3. Some scammer site (txti) using the address for doubler scam fund.All of these different customer from user to a company/project using the same address only have different MEMO. As we know, how the exchange deposit work some of them using a same address and to category of each user account is by the MEMO.",

So you are sent the coin from an exchange back then.What you need to do right now is to remember and trace back on which particular exchange. It is mandatory to remember and still having an access to procced further. The point that the transaction did not directly come from an account/wallet that you control, makes it required to ask the exchange's support to give the proof of that particular transaction is indeed coming from your end. So without that, there is zero chance to proceed further with Binance.",
