Our population don pass watin to call alarming, our production  dey low and this moneyatter now just push everything go up because, most people way dey into export and export, na money them dey use. The fact say, consumers dey buy there money to use and this money cef na watin this traders go still use go buy other people goods and to replenish there shop them na em be say, things gats cost pass as e be. Fuel kwa no make the matter better, e follow cast the whole thing. Na for election to pass first shah, we goanage as we dey manage before first first.When it comes to CBN, them don shred old currencies way enter there hands already and them no go fit go back to print old notes except new once.

Imagine say you go POS to collect 5k,them come give you 3k,if you get wetin  you dey trade or do you go also increase the price because no be only you go face the hike in POS charge. This nonsense politicians because of their greed,them mess the country up say na free and fair election we won do,come scarce cash,and still the election was not free and fair.In the beginning of the first week of this cashless policy so many businesses shut down and money no dey to transact,the way e affect Mr A,na so e affect Mr B. Imagine say wetin my neighbour buy last month,when I go price am,e don increase with 35%, I shock but na where we dey go self for this country.",

As dem talk, if too elephants fight na the grass dey suffer am. Una think say CBN fit do anything to reduce the inflation rate especially for food?But you check am na, wetin the CBN wan do when some members of the government dey sabotage their plans. No be same APC governors carry CBN go court to bring back old naira and this wan mean say the supply of naira in circulation go come increase and two currency go come dey circulate at the same time. This can only devalue the naira more instead of adding value to it which goes against all the plans the CNB had to make the Naira strong again. This governors think say dem dey do good things but your post na a result of the decision they took. Th CBN are hopeless, na to just dolf hand the watch as the country dey go because nothing dem fit do at this point. I get questions oh, food inflation no fit happen because of lack of money na instead e dey happen because plenty money dey in circulation. Make person correct me if I dey get am wrong. Like people dey usually add price because they know say people fit afford am and commot price when money no dey. I think wetin dey contribute to the peak in food price na high transportation fee due to lack of petroleum and not the new money policy. Make we no forget fuel scarcity hit us the same time wey all this other things dey happen.",
