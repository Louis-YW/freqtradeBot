A common man wouldn’t think or diversify his means of savings all because of fear of losing everything to a scammer. If a common man is not indulge in any illegal activity, there’s no cause for alarm to be bothered about the implications that comes with it. The issue here is that the culprits who could be elites will be freed and not charged whereby the common man that indulges in such will be charged accordingly. Whatever the case may be, we should not indulge in illegal activities.",

      "body": "The fact is the VBN flagging is like medicine after death, how can the banks involve allowed the fraud to be perpetuated before whitelisting the accounts involved, most of the fraud that happens in Nigeria is all through the banking system and reading through the link I discovered that the fraud that was recorded are those that involve the banks listed under 2021-2022 fiscal year and year under review. But what about the fraud that was targeted at the bank customers, take Wema bank for instance the was a case of massive investment scam amounting to billions of naira, and wema bank was the bank the fake company had a company account with so there is 100% certainty that the bank was well aware of the scam and some top management staffs of the bank all have shared in it. The Nigeria bank does not protect the customers but themselves and of you have fraud case with your account the bank will clearly tell you that its out of their power and will subject you to rigorous procedures that will make you give up on your recovery process.",

Having said that, E just they like when CBN bring their policy on withdrawal, i bin no support am for some few reasons, but as the amendment show, i come see say the thing don they fair and good, thus make them carry on. My problem with this BVN matter wey them don eye na im be say some people wey no commit fraud, but based on say them no loud their means of income, fit fall into wahala, e just they like EFCC matter, as long as you be fresh guy wey they do well, them go tag you yahoo boy, even if you never steal one naira from person before, e they vex me. If the suspects are truly fraudsters, then no wahala, but if people wey low-key work hard for their money come they affected, e no go make sense at all.",

All this one una dey talk no concern common man unless na mumu no know wetin dey sup allow person dey use him bank dey run transaction wey him no know about, na the only way wey common man go dey implicated for this matter if not nothing concern them. This fit be accounts wey dey Into forex or crypto, wey the government just dey find way to frustrate but make we wait for the full gist I believe any body wey dey scam no go fall mugu dey use him own personal accounts so all this account fit be people wey no know wetin dey happen for their account or strategic attack on those the government accused of causing dollars to be high and Naira losing value which are crypto and forex traders. Nothing our government dey even do they dey straight forward.",
