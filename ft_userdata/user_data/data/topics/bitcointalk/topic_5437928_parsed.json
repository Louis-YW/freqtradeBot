  "content": "Electric cars are a ploy that is being used by industry to take people's focus off \"Brown's Alcohol Motor Fuel Cookbook,\" and others like it.One of the things that Brown did was, he shaved the heads of a motorcycle engine, to give the machine about an 18:1 compression ratio. This high of a compression ratio would destroy a gasoline engine running on gasoline because of severe detonation... if you could even get it started.Ethanol alcohol (partially burned ethyl gasoline) has less power than gasoline. Why? Because some of it has already been burned. It burns really well in an engine like the Brown motorcycle engine.The point is, anyone can make alcohol at home. Home distillation units could be manufactured so that anybody could make ethanol out of garbage and table scraps, right at home. And with the metallurgy techniques we have today, engines could be made so that alcohol wouldn't corrode them.Forget gasoline and electricity. Get yourself a copy of \"Brown's Alcohol Motor Fuel Cookbook,\" before there aren't any around any longer. You can get one at eBay or Amazon.And don't forget \"Brown's Second Alcohol Fuel Cookbook.\"",

      "body": "^^^ This is where almost all the furnace companies are making us waste fuel money. I mean, what about using gasoline as a heating fuel? But not only gasoline, also natural gas. Fuel oil would be one of the best. Do it in a different way. Here's how with diesel.Run a small diesel engine off the fuel oil. Run a generator with the engine. Use the electricity as well as the engine exhaust to heat the house or whatever. Combo fuel oil heat and electric heat.Even if you have a wood burner, run a steam engine off the heat of the burner. Again, generator and electricity heat as well as wood heat.Do-it-yourself might be a bit of work... especially with safety and all. But why aren't professionally built packages available? Or are they?Further...What about dual cooling systems, especially in dry areas of the country? Like this...Swamp coolers work, and they work well at times. Also, standard freon-type AC units work well. Why not build the heat radiator coils of a freon unit to be cooled by a swamp cooler unit. This would make the AC to be much more efficient because the radiator wouldn't be radiating into hot air, outdoors. It would be radiating into the cool air of the swamp cooler, which is cheap.You can do this yourself, but it wouldn't it be great if there were some companies that make these units for the home?All that Brown did was some thoughtful backyard mechanics like these.",

Will do wonders for cylinder and rings, valves..... Frozen carburetor.....https://i.ibb.co/jWZ1YjP/Untitled.pngThanks for the picture. Oil and water don't mix. Your picture is an example of a gasoline engine, right? So, where did the water come from? Certainly not running water rather than gasoline, right?The products of burning gasoline in a standard gasoline car engine are:1. water;2. CO2;3. CO;4. An assorted bunch of chemicals from the additives in the gasoline.In other words, we are already running water in our engines.If a gallon of gasoline were efficiently burned in an engine, there would be more than a gallon of water coming out of the tailpipe in the form of steam and water vapor. In addition, there would be a large amount of CO2, that if compressed into liquid, would probably amount to another gallon.So, why when you put a gallon of gasoline in, do you get two gallons of exhaust back out? It's from the oxygen being sucked in through the intake, which is burned with the gasoline.Lots of things to think about. One thing we can do right now is to make efficient engines, so that stuff like your picture doesn't happen. Japanese engines have taken care of much of the problem already.",

Hemp (marijuana), and Jerusalem artichoke are two plants that can make almost as much alcohol as corn... and maybe more.Let's use what works for whatever, because the resulting mash from these plants, after the alcohol is removed, can keep farm animals healthy.",

Add sulphuric acid to break the cellulose off the carbon. Then add the acetyl enzyme. And wullah! You get alcohol that floats to the top and you can scoop it off with a ladle.Now don't quote me on all this. It's in the book, but I haven't read it in a long time. But do note that the alcohol produced this way will gel easily, and won't run well in an engine just for that reason. But it's something to think about.",
