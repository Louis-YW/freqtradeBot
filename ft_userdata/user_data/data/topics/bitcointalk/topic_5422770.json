  "content": "If you own lots of physical crypto collectibles, how would you store them securely? I usually put my graded coin slabs (crypto-related, of course) inside small shockproof boxes for safekeeping (each box costs around $2 on AliExpress). Then I put all of those small boxes inside a large Pelican box with a padlock for greater protection. The Pelican box is expensive, but totally worth it in my opinion. I think this method allows me to protect my collectibles against water, dust, shocks, and even fire (although I'm yet to verify if that is the case). In physical crypto coins alone, I have over 120 units. And that's without counting other types of collectibles such as the Papersafe Stock Certificates, the Polymerbit Notes, and even the original Bitcoin Magazines.Here is a picture of the small boxes I use to store graded crypto coins (click to enlarge):What are your methods? Feel free to share them here. Thanks.",

I have a few similar or could be the same - had to resort to using these as well as I simply do not have enough room to display everything I have.I hope to eventually have a much bigger office where I can fully display everything eventually.as for physical security - only people I trust are allowed in my office and I pity anyone who comes with the intent of breaking in.",

      "body": "It's cool to display the items. According to articles I've read about coin display, several parameters must be considered into account:1. Security: locked lockers, armored glass, Using jumbo screws to hang frames/shelves or cabinets. In favor of docking., etc.2. Lighting - direct light may damage the quality of the coin/banknote. Natural lighting causes increased humidity which can cause a process of \"excessive sweating\" in the capsule that keeps the itemâ€”especially items with holograms.So, in conclusion, there are items that are indeed nice to see daily or to show off to close friends. Still, the delicate items that require increased security or certain conditions are worth putting in a shady, locked place. And it is definitely worth using moisture-absorbing devices in these places for optimal and long-term preservation of your unique items.I hope this helped someone  QB",
