Here is how I will do it.~This is overcomplicated and unnecessary for the case described by Poker Player. He wants to make the message public after a certain event, so there is no need to encrypt the message. It is sufficient to sign or hash a message and publish its signature/hash in advance, so that anyone can verify, and you don't depend on one or two forum members to confirm the authenticity of your message.Poker Player, if you want to add a timestamp to your message, I suggest that you incorporate the block number and the nonce from the last mined block into the message. When you publish the signature/hash of the message, you also publish the block number and nonce that will be in the message. That way, you will have another provable way of confirming when the message was created.",

It's more secure than any of the options above. Here is how I will do it.~This is overcomplicated and unnecessary for the case described by Poker Player. I was going to ask, what is the difference in terms of security? Like 0,001% of being hacked if I use a signed message and 0,00000001% if I use PGP? Because in that case I would use the signed message, which seems to me more simple, although I find it quite interesting the different options. (I just used random numbers)No difference at all. If it was possible to 'hack' your Bitcoin message signature, it would also be possible to steal coins from the blockchain.Quote from: Poker Player on October 28, 2022, 02:58:22 AM-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----Signed message will be revealed on 10/29/2022-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----IIVa9HxfBRnnOFfks0sRBqlK5vd9tOzh6zgA6L6OFLfjCedQocGY6jxeg7tJLAnPKJrAk0RCf1rV6A6 ZSALY9tA=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----Address staked here.Would that be OK? Something like that works perfectly, yes. Do make sure that the post is / won't be edited; that's just one thing I'd try to make sure of. Or someone archive the page just in case there will be doubts in the future.",
