Iâ€™ve been searching for this too among crypto casino available here in forum but no one offers this event on crypto casino sportsbook that has an entertainment section. Most of the bookie that has this bet option are those fiat casino and doesnâ€™t have ANN thread here. I believe crypto casino is not interested offering this type of bet since they have oscars award feature.I will be interested to follow this thread.",

But, I don't think most casinos are offering a betting line for miss universe, I'm not sure but I think it's because most gamblers may not be interested in watching this international pageantry event. I tried searching for it, out of curiosity if there are an actual betting line for for crypto and non crypto casinos, though I found some, but when I visit their website it's not available.",

To be honest, this is the first time I know from your post that Miss Universe is also at stake.However, if there is such a bet, maybe almost all gambling or betting platforms don't have bets on Miss Universe because from my experience following several platforms I have never seen such a bet and I think it would be ridiculous if anyone was interested in betting on Miss Universe. ðŸ¤£",

Naturally the house would take on more exposure to some candidates than others and take on some risk. That's fine.I think it's pretty unlikely that would be built in time at this rate but could do such a thing in the future if people were interested and we had enough of a head start.It's clearly not as fun as being able to pick your girl, but I would have no idea how to handicap the women in the first place, and I doubt many people on Earth could do that efficiently, so idk how any book could offer such things easily.",
