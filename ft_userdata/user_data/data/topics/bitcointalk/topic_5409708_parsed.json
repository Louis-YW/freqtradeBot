  "content": "When repairing a single hash board of Avalon 10 series, if the test fixture reports 0 or a number, no matter whether the C signal and the CK signal are normal or not, you can use the Avalon debug signal short circuit board to quickly locate the faulty chip.Avalon debug D signal shorting board is suitable for A10 series, A11 series, A12 series.When in use, you only need to press the switch, short-circuit the clip to connect to the D signal on the board, and you can replace the oscilloscope to find the fault point, which is very convenient.Avalon debug D signal shorting board structure description:https://www.zeusbtc.com/share/avalon-d-signal-short-circuit-board/avalon-debug-d-signal-short-circuit-board-interface.jpg1. Short-circuit the positive pole, connect the D signal test point that the chip needs to be short-circuited2. Short-circuit the negative pole, connect the negative pole of the power supply where the chip signal to be short-circuited is located, which is the domain voltage Vcore)3. Test fixture cable interface (two data interfaces)4. Hash board cable interface (two data interfaces)5. Pull the switch: Open: The normal test mode is the same as the function when the fixture is not connected to this small board. Press: short-circuit search mode, find the number of chips through the short-circuit clip (the cable should also be connected to the hash board)6. Short-circuit clip interface7. Data cable8. 12V power interfacehttps://www.zeusbtc.com/share/avalon-d-signal-short-circuit-board/short-circuit-board-connection-physical-diagram.jpgAvalon debug D Signal Shorting Board Instructions for Use：1. When the Avalon board test shows asic count: 0;First, connect the D signal short circuit board to the Avalon hash board as shown above, press the switch on the short circuit board, and the shorting clip randomly shorts the D signal from the D signal transmission direction to locate the faulty chip.https://www.zeusbtc.com/share/avalon-d-signal-short-circuit-board/hash-board-test-result.jpg2. When the Avalon single board test shows asic count: 10, it means that the hash board lacks chips;https://www.zeusbtc.com/share/avalon-d-signal-short-circuit-board/short-circuit-d-signal.jpgShort-circuit the D signal output by the A16 chip, and the test fixture displays asic count: 10. It should be noted that the correct number of chips is 16-6=10 because there are no soldered chips in the first 6 A1-A6 positions of the test board. At this time, the number reported in the log is the same as the number of chips before the short-circuit signal, indicating that the first 10 chips are normal. Therefore, we need to continue the short circuit check until we find the chip without a D signal to locate the faulty chip.",
