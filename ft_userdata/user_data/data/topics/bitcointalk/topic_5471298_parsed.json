  "content": "I like to use many exchanges instead of depending on one, I decided to try MEXC recently to know how it is because I know it is an exchange people can still use without KYC to some level and because it is one if the leading exchanges. I registered and went to their trading fee and I was surprised with what I saw. The trading fee has been the lowest that I have seen on exchanges.The trading fee in the spot market for all trading pair is 0% for both markers and takers.The trading fee in the future market is 0% for makers and 0.01% for takers I'm for this USDT-M and Coin-M   Is this kind of promotional offer? If not because it is a good exchange, I would have thought that I should not accept what seems to be too good to be true. But their withdrawal fee is kind of high. I still prefer OKX withdraw fee among all the exchanges that I am using.",

I think 0% for market makers and 0.01% for market takers is still very low. Is this how it has been or the exchange is also having a promotional offer for future trading fee which makes it this considerably low?I think I like the exchange but the only thing I wish the exchange could have is multiasset mode or a unified trading account, but which some trader will not like though as they see opening position with multiple currencies to be risky. To open a position with a single currency, I think the exchange would be good.",

They can impose hidden fees, high withdrawal fees, or offers for a temporary period to attract more users, but in the end, do not use them because the fees are just low. Look for trading volumes, listed assets, identity verification procedures, and the possibility of their bankruptcy.",

If you want to know  what I am talking about, go to Binance derivative and change the USDT-M from single-asset mode to multi-asset mode and see the lists of coins like bitcoin, ether, ripple and some stable coins which you can use at the same time use to open USDT pair position. If you want more options for many coins, go to Bybit and change your account to unified trading account and read about it too.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on October 24, 2023, 08:57:22 AMThe last exchange that announced zero fees ended up in bankruptcy, which was FTX.Exchanges do have promotional offers. Binance has zero trading fee for most of their trading pairs either last year or beginning of this year. Since I joined Bybit, there is still zero trading fee for UDSC trading pairs on spot market. But I am more of the future trading type.",

I use only a few exchange but it's time now I guess to try something new just as what you're doing and with those promos like 0% trading fees. And based from their link blog about how long this promo will stay, it says that \"until further notice\".Quote from: https://support.mexc.com/hc/en-001/articles/17101730313113--MEXC-Mega-Offer-Zero-Fee-Spot-Trading-In conjunction with MEXC's 5th anniversary, and in appreciation for our users' support, MEXC will be offering zero trading fees for all spot trading pairs (excluding ETFs), starting 16:00, April 1, 2023 (UTC). Start time: 16:00, April 1, 2023 (UTC)End time: Until further noticeApplicable pairs: All spot trading pairs on MEXC",

These offers are good and contribute to attracting more users who want to take advantage of these offers, but I think they are only on certain pairs.MEXC was one of my favorite exchanges but now I have stopped trading so I only use the exchanges rarely, but in general I know that MEXC has many good features that compete with the larger exchanges.",

I already use 3 top exchanges but need more exchanges these days for personal reasons, and this is again worth checking out as I like to do my own research.A low fee is a very good point of attraction for me if I eventually choose this exchange, except that I noticed all the smaller exchanges like to offer a thing like this for a limited duration of time just to attract customers to try them out before even making it worse. Either way, let me enjoy it while it lasts, but will still maintain a low amount with such an exchange, at least for now.",

      "body": "I have been using MEXC for some time now and I was surprised when I made some purchases on it. The trading fee is way lower than other exchanges and the plus point of not having to go through KYC. What I did not like is that they also use Bitcoin Legacy address and not SegWit, wait for 3 confirmations, and do not support the Lightning Network. What I was impressed with was that they have a good volume on most pairs, no KYC policy might be the reason. I do not think they would be able to last much longer if they kept on like the way they are now. As of now, MEXC would be the first choice for everyone who was trading on Kucoin before KYC was made mandatory.",
