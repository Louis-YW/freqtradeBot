I enter some villages for my side, I fit talk say 99% of people wey dey all those villages wey I go no even sabi wetin bitcoin be, dey no even get stable electricity, very poor internet connection, No education, everything wey dem dey do no pass farming, if you tell those people about bitcoin, they go think say you just wan scam them self. Na why I dey reason say e no go easy make we dey use bitcoin for transactions in Nigeria, e fit even dey happen for urban areas, but u see our rural areas, we get work to do for that side.Quote from: Sexylizzy2813 on July 28, 2023, 06:49:13 AMI con imagine say we con dy use Bitcoin pay NEPA BILL, HOUSE RENT, TRANSPORT BILL (to pay conductor self) like do many things and the one wey make me talk about this one nah, we as Naija people con dy use  Bitcoin dey pay Bride Prize for this contri?Seriously e go dey fun ooo, but I know say e fit dey possible to dey pay Nepa bills, House rent with bitcoin, but you see that transport bill, e go hard small make we dey honest.

E get some people wey dey struggle to learn technology or to even dey acquainted with modern facilities not to talk of bitcoin technology. Make I tell you the truth no be every settings wey fit in bitcoin payment for we country. E get some payment wey go just require you dey fast to bring out cash pay den go your way. Those na like the public commuters, old and elderly vendors with no technological knowledge and lots more.  Another issue na internet connection. We country never really get to the point wey person fit use internet without interruption. Even for cities poor network connection dey talk less the villages them.  For my capital city, I go one hotel go visit my friend wey lodge there the first thing I noticed be say I no fit browse at all. It was very frustrating and the thing vex me be say we dey yet to upgrade for we country.

Why because first for you to do anything bitcoin transactions your phone should at least  be on and have power inside because there are lot of people who could want to pay with bitcoin but if there is power and network failure I don't think such feature would be ideal in our country. As per the bride prize well, our people may not put that in consider as they would want physical cash and not digital or electronical money. But whatever may the case bitcoin is young and with time we'll all have to use it as the way we uses our fiat without restrictions this could be only if it has been legalized and adopted globally.",

Na true, adoption of di lightening network by especially small business owners for Nigeria, na im be di koko to consider, because of bitcoin high transaction fees. If all things being equal, our government come regulate crypto matter, enof publicity about di use of bitcoin, NEPA come de try, network come de fast, but small business owners come de transact business with bitcoin at a higher cost, den e no go work. So dis LN suppose de available and make e no de so complex to understand by buyers and sellers.I believe say e de very possible say one day every business for Nigeria, go de make payments with bitcoin, because twenty years ago who fit to believe say we fit to de make payments for goods and services directly from our bank account, with ordinary phone.Me I no fit to advice anybody to collect bride price for anything inline transfer, because as our network be for Nigeria, di money fit to enter pending. Abi you go hold your inlaws ransom until di money enter your account? Or if you allow dem carry your daughter go, what if di money come reverse to Inlaw account?

It is possible now in countries like El Salvador and CAR that have made bitcoin legal tenders. Also there are some countries that are very bitcoin friendly like Slovenia and Switzerland which you can still be able to use bitcoin for some products and services. But Nigeria is not just like those countries. If bitcoin would be used like that in Nigeria, it has to become a legal tender and that is highly likely not possible.",
