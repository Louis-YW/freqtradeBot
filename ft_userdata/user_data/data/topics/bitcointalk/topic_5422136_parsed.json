  "content": "I don't know how we have been taught following our childhood years, till now. The things we have come to know have been inculcated by various teaching techniques applied by our teachers.Often times, we like a certain subject because of the teachers way of either calmly explaining to make us understand or by yelling at us to make us learn by force. Then we simply cram to avoid more shouts or whooping.As adults, we still happen to learn new skills from persons with the knowledge, but the quality of our knowledge may be dependent on how best we studied or learnt under the teacher.Would you prefer a teacher who speaks calmly while teaching, so as to buttress a point or the one who yells while teaching, inorder to make us understand with an aim of making one the best by force?",

      "body": "I think to learn & become well educated there has to be a big willingness from the pupil to succeed. It doesn’t matter how good the teacher is, if the pupil isn’t willing to be attentive, work hard & study at home away from the class then they will not do themselves justice & achieve their full potential.Obviously it helps if the teacher is good & able to adapt to their pupils needs but there must be a willingness on the part of the pupil to work very hard so they can achieve their goals.",
