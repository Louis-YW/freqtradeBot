Maybe they can manage their gambling time, but to stop their gambling activities, they need more than just confiding in others because this involves realizing what they get from gambling. Maybe they don't think about gambling or winning games but they want to keep going back to gambling but in a different game. And if they find a new game in the casino, they will be interested in trying it.If you really want to stop gambling, you need to have a strong desire and have to do other activities that can take your mind off gambling. Many people have tried it but still have much to learn to get used to it. This habit is still difficult to start regularly, especially if they have often played gambling.",

Some gamblers don't even think that they are addicted to gambling, maybe because they don't chase their losses but because they spend too much time on the casino gambling for fun. Before they will know it they have lost so much.3.This is why I think that having a time frame for your gambling activities is very important for you to stay safe from addiction. Gamble for fun and don't gamble for funds",

Just spend a few hours staying in a casino to gamble so you can avoid what you don't realize is wasting time that you should be spending on important things instead of gambling.These points are good but very difficult to keep to.  Setting out money aside for gambling is as good as telling a smoker to reduce the amount of cigarettes to take by himself. These actually need a pressure to achieve. A gambler that has money in his account after losing a bet has that drive to try again.It is every gambler delight to make money from it. So it is worthy to note because this is the primary aim to gamble and that is why it is difficult to spend a short time on it but agreed the lesser time you spend in gambling, the gradual your interest in gambling diminishes. I believe this aspect that if you want to stop gambling then start reducing the amount of time you give to gambling.",

But when they are also used to that, for sure that will improve the situation of what they will do as a responsible gambler for sure in the end.",

If he becomes addicted and keeps on losing, then definitely a point will come when he won’t have enough funds to gamble further, and automatically his addiction will also get over. Yes, the points mentioned in the OP are good, but some gamblers will deny following them. Gambling addiction is seen only in rich people. For them, gambling is like winning. For them, the money doesn’t matter. I would suggest everyone gamble only within their limits.",

You also need to set a limited time for gambling maybe twice in a week preferably weekends. This will make you not to spend more time gambling. The more you spend time gambling, the more addicted you become to it because it is natural. Whatever you do often become part of you. Then finally chasing losses is another thing that leads to gambling addiction. If you take gambling as fun and not for a professional job when you lose it will not pain you much.",

Gambling is a very strange type of entertainment and those people who have no luck or they are not lucky, then they will not gain any profits in the world of gambling. That's why if those people set a amount limit during their gambling session then their losses will not impact their lives.The second point is also right because gambling isn't a field to make money, and especially for those who would want it to be their main source of income. The gamblers on some days can earn quite good amount of money while on some days they will lose a lot of money. It's always important for a gambler to set limit on their gambling activities on those days when they have more losses than wins. The third point need to be changed a little because those who spend few hours are day on a casino often get addicted to it and that's why it's important to limit your daily gambling duration in minutes instead of hours. If you love gambling and enjoy casino sites then I think 40-80 minutes per day is more than enough, and more than that would be the misuse of time.",
