It's estimated that less than 1/10th of CS 1.0 were created as FDCs. Of these FDCs, only 13% were issued with a blue stamp making this one a very rare item.- Because of the high demand of crypto stamps especially the CS1.0 was subject to forgery (after several months on the market).I am original purchaser of these stamps / FDCs and guarantee they are geniuine and the NFT + ETH are still intact and on the wallet of the stamp.",
