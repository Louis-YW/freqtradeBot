This feature is very common and inferior to the current sportsbook available on the market. You have a very limited sports market offered and few cryptocurrencies accepted to your platform. I’m not trying to degrade your casino but the feature that you mention makes no difference at all when compared to other sportsbook.",

If you violate the T&C we have the right to refuse partially or completely (at our discretion) to conduct any transaction that you request.And the bankroll should run from your side, that's why your project is fully centralized, but I would like to understand why you called a decentralized project, can you explain that to the community?And why there is a limit to betting based on the users' total bets? that's kind of nonsense. You are limiting the high rollers this way.",

But you are right about the risk since there were incidents like the logins revealed to the app developer. Its basically like phishing and its scary to connect our wallets.",

Well it is understandable so I can give the benefit of the doubt but still, we'd like to see some proof its a DEX before anything else since that's the key feature of your casino after all.In terms of features, too little sports variety to even call it sports betting. Your roadmap shouldn't even include it, it should be the key idea of what your site should've had first and foremost. I know football and basketball are famous sports, but as you claim that you support many countries, having as many sports as possible would increase your possible user count imo.",

Although, security of smart contract still needs to verified, hopefully devs will publish audit from reputable firm.",

This looks suspicious and I don't want to visit your website by typing the domain name in the browser bar.I have never seen a successful fully decentralized sports betting platform. Many forum members(including me) have doubts that your sportsbook will be truly decentralized. I have never used the Binance smart chain before and I know nothing about it. Isn't the Binance smart chain actually centralized? Doesn't Binance have full control over the Binance smart chain?Anyway, good luck with this project, OP.",

In my view, the website looks well-designed, though it's still being worked on, so some parts might not function properly.When you connect your wallet to their website, make sure to use good security practices for your wallet. This is particularly important when dealing with decentralized projects. However, it seems that the website may not be a fully decentralized casino yet, based on their current terms and conditions.",

In such a case you cannot claim your betting platform to be decentralized.Furthermore, you should provide your gambling platform as open source. The website itself looks very simple, as if you put in an entire 10 minutes worth of work into building it. I cannot trust connecting my wallet because there are too many red flags.",
