      "body": "Hey Tyke nice to talk to you.I want to tell you a crazy story. No one has ever for a second or moment just for fun had thought that Satoshi simply forgot password I mean it happend to a lot of passwords for wallet but the one I am talking about is for this forum. The place where all started. Who is Satoshi doesn't matter Satoshi Nakamoto is just an idea of a person. Everyone think its person from Japan if you look at Satoshi profile it doesnt have location name is clearly an alias because he wanted to stay unknown. He just had ideas to share and was nice to people. HE ACTUALLY DIDN'T CODE A THING FOR BITCOIN. HE WAS A MAN WITH IDEA. He didn't command he would just comment on peoples ideas. The place was a mess. He was just a voice of reason in a crazy time. Such crazy time is now. When everything went downhill he just said this might work guys lets try this. Real colaboration is when you share credit. The white paper maybe wasn't his but was needed to be claimed for the sake of the greater good for a moment. Proof he didn't want to be hardcoded an bitcoin wallet adress to be paid. He was just doing this for ideal. Everyone thinks that Satoshi is the holder of the greatest wallet but that doesn't have to mean it's true. Investiaget movement of the forum. There is a reason that no one can have a satoshi in nick. if he lost password he couldnt possibly help others with the work.There is possibility that he didn't see himself as a very significant figure maybe he had personal stuff to do other work that needed to be done. Just because he was nice everyoneÂ  wanted to talk with him. Man had great kindness in a crazy word. Everyone had thought of him as a leader. EVERYONE BUT HIMSELF. Real world is not virtual like on the internet. If you are interested we can talk more.Satoshi",

Looking forward to engagement and constructive support â€¦ I think you are wasting your time and energy with shitcoins like DigiByte, Syscoin and others you mentioned, but it's your project and you can do whatever you want.Current market conditions are not great and people are more interested in current market conditions then past events, that can be distorted with different points of view.You need to understand that people are not willing to send donations and make sponsorship for any Bitcoin related books easy, except maybe for faces that are already known in public like Andreas Antonopoulos etc.Anyway, good luck with your project, and remember to mention Bitcointalk forum as important part of Bitcoin history",
