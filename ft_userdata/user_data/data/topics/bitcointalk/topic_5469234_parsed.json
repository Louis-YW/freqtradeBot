That would be when you will realized that there is nothing better than to have the knowledge and experience about how to trade on your own. But it is important for you not to use more than the amount of money that you can not afford to lose to trade.",

Whereas , you could really be able to learn for yourself and nothing beats out that you could really be making your own analysis came from your own understanding and knowledge. Key on here is that you should not make yourself that put in a hurry because most common newbie behaviors that they do really become that impatient and this is where mistakes do really came from.Quote from: Oshosondy on October 04, 2023, 09:17:30 PMTrading on your own is the best but you can try signals and see how they only care about their pockets.

But it is important for you not to use more than the amount of money that you can not afford to lose to trade.Totally agree with this on which making trades with your own and making your own trading analysis or formulate your own. You dont need someone to do something like this because we are all speculators on here and it is really that something that gives that regret feeling when you do follow someone but the analysis been made where ending up on a lossthen it do really give out that kind of feeling of regret on what you have done but somehow getting some information or on trying out look for some information with othertraders then it isnt really that bad to snip out some idea into them.",

You can't say that you are overtrading because if you are a responsible trader, you will know how to limit your trading and limit your losses as well. But let's say if you are just starting to trade, then it's always best to learn from your own trades. Do not be afraid to commit mistakes and losses because that will be your great motivation to improve your trades and become professional and profitable traders in the future. Furthermore, know that trading signals can never be reliable the whole time. They might work at some point but you will know your trades will work better if you rely on your own knowledge and skills as a trader.",

Trading on your own is still ideal though you need more time to learn it and it may not be easy but it can be worth it. Copy trading is too risky because you can’t decide on your own and you might lose the opportunity to buy or sell because you are not aware about the market trend, this is a risky decision go trade on your own.",

You can use it if you are not sure of the direction of trading or if you have doubts about the strength of momentum that could cause a support or resistance level to be broken.Trading on your own is the best because you learn from your previous experiences and have experience in trading so that you have a sense of the direction of trading even if there are not sufficient technical indicators to support what you are saying.",

The place where you are getting this data, is there is a guarantee that the stuff posted is legit and real? Cooked up signals are no sweat. Getting misled by those fake signals is also easy and many wannabe traders end up falling for that trap.If you ask me, copy trading is a scam, from my perspective and so is any signal group. I trust myself and I would always trade based on my knowledge and prediction. For that I might have to work a bit on fundamentals and technicals and a bit of luck but end of the day if I lose money, I would know whom to blame and that is better than trusting some weirdo on the net with their pipe dreams.",

If you want to trade yourself, this means you must have your own analytical skills, and must have knowledge about the world of trading and you must also have sufficient ability and knowledge in analyzing the market.If you want to use signals, it means you are using someone else's analysis to follow them and whatever the results, even if they don't meet your expectations, you have to accept them.And my advice, the best option is to do trading yourself and you have to learn everything well and continue to learn everything related to trading until you really understand it completely and can do it. And if your trading is successful and always produces profits then you will feel proud of yourself. If you haven't succeeded, don't give up and keep trying and improving your skills with small capital until you really master it and become an expert, and you are ready to use large capital.",

So copy or social trading is something I personally would like to avoid. Also I have indeed tried copy trading earlier and lost money every single time. I don't know but when I checked their trades, I could not match it with mine. I just don't understand how they maintain proportion based on the fund. So I took back the charge of my own trading and never looked back. Even though I don't trade anymore due to time constraints but I start again, I would stick with my own decisions.",

Like this you can control the losses and can regulate the profits. The types of trading you mentioned in the OP are good, but the one which is reliable, when you trade of your own. Copy trading is good sometimes, but if you by mistake get into losses, then you will make the person liable for the losses from whom you are copying the trades. It’s better to do your own research and trade with your analysis.",

A signal that is just a number without any chart analysis is just a fake signal, no one can be trusted. Then tarding yourself by analyzing independently will be better. It makes us learn how to analyze, and predict prices that will occur. Trading is not only about analysis but also about management.

Sometimes, excessive trading signals can throw you off your trading plan.I would go even further and say that proper management of one's trades is the deciding factor to be successful or not - at least in day trading. This includes: setting amounts correctly for each tradesetting and using stop losses/take profits correctlynot overstretching trades and above all: not to break your own rules (\"I am sure the trade will recover, ...\")If you master this basic rule, it is much more likely to leave the trading field as a winner. If you trade a lot of positions at the same time, the steps not only have to be automated, but it also becomes a lot of work to keep track of everything.",
