  "content": "The success of every nation is a reflection of their security architecture. When the security apparatus is solid and in tandem with the vision of the founders of the nation, every other segment of the country will align. But when the security system, that is supposed to be an institution, is compromised, every other thing will fall apart; this is the case with Nigeria. Nigeria's security institution is burdened with corruption; from the army to the police and virtually every arm of it. It is rather unfortunate that the top military hierarchy are just politicians in military uniforms. As it stand today, laws are made only for the poor because the rich are under the protection of the security forces who are ready to kill to protect themIt was so frustrating seeing that Nigerian police, the army and civil defense personnel played key role in rigging the 2023 General elections as they were practically involved in ballot box snatching, and even protected hoodlums that came to disrupt elections in many places. Furthermore, they watch INEC officials collude with thugs to change results of elections in many places. Now how do we make progress as a people when the security that is supposed to enforce laws and orders are the prime breakers of same laws? We knew how several accusations have been raised by prominent Nigerians like T.Y. Danjuma that the security forces collude with terrorist and bandits to kill Nigerians. These are not just casual statements or speculations... the man is am authority in that area. Until our security institution is reformed and made to stand for what they are supposed to, I don't see us making much progress as a people.",

Until our security institution is reformed and made to stand for what they are supposed to, I don't see us making much progress as a people. In as much as I know Nigeria dey very backward as regard security. The people wey we feel say na them they secure us na still d same people we they kill us. Imagine how people wey we dey call our security personnel dey involve themselves in criminal activities and other social vices seeing their self as people that can get away with it even if they catch them. Even our forces they conspire against themselves all in the interest say them wan they the top.Our security system have been compromise and jeopardize therefore it will really be very difficult to actualize a convenient security system.I just wish that our government can give security of live a property an adequate attention, maybe they can be doing security checks on each security personnel from time to time in other to know if they are really security conscious of our environment.And again our security system needs to be reshuffled. I believe if our government give immense attention to security it will bring a huge development in our society.Investors doesn't like where there is security brieges because they're very security conscious. So making security a priority will make investors to come to the country there paving way for our youths to take part in meaningful businesses.",

It is unfortunate say the Nigerian system no dey allow for institutions to work because the government pattern of leadership tie everything to the executive headed by the President. This is so unfortunate, if we dey think say the country go better like this na lie. From the beginning, at least for this democracy beginning from OBJ, him establish EFCC and anybody wey dey against him government dey for EFCC list.I believe say this Nigeria for dey on the part of proper democratic tenets if to say Yar'adua no die. Yar'adua admitted that the election wey bring him to power in 2007 dey fraudulent and in 2009 around march inaugurated electoral reform committee wey justice uwais be the head. So that committee been try say make the power of appointing INEC chairman be shifted to collective professionals/ institutions so that INEC go dey neutral and not answerable to the president. Goodluck Jonathan no continue with the reform, him allow people wey no want the country good to push him out of it.Therefore, the point be say make institutions dey appoint these key positions of security, INEC etc but if the president still do all those then we are far from it. The bible say the people rejoice when the righteous dey for throne and we know the system no dey allow such people enter there. Is a corrupt place with impunity, see court judgements dey fly wrongly up and down. How can we now get it better this way hmmm .",

One at a time pls. Lol.Let's keep grammer aside, not that ma happy or supportive of the dilapidation progress of the system but the truth wey most of us no wan hear and accept be say e get some of us wey if we dey there in government we go do the worse. You know why? Cause that's how the system was built to function which is different from what ought to be with what it is right now.The system for Naija na wen inno favor you you go dey shout shout say the government all round, but this same person if the government turn com favor am you go dey hear am the shout government good, everywhere soft both economic n security dey okay.  And these are the characteristics of the political culture of the typical Naija man that's why it will be very hard to bring solutions to all these questions you asked.  Who's with you today against the bad governance, if given a tip of the iceberg will easily turn against you in favour of the same government you both were criticizing and seeking for betterment from. How do you successfully fight such a system?",

Unfortunately, no be say e sweet to say, but na the koko reality be that. Ayyah!The security of a country is measured by plenty things which starts from the strength of the Economy, respect to rule of law, justice in the judicial system up to the security architecture of the states, the intelligence response team/force, the level of government's response to to violence and crimes, access to healthcare and basic education amongst others.Now make we put our country on a scale of 100%, I doubt if our country fit boast of 50% of any of those above-mentioned measuring parameters. That's where the issues lies.Make we see how porous out borders be, how weak our internal security be and how hardworking but incapacitated our troops be. It only takes God's intervention or \"till death do us part\" to right the wrong ss a giant of Africa.In the end, I go just advise each and everyone of us to stay safe out there and remain steadfast to our faith.

An example of this is any system of government in which people vote their elected representatives into parliament.Is there anything like family ruling in Nigeria? No.In Nigeria, is there anything like election but only family winning like what happened in Gabon? NoObasanjo the first executive president is a Yoruba (South West)The second, Yar'adua is Fulani (North West)The third, Jonathan is from, Bayelsa State (South South)Buhari is a Fulani (North West)Tinubu is a Yoruba (South West)If you meant that it is like military is ruling, like when Twitter was disabled in Nigeria. There was a lot that happened during Buhari time. But I still see it like democracy. That can happen in democratic nation. There were even democratic nations that took down their internet for some days or weeks during violence, but during EndSARS, there was nothing like that. Has Nigerian government taken down internet before? No.But I can understand, Nigeria is not as democratic like the Wests. But we are far better than some other nations.",

This is not possibly to happened soon anytime now why because there are several people who are there with different motive and version of life, let say them they knows what they benefits or have you also forgotten that they are taking serious allocation for security in our country?Yes the Federal Government has a serious allocation for security but those money are going strictly into personal pocket, and the killing including bokor haram ravaging and invading most of the Northern states and houses are all masterminded and calculated games. What is going on in Borno State, where they said is the war zone of boko haram is place filled with Milk and Honey, They are mining illegal mineral resources that is supposed to change our country 10 x worth more than Dubai but, what do we do as Nation they used Boko haram to set up that region to scare people from knowing what is happening. Thus few of the Governments leaders focusing their efforts in Crude (Oil & Gas) while what is meant to change our dear Nation is wasting in the hands of the foreigners. Who dear cough over this issues? Yes! No one's because they knew that they had set ups the boko haram to protects that area. Okay lets to talks about Kidnaping Nko? Those  who are kidnapping, where are they cashing out and which account are they sending those money why can't bank and security agencies track about those funds? Yes they all knew what they are doing. Do we have to go more further about Godwin Emefele? Yes, He is a criminal in another cool way and between how much was restored from him in Hard currency? After making the innocent Nigerian pass through hell it happens that the new Naira note weren't in circulation any more but are being partially used. In facts as matter of fact, anyone whom I tried giving that new Notes now finds it very funny as they still have this mindsets is counterfeit instead they preferred using the old Note, Off course to me I am well secured with the old Notes that we were using before the new Notes. How much did people made especially Godwin and co, who planned to trickily extort people with their old Naira note in name of expiring before the deadline, people were selling their had earn money for peanuts while those who couldn't spent it they ended up going to some Aboki's for exchange of food ( Let say when you buy's something of N500 you pays with 1k old notes even to an extent you will buy something of N300 they takes 700 just to make sure people spent their old Notes). 2 weeks interval it was said that old notes expiry dates has been extended to December what is happening now, are they still talking of the notes currently or what is the news on ground  now? Fuel drama, open swearing in seat his first speech was directly on removal of fuel subsidy ( why is this part so important to him?) Question to asked; Was there really fuel subsidy?So sir, lemme just stops here as I don't to give myself a high blood pressure (HBP) why because we all allowed incompetents and incredible, uneducated people to rule us so we must remain in this bondage untill we chooses to change and renew our minds by putting credible people, those who knows what they are doing than just those who thought Presidential seat is an entitlement to them since they have sponsored Ex presidents so is their turn to rule as well.",

I am referring to this:Quote from: Odohu on September 11, 2023, 04:41:58 PMIt was so frustrating seeing that Nigerian police, the army and civil defense personnel played key role in rigging the 2023 General elections as they were practically involved in ballot box snatching, and even protected hoodlums that came to disrupt elections in many places.Quote from: Odohu on September 13, 2023, 05:11:39 PMIf you think Nigeria is practicing democracy, then you are not really on ground. I am from Rivers State and here election is by force... the strongest wins. You can do your campaigns and mobilisation but so long as you are not part of the powers that be, you are not going anywhere. This is not peculiar to Rivers State. Is that your definition of democracy?Mention how Nigeria is not a democratic nation?Because they are voting? Or because they have three arms of government (the executive, legislative and the judiciary). Or because the governor of some states have been declared not to be winner of an election before and given to the right winner. CBN banned bitcoin, they said it is the Nigerian government that banned bitcoin. The government that were mute about it and allow Nigerians to trade cryptocurrencies on their own risks. Or because no matter the kind of protest in the country, the government still allow you to access the internet. Or is it because Nigerians like to move from one party to another. Give evidences. Do not worry, I am here with you.",

      "body": "Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 13, 2023, 10:14:25 AMWhat is democracy:QuoteDemocracy is often said to mean 'rule by the people'. An example of this is any system of government in which people vote their elected representatives into parliament.You think say na because those things wey dey happen for other African countries no dey happen for Nigeria na him make you think say we dey do democracy. Wetin dem teach me say na democracy for school no be wetin we dey see for the country. The government supposed be government of the people by the people and for the people. Abeg no vex na wetin dey happen for the country be dat? When last our vote really matters abi no be dis country wey we dey see person tell us say na him turn and still collect the power without we not been able to do anything. This one wey you list all those president from different regions of the country wetin dat one dey tell you, it simply means we're doing turn by turn so na dat one be democracy or our politicians dey share the country as it fits dem. Democracy no be turn by turn, e supposed be who the people vote in, e no matter if the person qualify or not but who the people love and they want make him rule them that's what democracy is about. If you go wash your skin from black to white no means say you go call yourself white (take Micheal Jackson as a case study). The back here be say we no dey actually practice democracy and the white be say the government dey say na democracy wey dey practice. How you go accept wetin no be true, abi you wan make we dey suffer like other African countries before we agree say no be democracy we dey practice, just because the government say we're doing something that isn't true no mean say we go accept am. In a Democratic government e no matter if na the same family dey rule but provided the people want dem and they're been voted back into power, na democracy be dat. Until our vote begin dey count we're deceiving ourselves thinking we're practicing democracy. On paper the country is practicing democracy but in reality the government are just deceiving the innocent citizens.",

This is the summary of the whole thing; thank you for lending your voice. Nigeria photocopied America's system of government which is federal system but have failed to follow it as it should be. In the US, each of the states are independent and manage their security and resources. But here in Nigeria, the states have no power or authority to do anything as the federal controls everything. Just ordinary road, states are not allowed to build without approval beccauae they are federal roads. Plenty things dey wrong with our system of government abeg.",

      "body": "Truly the success of every nation depends on the security architecture of that nation in particular. When the security forces are very much active and in compliance with the laws to discharge their duties accordingly, there is peace and progress because everything seems to work in tandem with the laws of the land but when there is compromise, the reverse is always the case.It is obvious that the system is corrupt and messed up to the extent that the security forces can not be trusted and this has resulted in people taking laws into their hands. This act always triggers unending crisis in the society. I have come to realise that one of the possibilities of these security lapses is the appointment of heads of security forces. When one is appointed as the head, every other subordinates would want to pay obeisances and dance to the tune of their head and their heads too would also want to play to the tune of their paymasters. This is the problem with the security architecture but if it happens that heads get to a position based on political settings through ranks without appointment and are independent on their own, I think most of the problems in the society would be curtailed. They will discharge their duties without fear or favour.",

Wetin dem teach me say na democracy for school no be wetin we dey see for the country. The government supposed be government of the people by the people and for the people. But you voted for these people. In my state, if you go outside to many places, you will likely know who the next governor will be. If it is going to be tough between two different parties, you will also likely know. You will all know these from what people are saying. Probably our states might differ. The first governor in my state was APC, the next was PDP while the PDP governor was unable to do second term. The third governor was PDP which was later removed after he lost the lawsuit that he did not win governor election. APC was the fourth governor while PDP was the fifth governor, then APC took over again and now APC took over again. It has always been competitive.In states like Lagos, APC has been the winner always, but if you find out what is happening winninz you will know how strong APC in the state. What is happening in one state may be different from what is happening in the other states, bit not that we are practicing autocracy in Nigeria. APC has influence in Lagos. Yet, the incumbent president was unable to win in the state he was once a governor. Is Peter Obi people wanted? Or can we also say that it was rigged?Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on September 13, 2023, 09:28:38 PMWhen last our vote really matters abi no be dis country wey we dey see person tell us say na him turn and still collect the power without we not been able to do anything.
