  "content": "QuoteFeng shui is an ancient Chinese art of arranging buildings, objects, and space in an environment to achieve harmony and balanceBut do you know that Fengshui is practiced and observed in gambling and in popular casino cities? even MGM and many hotels in casinos are following Fengshui, these are just some of the examplesQuotethe MGM Grand had to change its entrance, one that formerly forced customers to walk through the mouth of a lion (actually, under its chin, but close enough), deemed to be a very bad mojo by players from Asia.QuoteThe number Four is unlucky because it sounds like the Chinese word for “death.” This is why many hotels in Las Vegas skip floor numbers that start with the number four. The Rio Las Vegas, for example, is advertised as having 51 floors, but if you deduct the missing 40-49, it actually has just 41. The Encore is also missing floors 40-49.Fascinating Chinese Gambling SuperstitionsSo you see even if everything depends on luck and circumstances there are many people even non-Chinese are following Fengshui practices.How about you? Do you have Fengshui practice that you're observing when you are about to play or while playing",

There are times we get lucky but we can never get consistent with that, so for me, Fengshui or whatever it is that would make me lucky is not necessary anymore as luck will just come when you are not expecting it, just like a thief in the night.",

I confirm that anyway, when I was in Las Vegas 3 years ago I've seen this strange thing, and when I've asked about it to receptionist, he has given to me the same explanation that you're givin here !",

Just like they did on the 8th and 8pm.Conclusion: gambling and feng shui, I think this method applies specifically to Chinese people, even though they apply it in the world of gambling, the reason is because they already believe in fengshui, I'm not sure fengshui science can apply to followers of other schools besides fengshui, luck, fanatics, hockey and luck of a person based on their beliefs, if they see Chinese people get luck based on fengshui beliefs, then they try, I'm sure they will go home empty bag in gambling, like the hotel method in Las Vegas, It's weird nowadays how to bet, it's the same as lottery guessing believing in the devil, if they are not the basis of Feng shui.",

Do you have Fengshui practice that you're observing when you are about to play or while playingWell, this is my first time to learn of the word \"Fengshui\". It turns out that I have been practicing some form of it without even knowing. In my culture the number Four isn't associated with being unlucky. What is associated with being unlucky or \"death\" is the colour black. Casinos do not use the colour at all. A gambling superstition in my culture -  When a gambler hits his left foot against a rock. They associate it with losing. Another superstition is when a gambler's palm itches and he scratches it. It means he is going to win some money at the casino.",

However, I don't believe in such a thing though I respect the superstition of other cultures. Most gambling games are luck-based yet Fengshui can't control or even decide our fate. I guess this is another strategy for casinos that want to attract players who also have the same belief but as for me, Fengshui or any tools being used in gambling has nothing to do with our gambling results.",

For many that formerly know and believe in the Fengshui they may most certainly be affected by it based on mindset. While for others like myself who just heard about it, it now depends on us to either believe it or not...You believe, you begin to see it's effect, if you don't...i believe you won't.i have no Fenhshui practice, i gamble whenever i choose without considering superstition.",

You mentioned the example of number 4 in chinese culture, that is avoided. While here, we tend to avoid numbers 13 and 666, because they mean bad omens and reminds negative events in our society and imaginary. Even when I win a bet resulting in one of those numbers I don't feel good about it. It gives me the impression there is something wrong going on.",
