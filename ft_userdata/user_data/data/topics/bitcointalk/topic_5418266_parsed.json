  "content": "Recently I have found an information about problems with fiber cable which was damaged (probably intentionally) and causes some networking issues:https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256It made me think - is it possible that bitcoin nodes network would be split? I know that many connects to many etc, but what if \"2 bubbles\", similar size, enough to be fully functional, would be created? Imagine that for example South&North Americas lost connection to rest of network (no oceanic cables, no satelites etc etc). Is it possible to detect that you are in a separated bubble? I assume we would have 2 chains, which would make it impossible to merge.From the point of single node it would only mean that you lost some connections but you are able to quickly find replacements. At the end now, when you have your node and you are connected to 10 other nodes, you do not know if you are connected to Asia and Australia or to your neighbors on the next street - there is no criteria for nodes selection, is there?",

Outside of this, though, I'm certain that everyone would immediately notice the internet splitting in two, since you would not be able to communicate with many of your contacts and you would lose access to huge chunks of content.Quote from: PawGo on October 25, 2022, 10:22:36 AMI assume we would have 2 chains, which would make it impossible to merge.Provided neither chain rolled out any update or fork which would make it incompatible with the other chain, then when the connection was reestablished whichever chain had the most proof of work would win and the other chain would simply be abandoned. I would assume in such a doomsday event though that at least one side would deliberately take steps to prevent this from happening so as not to risk a massive reorg and loss of hundreds or even thousands of blocks worth of block rewards.Quote from: PawGo on October 25, 2022, 10:22:36 AMthere is no criteria for nodes selection, is there?In terms of geography then no, not as far as I am aware, and with nodes being run over Tor/VPN/VPS then IP addresses are not reliable indicators anyway.",

There are so many redundant paths to places and contiguous loops of fiber and BGP is really robust enough to figure out a way to get data from A to B. It *will* be painfully slow and for BTC there would probably be a bunch of 1 or 2 block reorgs as nodes get the new tip of the blockchain. But, since international banking and finance and shipping and just about everything else would have imploded it would probably not matter.Someone brought this up a couple of weeks ago too.

There would be other ways of transmitting data, such as satellites, which might be repurposed for such things although could also be slow (unless well planned and implemented).As noted above, block speeds would be very noticeable from the onset, if Asia has a lot more miners than America then the one with the least power behind it would become really slow and the longest chain would win out over the shortest chain when a reconnection happened. If the reconnection happens after 12 hours passes, I'm unsure how a double spend attack could actually be stopped (without the chain being considered entirely insecure and companies stopping dealings in it for a while - since you could hop on a flight or send your private key to a contact on the other side of the disconnect just after sending your transaction and selling your funds).Information for critical infrastructure could also be flown across if it needed to be and I don't think those flights would be too slow with military involvement (less than 2 hours).",

In such a case, their chain would become completely unusable unless they quickly implemented some new retargeting mechanism. Worth noting that in such a case it would be the chain with the most proof of work which would win in the case of a reconnection, which is not necessarily the longest chain. If the chain with 95% continued to mine at the current difficulty, but the chain with 5% forked to drop the difficulty drastically, then the 5% chain could end up being longer, but the 95% chain would win due to having accumulated more work in the production of its chain.",

By the time people realize it has been a split and they will try to do something more blocks will be added, more headaches, and so on and on.That aside, a complete cut at global levels is nearly impossible, a country-level one is definitely in the books but it will have way lower implications.",

There will not be enough time in 1-2 hours to do anything else.With such a short split, there might not be that much disruption. Assuming that no one has access to both chains (otherwise there wouldn't be a split at all), then every transaction on the minority chain will still be valid and could then be mined on the main chain after the reorg. There would be no transactions invalidated due to block rewards being invalidated, since we would be well below the 100 block lock up period.",

      "body": "Issue like this has been looked at in the past, solutions were developed, one of which is based on sidechain/multi-chain (PoW) Networks. Once a chain in the multi-chain Networks lost connection to the rest of the Networks or is detached from the rest of the world, it can continue to function in its local environment as a single blockchain with its own token and still have the ability to exchange existing bitcoins in the local blockchain with local peers. I think the price of the local bitcoin will vary from the rest of global market depending on how much the split networks value it. The split network can rejoin the rest of the global multi-chain networks (when connection is re-established) Â and continues to exchange its bitcoins with the networks, or it could exist as a separate network within the multi-chain networks with its own token (or colored coin). In such multi-chain networks, it's best to store your coin in the local blockchain you control and can easily run as node. If you detach your blockhain network from the rest of the multi chain networks, your chain/node can continue to function and exchange token/bitcoin with your local peers.If that happens to this current Bitcoin Network, Multiple Crypto networks would eventually be created. Â But I think there will be alternatives means for people to exchange and verify bitcoins with established international Bitcoin Networks. For example radio frequencies, via sms etc",
