I am going to be testing them when I get them. I have DHL tracking number  they are due on Sept 12th. I will post a few photos and start a support thread on the miner. My main mine is shut down for a rebuild. We finally got approval for the 260kwatt solar array that was install in August 2022. this means we generate 48 kwatts 24/7/365 via grid attachment. It is possible I may get more of these and run them as hosting deal with Marco or not, as I am not sure as to the practicality of it. Due to my Clifton NJ mine being a 4-way venture.Back on pointSo far this is looking good. My thanks to marcotheminer.Note:I had a typo and fixed it:please note a1 Hashrate LLC2022is my alt",
