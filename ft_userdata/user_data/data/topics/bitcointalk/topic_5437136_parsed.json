Even if you are gambling in different platform in different market still you need to be patience and be lucky to find a good arbitrage. On the other hand, bookies do not like their punters do arbitrage. They ban the customer if they find such betting pattern.  Quote from: Ivekzg on January 28, 2023, 06:10:03 PMI’am in arbitrage for long time and I can/know where to find arbs manually.Have accounts with few bookies, check odds, when you have good difference then place your bet. I used to have a calculator to calculate profit from arbitrage betting. It was useful.",

In Arbitrage betting timing is very important even a few seconds can make huge difference. The best practice is to do it with friends. Check the odds in several sites. Decide between you who will place bet in which leg of the same market. Do it at once. This is one of the method.Another method is doing it by yourself. You can do it in different platform or in the same platform too. Mostly in the Live match you will find this kind of opportunity. But it's risky. I used to do it in Test cricket match, you can easily find several opportunity for arbitrage betting. Five days long match, session by session games. You will easily find the fav is behind in one of two session. With a lot of passion you may make some money but to be honest the amount of time you spend in it not worth it even if you are placing huge amount of stake.",

What sportsbooks don't like is players placing value bets, that is to say bets with positive EV, or odds above the real odds to happen in other words. So if you are able to make surebets without using value bets too frequently at the same sportsbook, you should be fine IMO.",

Yes, it is true that arbitrage bets are very rare and of little interest to gamblers, maybe because these bets have a greater risk and are more difficult to win compared to other bets.Even though these bets aim to make a profit without having to worry about winning or losing in a match, the reality is that not all gamblers can successfully take advantage of making these bets.I myself have never once tried to bet on Arbitrage because I wasn't too sure that this bet could give me the win and profit that I expected.",

Going against a sites ToS isn't all that smart and usually ends up with a bs scam accusation because someone cannot wd due to violating terms.What do you mean cheat the casinos?I don't understand why arbitrage betting should be any problem at all, even though I know some say in their TOS they don't want it.If I place a bet on team A on site 1 and on team B on site 2, where is the problem? Both sites see action, the odds only reflect the action on the site/games provider. On site 1 more people bet on team A and on site 2 more on team B, thats why the odds are what they are.If anybody cheats then it's the casinos by offering way to low odds on sports. Some sites offering 1.8 : 1.8 or even less are the real problem of this industry.@ the people that talking about risks of arbitrage betting: it seems you don't understand what it means. With these bets you cannot lose.You bet on 1.6 odds on bookie A and the other side on 3.15 odds on bookie B, where can you lose?",

I am just curious if this kind of strategy is legal? or will the gambling site will know that you are doing arbitrage bets? I'm just curious if that was allowed, many people can make a living out of it but I think it is still depends on the betting amount usually it is only 0.01 multiplier right or 0.1?",

Thats theft and criminal behavior. Just read the TOS carefully of every site you intend to use for arbitrage betting and pay attention to what it says. 99% of people won't do that. They will spot it if you make it to easy for them. A $50 bet doesn't look like an arbitrage bet. A $52.17 is a completely different thing though. Quote from: Ivekzg on January 28, 2023, 09:46:04 PMDid you ever heard Pinny confiscate money from players ? No, cos they know what are they doing. Pinny as in Pinnacle Sports? I have heard of the brand but never played there nor do I know their reputation.Quote from: Ivekzg on January 28, 2023, 09:46:04 PMEvery bookie should by lead by their example.Period. What should be and what is happening are two different things. We shouldn't have war in the 21st century either, but you can see how that goes. Go to the scam accusations board and read some of the complaints there. There are, of course, many players who are scammers as well, but maybe you will get an idea about some of the things that are are happening.

The OP doesn't mention specific names of sportsbooks. Each one should be analyzed individually. Like I said, the size of the wager can be enough for them to see it's an arbitrage bet.Even if the TOS doesn't mention arbitrage betting itself, they can have a vague term like: We reserve the right to close your account and confiscate any money used in a way that is detriment to our businesses. The statement doesn't mention anything specific, but justifies their actions and gives them the right to protect their business (according to them). Then it's on the player to fight and prove his innocence.",
