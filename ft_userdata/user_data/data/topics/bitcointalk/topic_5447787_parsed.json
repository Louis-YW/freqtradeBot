Check out the project's social media.Following these three steps, I can determine whether it is worthwhile to invest in something. How about you, would you add something to my list?Wouldn't say this is the \"perfect\" way to look for information and judge if a project is going to do well or not. Your approach has lots of flaws. Following your gut is not really a reliable method when it comes to investing. You want to base your decisions on solid research, not just some random gut feelings that changes overtime. Websites, roadmap and whitepapers might look great, but sometimes they're just a front for something sketchy. And always remember, those are just some \"words\" that anyone can write. Never rely on those to determine the future of the project. Sure, read them, but don't forget to dig deeper. Some projects might overpromise  and underdeliver (things that might sound too good, but when it comes to reality, almost impossible to deliver). And lets not talk about the social media. You never know if those followers are real or just bots. So it's not the best way to judge a project's popularity. Instead, I'd suggest checking out this forum for announcement threads where people discuss these projects. Look for genuine opinions, keep an eye on trusted news sources for updates and red flags. Also, evaluate the team behind the project. If they aren't transparent about everything, abandon as soon as you can.",

And this is about the \"DYOR\" you mentioned.     We often read that here on the forum platform, but the question is, do the majority of the community here know how to do it? Many people read and understand this but in reality do not know how to do it and what they will base it on to choose the right crypto investment.",

As a result investors who invest in those projects do not get their invested money back.

That means that it's not just solely basing on what you feel towards a project but you're backing it up with research and more readings.It's a good way to assess a project that you're doing all of those stuff unlike many today, they invest in because they're emotional and doesn't back up with any solid reference to defend why they've invested into a project. Much even worse if they just follow the herd of that token's investors.",
