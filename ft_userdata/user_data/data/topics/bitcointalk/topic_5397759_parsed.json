  "content": "Unemployment can have a negative impact on the entire economy. When fewer people are employed, output and GDP fall. Unemployed workers deplete state and federal government resources while tax revenues are lowered at the same time. Unemployment that persists can have major socioeconomic consequences. During the Great Recession, a research revealed how prolonged unemployment might harm workers' long-term earning potential, affecting the economy for years to come.The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the unemployment rate by year for historical statistics on US unemployment trends. It dates back to 1949 and shows the annual percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. It also reflects the success or failure of fiscal and monetary policies through time, as they have an impact on unemployment rates. unemployment is cause by a number of issues raging from Low level of education, Mental issues, Physical health problems, Gender discrimination, Mobbing, Homelessness, Burnout, Stroke of fate, Financial crisis, Structurally weak regions, Lack of motivation. which begs the question, what is the solution to unemployment?The solution to unemployment some would say is to create more jobs. The number of jobs that must be produced is determined by the unemployment rate and the number of persons seeking employment. When unemployment rises above 6% to 7% and stays there, the economy is unable to generate enough new jobs. one way new jobs could be generated is the creation of a federal job-training program that subsidizes private-sector firms who hire unemployed, formerly low-wage individuals might help employers struggling during crisis, as well as workers earn money and create a long-term job. This policy should also provide a full federal subsidy for the first three months of employment costs and a half subsidy for the next three months, with the employer guaranteeing to keep the worker on the job for at least another three months with no  subsidy.  In Austria, two pension reforms raised the early retirement age (ERA) for males from 60 to 62 and for women from 55 to 58.25. Raising the ERA increased employment by 9.75 percentage points for impacted males and 11 percentage points for affected women, according to our findings. The revisions had a significant impact on the unemployment insurance program, but had little impact on disability claims. Men's unemployment climbed by 12.5 percentage points, while women's unemployment increased by 11.8 percentage points. The employment response was strongest among high-wage and healthy workers, whereas low-wage and unhealthy workers continued to retire early through disability benefits or used unemployment benefits to bridge the gap to the ERA.Taking into consideration spillover effects and higher tax revenues, we show that a one-year increase in the ERA resulted in a reduction of net government expenditures of 107 million euros for men and 122 million euros for women for a typical birth-year cohort.",

Unemployment is not about the retirement age.

Having job-training programs that can inspire remote jobs, entrepreneurship and partnership can go a long way. it is obvious the government can't employ everyone but programs that can help start-ups can be organized",

So this often results in macroeconomic instability. Some people decide to retire early from work and open their own businesses, others are still forced to work because of urgent needs driven by rising prices of basic commodities. All financial needs must be considered by the state, but the fact is that at this time the pandemic has wiped out the economy in almost every corner of the country. As a result, the swelling social and economic inequality cannot be overcome.",

As much as possible, creating new jobs will give a very good heads up to the government. It may not be lucrative jobs, but it will lessen the unemployment among its people. With less unemployment, means, people can support themselves and it will also reflect on the spending power of its citizens. Maybe less crime also as people are busy attending their jobs. The government can create new jobs by creating projects for new infrastructures such as buildings, roads and others. The more projects they have, the better for its own people. And with less time for vices, will translate to less crime. So at the end, it will be a win-win situation for the government as well as its people.",

Reducing the retirement age can’t help at all since retired people are no longer part of the unemployment rate computation.

      "body": "There are a lot of reasons behind unemployment and it can't be solved so easily by just choosing A or B.What was working in past, doesn't work in the modern world anymore. In the past women were used to stay at home and take care of family members, including the children but now they have the possibility to build career and work with men, this significantly increased the competitiveness and made the market more saturated.The population is increasing and a lot of business integrates the automation system in order to function with minimal or no human intervention that helps them to save a lot of money and increase the efficiency and speed of the operations.What is the most demanding now? The software development and works associated with informational technologies. Not everyone has the mental capacity to become a software engineer or data scientist, other sectors just pay too low to afford a normal quality of life. People who work in McDonalds, KFC, in supermarkets, Restaurants, etc have to do a lot but are paid very low, this makes them depressed and young people lose motivation. Some people learn economics, business administration, laws, etc but after 4 years of graduation and masters degree they analyze that the market is so competitive and there are so many, so many people out there in their field that it's almost impossible to get employed if you aren't the best or don't have great connections. These young people analyze this fact in late and lose hope.What will be the most demanding in the future? Trades skills. At the moment there is not much salary in trades but the skilled labor shortage is expected that will in turn increase the salaries. But the young generation was taught that it's a dirty job and they should enter the university and graduate, etc.The development and adoption of social media, especially Instagram makes it clear that hot girls don't want to be with the boys who do dirt work.Some people are lazy and play games, their parents earn enough to feed themselves and the family members and don't push their sons and daughters to work.Summarise everything and you'll understand the mistakes of humanity.",

Although I don't think Bitcoin is the complete answer to these problems. Sure, with a deflationary currency, people aren't as stressed about inflation: I hear it all the time telling people in the news that inflation is good for the economy... why? Because they can print money to further increase their incompetence? If governments were forced to work with a limited budget, they would pay more attention to the environment they operate, they would have to pay attention to how they do their job instead of being cumbersome in finding tax revenue. It also doesn't help that all the printing devalues everyone else's savings and forces people to invest in increasing the value of assets like homes. and stocks... I don't know if it's a good idea to force people to gamble with their savings.",
