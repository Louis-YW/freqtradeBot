  "content": "Taxation is a topic that often comes up when it comes to someone winning anything in gambling. The so called \"nationally licensed\" providers will usually automatically get a cut from anyone's winnings whenever they win anything. And let's be realistic, we all know the drill with gambling. Most gamblers are not in the green and those that persist do it for the thrill of it, not to earn from it. So when you win, it's usually from your own bank. But whenever someone is lucky enough to catch a break, governments will slip in and take their share. Regardless if you've lost more than you've earned in total for instance. The irony on this matter is also that gambling wins are used to substitute how many taxes these state \"licensed\" casinos have to pay. So the whole subject of gambling taxation is unfairly structured towards the player. Moreover, in many countries, filling out the forms to get taxed can be a nightmare. For winning 100$ for example, you will have to pay a big chunk of it to an accountant to find how it should be taxed. Bureaucracy is a whole other debacle in and of itself. I'd imagine that many people actually chose to gamble with crypto to avoid these restrictions and bureaucratic procedures. It really makes no sense to go through all these troubles to tax a small winning amount. Still if someone happened to win a large amount on a small bet by chance, I'd imagine some people would want to tax it so they can spend it in the real economy as fast as possible.",

It is one of the most important feature on what crypto gambling had is that whenever you do win big then there's no waythat they could be able to ask out taxation. Why? you could opt out on gradually be able to withdraw those funds on staggered manner and it could really be doneanonymously or something that wont really be giving out any suspicions.",

The situation may not be same with countries like the United States who have high regulations for casinos and at that,  there be working systems that deduct the tax percentage from every winning before their laid out at whatever point.",

The state automatically deducts that amount in the form of payable taxes and considers it a taxable grant. Of course, these procedures go through a bureaucratic process that will take a long time, and it is not possible to predict how long it will last.Crypto represents an ideal solution for those who are struggling in a country like mine. But taking into account that my country does not grant official business licenses to any platform that is not under its direct authority. In other countries, gamblers cannot escape paying taxes, even if their winnings are in crypto.",

At what point do your government deduct the money? Do they have the authorisation to debit accounts on the basis of taxation? In my country, we complain of tax that is 10% in my country... seems we are even enjoying here.  Besides, so many things are not taxable here and the rate of tax evasion is high.",

No need to go too far into the real gambling side, let's just take an example like Coinbase users, do they get a kind of rakeback from the American government because of their trading losses?",

I guess it helps that it isn't that strict here but is there a country that's that strict when it comes to gambling taxes? Wouldn't it necessarily become crypto taxes instead since we use crypto? It's like everything spent/earned from crypto is subjected to whatever crypto tax law, if your country has one, instead of differentiating it.",

But not all gamblers pay taxes, gamblers are more comfortable gambling through crypto to avoid paying taxes. Each country's government sets taxes in their own local currency, so gamblers use crypto instead of local currency, thereby avoiding the need to pay additional taxes.
