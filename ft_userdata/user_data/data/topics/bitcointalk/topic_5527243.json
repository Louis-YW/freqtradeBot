Therefore, it's impossible to go from private key to seed phrase.Nevertheless, a seed phrase normally produces an extended private key and not a single private key. Thus, the use case of the seed phrases, for the time being, is to generate a tree of private-public key pairs.",

You can always use Electrum to recover your coins if you use a seed phrase generated on Electrum. Electrum wallet is not using BIP39 seed phrase. But you can also import Electrum seed phrase on Bluewallet but no other wallet that I know of. Also you can import Electrum file (not seed phrase) on Sparrow wallet.You can import BIP39 seed phrase on Electrum.Most bitcoin wallets like Sparrow and many others are BIP39 wallets. You can import their seed phrase on Electrum or any other BIP39 wallets and it will work.",

Those wallets generate seed phrase straight from the wallet and not from the private key. You can't generate seed phrase from private key. They are of two different securities for a wallet.A seed phrase in other word is mnemonic seed. It is a 12 words generated by the wallet to to secure/restored the coins back to the wallet. Okay look at the different between Seed phrase a.d Private Key. Seed phrase is use to restore the wallet Â while Private Key is use to access and manage the wallet and it funds. So with this simple explanation it is clear that Private Key cannot generate seed phrase. A seed phrase is used to generate private key and a private key is used to generate wallet address. As I have said, seed phrase produce is used to restore your wallet in another device or probably you format/reset your device and deleted or erased everything so after downloaded the wall app or the software, you have to use the seed phrase to restore the wallet.",

I used bitaddress.org to generate key pair for cold wallet, so I got just private key and QR code. Any advice on how to generate seed out of it?Bitaddress isn't safe because there are lots of people who use bitaddress to generate key pairs and reported here that their funds are stolen. So avoid generating a key pair from Bitaddress. It is way safer if you use Electrum to generate the seed phrase, or if you want to get a key pair from that wallet you generated in Electrum wallet, do it in offline mode. About using steal washers to have a physical backup wallet, I think you can also do that with a private key, but the only problem is I think you will need much longer bolts and more washers to be able to do that. Or I think split them into 4 or 5 characters and put them into washers with the mark that this is the first, 2nd, and so on. To make sure to get a correct sequence, just like what mcdouglasx pointed to.",

[1] [2]With HD wallets, from a mnemonic seed, you can generate a tree of keys and addresses from a single wallet mnemonic seed. One public address is created by a specific private key to a specific public key, and a public address. Two steps are one-way and you can not brute force any of two steps to get a previous one. You can not start with a public address and find it public key, or start with a public key and find its private key.[1] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/hd-wallets/[2] https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch05_wallets.adoc#hierarchical-deterministic-hd-key-generation-bip32",

Individual keys or child keys that are derived from a master key are unique themselves and can not be \"duplicated\". Well, I think it's just the context from which we both see this that is different. Over here in my country, I don't know about other places or other parts of the world but In my area here, from what I've seen and learnt, a child key, that is; keys to each of the doors in a house can be duplicated, there are craftmen who specialize in this job, this helps to have more extras just incase one gets lost or misplaced. But the master key of the house, that is; the key that unlocks every single door in the house can not be duplicated, I guess this is a security measure put in place to encourage their holders to protect it at all cost, since there is just one of it and there will never be another. I used this metaphor to explain not because it really tallies, but it gives a simply and easy to understand idea and good representation of the difference between a seed phrase and private key, and why it's impossible to derive a seed phrase from a private key, but possible the other way round.",
