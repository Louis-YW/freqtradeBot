  "content": "I have specter connects to my core node. Its 2/3 multisig. However, the balance is spendable on core. I want it to be watch only on core. I've tried to add disableprivatekey=1 in config, doesn't work. Is there anyway to do this? The wallet was created from a specter desktop export in sparrow.Â  Sparrow does this by default when linked to node, balance in core is watch only. Any help appreciated",

Yes, it can create partially signed raw transaction (without any signature) but cannot sign since it only contains master public key.So it can't spend your bitcoin.",
