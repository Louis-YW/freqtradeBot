With B2B its all fine but P2P - big problem aspecially lately. 100 trades could be fine but 1 can mess all of them. Need to eliminate that for P2P. my thoughts so far is: - make sure the funds are coming from exchange with KYC - move over to Monero and Zcash and conversation to btc. but If im not wrong ZEC has some issues with traceability.  - other option is to receive small amount of BTC directly on  verified exchange wallet with 0 balance. if it not gets suspended - coins are clean and can be received with no worries. In this case question is - how soon your wallet gets suspended if you receive flagged coins and does it depend on amount (50 cents or over 100$). Please add your thoughts.Decentralization slowly moving towards centralization . But that's another topic.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Use mixers if you are worried about it then! Though in my opinion this is a non-issue, a currency, that bitcoin is changes hands very frequently, so if funds that have been marked as bad or stolen gets to you, i don't feel you can be in any trouble since your address wasn't the first one to receive the stolen funds. My local currency for example is stolen from people on the streets, in their houses every goddamn day, that same money circulates, but as long as i am not the thief who stole the money, i don't worry about the origin of the paper money in my purse, even if there is a high chance it was stolen at some point.",

Also I would use mixers - but problem is that with all this AML ,exchanges can block your wallet just because it came from mixer and at some point coins been marked. Thats why im looking for who went over this problems and have something to share with all of us.PS. don't want to try it myself and end up in bad position.",

Don't compare cash with Bitcoin. Restaurants, barber shops, grocery stores, hotels, markets, and almost all business establishments don't have mechanisms in tracking whether your money is dirty or not. That's different with a lot of duly licensed or registered crypto companies. Centralized and regulated crypto platforms such as exchanges, payment processors, lending, crypto banks, and so on are normally AML-compliant, which means they have AML bots and tracking software running 24/7 to guard against dirty coins. The moment your coins are marked dirty, you'll be in trouble. Your coin might be rejected. You might not be allowed to do trading or conversion. You might get banned. Your account could be locked or your funds frozen or even confiscated. Your wallet could be blacklisted. You could be fined. You could even be prosecuted.",

There ain't no difference between so-called \"dirty\" coins and normal coins.It can be argued, that every single coin is going to be tainted by the year 2147 - when the last block reward is mined. Think about that for a second.Every coin you touch will either have traces of mixers, coinjoins, casinos or ponzi schemes (because scammers dump their coins on exchanges).So, it is suicide to even worry about the issue of tainting in the first place. In chess we call this \"zugzwang\" - It's your turn to move, and all your moves are bad.But since you are not obliged to move your coins, then by all means don't, unless you're trying to pay someone/thing.",

And I am fully subscribed to Bitcoin's fungibility. I was just responding to Z-tight's post. That reply of mine wasn't representative of my stand on this specific issue. I don't believe that one Bitcoin is purer than another. There's no single Bitcoin in the 21,000,000 total supply that is more Bitcoin or less Bitcoin than the rest. While coins directly involved in crimes should be tracked, intercepted, confiscated, or returned to their rightful owners, it doesn't mean that those coins are dirty and aren't acceptable for circulation.",

If you've really heard of it then avoid accepting payments from those wallets or you'd better not make transactions with them [but it's hard to track them down]. But since we can't tell which coin is called dirty coin, then I can say that it is clean. Every coin you buy on a centralized exchange seems safe from dirty trade lines, exchanges and governments can't catch you or freeze your assets just because of that, but maybe the exchange will freeze your assets if it's actually a deposit from a wallet marked as a hacker's wallet.You have the option of clearing history transactions from your purchased coins by using a mixer, in this case you can increase your privacy in my opinion.
