  "content": "The threat that Putin is exhibiting might have a flaw. Does the US or another country have armament that can track and shoot down Russian missiles? If this is the case, a Russian nuclear war might be an impossible thing. But, a cruise missile is a very small target to hit... especially one with nuclear-powered speed.Putin claims successful test of nuclear-powered ‘global-range’ cruise missile for 1st timehttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-10-06-putin-nuclear-powered-global-range-cruise-missile.htmlEach year, Russian President Vladimir Putin uses the occasion of the Valdai Discussion Club hosted in Sochi to present on a wide range of foreign policy issues in an off the cuff manner, which most often comes out in Q&A format. He did the same Thursday at this year's Valdai event, and one of the statements which is grabbing the attention of Western officials was related to testing nuclear weapons, at a sensitive moment where the last nuclear weapons treaty with Washington is set to fail.(Article by Tyler Durden republished from ZeroHedge.com)\"I think no person of sound mind and clear memory would think of using nuclear weapons against Russia,\" Putin began in that segment of a speech before Russian foreign policy officials. That's when he made a statement being widely perceived as signaling openness to resumption of nuclear testing:    \"I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons, to return to testing,\" he added. \"I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.\"He also raised eyebrows in immediately touting completed work on the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, with the former being identified as a nuclear-powered cruise missile.\"We conducted the last successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered global-range cruise missile,\" he said. This weapon hasn't been publicly mentioned by Putin since 2018, and suddenly he's revealed it's been successfully tested.Code-named Skyfall by NATO, the consensus among Western analysts has long been that the technology is likely too hard to achieve given unreliability and volatility of such a nuclear propulsion engine. On the deep significance of the 'threat' to possibly put the Burevestnik on combat readiness, Mario Nawfal comments: ...Putin: “We have never spoken negatively about Ukraine’s accession to the EU, but we are categorically against its accession to NATO” pic.twitter.com/oBbGg4Nhek...",

      "body": "^^^ The interesting thing about this is that small, safe fusion reactors can be made to power cars and houses 'forever', so to speak. It's part of the reason why fusion reactors are taking so long to be developed. With small fusion reactors powering everything, there would be a whole lot of freedom for the people, and dependence on oil would be almost eliminated, because fusion energy could develop economically feasible bio-based products to take the place of oil produced plastics, etc.Guess which companies wouldn't like to see oil become a useless commodity in the world.",

      "body": "You mean, like the hypersonic cruise missile that was supposed to be unstoppable but Ukraine successfully stopped, after which Putin enraged ordered imprisonment of everyone involved? This hyper corrupt country couldn't even land a probe on the moon like the soviets did, it would be a miracle if the things don't detonate at the launch site, most are decades old technology they no longer maintain or are able to.Sub-orbital launches are far more efficient and faster if the objective is delivering payload from one continent to another, than flying all the way and hoping to remain undetected.And don't get me started on the \"military exercise\" that was supposed to last only \"a few of days\"...Hispo got things backwards...Fusion has long been demonstrated for mass destruction, doing it in a way that doesn't obliterate everything around it has been the tricky part. Fusion energy does not open the door for mass killing, because that was already demonstrated (Tzar bomba, etc). The event you mention is the ignition which theoretically generated more energy than that used to start it, except it actually didn't but demonstrated it could.What has this to do with Putin's V1 wonder weapon? Nothing really. Fusion energy is only for pacific purposes, non pacific purposes were achieved way back in the 50ies...",
