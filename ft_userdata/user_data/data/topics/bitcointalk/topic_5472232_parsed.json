If the demand is high and the supply is low, the value will increase. And if the supply is high and the demand is low, then the value will decrease. You can apply the same thing with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. There are other things like potential. If one can predict what the future is going to be then they will demand more. And based on supply the value will be created. It's a very simple thing. Bitcoin has created a reputation so I can't give good example with it. For that reason I am choosing alt coins. For example, if there is a new coin and people see that it has potential to grow by its use case and people behind it, then people will buy it. Thus creating a demand. Based on that those who created the coin could make an offer. And if the both parties are on the same page then they will make an exchange. And a value will be created. That's how it works.",

This has to be combined with utility that the product has. There cannot be a linear relationship between the value of a product and the cost to acquire the product. Gold is difficult to mine and has real world value, both factors has to be present. A product can have real world value but can be easily acquired anywhere in the world with no effort, and it can have no utility, but be very rare; in both situations the value of the product will be low.Bitcoin has utility which creates the demand, it also has a limited supply which means the demand is constantly growing against it.",

For example, Bitcoin is a universal coin that a lot of institutions have adopted; many companies, some schools, and a lot of individuals worldwide are using Bitcoin. The high usability of Bitcoin and its limited supply are what give the coin great value. Normally, if there is a surplus supply and low demand, the value of such items will not really be of good value. For example, there are hundreds of alt coins that are not so valued, and the price of those coins is very low from year to year. The reason why this is so is because there is not much use for those coins, and they also have a huge supply compared to what they're used for.",

However, one great way to evaluate it is to see how popular it is with people when times get tough. And I noticed that often people prefer to reduce the share of Bitcoin in their portfolio if everything is bad. But on the contrary, they buy more gold. The conclusion from this is that people do not trust Bitcoin as a safe haven currency.",

Of course, when more and more people develop an interest in Bitcoin to have it, the demand increases, and that is good news for us because the price value of Bitcoin will gradually increase in the market.And what is also important here is that we will also look at its utility, which will be its usage, like in Bitcoin, where it can be used as a payment for a business that also recognizes Bitcoin, and in addition, it can also be used to send money to different parts of the world as well as other cryptocurrencies, if not all.That's why we should know how to value Bitcoin when we do it in the era we live in today.",

      "body": "Actually, I am of the view and opinion that a token or coin utility also contributes to the value and existence of the coin. When a coin or token is of good use in the market, the demand is always on the high side which causes an increase in the price value of that coin in the market thereby pushing up the use value of that coin. Value too has to do with acceptability. When  a crypto is acceptable in the market it means that there is every possibility that the crypto  would be in much demand in the market and that causes a sudden rise in price of that coin which shows the value of that coin.  For instance, Bitcoin is seen as a store of value so therefore people use it to measure their asset worth and in that case they store their wealth and asset in bitcoin which is quantifiable and  shows the asset equivalent in the number of bitcoin they have.",

While its fixed supply contributes to limited availability, when there's a surge in demand and people are holding onto their Bitcoin (often referred to as 'HODLing'), it can result in significant price volatility. These two factors, supply and demand, play a crucial role in determining Bitcoin's value.I hope I was able to answer it right because honestly this question is quite tricky since crypto is different from the usual assets, so I guess we should focus on factors like utility and demand to determine it's real value.",
