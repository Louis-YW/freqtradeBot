  "content": "I’m sorry to create another post, but this is a significant upgrade. BTCapsule is an open source Bitcoin time capsule for your private keys. I have been listening to the community, and I really think I have addressed all issues with the previous version. BTCapsule now uses Bitcoin Core’s 'mediantime' to log the year from Bitcoin’s timestamp and decrypt your private keys. This actually solved two problems. Not only does BTCapsule use the only fully decentralized clock straight from the Bitcoin blockchain, but it also means BTCapsule never has to use the internet. This is not an API call to a centralized block explorer website. You can install Bitcoin Core, download the blockchain, and check the date offline. I have also made BTCapsule free to download. If you find value in BTCapsule, please consider donating some sats on my website. I still have a lot to do; like port BTCapsule to Linux, work on the UI, and clean up the code. I also want to throw it out there that I would love to work in the Bitcoin industry if anyone is hiring. My style is dirtier than fiat money, but I will hack away at a problem until it’s solved.You can view the source code here:https://github.com/BTCapsule/BTCapsuleAnd to download BTCapsule that’s been converted to C and compiled to an .exe, please visit my website:https://btcapsule.comUpdate 10/19/22Linux version has been temporarily removed",

If none of these work of if any of them are missing, then it can be concluded that the service is a fake.",

Speaking of encryption, this app should make a self-signed certificate to connect to a backend service of its own.

This is your third topic about exact same thing and it was not needed at all.I appreciate you are working on this project, going open source and giving it for free, but there is still a problem I initially wrote..someone can fake the data and abuse your program, and he doesn't even have to be super-duper hacker at all to do this.I am not saying your idea is bad, but you need to rewrite everything from scratch and use some different method of calculating time, maybe by using multiple sources of information.This is not easy problem to solve, but I think you are going in right direction, so maybe try asking suggestion and opinion from known bitcoin security experts.",

I can confirm that this hack no longer works.BTCapsule is pulling the mediantime from Bitcoin Core. I’m sure you know this already, but this is the accepted timestamp compared to the previous 11 blocks. It’s written in Unix time and BTCapsule converts it to ISO format.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_timestampIn order to hack the time, you would have to do what NotATether mentioned, as well as fake some blocks to get the mediantime. I would assume you need a lot more than 11 fake blocks for RPC to check, but this is well outside of my hacking knowledge.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 17, 2022, 09:05:18 AMBased on discussion on other thread[1], IMO you take wrong approach. When your target isn't technical or power user, you shouldn't ask them to install and configure Bitcoin Core manually. If you want to utilize median time on Bitcoin network, there are another approach such as connecting to several Bitcoin node, ask for recent block header and verify received block headers. [1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417145.msg61133095#msg61133095I’m not really sure how to connect to other nodes and receive information without Bitcoin Core. I think the steps to use BTCapsule are simple enough. They might have to wait a few days for Bitcoin Core to download to see the private keys, but it would be worth it.The directions are:1. Install Bitcoin Core2. Choose Settings>Options>Open Configuration File3. Add rpcuser=user rpcpassword=pass to configuration file and save4. Wait for blockchain to download and view the keysWith the option to prune the blockchain, this shouldn’t be an inconvenience at all.Quote from: FatFork on October 17, 2022, 10:29:24 AMOP, I think you're overlooking some important facts about basic network security.

The only thing being sent is the mediantime of the blocks from Bitcoin Core, and these are installed locally.Also, this will be my last thread about BTCapsule. I will post all updates here. Changing the method of receiving the year was huge, and it’s my final attempt. Anything else will just be small upgrades.Quote from: DaveF on October 17, 2022, 12:11:28 PMIt's going in a good direction and it's a work in progress so he can keep updating it as we give more suggestions.

($6 wrench with inflation)-DaveThanks for the encouragement. I’m working on porting BTCapsule to Linux so that the private keys can be entered and decrypted with a temporary Linux OS that can be deleted afterwards.I looked into the $5 wrench, and it seems the only known protection is multi-sig. BTCapsule is not a wallet, and anything can be typed into the private keys sections. If someone has three children, they could copy BTCapsule to three separate flash drives, type a different private key into each, and then require all the children to decrypt the keys.",

There’s not really a security difference, but since Linux is free, it’s much easier to dual-boot and destroy the OS. Sorry, I’m trying not to repeat myself because I keep getting messages from the mods and they have to edit my posts.I’m working on a macOS version. It hopefully won’t take too long.

LoyceV is right.Checking whether all RPC methods exist is a pretty weak method to detect a modified bitcoind; besides the fact that it's not too hard to do what I did here or actually, ETFBitcoin's RPC-capable implementation here for all RPC calls, you may not even need that. You could whip up a script that tunnels all RPC calls to the real bitcoind running locally, without modifications, except for the blockchaininfo call. That command's result will be altered before being forwarded to your software, to display a different timestamp.No need to mess with any blockchain files; just intercept the result and alter it as needed.Structure:Code:┌────────────────────┐│Bitcoin Core on 8338││ (modified port)    │└────────────────────┘   ▲   │   ▼┌─────────────────────┐│Custom script on 8332│└─────────────────────┘   ▲   │   ▼┌─────────┐│BTCapsule│└─────────┘Is there anything stopping me from modifying Bitcoin Core's RPC port and writing the small script in the middle?",
