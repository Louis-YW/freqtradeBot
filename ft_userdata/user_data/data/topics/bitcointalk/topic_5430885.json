Coyster is right. If anyone is reported, we cannot agitate for a permanent ban; that is up to the admin to decide. We are human, and no matter how long you have been here, sometimes unexpected mistakes lead to a permanent or temporary ban. In such cases, we also support the user against being permanently banned, but in some cases where the user consistently breaks rules, he will be banned and no one will say anything.For the past year, the case of plagrism in the Nigerian community has decreased significantly due to constant awareness",
