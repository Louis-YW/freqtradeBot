Dear op, i never bought gold online, and never hope to get it via any courier or shipment but my advice for you is to go physically in the shop and buy gold physically.Because, if you would try to buy online you could easily be scammed but if you buy it physically then you can check the purity of it, if you are buying gold for the very first time then, you should go with someone expert or atleast with those who bought few times. If you found not experienced companion then you should check for various tips like \"things to keep in mind while buying gold\" or \"tips to buy gold\" etc. etc. Once you started to search out you will find more interesting facts about it, and again i suggest you to buy gold from physical store, not from online store.",

There just seems to be alot of places to choose from and not all can be trusted. Your best option is to find a good gold dealer in your own local town or city and then visit them personally. If you aren't good at judging the quality of gold then take someone with you who is expert in that regard. You should also keep in mind that most gold dealers in your city may sell it in the form of jewelry, and in order to get it in brick form, you must have to convince the dealer that you are buying it for a good purpose.It's always better to ask your relatives or friends who have bought gold before from dealers of the city or country where you live as they will be very helpful for you in that regard. Those who have already bought gold are better aware of dealers and they might suggest you a good and trusted dealer. You can also request them to visit with you if you're not good at judging the purity of Gold as those people know the quality better than the ones who are new in the field.",

There just seems to be alot of places to choose from and not all can be trusted. No worries. There are many gold investors in here because hold is also a system collapse hedge type of deal. We are not a \"bitcoin the only god, bitcoin the only savior\" kind of sect Where are you from? often local mints issue their gold coins. You can use local retailers and buy in person. I don't think shipping halfway around the world is needed here. What is important to me when buying physical gold is to avoid KYC and leaving any trace of yourself (so preferably cash payment). So that then the local government wouldn't pursue me like in the USA in 1933, when they come up with a gold ban \"Executive Order No. 6102\"",

I am curious where you are from. If you are from the Middle East, it's easy for you to buy Good quality gold at a cheap price. But if you are from somewhere else, Check if any of your friends live in the Middle East or visit the Middle East. If you find someone trusted lives in UAE or Saudi Arabia, You can ask them to purchase Gold for you. I suggest not buying physical gold from online stores to reduce the possibility of scams. BTW, I am not sure if you can find good quality gold at a cheaper price than in the Middle East. But that's where I get most of my Gold! I have a couple of friends who live In Saudi Arabia and the UAE. If you do not have any friends in those countries, You may still search in your country. I suggest you buy physical gold by checking it physically. I don't recommend buying gold from an online store, no matter how reputed the company is.",

In our area there is still no gold buying service available which can be ordered then the seller takes it to our location.In the process of buying physical gold, what I usually do is go to a gold shop to buy it.This is the process of buying online or investing gold digitally. If this is what the OP means, in our place there are many of these applications available. That is, it is not a physical purchase.Maybe in the area where OP is also widely available.If an online gold buying service is available, I won't do it because it doesn't guarantee whether the content is pure or not.The opportunity to be conned is great.",

There just seems to be alot of places to choose from and not all can be trusted. If you want to invest in gold, I suggest it's better not to go online, because investing in gold online has quite a big risk. One of the risks that might occur is that the site or application will go bankrupt. Meanwhile, when investing in gold online, as far as I know, investors usually don't hold gold physically, but only through data. So when the worst possibility occurs, it will definitely be very troublesome. Because the gold is not held directly by the investors. So I suggest you more, if you are going to invest in gold, it's better to go directly to the pawn shop. Because there you can immediately make transactions and after completing the transaction you can immediately bring the gold.And I also suggest that if you want to invest in gold, it's better to choose gold bullion. Because the gold content is very high and very pure.",

Same with other said don't deal anything online especially buying a expensive asset since to many scams are posted there and to bad if you catch up a scam then you lose your money. Much better to search for local seller which have physical store so that you can personally go there and assure that he has a gold on hand to avoid any unnecessary things on your supposed to be investment. Also try to compare the price of each seller since there's price different on each store especially if you spot a supplier on your place since for that you can get a discount upon purchase.",

Have first considers the conditions in buying a physical gold, which involves you undergoing through a thorough KYC conditions, most of the gold sold were from government and you should understand what buying a raw gold means from government, rhe second means is to buy from individual gold merchant with materials or jewelries made in gold, those ones can be gotten in an open market of any location in your country as long as you make a demand for it you will surely have a direct link to those that sells it from diff locations.",

There, it is referred to as the \"black market,\" where gold and other foreign currencies are being transacted between the indigenes.

Better buy actual gold, like in the form of jewelry as it is safer and handy as compared to gold bullions.You can easily buy it from pawnshops near you, and you will know their reputation also. So you know if they are legit or not.You can buy from 14k,18k, 21k - depending on your preference here. There is marking on the jewelry to see if they are authentic.For me, this is the best and cheapest option to buy physical gold. You don't need to involve anyone to buy one.",
