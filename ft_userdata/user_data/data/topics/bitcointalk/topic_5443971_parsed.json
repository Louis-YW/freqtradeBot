International Women's Day is one of those occasions to remind the world of the centuries-old struggle that women have been carrying out at all levels. Despite all the successes that have been achieved in the field of women's rights, there is still a long way to go to achieve true equality with men.Happy international women's day to all the hardworking women here.Greetings to African women in particular, since they suffer more than the rest of the world.",

I think there are happy and miserable people everywhere, no place is more miserable than anywhere. To be fair, although the world has become fairer, I still see that there is something male has priority over female, the distinction has not entirely disappeared. Women are always more disadvantaged than men, both in the family as well as in society. But today is their day, give them the best. Happy World Women's Day, hope the world becomes more and more equal.",

I see the world making progress (We have evolved from societies where people stone women to societies that pay less to women) on these issues, but there is still a long way to go.

They deserve special recognition for their selflessness. I remember my mother and how much she made sacrifices for me when I was very young. I celebrate her first even though she is not into bitcoins and then all other women who are representing the female gender in bitcoins. Your number may be smaller than the number of men in bitcoins, but your number is not insignificant.Happy International Women's Day.",

But I think women have more work to do than men, so I think that's why they don't have time to engage in investing or other activities like men. In addition to outside work, women today also have to spend time doing housework at home as well as taking care of children. We call it an equal and fair world, but much of that work is still done by women, and that's also a loss for them. As men, we have time to drink with friends, but as women, they hardly have time to rest, let alone earn extra income.",

In general, I congratulate all working women's day.The world has made a lot of progress in its quest for gender equality but we still have a long way to go. Religious belief has become one of the leading tools for subjecting women to slavery and suffering. We hear about child marriage going on in some parts of the world, where children are forced to marry men that are old enough to be their grandfathers. The issue of Afghanistan is a pathetic one where the Taliban have chased out the girl child from schools because of religion. Boko Haram terrorists in West Africa have always kidnapped female schoolchildren because they believe that girls are created to serve in the kitchen or become full housewives. Culturally women are seen as second-class citizens. The men can commit some offense and can be spared by society but if a woman commits that same crime, she will be disgraced and sometimes beaten to death. The world is blinded by religion and culture and it will take education and meditation to stop this attack on the female race.",

Some see as some disruptive female trying to have a supremacy fight with the opposite gender. Some see as a taboo and this has led to some women finding it difficult to strive.",

Still, I'm sure that someday it'll change.We all live in the hope that this liberation will be achieved and an end to the suffering that has been going on for centuries. Unfortunately, there are not many encouraging signs because the causes of the crisis are complex and intertwined between economic, political and even biological. Women struggle to complete their rights in all parts of the world, and African women are the worst, so they are at the bottom of the ranking, even in the ladder of liberation. We see many examples of women in poor and conservative countries who succeeded in obtaining a significant status and regaining a large part of their rights, but this does not seem easy in African countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa.",
