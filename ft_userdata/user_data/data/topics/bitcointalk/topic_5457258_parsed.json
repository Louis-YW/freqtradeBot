This post of mine on other thread gave a brief summary, and that was a bit behind the latest update.Up to this day, user from case number 1 was never be seen anymore, with last post on the thread made by themselves, at 30th of May, and their last online date was more than one week ago as per when this post is made. Not sure if the silence is because they escalated the case to the EU authorities like they said they will, they waited for a response, or something else happened. So, it's actually 50-50. One might argue the user left the case because they tried their luck of playing victim and lose, while other might argue their silence is because they're working in the background. So, taking assumption of the later, let's say it's open.As for case number 2, Rollbit and the user finally took their case to the licensor. Though the case should be still in early phase and perhaps currently being reviewed by the licensor, given the verdict made by CEG is binding to the parties involved and final, it is as good as closed.So, to summarize and reflect to the latest situation, accusations about Rollbit are as follows:1. Rollbit - scam 5k - GDPR PROBLEM 2. Rollbit disables account and seizes funds (10.2k)! - pending for CEG's decision3. Community Warning - Rollbit ⚠️ 4. Rollbit hold funds and ignore in chat5. scam warning rollbit.com banned my account6. rollbit scam (255 USDT) And of course, as you also noticed and well mentioned, this one is not Rollbit's case, and rather an impersonator.Where are these plenty of complaints? At best, there's only one unsolved case against Rollbit, and that only applied if we assume OP of that thread is working in the background. Or are there other cases that I missed? I'd like to visit them myself if there's any.",

Resolved or not, these things happened.I could have added one myself if I wanted to but didn't bother as it's a waste of time.I have mentioned this before in other threads, rollbit used the stolen/hacked user data from stake (email, username, VIP level) to send promotion emails to stake users with platinum 1 and up levels with bonus codes. These bonus amounts were supposed to be \"no strings attached\". When it came to withdrawing they suddenly asked me to first, make a deposit, and 2nd go through KYC.Without these 2 things I would not get any of my money.As I didn't bother doing this for 150$ at a place where I will never play again I just never logged in. In my eyes a site that buys stolen data and user it for self promotion is not to be trusted.But that is just my personal opinion. The future will show how long they will be around or if it's just another x1bit situation.",

The future will show how long they will be around or if it's just another x1bit situation.If this is what the measurement of how likely a platform scam someone, the numbers of accusations and disputes raised against them on this forum, disregarding they are solved or not, then almost all of the platforms on this forum are doomed. Even platform as big as SB has their shares of scam accusations, be it the one they invalidate themselves through proofs, or the community that provide the evidences, or the ones that solved through mutual agreements. But, if we use your parameter to determine the likelihood of SB to scam, is it still applicable? Wouldn't that means SB also is \"very likely to scam\"? If any, I think the exact opposite is what happened. The bigger the platform is, the more accusations and disputes raised and will be raised against them, as more people will try to take advantage and cheats, or miscommunication and technical issues happen.Instead, the measurement that worth its weight and should be taken into consideration is how the representative(s) address and solve each of the cases handed to them. Several big platforms here have their fair share of accusations, and they addressed it the best they can. I left tags at several points to couple of casinos due to their very poor way attending to the cases. Razer for instance, went AWOL with those cases mentioned above piling on top of each other, but then he returned, was it not a show of good faith that they take accusations seriously and give their best to protect their reputation?Feel free to argue back, I am open for non-hostile discussion.",

I have my opinion and I stick with it, also due to my own above mentioned negative experience with this site. Can a site, buying/using stolen player data of a competitor be trusted? I don't think so. I certainly respect your opinion about this, we all have different views on things. That's how it is. Wish you good weekend!",
