Thanks.It may not be my biggest obstacle but this is the common reason with what I've seen in different online money forums about. And that's all about the delayed gratification. Because when someone has the money, he just can't stop himself on purchasing the things that he want. There's no feeling of the need to invest the money because they'll earn it again and again.That's where the cycle goes on and they'll complain that they can't invest because they can't delay the gratification that they might feel upon purchasing a thing.So, aside from that, it also connects to the discipline in handling money.",

Thanks.You ask about obstacles in making money, right? Because the point of the question is that. So, in this case, I can only say that my obstacles in making money are three things for now and I'm still experiencing it to this day, even though I always find a solution.The first is the lack of capital that I can turn to for profit in various directions or businesses of various sizes. The second is that stalls or places to open new businesses or side businesses have begun to decrease to support a better living income. Those are the only two that are currently holding me back because I am not a government employee who receives a monthly salary.",

Thanks.it's very difficult to be able to get passive income nowadays,, especially if you live in a city,, it's even more difficult to achieve, because the cost of living and also the needs that must be met often make it difficult for us to divide our income for needs and investments .. therefore most of it today's youth cannot achieve financial freedom at their age unless they inherit assets from their parents",

It is understandable that governments make strict laws because that is how they maintain their existence and how they govern us. If a society is not controlled and regulated, I assure you that it will first become more chaotic than developed.Every country has corruption, if you are the government, you will be corrupt like them, that is human nature, and it is tough to eliminate completely. But I agree, a corrupt government is the cause of economic difficulties and people's miserable life.",

I have some space with my salary after deducting everything that I need to spend for the rest of the month, a small bit for my enjoyment, and the rest goes to my portfolio, but even then it's a tad bit paltry compared to what I want.

Tbf, even with the idea that Bitcoin existed back then, I doubt most people would've actually taken it as an investment, mainly because most people don't have any idea what it is. And for those who actually do, they've already decided to take one of the two stances, to support it or to ignore it. Lack of information is indeed a factor but also knowing what said information is, is also needed. It's rather easy to say that you'd invest in Bitcoin back then since it's already happened, but realistically speaking, I doubt most would be able to when faced with the same question a decade back.",

Actually what is our question to others, is the first question for ourselves to answer. But we don't realize this little thing so that later we can learn more from what happens to ourselves.Too many people blame circumstances, especially their financial problems, but is it true that circumstances are fully responsible for the problems they face? I do not think so. Indeed, in certain situations, our main problem is outside of us, but if we think about it, the biggest problem is ourselves.",

People spend lavishly on frivolous items and later come around to regret purchasing such items. And without some savings to fall back on when your account is in the red, when then would you do? Youâll head on down to the bank to take out a loan with some ridiculously high interest rate. But youâre broke and need the money so you take it and now owing the bank.

It has to do with making a decision at the point of realization that this is what you want to do inorder to contribute your quota to society and thus make a name for yourself.
