There are several malware viruses that infiltrate our devices via phishing attacks and then take control of our keyboards, with the ability to replace our wallet addresses with their own in order to receive the coin we are about to send. That is why it is important to double-check the address before sending it, as they can change our addresses with theirs that have similar suffixes to ours.",

There are numerous occasion where people have mistakenly sent out Bitcoins and never receive them back.Being irreversible is not an issue, it's a positive that Bitcoin has other forms of currency.First point to note is for a transaction to be reversible, there has to be a central authority to oversee transactions and go through the details of each one to ensure people do not just reverse transactions after paying for something. This will mean Bitcoin is not decentralized and is not a unique, futuristic asset at all.If transactions were reversible you will not be certain you own the bitcoins in your wallet.What we have to do it take responsibility when making a transaction.
