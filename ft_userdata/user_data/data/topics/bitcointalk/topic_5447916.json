Its also part of your journey to loss before winning. Actually I don't have any idea what is it about before, like how can they mine Bitcoin using GPU? That would be my first impression. In my case, I've found out Bitcoin by exploring the internet. Saw some articles how you can earn in Bitcoin in some ways. So I watched some tutorials online and started with small amount first until it continues.  Started a long time ago have many mistakes which I fixed causes me to loss>win.",

He rather told me that I should instead invest in altcoins. That bitcoin is too expensive. That I could not afford it at this time.

As a newbie, everyone will have bad experiences, but we should not regret it. I knew bitcoin quite early through a friend, but he also did not teach me to invest and hold bitcoin, what he taught me was to buy bitcoin to participate in Ponzi projects. I also didn't learn what bitcoin is and just thought of it as a vehicle to invest in those projects. It wasn't until I lost everything I invested in those projects that I got bored and became idle. I was curious about the name bitcoin and just started to learn and invest in it. I believe most of those still on the market to this day have had many of the same initial experiences as you and me, but I have never regretted it because our lives are all about experiences.",

Every bull run, miners are like that and taking every possible stock of GPUs but then when the transition of ETH from pow to pos happened, that has changed a lot.Now, those expensive GPUs dropped down in price and they have got enough stock for every customer since most GPU miners were there because of ETH.And even manufacturer of these GPUs were blaming the miners but now, look at how they reason out that there is an actual chipset shortage worldwide.I was about to invest huge with GPU mining but just thought that I do not want to exert much effort on it and it was what I have noticed first so, like what others are suggesting to just buy bitcoin instead and so I obliged.",

Bitcoin become popular here due to faucet and ponzi which promises profit by just solving captcha and investing online. I learn Bitcoin the hard way by experiencing a lot of scam since there’s no clear warning about this scam scheme before. I just become open minded after learning the forum and discuss here with other user.",

If some of these freelancing firms will add Bitcoin as their alternative payment currency it will be very nice. It will help freelancers to save and hold Bitcoin. This forum (bitcointalk) is one of the major platforms that has helped many people to earn Bitcoin and am also benefitting from it. P2P platforms and other decentralized platforms are always the best places to keep your coins. Exchanges are not different from banks and other financial institutions that are greedy because of profit-making.",

Something doesn't add up here. Did anyone mine btc a couple of years ago this way? Everyone must have already switched to ASICs or mined other cryptocurrencies with the help of the GPU, like ETH, XMR, where it makes sense and profitability.It seems that some blogger who talked about the benefits of bitcoin pushed me into a close study of it. Of course, even before that I knew about the existence of btc, but I didn’t take it seriously and it seemed that this whole pyramid was about to collapse.  Years have passed, and this bubble still doen't burst.  Apparently, there is something worthwhile in this.",

Amidst a solo mountain excursion, pondering life's profound questions, an elderly sage approached me. He divulged the existence of an enigmatic digital currency poised to revolutionize our world.He described an unregulated currency, liberated from governmental or institutional control. Intrigued, I pursued this curious insight. Bizarre, isn't it? Trusting an unfamiliar fellow speaking of virtual coins? The rationale eludes me still.Months later, I invested in Bitcoin. A tumultuous journey, marked by soaring peaks and plunging valleys. Yet, my convictions remained unshaken. The rewards? Astounding! Now, I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast.However, it's not solely about profits. It's the exhilaration of participating in a transformative movement.

But I digress, it's a rite of passage to lose money in this industry alright, I'm guessing a good amount of people in this forum have suffered a net loss especially those who sold during dips.
