This is massive News and Ftx exchange token which was down below 1.5$ suddenly pushed by big whale and its pumped more than 100% in 45 minutes.

Either it will be refunded?2: FTT token will be Their native token ir they will launch another token?What do you think Its worth to invest now on FTT token after this news? can we see price back to value where ut crashes after Ftx Bankruptcy If answer is Yes how much time it will take? if i am not wrong the price was above 25$ .",

Either it will be refunded?They won't be refunded or receive any compensation if FTX v.2 exchange won't get enough customers, trading volume then income and profit from its operations. It depends on decisions and strategies of FTX exchange's new board members to compensate their users. I believe that if they are serious with their relaunched business, they will spend part of their income to compensate their users gradually. It will take a lot of time and even take years for FTX to fully compensate their users but it is a best approach for them to rebuild the exchange reputation.Quote2: FTT token will be Their native token ir they will launch another token?I don't think they will launch a new token. If they have full access from FTT tokens belong to ex-core team members, they won't need to launch a new token.",

If they try to launch another token, they're not far from being Luna and UST.",

Is it so hard to brand new exchange that people would rather trust FTX then brand new one? Or could it be that some people in charge of this move bought FTT tokens in the bottom and this is their way to manipulate the price. You don't need to use 2 brain cells to figure out what's happening here.",

If they want to have a good comeback here this is the good way to introduce the site again. Anyway, If they will relaunch the exchange I’m sure many will hesitant to try it again so better not to expect to be a good exchange again because for me, it’s over even if they will change the whole management of that exchange.",

Let’s just wait for their announcement if they really want to bring back that exchange and see what will be the reaction of investors to them, maybe they can have some or maybe many already learned their lesson with FTX.",

But before that, they must go first with customers, all the funds of customers that were locked must go back with a lot of customers and after that, for sure they will start rebuilding the FTX and then regain the trust of the people step by step.",

They need to refund those who wanted the refund or just issue a refund to those who are affected by this incident. 2. For sure they'll launch a new one, maybe just a fork out of it.LOL don't get hyped, it's just a rumor and nothing is confirmed. If you wanted it badly, just minimize and manage your risks then. I am still doubting if it will be opened again so it's uncertain as well to comment on the price of the token.",

If it is more than the amount they have recovered there is no way they are going to allow all of those people to withdraw that money, maybe they could try to pay them on installments, but if that is the case then FTX will become nothing more but a Ponzi scheme as they will use the money which new traders deposit to pay their older clients, and if that is the case I doubt they will get enough customers as everyone on the back of their minds will know that a crash can always happen again.",

Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on April 13, 2023, 01:09:40 AM2: FTT token will be Their native token or they will launch another token?

Ftx new team also didn't talked about new token so it seem that they ftt will be their token.
