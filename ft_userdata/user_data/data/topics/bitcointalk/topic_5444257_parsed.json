I mean, how do you explain that a member with a new account knows that the forum has rules that must be viewed and does not know how to search for them, and all he was able to do is publish a topic for the question. I suspect he's coveting merit points in something like this “Hello World” message.",

There's a helpful guide that covers everything you need to know: Newbies - Read before posting If you're feeling like you don't know where to start, try searching for answers to your questions before making a new post. There's a good chance someone has already asked the same question and you can find the answer without having to ask again. If you're here to learn, that's awesome! We're all here to help each other out, so don't be afraid to ask questions if you need help. But the key is to educate yourself as much as possible!",

What happens to reading by yourself and ask more specific questions and not just for wanting to know about general situation in the forum. Making post as opening a thread on the first post could mean being in a rush or intentional for some purpose that may now be defeated.",

It’s amazing how newbies skip past the pinned threads, then create a topic asking questions that have been repeated over time.Sometimes I feel like maybe some actual take it has a welcome routine, because you might see posts like this just above a similar post. Some newbies actually post this welcoming post not because they have not find the rules of the forum but just posting to have their first post. Nonetheless forum members will continue to share links for them even those that I know they won’t even open. Welcome to the forum mate adhere to the guidelines of this forum and most importantly avoid plagiarism. Also don’t copy AI posts here, believe me there are members here that would detect it. The punishment for plagiarism is banning.",

Don't forget, it's a discussion platform, your free to air your ideas as they are indeed valid but, don't be forced by yourself to put out something when you don't feel like. That would be spam and it's not a very welcomed practice in the forum. In fact, you get deleted posts, warnings, temporal bans and eventually the ban goes permanent.Mind you, the rules arr very active and works here plus, it's a forum where you've got eyes watching. Be good and your sure to enjoy the forum.",

As you can see that there are only 1 in each but these two is what makes this forum great. Try starting from doing research then you will learn a lot later on. I was once a newbie where I don't know what I would do here in this forum but I explore on my own and made some research about the forum and also about cryptocurrency at the same time. Anyway, don't get carried away by the harsh criticism and just think of it as a way to find your mistakes or to make yourself better.DO:Always follow the forum rules as it for your own good (Unofficial or Official forums rules doesnt matter).DON'T:Never violate or break the forum rules even though you might say that it is not the official forum rules but we still follow the rules (Unofficial or Official forum rules doesn't matter).",
