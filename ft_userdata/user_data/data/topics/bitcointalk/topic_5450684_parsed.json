The older people are, the more used they are to common systems and it is more and more hard to try to convince them to adapt a new solution.I’m my opinion there are a lot of young people in bitcoin, but most of them are not (yet) on bitcointalk. It would be nice to try to Bringen them there, since the quality of information on boards like Reddit etc is not as good.",

Young people are inquisitive and are not as skeptical as older folks so they can easily accept bitcoin Bitcoin adoption will not happen overnight, it took years for bitcoin to reach ATH of $67k in 2021, and I believe the price of bitcoin is what attract newbies to the tech, the thought of making money from bitcoin is a greater motivation than you can be your own bank pitch. There is a misrepresentation of bitcoin that gives people the idea that they can become rich overnight from investing in bitcoin, this conception has done bitcoin more harm than good..  A word of advice; next time do not rush to create a topic, I can point two typos in your post, this can make it difficult to others to understand what you are saying and you may not get the response you expect.",

Most of them,see Bitcoin as a get rich quick program and when ever they hear someone who is a holder of Bitcoin, all that comes to their mind is that he is a millionaire. This is not so trueAn experience from yesterday, when I was discussing with a co worker and when I told him I was into Bitcoin trading his reply was so straight forward that I was putting up a lie. And if I really was into Bitcoin, I wouldn't be not be working. His own idea about Bitcoin is actually wrong. Having Bitcoin doesn't actually mean that you shouldn't go to work it can act as a secondary source of income for you.So what I'm trying to say is that most youths needs to learn more about the digital currency,  BITCOIN  and understand fully, what it is. Bitcoin offers many benefits for young people who are looking for digital payment options and investment opportunities and is not a get rich program.",

Many are remembering way back, years ago when they've heard about Bitcoin but they can't invest yet because they've got no money and when they've grown up after several years and got jobs for themselves, that's when they started investing in it.",

Almost 90% of the youth in developing nations, i bet are using this amazing creation Bitcoins. I mean they have seen the rise of Bitcoins from nothing to precious, so definitely they will be more interested to use it to make the more money out of it. Bitcoins have also many benefits over the traditional banks and hence the youths are getting more attracted to the coins.",

New generations are growing up with smartphones, apps and things like that, not really distinguishing between the real and virtual because the virtual is equally real to them, being available since birth. This means that at least some scepticism about Bitcoin may be way less prevalent when it comes to people born in the 90s or later, such as that Bitcoin isn't real money just because it doesn't have a physical form.But perhaps, considering that Bitcoin is probably more naturally appealing to young people, more work should be done in attracting older people to it.",

I think only this forum is more than enough for anyone to master Bitcoin because all Bitcoin experts are available in this forum and they have been doing their best to educate others about Bitcoin.
