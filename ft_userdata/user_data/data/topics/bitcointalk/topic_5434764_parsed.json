  "content": "Protocol proposal to associate a multisig 2/2 address to bitcoin-themed collectibles Author: gbianchiRevision 0.2 dated January 14th 2023AbstractIn cryptography, using a private key generated by another user does not guarantee security in the management of associated funds. With this protocol we offer a valid alternative to the use of a 2 of 2 multisignature system capable of guaranteeing security for the user in the purchase and use of bitcoin-themed collectibles.IntroductionThanks to  @bitbollo  I learned about the world of bitcoin-themed collectibles.I also learned that collectibles are often manufactured with an associated bitcoin address and relative private key, suitably hidden, for the purpose of loading amounts in bitcoins,associated with the collectible, sometimes even substantial.[1] Obviously the first objection/observation that came to my mind was: if the producer keeps a database of the generated keys, once a certain volume of customers is reached he can scam them all.[2]Coincidentally, the @yogg  scam related some Coldkey ™  cards occurred just a few days later which was the blatant manifestation of these doubts.[3] The purpose of this document is to propose a multisignature[4] 2 of 2 for the production of collectibles with an associated multisig address at a higher security level thanto the private key system generated by the manufacturer.AbbreviationsPrefixP = Manufacturer (producer of bitcoin-themed collectibles)C1 = direct customer of the manufacturerC2 = customer of C1 (and any other customer later C1) Suffixk = Private Keyp = Public Keya = bitcoin address Symbolsms = address multisignature 2 of 2cc = paper certificate ------ Production ------------------------------C1 wants to buy a collectible from PC1 produces C1k and C1pC1 sends C1p to PP produces Pk and PpP generates ms from Pp + C1pP generates Pa from Pp and C1a from C1pP generates paper certificate cc with printed Pp, Pa, C1p, C1a, msP inserts his Pk into bitcoin-themed collectible and seals itP prints a ms qr-code outside the bitcoin-themed collectibleP sends bitcoin-themed collectible to C1 accompanied by cc Note: the loading of an amount on ms by P or other parties has no influence on the description of the protocol. In any case P is unable to spend ms, he does not know the key C1k to sign a possible transaction.  ------- passing the bitcoin-themed collectible to c1 ------------- C1 receives bitcoin-themed collectible and cc With the cc, C1 can verify that ms was generated by Pp + C1p .He can also verify that the qr-code printed on the bitcoin-themed collectible corresponds to that of cc.C1 if later wants to spend any ms content must break the bitcoin-themed collectibles, to withdraw Pk and be able to sign, together with C1k, the transaction. ------------ Selling the items from C1 to C2 (and so on)------------------- C2 wants to buy from C1, but wants proof of ownership:C1 sends C2 a photo of the qr-code of the bitcoin-themed collectible (address ms)C1 sends C2 a photo of the paper certificate (and then Pp, Pa, C1p, C1a, ms ).C1 proves to C2 that it can sign a message with address C1a (then prove it have the private key) Then C2 it is certain that:   a) cc is that of the bitcoin-themed collectibles (ms of the qr-code on the bitcoin-themed collectibles and that on cc correspond)   b) C1 owns the private key C1k (is able to sign a message with C1a) If C1 and C2 agree C1 transcribes its own C1k and inserts it in the bitcoin-themed collectible.C1 sends the bitcoin-themed collectibles to C2  ------------ Advantages over the one key protocol------------ P  can never withdraw the amount paid in ms.Even if you keep a database with all the Pk's it has generated, nothing can be done with it, so it can never scam C1 C1 interacts with P and is certain that the object is customized for him and UNIQUE. C1 can demonstrate to C2 by sending the photo the paper certificate and signing with C1a (because he owns C1k) that he really possesses C1k[/i], therefore that he is aware of C1k (so if it's not C1 it must have somehow interacted with C1 and/or with the object). Disadvantages:The protocol does not lend itself to industrial productionRequires knowledge of bitcoin protocol and multi signature addresses from C1 and C2The object must be \"broken\" in order to access P private key (that is inserted during the creation of the bitcoin-themed-collectibles), this kind of process has been already introduced by Kialara [5] Weaknesses:P doesn't actually put Pk inside the object, or it puts a wrong key:P cannot spend any ms content, so if he doesn't introduce the key on purpose he has no advantage. If he introduces an incorrect one, he still has no advantage, as he could not gain anything in a scam attempt and would lose his reputation as a producer, so he could only lose out. P make an agreement with C1 in order to scam C2:P could do it even in the single key case and with much less effort.Also P should agree with various C1 level clients for being able to scam all C2 level clients, which is unthinkable since items are available to all kind of users hence C1.The bigger the number of customers of P the more unlikely an agreement between C1 and P to scam becomes possible. if C1 does not send the key C1k to C2 C1 is not able to use / redeem the amount because the object remains intact, therefore it would have no advantage in not sending it, it loses its reputation in the face of any economic or trust advantage. In this case a reputable escrow during the transaction could be another viable solution to avoid any potential scam. C1 loses C1k: is no longer able to sell the item, a C2 wouldn't buy it.In any other way C1 tries to scam C2, they are cases identical to thoseof the system with only one unique private key \"hidden\" in the object. I ask all of you to review and suggest further implementations of this method for introducing keys into collectibles and increasing security in this type of transaction.SummaryIn the first level passage P -> C1 the risks for C1 are almost eliminated compared to the single key system.In the second level passages C1 -> C2 the risks of C2 are slightly lower than in the single key systemReferences[1] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_1000_BTC_gold_coin[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3315347.0[3] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5434506.0[4] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multi-signature[5] https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/01/how-kialara-uses-physical-bitcoins-to-explore-the-value-of-art/AcknowledgmentsI thank @bitbollo for the fundamental contribution, the constructive exchange of ideas and the patience.",
