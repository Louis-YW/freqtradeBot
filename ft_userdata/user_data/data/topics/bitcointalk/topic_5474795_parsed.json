  "content": "hello,For a long time now, I have been receiving several small Bitcoin transactions from a payment system to my trust wallet almost every day. Until about 2 weeks ago everything was ok and the transactions were usually confirmed within a few minutes. But for about 10 days now, since the blockchain has been a little overloaded, the transactions are no longer confirmed. I can't set a sending fee myself and the only thing I can see is that it is quite small. Now some transactions are no longer unconfirmed but local (I restored the wallet on Electrum and that's where I see it). On Blockchair, every transaction has been saying \"in about 24 hours\" for days.I took a screenshot of the transactions from the electrum wallet so that you can see a little more. Is it possible to speed this up somehow or can someone realistically tell me how long it will take and what these local transactions are?Any information or help would be very gratefulhere screenshot of electrum transaction and thats not even all. the oldest is now like 10 days oldhttps://ibb.co/dPq62qzregards",

In short: you screwed yourself big time by creating so many dust inputs in your wallet. With high fees, many of your inputs aren't worth the fee needed to send them. There's only one option: wait for fees to drop, and then consolidate your funds.Quotefrom a payment systemThey shouldn't be sending transactions with such low fees. But you shouldn't be withdrawing such small amounts on-chain in the first place.Quoteto my trust walletThat's another red flag. There are better wallets out there. By restoring your wallet on Electrum you've exposed your seed phrase to 2 different wallets now. It's better to create a new Electrum wallet, and move your funds there (when fees are much lower).QuoteIs it possible to speed this up somehowNo. The only options to speed it up are very expensive.Quotecan someone realistically tell me how long it will take and what these local transactions are?Bitcoin on-chain transaction fees are a free market. Nobody can tell you when they'll get lower.\"Local\" transactions in Electrum mean the server dropped them, usually because the fee is too low and the server's mempool reached it's maximum. This will vary per server.QuoteAny information or help would be very gratefulRead my first link, learn how Bitcoin transaction fees work, and avoid small (dust) inputs. You're having problems receiving your funds now, you'll have much bigger problems sending your funds later.Quote from: Zaguru12 on November 20, 2023, 05:53:42 PMyou will need to use the CPFP methodCPFP is too expensive for dust inputs.Quote from: Amphenomenon on November 20, 2023, 05:54:34 PMuse ViaBTC free accelerator.There's no point.
