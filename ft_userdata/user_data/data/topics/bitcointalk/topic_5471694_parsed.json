  "content": "From FED: $CME UPDATE VIP--------------------On weekly timeframe level the price action of $BTC Chicago Mercantile Exchange is filling out the CME gap level marked at $35,860 - $34,580 level We need to see the breakout and retest level above the Horizontal Resistance level which can show us further movements towards the Buy Side Liquidity level From Crypto Heaven UB:cryptoub: Honestly I don't have much to update: I've been scanning for potential new longs. I'll wait until tomorrow before taking anything fresh. I'm happy with my current positions. There's not much to update there. All in good spots. BCH - Level to break is $259. https://www.tradingview.com/x/bZhxPe1Y/SUSHI slowly grinding up. Level to break is .622 https://www.tradingview.com/x/ecrPHyGD/STORJ - Consolidating before hopefully the next leg higher. https://www.tradingview.com/x/s5ftrat7/Now what a lot of people will do is be in comfortable positions but LOOK for reasons to exit that don't really exist. They'll monitor lower timeframes just look for anything as an excuse to close early. Do your best to stick to AT LEAST the h1 + and don't get shaken out for something stupid.From Crypto Heaven LOMA: ETHUSDT - LONGEntry: $1,700-1,790 (current price)Size: $500K (sizing up to $2M eventually)Stop Loss: D1 close below $1,690T1: $2,300-2,400 (maybe earlier depends on BTC pa)T2: TBDChart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/7T5woQZC/Details: Patiently stack bids, don't rush. Another swing setup.I think ETH must hold this $1,700 area or it's doomed anyway so good R:R and I like everyone shitting on ETH. This happens literally all the time.We have exposure to other ALTs already, this is mainly just to round up the overall exposure. A little bit of the BTC/ETH, blue chips, and top100s, and the smaller exposure to round out being spot shitcoins and MC.From Birb Nest:Absolutely, here's a condensed version of the Bitcoin & market update, emphasizing that all signals are currently bullish:DAILY REPORTBITCOIN & MARKET UPDATEBitcoin has a history of surging post-halving—peaks showing 9000%, 3000%, and 700% growth. Now, all indicators are increasingly bullish as traders anticipate the 4th halving.Daily timeframe indicates a confirmed breakout above the 200-day SMA and BPRO Baseline, targeting $39k. Traders should be cautious near the psychological $40k level.The breakout confirmation is approved:▸ Volume (spike) ▸ Breadth (coins > SMA200) ▸ Volatility (ATR > SMA50) ▸ Price % traveled (12%) ▸ Price action (new 52-week high) ▸ Time (2 days > resistance) ▸ Momentum (RSI >80) ▸ S/R level ($32k broken)  The 12H chart presents a bullish outlook with a key CTF Stop at $32,775. If held daily, expect more bullish action to persist.On the 4H chart, Momentum Bands slope aggressively upward, signaling strong bullish momentum. Wide support area @ 31-32kBullish trend sentiment is prevalent across all timeframes except for hourly consolidation - neutral rating. October’s bullish seasonality supports current price action. November gets 2-3 times stronger, historically.:calendar_spiral: Mark your calendars for November 15-21 -> Free Trading Congress V.If you find this helpful, please leave an emoji under this report. God bless.Good luck in trading!Crypto Cartel Original @cryptosignalsoriginal",
