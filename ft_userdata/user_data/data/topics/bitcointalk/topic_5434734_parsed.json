  "content": "Hello,I posted this in Coldcard reddit but didn't really get a proper explanation so I hope someone can explain what is really the issue.As per the Coldcard guide, you would need to export .json file and open it with Electrum where you would see all your addresses but you need Coldcard to sign a transaction to send coins (either via cable or PTSB signed file). This works with no issues.However, when I extract zpub master public key and add it to watch only wallet in Electrum, I get exactly the same addresses and balances as with .json file. But when I try to sign a transaction by extracting PTSB file, it doesn't work, Coldcard gives error message that wallet signatures don't match.Can someone explain the difference between .json file and zpub master key. Do they contain exactly the same data in different format or there is a real difference. Also, is there an increased risk by exposing .json file to the public/hackers vs xpub/zpub?Someone from Coinkite suggested that the issue is probably different paths, but if the paths are different, wouldn't you get different addresses? In my case, I get 2 identical Electrum wallets with exactly same addresses (native segwit). Except when using zpub in Electrum, I can't sign a transaction (different master key fingerprint).Thanks in advance.",

But when I try to sign a transaction by extracting PTSB file, it doesn't work, Coldcard gives error message that wallet signatures don't match.as you mentioned as watch only wallet that is impossible to sign a transaction because there isn't key to open it. so that possible PTSB is also doesn't have key to sign. So, what is PTSB?, I just heard today from you.Quote from: CryptoWomb@at on January 14, 2023, 06:18:25 PMCan someone explain the difference between .json file and zpub master key.

In my case, I get 2 identical Electrum wallets with exactly same addresses (native segwit). Except when using zpub in Electrum, I can't sign a transaction (different master key fingerprint).Maybe Coinkite support means not as derivation path, but a other path like .json file. or code. Like electrum, we can't import private key without code front [p2pkh:, p2wpkh-p2sh:, p2wpkh]",

Btw, PSBT means Partially Signed Bitcoin TransactionUsing PSBTs, a transaction can be crafted with a watch-only wallet, which does not have access to the private keys needed to sign the transaction. The watch-only wallet can then export a PSBT file, which can be imported to a wallet which does contain the required private keys.",

      "body": "It is not possible to find the problem without seeing the PSBT contents but usually problems like this are caused by the wallet creating the wrong \"fingerprint\" for the transaction the wallet sends to the other device/tool to sign. This is why your Electrum wallet created using the master public key is showing correct derivation path and correct addresses but the PSBT is rejected.Conversely when you export the JSON file from ColdCard, it already contains the correct fingerprint so the PSBT created that way is not rejected.",
