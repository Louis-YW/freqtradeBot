Bitnet was mined (PoW-sha256) and evolved to use Dark Gravity Wave Algorithm within a few weeks. Bitnet is not a security, it never had an ICO, nor any kind of funding rounds. Bitnet is self-sustainable and is fully supported by volunteers (Just like Bitcoin). Bitnet has a total supply of 2,000,000,000 BIT and our block rewards are 10,000 BIT per block at block height 150,000 our block rewards will reduce from 10,000 BIT to 100 BIT per block to preserve the network for another 30 years.For more information about Bitnet, please visit: • Website - https://bitnet-io.org/ • Twitter - https://twitter.com/Bitnet_io • Telegram - https://t.me/bitnet00 • GitHub - https://github.com/bitnet-io/bitnet-core • Explorer - https://bitexplorer.io/ • Discord - https://discord.gg/tsx7EY8F2zBuy Now: • https://xeggex.com/market/BIT_USDT • https://xeggex.com/market/BIT_BTC",

I mined over 2,000 blocks! will you swap?\"in the beginning we were going to base this off of litecoin as a scrypt based fork but we decided to use the bitcoin wallet as a framework instead we are sha256 meaning that we are compatible with any pre-existing sha256 technology for Bitcoin. Our coin is a richer coin that Bitcoin because we have 2,000,000,000 total supply and we started with 10,000 BIT per block. at block height 150,000 we plan to reduce our block rewards down to 100 BIT per block which will preserve the network for the next 25-30 years. Bitcoin cash which is also similar to bitcoin has a halving every 210,000 blocks and is currently down from 50 BCH to 6.25 BCH. This is not the case with Bitnet which will always supply a 100 BIT for a block reward and it will not go through halving",

I mined over 2,000 blocks! will you swap?we plan to stay on sha256 indefinitelywe are at an all time high now of 0.0004~ USD per BIT on xeggexwe figure that if the price goes up to 0.004 USD per BIT it will continue to support miners at 100 BIT per block",

      "body": "mining (bitnet). though i will be collecting a few on the way from trades instead (no time at the moment). will be limiting my bitnet mining process in future, will be completely lowering it from 26 cores/threads (which im mining bitnet with at the moment) to 4 or 2 cores/threads (i have 32 cores/threads-total). i have my reasons.(UPDATE: I've put those 26 cores/threads to use back to some place else. I have my reasons   I need find or wait for a pay per share mining ⛏️ pool with a smaller threshold. This way this will insure me a window of assurance and confidence. I wonder what an upside down bitcoin would look like.  I do like Bitnet for the enthusiastic support for CPU. I appreciate though. Really really. Continue with the greatnet-work haha    ).I only use a single desktop PC for mining and researching purposes. Planned to upgrade in future and also get secondary in far future    ).",
