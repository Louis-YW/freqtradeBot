Apeswap.finance who's native token is Banana is different from apecoin.Many projects have Ape in their project names and token names but it does not mean those projects are related with each other by team members or project developments. Like with Bitcoin, there are hundreds of Bitcoin forks and they usually name their projects and coin names with Bitcoin as part of their names like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold ... However, it is wrong to say Bitcoin has any relation with them about team members, developers or any other things.QuoteApeswap is more focus on Defi where Apecoin focuses on web3 technology.

Apeswap is a DeFi project and if OP want to know more about them and what's going on recently with their project development, marketing, join their Telegram group and ask questions.Get links to their communities on Coinmarketcap https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/apeswap-finance/",

I think defi and web 3 have some similarities because when we use defi, we are being asked to connect our web 3 wallets but I am not saying that both of the ape projects are the same. You already explained on why they are different and even before, I am already aware that they are not the same even though their names are almost identical to each other.Apeswap was once famous during its release but I guess that's just how it works, that the longer the project exists, the more it becomes less popular and favoured by the masses. Apecoin is much newer than the apeswap so it was still hot in the public right now but its time can also come soon.",

BANANA was a token that being released by apeswap.finance team. https://apeswap.finance/You may see that if it's almost pretty similar in the name but it's very different compared with ape token released for Bored Ape Yacht Club token holders. Ape token related to the BAYC NFT has a purpose to be used on the metaverse that being developed by yugo labs. Both of tokens have different purposes and it's developed by different entities. i heard it and you must be careful by checking the site. BANANA token (apeswap) didn't have relationshp with Ape token by BAYC NFT created by yugo labs.",

We are all \"apes\" and that is why it's called ape here as well as anywhere else as well. The meme that we are \"aping\" or just accepting that we ape into these things and just accepting the non-informative ways and just disrupting the normal financial system by being out of the box, all of these are wrong things.You can make a bit of a profit here and there, some people could even get rich, but it is not a long term solution and can't make anyone have a retirement fund with this method, you gotta do something a little bit more legit.",
