  "content": "One of my relatives goes to work in Singapore as a remittance fighter to earn some money. He had a habit of gambling before. One day he goes to the casino and gets free food and $10  to go there. She fell into the greed of eating free and some free dollars and started going there regularly. At some point he becomes interested in gambling. And he started gambling regularly and he started losing all the money he earned here. At one point he lost all his money. One day a lottery was arranged in that casino. And he bought a lottery there as his last attempt. And he won that lottery and got 2nd prize. Where there was 1 million usd. But this money brings danger to him at one stage. The other expatriates who were with him wanted to kill him and take his money. Then he realizes this and take the help of the police of Singapore but Carrying $1 Million was high risky and transferring money to his country by international money transfer it was matter of time. so he buy $1 million worth of bitcoin and back to his country Immediately. Bitcoin saves both his time and money. And he was able to back safely to his own country with his money.",

But buying bitcoin makes cross border transfer faster and cheaper, which is a good advantage over fiat. I did not see anything like noncustodial wallet when you were narating the event, possibly she used a crypto exchange for the purchase? If so, she should know that she do not have complete control on her coins and it is better to move the coin to a noncustodial wallet. Getting a hardware wallet will be perfect for better safety.If the story is true, I am glad about your relative.",

All casino's definitely understand the risk involved with giving cash to lottery winners especially immediately, and certainly they will not want to put a winners life in danger. Plus If you win a huge sum, it takes a while for any casino to process it, it is certainly not instant.",

Unless, of course, he bought so many tickets that his odds of winning were very high, but if he earns money doing construction work, then it's unlikely he has hundreds of thousands to spend on gambling. Not to mention the part about friends wanting to kill him. But yeah, Bitcoin can be used to hide wealth if one does it right. My thought is also that if he likes physical gambling, storing the money in Bitcoin might be a way of avoiding gambling because physical casinos rarely accept BTC.",

But rationally it's just a fictional story, there's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the story is real.",

Although its possible to win such a huge amount but handling it all to you in a form of cash, that sounds unrealistic. Here in our country, mostly it will be done through bank transactions. And you can't just withdraw it all at once, the bank provides withdrawals limit. I guess even if the story is cut short, the flow of events is still hard to believe. Converting all your fiat into bitcoin, that thing alone is very risky to make.",

In the form of seephrase, right? Because I didn't see any mention of a bitcoin transaction in your story.",

Buying on that kind of amount would take weeks in my country since banks here aren't bitcoin friendly and so many steps unless you have a peer to peer transaction.",

I doubt that OP's story is true, that a non-bitcoiner suddenly put all his money in bitcoin to move it around, not being afraid of all those hacks and scams the mainstream media pump people's heads full of.Bitcoin works great as your private stash for hiding money and moving it around.
