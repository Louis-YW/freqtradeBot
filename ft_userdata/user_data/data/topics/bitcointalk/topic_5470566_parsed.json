According to the latest data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which serves as a proxy for gun sales, because there is no national database tracking firearm purchases, gun demand surged during the early days of Covid. It continued erupting as Black Lives Matter protests/riots sparked concern for safety among millions of Americans. Gun demand has since plunged since panic buying was merely a bubble.

Shutting down the Federal Government would get rid of their authority to use guns all over the world... make war, that is.So you are in favor of the idea or theory of the \"good guy with a gun\" who is supposed to say bystanders are to be saved by a law-abiding citizen with a gun from a mad mass shooter. While I admit there are situations which  a good guy with a gun managed to take out the shooter as soon as he started to fire against innocent people, there are still situations in which the good guy would not be in such position of advantage to save innocent bystanders. Take for instance the horrible attack in Las Vegas, the target was a wide surface of concerngoers. Even if they had handguns with them, they could have never counter attacked against the shooter. They were not even aware where bullets were coming from.What is supposed to be done to prevent those events to happen and take innocent life?",
