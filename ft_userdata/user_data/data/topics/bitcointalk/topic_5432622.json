I have seen that Bitcoin is looking too weak, and also volume is also going too much down and also down and that will draw short people to go down more dropped. Let's see what will happen with Ethereum in coming days. I am waiting to buy Ethereum at 500-700 dollars Rnage when it will come. So what you guys will say if there are some experts. We cannot project anything full clear but we can say that at least technical analysis wouod be great.",

I am sure not in Bitcoin because its price is still the same but in fact when I check BTC earlier, it gained some and then its colour is green again. Altcoins are supposed to increase and not drop right? Since BTC is their leader and they obey it whatever it do.2023 is suspected to be a continuous dump year for the whole crypto so yeah we should not hurry up when buying and use most of our money but we can just do a DCA to be able to gain access for a better buying entry. If they missed the last times bear then they still have a chance. They shouldn't missed this one because this may be the last bear we have before the rally begins.",

I mean if they had patience to hold this long, they most likely have patience for another year.Holding for that long indicates that they are still hoping for a better price with ETH and believe that its not over for ETH. We are still on a bear market, that’s why the market is still weak and personally I see this as an opportunity to buy though the chance of hitting the real bottom are more likely to happen in the first quarter of 2023, you can choose just to hold or try to increase your holdings, this is still ETH the top altcoin.",

But waiting to buy ethereum for $500-$700 is too long to happen because the price is still at $1.19x. Apart from that, we also don't know whether it is true that Ethereum will fall to that level or whether it will experience a reversal along with the movement of Bitcoin. Ethereum moves based on bitcoin's movement, although it won't always be. At least, that's what has been going on forever. And if that's what you want, it might be too late to buy ethereum and I suggest you do a DCA.",

We cannot project anything full clear but we can say that at least technical analysis wouod be great. In the last few months Bitcoin has been observed to be very weak, it is so difficult for Bitcoin to be able to stabilize prices.Therefore the cryptocurrency market is always shaky and difficult to survive because the prices of all crypto assets are driven or depend on the price of Bitcoin itself.So don't be surprised if ETH also experiences the same thing because indeed ETH is classified as one of the Altcoins whose price is also centered on bitcoin.But don't worry, in fact you can take advantage of this momentum to take large amounts of ETH at prices that tend to be cheaper.you only need to analyze the right position to be able to take ETH at the lowest price.",

We can't just value a particular coin base on the current situation or on its price but we value a project base on what is its role in the crypto market.

Both currencies are stable, while presenting a slight increasement in price, which may touch their resistance levels respectively, if the tendency continues smoothly on this direction.I don't see why ETH looks weak right now. It's behaving like bitcoin, and it doesn't mean bitcoin is weak at all. There isn't a real evidence to justify such claims. The week time period seems positive for ETH with a 2,35% increasement in price, but it still has to overcome some barriers to have a positive fluctuation in comparision with the monthly time period, which shows ETH with a - 6,05% negative oscillation.",
