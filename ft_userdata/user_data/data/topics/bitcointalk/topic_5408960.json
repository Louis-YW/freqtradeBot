Although this doesn't suggest that an appocalypse is upon us, but prices are indeed increasing and it will likely be like that for a while.You can check out this graph here so you can have a better picture of what iam saying: https://imgur.com/a/HaczCbz",

If you want to experience it then go to a place where inflation is high and go to a place where there's no development. Most probably we will not see the real situation in the supply chain, but as we can see the price is rising rapidly and that is the effect of many situation around the world. The shipment of many goods becomes slower and that is why some commodities rise in price. If there's another war that can affect the supply chain in the world, we can expect for the crisis to get worst. Have you heard the news about the situation in Sri Lanka? That's a big crisis.",

You may not yet be experiencing it, but it doesn't make it any less a reality to some others in other location and the fact that you are not experiencing it doesn't mean it hasn't started and won't get to you. When people complain about food crisis, you should get worried because it is a ripple effect and if people are experiencing shortages and your location has supply still, it  means your supply will soon be under pressure and it is under the danger of shortage.",

Prices will continue to rise till 2023, there seems to be no end to it. And yet you are posing stupid questions  A 10% increase in the cost of food is probably not much for those that are middle class, but for those that are poor it is a tragedy, and this is because they will have to either reduce the amount of food that they buy or they will have to decrease their expenditures elsewhere so they can afford the higher costs of food, in any case this is going to strain their budgets and if the price of food keeps increasing then most likely we are going to find ourselves facing a social crisis very soon.",

The country banned the use of fertilizer for thier crop so the farmers also stop planting. Maybe the crisis is still coming months to a year later as I heard farmers protesting though from the Netherlands to Italy farmers are doing the same. The farmers in the US are also displeased when Bill Gates is buying up all of their lands.",

If you are benevolent enough, visit some African countries and do charity work there. Go there and see. Don't just sit in a little well full of food without knowing what is happening outside. For me, food is very necessary and it makes me sadder when today the situation of poverty is wider. Of course, it does not affect me, but seeing someone without food is really not. This is a comfort. There's a lot to be said for this. When you're rich, learn to share more than brag about the little things that you think you're big on.",

These days most of these items are $3.99-$4.50. And it adds up when you do a weekly shopping list. Certain types of fruits are so expensive that I just don't buy them anymore. Milk and everything is very expensive.Sure there are no shortages but its expensive to buy food. So this has an affect on everything. People need to eat. And they cut down on everything else. So other businesses will suffer and its a feedback type of loop. Eventually we might get hit with layoffs and mass unemployment and it won't be pretty.",

The current food crisis has not affected all countries. This affected the underdeveloped countries more, and those who are largely dependent on imported products. Be glad you're all right. And if you want to know how it is to live with a food crisis, give up food at least for a while. What problems?",

Food crisis doesn't necessarily mean that we are no longer producing food; it's just that the cost of producing food products are heightened leading to high prices on these products. Inflation is spread everywhere around the world, and if you don't feel these effects, it's either you're out of touch with reality because you're extremely rich, or you choose to be ignorant on these pressing matters that a lot of people face.",

Mind you that when they say there is a food or hunger crisis, it does not mean that everyone in the world is suddenly hungry, it simply means that the number of hungry people prolly increased or the cost of buying food became higher and many people can't afford a sufficient quantity for themselves. Remember that due to the pandemic there was an increase in unemployment, coupled with increase in prices of commodities, now imagine people who were poor prior to the pandemic, surely things have grown worse for them.",
