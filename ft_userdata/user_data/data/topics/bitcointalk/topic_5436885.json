If you find anything else, it could raise a big red flag.I don't know why a legit team would use Stock and fake photos for their team member. They may keep it blank if one doesn't want to reveal their identity. But, Inserting a phony picture is a red flag.",

      "body": "Nice catch. To be honest, sometimes when we see an announcement thread we can not expect something good from the project. Once I visited the ann thread first time I understand that it's a random ann thread that is made by some unprofessional man/team. They don't even care about the ann thread and how it should be presented to the community. Even they don't care about the project. They just want if somehow they can arrange some funds from the fool investors. I am going to tag them.",

I am going to edit my post and include your findings as well. For some reason, reverse-image search was not able to find the other two (2) members as well. I guess these are overwhelmingly evidence that signifies that the ANN is indeed a scam. Having fake team members constitute fraud and their deliberate intention to defraud other people.With this finding, I will create a flag agains the user to alert other forum members in order to avoid this project at all cost. As always, thanks holy!Quote from: Saisher on January 26, 2023, 10:57:42 PMIf you don't mind, would you post on their ann thread to invite them here so they can properly give their defense... suppose they're legit. I doubt they will, though.Meanwhile, will also tag them.Yup, there is no way that an ANN thread can defend fake team members on their project. This is a deliberate attempt on their end to create a fake project to defraud investors with a quick rug and pull.I don't think they can defend this, they can defend plagiarism but stealing photos and claiming it to be part of the team is just impossible to defend, on plagiarism the most common alibi is they hire a writer to write a whitepaper for them but ended up copying other project's whitepaper, this is as good as we tag to be, scammers.A fake team is a big no, because the platforms and roadmap depend so much on the team's skills and background.",

Therefore, I advise anyone who wants to invest to do their research and not rush to make any decision.

If they are old ICO scammers, they wouldn't be stealing photos online since this is the easiest to spot due to google images. So many ICO in the past have been exposed because of having a fake team, but that's what scammers are doing for the past three years, the developers of this project obviously are not aware that they are easy to catch because there are many tools available online if they resort to stealing people's pictures.There are three warnings, plagiarism, fake team, and not working platform, if you're investing in ICO you have to learn how to flag projects by checking these three.",
