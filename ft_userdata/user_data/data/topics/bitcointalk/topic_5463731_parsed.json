  "content": "Failure The Game ChangerGrowing up the school traditional system taught us that failure is an end point. To make it worst, in class those with higher grade sit at the front then those with lower grade are back benchers.  so, we saw the hopelessness in failure not necessary understanding that it can be a tool to be used.knowing that reality is an incomplete narrative, I have taken little time to practically look at it. Those who we celebrate now have been once considered failures, some of them perpetual failures as a good example; Nikola Tesla, Edison, Ford etc. Again, those in reality who rose to wealth were once broke. Does this not make us to reconsider what we term Failure.Look at the Wall Street Billionaires to mention a few; Israel Englander, Charles Schwab, Antony Ressler, John Paulson, David Teppe, Stephen Schwarzman, Warren Buffet etc. All of them had experiences of failure and has lost millions and billions you can verify.My Reservation- A man who had not experience failure should not mentor you“Failure is the Power of Yet”It simply means you are not there yet or you have not gotten it yet or you are yet to become. The way to build success in the market is to understudy failure and used it as a tool. When you fail you learn the lesson and keep moving. When others fail you get the story and you consider your own ways.When you make mistake in analyses or interpreting news and event you learn from it and you continue. But always take step you can handle per time but be consistent. Note: You cannot be a profession Trader or a credible investor without the tool of failure. It is Written “For a righteous man will fall seven times, and rise again” (Proverb 24:16) – Holy Bible.Kindly Share Your take on this Subject.",

      "body": "Failure is a choice that's the bottom line, if you can not admit responsibility for failure and know that no one made you fail not your school, not your parents not your government yes they can be a factor in your life but the choice to fail was taken by you.I don't know where you are from but the sitting position is mostly done by height the smallest stays at the front while the biggest stays at the back or most times it's a Matter of choice and those back benchers made the choice to stay there and that's when the failure starts.To break failure you have to come out of your comfort zone and do things you normally feel lazy or tired to do, change your mentality and have a different approach to things.",

Kindly Share Your take on this Subject.Learning from your failure is a necessity in life, we become better from our mistakes. It’s easy for the brain to register patterns and learn to avoid making the same errors. In trading, I think what is more important is how we react to our failures because sometimes your trading plan or strategy may go wrong and you may lose money. Your sucess will depend entirely on how you control your psychology during these losses.",
