Just have it mind that featuring bitcoin on the site will bring 10x traffic and engagement on the site.Anyway, it's time for doing some marketing too. I am sure you planned for it already. However if you need someone to assist you in it then I can help on bitcointalk promotions. With a good strategy this forum could be a good asset for your business. There are many projects who started from this forum are now one of the leading in their industry.Good luck and welcome again.",

There is also an NFT market so that the platform you are promoting is not only for playing but betting on the NFTs that are already available there .",

Good luck with your stay in the forum and almost everything has been said to you about on how you'll increase your presence and exposure in the forum.It was a good combination though with the wording 'bet' on it, it comes completely good with anything that's connected to it and understandable that it's gambling however someone can also think of dessert.",
