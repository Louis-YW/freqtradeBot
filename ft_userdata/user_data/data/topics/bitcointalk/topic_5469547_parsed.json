So I want to make everyone use one or multiple of these services if they needed with advantagous prices. I'm buying them myself from my own bank card and I will gurantee any purchase with covering full refund.For now only accepted currency or platform to transfer money will be Cryptocurrency or Payoneer(Prices will be a bit higher if you choose this service).  Payoneer is alternative service for PayPal since PayPal is banned in my country. You can contact me through discord anytime in day. I will answer you as soon as possible.My discord ID   = keolthMy telegram ID = https://t.me/KeolthWhatsapp        = https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=905347331866Thanks everyone.",
