If exchanges like Binance do not allow you to trade derivative, that means it is not allowed in your country and you should not trade it.Derivative trading is also possible on decentralized exchanges like Pancakeswap and many of other decentralized exchanges like that.",

And those who will follow can work fully in that country. I hope you understand my point here. For example, Binance is not allowed to perform functions in the UK, but many other exchanges work there, and they can provide all of their services because they comply with their rules and regulations.Quote from: Hamza2424 on September 17, 2023, 03:36:00 PMI would recommend you go with the decentralized derivatives for trading in your region but it's not recommended if its Ban and still you want to proceed it will be called an illegal act and I don't want to provide any sort of assistance haha even though I'm telling you about the decentralized platforms haha it quite funny right but this information is for the educational perpouse only.That's good that you mentioned at the last and gave a disclaimer, As it would be good for the OP to understand the sensitivity of the matter. I hope OP will find some good platform to perform derivative trading from the following link:https://investingreviews.co.uk/guides/best-trading-platforms-uk",

Right now have many dapp exchange and looks not worry when Cex exchange have banned in your country because available for trading trough dapp exchange and convert to fiat or withdrawing to be cash trough several convert trusted service place. Many decentralized exchanges are supported for trading or swap coins there from Uniswap, Pancakeswap and right now many new network launching their dapp exchange for swapping coins. You can trade coins trough swap and not matter although CEX exchange banned or restricted there.",

If the case is that they ban your country IP, simply use a decent VPN, and that's pretty much it. The only reason to use custodial exchanges today is if you have high amounts of capital that requires a lot of liquidity.",

Still, I want to clarify I'm not getting specific with the platform I'm getting specific with the policy if the government imposes a policy on BAN trading there will be no official way even to trade. As far it comes to the UK they've changed most of their policies for the crypto market.I was able to quote the Bybit and Binance case here but I tried to answer in a general way as my post was regarding providing information in the specific times when government/state Bans. What type of alternatives are possible..Thanks for the appreciation for the Caution! as you can say its my style",

But anyway, the website is only the interface and its administrator can set their own regional restrictions. In such cases you can:1. Interact to smart contract directly if you have particular tech skills. 2. Just turn on the VPN.No one will freeze your funds on DEX due to regional restrictions so it should be safe no matter how you access the exchange. The only potential issue that in case the exchange gets hacked it may be harder to get legal support, but I'll assume this would not happen.",

If you use a service that explicitly states you can't use it if you live in the US or somewhere else, using a VPN is likely going to get you a ban.

The SEC fined some services as mentioned above because they believe those DEX services still need to follow regulations. Whether you agree or not, you still have that risk.

If it is staking, a user has to lock their coins in a staking pool that is owned by a DEX. Risk can appear there and that DEX can seize your staked coins.",

In other words, limited choices especially in US where US-okay platforms are already limited-- not counting obscure ones.In addition, from what I've seen, [established] exchanges often expect business/institutional accounts to trade a high amount of volume and they may ask corresponding documents. You'll know for sure when you ask your picked exchange.I'd probably place this approach at the last of my list.",

Even if you use a \"DEX\" to trade and never stake any tokens or coins, you still can't remove the risk that a service will be banned or stop operating because a government fines them or classifies them as an entity that manages financial activity. People should be aware of risks like that instead of gambling the chance that they won't get caught because they use a good VPN. VPN and other tools can help you increase your privacy, but not remove the risk that comes from using a centralized service even if you name them as DEX.",
