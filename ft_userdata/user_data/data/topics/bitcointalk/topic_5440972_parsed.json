You can also be whitelisted for free by any staff member and a few non-staff, but we're going to need some reason to think that you actually deserve it. Do not ask me for free whitelisting..",

After registering the account (Hi******ey), a notification was sent: \"(Hi******ey), you are banned from posting or sending personal messages on this forum.You have been permanently banned by a forum moderator, probably due to spam or plagiarism. You may appeal here, but your chances are not good: banappeals...@bitcointalk.org\".Please check what is the matter.looks like you have a banned account, then tried to create a new account but was restricted by evil IP. Next, you asked for whitelisting. I guess your flow is like this.About your banned account, reason is either spam or plagiarism or both of them. If it is spam, you can make ban appeal. If it is plagiarism, you can make it too but chance to be given a second chance for plagiarism is very slim.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 03:57:17 PMThere's been no policy change. redsn0w wasn't permanently banned due to several factors which made me think that permabanning him would be a net negative for the forum. Nobody is banned strictly because of \"the rules\"; it's always handled case-by-case, but almost always, plagiarists deserve to be permabanned.If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.Quote from: hilariousandco on November 17, 2016, 12:46:01 PMStaff do not want to hand out bans for unconstructive posts but if we feel that you as a user are continually making very poor or unsubstantial posts due to your paid signature the following bans will be issued:First offence: 7 daysSecond offence: 14 daysThird offence: 30 daysFourth: Permanent banYour first ban is your first warning. If you have to be banned for a fourth time it is permanent and you will no longer be allowed to participate on the forum under any accounts. Note: If you are banned on one account then you are not allowed to post under any accounts you own for the duration of your ban. The only exception to this rule is Meta where you can discuss the circumstances of your ban if you wish to do so but anywhere outside of that sub will be considered ban evasion and will get your ban doubled, but it is generally best to just patiently wait out your ban and improve your posts on return and hopefully no further bans will be needed.Warning: Anyone caught copying other users' posts or plagiarising content from elsewhere on the web will be immediately permabanned. You shouldn't need a warning to know that this isn't acceptable under any circumstances. If reason is spam, you should be banned a few times before, perhaps up to 3 times.If it is plagiarism, you can be banned immediately.Quote from: theymos on September 23, 2018, 08:58:25 PMPlagiarism: If you copy some text from somewhere, then you should have a good reason for it, and you must link to the source. Doing otherwise is plagiarism. Changing a few words around doesn't matter. If we find that you plagiarized, then you absolutely will be permanently banned, even if we find it years after you did it.",

      "body": "The  forum rules clearly states that plagiarism is prohibited. I think that could be the reason for your ban, you should reference your original account so the moderators can confirm if truly this was a case of plagiarism or mistake. Meanwhile you shouldnâ€™t post anywhere else aside from this thread, if you do it will be tagged as ban evasion. Good luck! Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PM25. Ban evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed. If you get banned (temporarily or permanently) and create a new account to continue posting / sending PMs, it's considered ban evasion. The only exception is creating a thread in Meta about your ban. 33. Posting plagiarized content is not allowed. This includes both copying parts or the entirety of other users' posts or threads and copying content from external sources (e.g. other websites) and passing it as your own.[e]",

You don't need no explanation other than that. You might as well check your post for the plagiarised content and be at peace with the judgement. Its a new account and that won't hurt so much for one who is comfortable operating an account farm.",

I think they're just the usernames that could potentially match what the original poster obfuscated. Again, I'm not sure why you'd censor the username if you want it to get unbanned.
