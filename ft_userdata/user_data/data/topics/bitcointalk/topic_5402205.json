I will continue to post, but until then the thread will remain closed.    https://imgur.com/NsuPlYq (Video of burnt equipment)    https://imgur.com/Vk8CKcH (Detailed animated 3D map)In addition, while you were arguing here, I visited Kyiv and did some useful things (but more on that later).Well, I can understand your anger. Now if you would only realize that some bad, bad leaders in the Ukraine are the cause of the war, and that by supporting them, you are doing it to yourself.Russia being blamed for locking up Ukrainian ports so grain cannot be shipped, but it’s actually Kyiv’s fault for dropping mines in the watersQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-10-russia-being-blamed-locking-up-ukrainian-ports-its-kyivs-fault.html#While it’s true that Russia did invade Ukraine after building up its forces for several months, not much else about the war there that we’re being told by Kyiv-friendly Western media is accurate.For instance, Russia is being blamed for ‘blocking Ukrainian grain shipments,’ thereby ‘worsening the food shortage around the world,’ but in fact, Russia has been working with the United Nations and anyone else who will listen to unblock the grain. Only, Kyiv isn’t cooperating.In fact, Ukraine has mined ports and harbors previously used for exports including grain, and Russia is in talks to try and get them de-mined so much-needed grain can begin flowing to the neediest parts of the world again.Zero Hedge notes:For days the United Nations has been in (so far unsuccessful) talks on cobbling together an agreement on plans to unblock Black Sea grain exports from Ukrainian ports, including controversial discussions with Russia, which has stood accused of ‘weaponizing’ global food supply with its military blockade of key ports. Moscow has in turn charged that Ukraine said ports, making tanker traffic impossible, while also saying the West must ease sanctions if it hopes to get crucial grain exports flowing again.UN officials have said President Vladimir Putin’s offer to lift the blockade if sanctions are dropped is “complicating” the already “fragile” negotiations. Washington has been watching with skepticism.“The bottom line is that, apart from leveraging overland routes, we need to get the ports back up and running so we can boost food supplies for those most in need,” a State Department spokesperson said in weekend comments.Earlier this week, Moscow reportedly reached an agreement with Turkey to build a de-mined “grain corridor” that provides safe passage for Ukrainian cargo ships hauling grain off of the Black Sea port of Odessa, under joint military escort.",

General Smedley Butler in 1935. He explained: “A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.”(Article by Ron Paul republished from RonPaulInstitute.org)Gen. Butler’s observation describes the US/NATO response to the Ukraine war perfectly.The propaganda continues to portray the war in Ukraine as that of an unprovoked Goliath out to decimate an innocent David unless we in the US and NATO contribute massive amounts of military equipment to Ukraine to defeat Russia. As is always the case with propaganda, this version of events is manipulated to bring an emotional response to the benefit of special interests.One group of special interests profiting massively on the war is the US military-industrial complex. Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes recently told a meeting of shareholders that, “Everything that ‘s being shipped into Ukraine today, of course, is coming out of stockpiles, either at DOD or from our NATO allies, and that’s all great news. Eventually we’ll have to replenish it and we will see a benefit to the business.”He wasn’t lying. Raytheon, along with Lockheed Martin and countless other weapons manufacturers are enjoying a windfall they have not seen in years. The US has committed more than three billion dollars in military aid to Ukraine. They call it aid, but it is actually corporate welfare: Washington sending billions to arms manufacturers for weapons sent overseas....",

Russians are getting US armament that they capture. And you people are getting destroyed homes and lands.The videos at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg60340101#msg60340101.The Ukraine is essentially lost.To save lives of their soldiers, as well as keeping their land and properties from being destroyed, they should surrender.Quote from: https://stephenlendman.org/2022/06/12/massive-ukrainian-battlefield-losses/Massive Ukrainian Battlefield LossesTime and again, indisputable reality has final say.The illusion of Ukrainian battlefield successes at any time since Russia’s SMO began was thoroughly debunked by independent truth-telling reports about reality on the ground.Even MSM reports are increasingly hard-pressed to ignore the inability of Ukraine’s greatly degraded military to hold on against vastly superior Russian firepower and tactical skills.Diverging from the fabricated official narrative, an exclusive London Independent (LI) report explained the following:Citing Western and Kiev intelligence reports about reality on the ground, LI said “Ukrainian troops are suffering massive losses as they are outgunned 20 to one in artillery and 40 to one in ammunition by Russian forces.”They’re unable to respond effectively against relentless precicion Russian shelling and missile strikes.Kiev’s artillery has a range of up to “25 km” — compared to “12 times that distance” by long-range Russian salvos.So while the majority of its forces can’t be struck by Ukrainian shelling — and its missiles can be destroyed by Russia’s air defense systems — Kiev troops are cannon fodder.Along with large numbers of Ukrainian casualties daily, “desertions are growing every week,” LI reported.Russian advances are unstoppable.Its Donbass offensive is “fierce,” said LI, adding:“Reporting on the ground backs up claims of rising Ukrainian losses due to Russian firepower.”LI “last week witnessed losses being inflicted on the Ukrainian military and the lack of long-range firepower to fight back.”An intelligence report states: “It is plain that a conventional war cannot be won if your side has several times fewer weapons, your weapons hit the (other side) at a shorter distance, and you have significantly less ammunition.” “The tactical situation on the Eastern front is as follows.”“The Ukrainian side has almost completely run out of stocks of missiles for MLRS of Smerch and Uragan types.” “Today, the maximum range of fire of” Ukrainian forces is 15.5 miles.“This is the range at which 152/155mm calibre artillery and the Grad MLRS units remaining in service can fire.”“At the same time, (Russian) strikes at concentrations of Ukrainian forces from a distance of (186 miles) with Iskander tactical ballistic missiles, (43 to 50 miles) using Smerch MLRS and Tochka-U (missiles), and from (25 to 37 miles) using MLRS Uragan.”...",

That ought ta work!  https://www.bitchute.com/video/t2qa2FFOMgeJ/(I don't speak the language and there are not sub-titles so I don't know if the title is accurate or a sham, but it is pretty much exactly what I would expect out of the mouth of this freak.)I don't think that the guy (or whatever it is) is on Ukraine's side.  But then I don't think that any of the other leadership is either.  The Ukrainian people are basically friend-less at an international level and an internal level, and will likely remain that way from years to come unless they just throw in the towel and partition the place voluntarily and fully.  Just put another chalk mark in the win column for 'the tribe' with a foot-note crediting this one to the fine work of Vicky Nudelman-Kagan.",
