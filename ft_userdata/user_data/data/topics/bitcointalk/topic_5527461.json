We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Withdrawals will be restored soon.Phemex and the development team apologize for the disruption. Our mission to provide a seamless and trusted trading environment remains firm. We are working on a compensation plan, which will be announced soon. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.Our ongoing business operations are fine. Trading services continue as usual.According to arkham intelligence, their assets are 4x times higher than coinmarketcap, it should be enough to recover the losses.",

Looking at their proof of reserves, looks like they'd be able to compensate folks in full. Let's just hope whole process will be smooth.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/phemex-exchange-sees-29-m-suspicious-crypto-outflowsPhemex crypto exchange halted withdrawals after being alerted to nearly $30 million worth of suspicious outflows that raised alarms among blockchain security firms.It's interesting that while reading articles about this. I come to know that aside from proof of reserves, they apparently have proof of solvency as well that covers their liabilities. Haven't looked into it thoroughly though. I'm assuming such information is nestled in their own proof of reserves page that I need to be logged in first.",

Footing the information provided by the current CEO.In the meantime, I hope the exchange users get their correct amount of crypto back.That would explain why they were withdrawing shitcoins. Most likely some holes in protocols that were exploited. I knew a guy who was running an exchange in my country and he once told me that one of the biggest security risks is adding new shitcoins because each of them requires separate wallet software that you have to maintain and update. For this reason many cheaper coins were being merged together and held on the same online machine. It was too much of a hassle to keep every single coin in cold storage, especially if you were dealing with coins with combined deposits worth less than 0,1 % of total assets.BTC was probably in cold wallet and the hackers were able to siphon out some cheap altcoins. Some of the listed coins have total 24h volume of less than 10m USD and value moved off exchange of just $10k.",

The support team chat bot app has also been edited to not close out survey as they prevent clients from resubmitting new tickets via the app who are more than likely just checking on their deposits/withdrawals.Instead of doing the right thing and that is refund those effected during the hack” and suspension, they rather remove the wallets you have balances so that you don’t realize they are running with your funds.Getting hack is a pain in the but, but publicly promoting to your clients of backed funding for insurances while suspending withdrawals and not crediting deposits always in the fall sign of a exit scam in affect.Sorry to say this.
