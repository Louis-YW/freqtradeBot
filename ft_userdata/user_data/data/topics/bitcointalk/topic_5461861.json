In this year's Mining Disrupt Conference which happened a few days back (25th-27th July). They made an appearance there and were one of the exhibitors.According to the tweets I came across, they even gave some experts some mining gear to test and try out.Still too early to judge.https://twitter.com/MiningDisrupt",

There is no way they will have that up on their official Bitmain website and it's fake, next hope they reply soon, I will keep an eye on this topic.",

Are you saying very limited numbers of this new Asic will be created? Big boys always get their hands on every brand new Asic miners but the more it's in production it will reach those who are small boys in the mining space, unless this Asics are going to be limited in number which will sucks really bad, well like you've said, lets wait and see.",

The first batch was all sold out, it was only 1000 miners, the next batch won't be available before 4 months according to my guy, the price tag is $25-27/th depending on the quantity, these miners run a lot cooler and quieter than their rivals, given that the company is still new and small, I doubt they would be able to make a lot of them, so getting them would be difficult.Thecoindad sent me another video of him testing the miner on normal mode, I uploaded it here > https://easyupload.io/7oi5xa , link expires in 30 days so if someone wants to be nice and upload it somewhere else would be great.He sent me another video showing the high-power mode as well, the miner does 197th and uses roughly 5kw while running cool without errors, I can upload that if someone is interested.below is an image showing the built-in screen",

Isn't this industrial espionage if the chips are identical in configuration?",
