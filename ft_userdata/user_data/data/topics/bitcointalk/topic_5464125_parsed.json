      "body": "I agree with @Apocollapse above. There's really not much that can be done since many projects are already created. Actually, they just keep on recycling all those projects that were made during the ICO hype. As long as something can prove his reputation, will not end up as a scam coin, and is backed by an item that can be prove worthy then I guess it's a good-to-go feature. We don't need those coins that create too much hype by just using the name of another coin or a popular person like a billionaire. They will all just end up either dust, a scam, or a rug pull project.",

Most of the features we would have needed we got them in Bitcoin, Then when you mention privacy coins and coins that have speedy transactions and low fees coins such as LTC, xlm, and xrp are available. The bottom line is that we have had more than enough coins existing today, Instead of bringing more coins, improvement should be done on already existing ones or projects.",

The main task of an altcoin developer is to convince you to buy his coins, and he will convince you in various ways. Someone emphasizes privacy, someone emphasizes development, someone emphasizes scalability, etc. For the most part, the bulk of investors do not need all these features and developments, with rare exceptions. 99% of altcoin investors are interested in how fast an altcoin will grow so that they can sell it profitably.",

I knew there are some like nansen and arkham. The only problem if these tools were not free especially nansen. I need to pay a lot of money to subscribe it. It will be good if i will able to use a similar platform that is offering free service. I will not put blockchain as my primary concern as we have so many feeless blockchain. I would prefer to focus into the something that will be beneficial not only for investors but for traders too. It will be so good to have a similar platform like nansen but it's free.
