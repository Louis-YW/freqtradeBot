  "content": "Due to fake reviews, it is difficult to choose which is the real website and which is the bad website. They want to confuse users with fake 5 stars on platforms like Trustpilot. We can't overlook the OP as a newbie account, because those who offer such services will definitely contact with the OP and continue their activities.Profile : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3533118Thread Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5438123.0Archive: https://archive.is/MSUiJ",

Assuming I am looking for an exchange, I can check Trustpilot, but that is not the end, I will still check sites like Coingecko and also check online to know if the site is good or not. Reviews are helpful at times, but we should not fully depend on it because some are just fake. There are many things to consider while researching about a site. You can even check how old the site is and also asking on this forum if the site is good or not.",

There are a lot who are not going to leave a true review in most cases, they just want to get paid. Not everyone is that way, but it's hard to believe anything you read on trustpilot. I'd rather see how a company represents themselves and their business on the forum and decide whether their behavior warrants me visiting their site.",

If the website is open source, you can verify the codes and if you don't know how to, check on the GitHub channel. If it's closed source, check the date the website was created and check for scam discussions around it on different platforms.

I know Trustpilot disallow to create multiple accounts and they might ask KYC in the future, but they have a rule to not allow fake review, of course they have no way to verify this if the case isn't big and they're not aware if the site is clearly scam.Although it's not wrong to leave tag and flag to this account, but he has nothing to lose anyway.",

Stop making such a bullshit comment. The business is all about honesty and legitimacy. You don't have to buy reviews if your business is legit. You don't have to jump. Be patient, and you will get the trust of users slowly. If you are a scammer, the words are not for you. The thief never listens to regional quotes. A long ago, Duckdie was accused of buying fake reviews. Then they stopped. Right now, 1xbit is buying fake reviews and paying TrustPilot to remove negative reviews.",

I don't know if there is another social media platform where this tagged user  can ask for review why he choose this forum for creating fake review . Maybe this forum users are more related to crypto and their review is valuable. This users is smart enough that he used new account for this purpose because he knew the results. QuoteCome on, he can just create multiple accounts and create fake reviews about his site without need to pay $5 to each review I think there will some IP tracing or something else this user cannot create multiple review. He claiming that his sale has been Raised 400% after fake review. Maybe some users contacted him through PM. My question is how can we report Trustpilot to remove these fake reviews ?",
