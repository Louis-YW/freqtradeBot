A spot ETF will attract large capital to the market, with which they will buy bitcoins, so the old manipulator will lose its influence in this market.

Look at the chart of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Very characteristic candles. A rapid rise in the price of a coin or a rapid fall in price. If there is a rise or fall of 50%, all margin positions from x2 and above are liquidated. This is how hamsters are usually cut.If you are interested in my opinion about the SEC, then certain agreements are always present. For example, the SEC does not pursue Ethereum despite the ICO. How did the FTX exchange appear? Binance specialists helped when they had problems with SEC in the USA. This could all be a coincidence of course",

Someone who has a lot of bitcoins from the early years, if a lot of money comes in to buy Bitcoin for the ETF, what they are going to be is richer. Besides that in the early years it was much easier to get them, even mining with a laptop and cheaper. If someone had, for example, 200,000 Bitcoins from the early years, Saylor with all the money he has spent, several billions of dollars, would still not have as many Bitcoins as him (Saylor has personally 17,732 and MSTR 152,800).I don't know what the current holders of large amounts of early bitcoins will think, but if I were one, I would want a lot of money coming into the market.",
