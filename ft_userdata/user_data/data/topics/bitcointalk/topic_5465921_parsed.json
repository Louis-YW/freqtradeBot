For sure.  We will evaluate it, discuss it after (hopefully successful) conclusion of our project deal and see which lessons we can draw from it.

Or if we will get a close call, that it turns out to be in our favor.  Well, even a close call should be pretty unlikely.",

As mentioned in our description it's about a special deal, where real Bitcoin is involved. Regarding the subject matter you probably know cryptofrka's and Trofo's famous ⭐⚽⭐ Sportsbet's Bitcointalk Sports Fanatics League (BSFL) – 7000+$ rewards ⭐⚽⭐. Trofo and cryptofrka really deserve some credit for their effort. And our deal is different but based on sports as well. That's why buwaytress and slaman29 are involved here. They are two sports specialists and know a lot about that issue.",

I've allowed to link your Sportsbet's Bitcointalk Sports Fanatics League (BSFL) topic here, so maybe you can get some more new participants. Unfortunately I don't have enough time for it.  But I really like your dedication for BSFL.  +1",

Looking forward to seeing what it is all about.From our discussion here, our topic seems to be quite exciting but I don’t want to raise too high expectations because it's really just a very trivial special deal, so having too high expectations might result in a disappointment because it's indeed very trivial.  Our topic is just a place to write down all important details to be set for starting.",
