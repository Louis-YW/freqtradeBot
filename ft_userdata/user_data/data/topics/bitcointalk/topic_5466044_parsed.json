  "content": "Hi guys,Need some help with my recent transaction. After swapping some bnb for a token, the balance appeared for a short period of time in my wallet but then it started showing it as if I have 0 of that token.The transaction can be seen here https://bscscan.com/tx/0x25e599bc4813e195fa9f6252af987f482f9ae6a25265b83a7cad8a7f962cb000Also if I check my wallet assets on the blockchain I can see my tokens: https://bscscan.com/token/0xf7b4feb2d25975fff347ad6ccf5be5ba16ee35a8?a=0x925768bB59f8b3E36897eC870cdf4788BA18f527Tried metamask, coinbase and couple of more wallets, they all show 0 balance for the token. Again the balance was showing correctly for a few seconds before going to 0.Am I doing something wrong or is it some kind of scam. I can see other people being able to sell their tokensThanks",

I even went ahead on saving and importing your address as watch only on my wallet and added the token through custom add still the same thing..

I would suggest uninstalling the MetaMask extension and then reinstalling it, ensuring that you clear your cache as well. I hope this resolves the problem.",

Thanks for looking into it!!!MetaMask wallet supports ethereum blockchain by default and you need to add BSC Network. https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chainBut how token appeared for several minutes and then disappeared, if this is true, I think your problem is Display Tokens in Metamask, where the balance is supposed to appear without the information, this link may help you a little https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask",

Thanks for looking into it!!!Let's ignore whatever your wallet is displaying for a second. You said you used Pancakeswap and KyberSwap to buy the token, what happens if you try to sell it? Does one of these two exchanges display the funds to you? They should regardless of what your MetaMask is showing. If not, then it must be something related to the token itself.",

Try to reinstall Metamask and then restore your wallet, if the problem still occurs, it's a good idea to try it on another device that you have. Also, don't forget to try displaying your $GIRL balance on the relevant network, you might miss some things.",
