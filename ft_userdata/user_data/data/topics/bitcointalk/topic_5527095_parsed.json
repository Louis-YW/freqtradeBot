  "content": "So after Trump pretty famously rug-pulled all his Trump memecoin holders as his first official \"day 1\" act as the 47th president (surprise!), now people are guilty of saying the usual about crypto - that it's useless, that's it's a scam, waste of energy, etc.Now whether you like Trump or not, you're still a Bitcoiner, right? So here is where things get interesting.Over here is one of the many Reddit threads where people are having a meltdown over crypto:https://old.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1i5oivg/we_failed/However, this one is different, because it has many comments saying things like: \"Bitcoin is the least interesting thing you can do with Block Chain.\"Of course whenever someone big uses crypto to scam people, there will always be things like this, but to say something like currency being the least useful thing you can do with blockchain is absurd.Blockchain is the storage of money and other valuable stuff.Without currency, there is no blockchain.Medical records and voting slips aren't valuable and can just be stored in a distributed database. They either have no need for cryptographic verification or are impossible to implement in a decentralized and secure manner (elections, for obvious reasons)When you see stuff like this after someone does something really bad with crypto, do not let it blind you to its benefits. It's like looking at Tiktok and deciding that all social media is bad, even though you probably wouldn't be reading this topic on this forum today without it.",

I even like the narrative that Bitcoin is \"boring\", meaning that it is stable and does not have too many large oscillations. I would leave the interestingness to meme tokens, in the end, I guess that's their only purpose.",

      "body": "First and foremost I don't really fancy the idea of coining being a bitcoiner to being a trump lover or trump supporter. Similarly it's not true that all trump supporters are bitcoiners. The fact is there are always profit minded schemesÂ  to many big and economic moves made. Take for example the group of people that were initially bitcoiners but came to like the trump movement because of the support that pushed bitcoin to a 100k +.As we all know meme coins are majorly just a preplanned scheme to generate liquidity for those that are able to take advantage of it. This simply means it's totally safe to say that the whole trump coin hype was totally profit minded.",

For example EU seems to use EBSI (you may want to translate and read that topic for context, shortly, Romanian vote counting was delivered from voting centers via ETH blockchain)Quote from: Rizzrack on December 17, 2024, 10:20:05 PMhttps://hub.ebsi.eu/blockchainQuote from: https://hub.ebsi.eu/blockchainHyperledger Besu is an enterprise-friendly Ethereum client suitable for both public and private permissioned blockchain network use cases. It is also EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible, which signifies that EBSI can support the deployment of smart contracts written in Solidity, executable by the EVM in a decentralised manner.Quote from: NotATether on January 20, 2025, 03:09:25 PMWithout currency, there is no blockchain.Private blockchains can be interesting even if they don't hold money. Private smart contracts on public blockchains can be even more interesting.Public blockchains, yes, you're right, need to pay for the PoW hence they need to hold money/block rewards.",

You got it. This is the feature of memecoin. Everyone already know this including those who adviced Trump to create one. They made money and that is it. Memecoin can never have any value or compete with bitcoin. I read people writing articles that Trump coin will rival bitcoin. They knew all that was BS but wanted people to visit their website because of the trending topic.",

The price is still 6x-8x from where the index listed it/picked it up, let alone the 100's of multiples above where it started, which any of those who were paying attention could have also captured? I'm seeing consistently \"oh he rugged them he rugged them\" - why, because it is not holding at peak price? In terms of the thread, TBH maybe I'm in different circles, though bitcoin really doesn't have an image problem around my online and offline circles anymore. There's no doubt whether it will stick around and its volatility is understood...maybe that's just because I and others who understand are also in these circles...Where are you hearing the Trump token price = \"crypto is a scam\" when it goes down sentiment? Online, offline?",
