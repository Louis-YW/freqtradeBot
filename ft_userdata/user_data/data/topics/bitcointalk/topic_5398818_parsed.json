If your goal is to have a currency that can be used as a store of value, the coins mentioned by the RussianEnglishTranslation brothers could be an option.",

It sounds crazy, but I don't see any Stablecoin that has been running using the Stellar Blockchain! On the other aspect, the transaction fees and the transaction speed are also important factors and the Stellar Network is undeniably one of the cheapest and fastest in the industry that's why for me it was attractive.",

      "body": "I will be using ethereum or another first layer blockchain that fully decentralized. yeah solana was getting shutdown so many times, luna dumped so hard and it's ecosystem may be dead soon. That's why i will always try to pick scalable and most decentralized blockchain. The scalable blockchain will be used as a way to avoid the huge fees but the decentralized blockchain will become the main house to hodl the majority of stable tokens. I will not try to risky by using the bad reputation blockchain like solana and luna ecosystem. both were horrible blockchains at this moment. The main concern must be decentralized and scalability",

On the other hand this stable coin if we go that route it’s not something the average person will have access to purchase you have to live in this community in order to buy it. Now because it’s very limited as far as who can get this token it doesn’t make sense to list it on an exchange as it would be a private community token correct?",

Local bank money with application. If you will not open it in the world, there might be an economic breakdown in your place. This is like playing house or a board game like monopoly or chips from a gambling den. So what if you go places and you only have your QR code in you? How are you going to spend it? It is unknown to the world.What will the stablecoin you are trying to make be backed with to have value?",

The main concern should be on the security, scalability and stable token mechanism. This will determine whether my stable asset can peg to make the price stable or not.
