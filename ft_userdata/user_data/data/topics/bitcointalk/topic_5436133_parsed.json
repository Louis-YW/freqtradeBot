AFAIK wasabiwallet is not compatible with Electrum Personal Server but its a good solution for TOR, anyway Samourai Wallet should work.",

Tor can connect with enabled app like Electrum on computer, unlike mobile phones that it is just a browser.",

      "body": "Electrum mobile only has 2 options to connect Electrum to the server Socks4 and socks5 is the only option where you can hide your Electrum wallet to connect to a custom server. However, you can make your own electrum server locally with hidden tor service and connect your Electrum mobile directly to your server by typing it manually in network settings just make sure to disable multiple connections and enable the one server only. Additional privacy option while connecting to your Tor Electrum server you can configure your proxy to socks5.",

It has no push notifications whatsoever and I roughly checked their codebase which looked good in this regard as well.",

I did not think about it, thanks!Orbot acts as a VPN for all the connections, but I may live with it, as long as it allows BlueWallet to connect to the given server.On the other hand, after I reinstalled BlueWallet integrated TOR seems to start and work correctly almost always. But it is good to have a Plan B.",
