Which is why they have a porn industry where it will be properly controlled and practice maybe most of them are being license which they have some percentage to remits to the government such is also applicable to money lenders.",

      "body": "If it's truly a capitalistic economy, then usually usury would be stomped out by the competition undercutting the high rates of which ever lender. If the market is free, competitive, and fair, then it shouldn't be a problem. Greed isn't a capitalism problem, it's a human morality problem. I wouldn't expect capitalism to be perfect, because predatory lending agencies exist -- though capitalism can make things more fair for the consumer because there's alternatives.",

The height of competitiveness and capital accumulation it brings has incentivised business efficiency and growth. It might have tampered with the morals of todays society but to a larger extent it has improved the standard of living in the modern era.Usury is part of capitalist society, its moral justification might be worthless but the honest truth is that to fit into the society without engaging in criminal act or money laundry Usury might just be one of the options. But come to think of it even the borrower no one know their intent when taking the loan. They too can ignite inflation in their own business. Majority of people in the capitalist society are guilty of the same act. The immoral living is not in Usurers alone even the local business vendors are guilty of the same act just that each does their differently.",

      "body": "Quote from: Dzigie on March 25, 2023, 01:15:52 PMUsury is an immoral profession in almost every society.I don't agree with that premise. Interest-free lending is charity because the lender is giving away the benefits of what they are lending. So, a lender is immoral if they are not charitable, and charity is therefore not a virtue because it is simply the selfish avoidance of immorality.In my own case, I loan money to people who are drowning in debt. I give them a chance to get their finances back in order and pay off their debt. I do this primarily because I think it is a benefit to society, but I also charge interest on the loans. Charging interest is necessary because many of the people I help do not pay me back. Without interest, the lending could not be sustainable. Also, I could instead charge a fee for my help based on the size of the loan, but isn't that really what interest is?Quote from: Dzigie on March 25, 2023, 01:15:52 PMDo you think moral concepts are being killed by capitalist imposing laws who want to make more money?A transaction involves two people. Why is only one of them being immoral when both are making the transaction? If charging interest is immoral then being willing to pay interest is immoral. If charging for sex is immoral, then being willing to pay for sex is immoral. You say that the people making money are immoral, but the people wanting services must also be immoral.",

These industries serve people, albeit somewhat challenging morality of a lot of people too. Whatever the cases is, so long as a large portion benefits, it will be approved or legalized no matter what. I don't know about porn though, because it is illegal here.

There are many things that were considered immoral in the past but are now part of our lives.These moral values you're talking about have been killed by the capitalists who have taken over the governments and made them make laws that make these things legal, without the capitalists controlling the government they can't pass these laws in society.But even a society that rejected such things as immoral in the past, today gladly accepts them because they have brought prosperity and wealth to the people.",

It's the social norms that change with time. Your examples don't show \"capitalism destroying morality\", it shows that religious morality is weakening in some parts of the world. Capitalism just makes use of the new opportunities.But a new kind of morality is also being established. What some people call \"wokeness\" and \"cancel culture\" is just a modern secular morality based on ideas of tolerance and defending those who are perceived to be oppressed. So large companies cut ties with those who publicly make hateful remarks towards certain groups, even if it means that the company will immediately lose revenue, because not doing this could cause even larger revenue loss due to reputation losses. But 30 years ago they weren't doing any of that because society had different morals.",

Even in socialist economies, these two professions exist and they are as old as man. Capitalism has its merits and demerits. One of its most profound advantages is that it promotes competition which reduces exploitation by monopolists. While it's demerit is that some capitalists pursue excess profit when they have the opportunity without considering the plight of the masses.Capitalism is not killing morality but morality is dying because of greed and selfishness. Even in the so-called socialist societies we still see corrupt leaders embezzling the perceived commonwealth,  while the people live in poverty. Collecting loans from banks with interest is not wrong because it could be used to start or expand a profitable business. Porn is technologically advanced prostitution created because of the advancement of science and technology and not capitalism.",

Society developed, and the same could be said with societal norms. I'd agree in some sense that capitalism has changed our and society's mindset to what it is now,  but the same could be said for anything else really. It's not the sole factor involved.

In my country it's legal too and is nothing evil, because it gives better protection for the workers. If something is illegal it doesn't mean people won't do it, it's just that it will be hidden from the law. Capitalism isn't really at fault here because it has been around much longer than we have capitalism. Same goes for banking, the concept of borrowing and lending money has been around for hundreds of years. It's much older than capitalism and we can't blame it for all the evil.
