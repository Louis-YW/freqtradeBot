If so we might have only few hours outages...if not then its serious",

      "body": "Are you seriously expecting that in the middle of a NUCLEAR ATTACK the Stock Market is still running and booming?  Seriously.  Just think about it.  If a nuke exploded in the middle of the United States, there are SO MANY things to prioritize before even thinking about money and assets!  Because first and foremost, as soon as US gets nuked, the greatest asset you will have under immense risk is your life!You are afraid the market will crash if US gets nuked?  The market will crash with or without NYSE going down.  That is pure common sense.  If a nuclear war erupts, nobody is going to care about hyping Doge Coin, Bitcoin or Gold.  Look at the market charts back when the war began between Russia and Ukraine and remember there were no black outs at the time.  You will get a very small glimpse of what would happen to the markets if a nuclear war erupts.But back to your question, to be completely honest with you, I do not have high expectations when it comes to institutions doing backups and all of that.  I have no expectations when it comes to them saving me because if we ever get to live the hard times, we will most likely be solely on our own.  The US likely has backups of everything in extremely secure areas such as underground servers and as franky1 interestingly pointed out, one website's black out does not necessarily mean the website and all its data base are forever gone IF the website was backed up in multiple areas around the world.  And since most websites are nowadays running on Amazon Web's Services, I would imagine many of them will be easy to restore.  The problem is how do you ensure full functionality of a website if the website owner's headquarters get fully wrecked and turned into dust by a full out nuke war.I imagine that, before a nuke actually happens, there are less life threatening events that could happen and put Bitcoin under risk.  For example, cyber attacks.  Internet wise, these might be able to do more damage than a nuke would if the hacker(s) get to launch a full scale cyber attack which could possibly even turn off the Internet at a national scale in smaller countries.  Maybe even US, but I imagine the internet United States has does not have just one single point of failure.-Regards,PrivacyG",

You're talking about data and exchanges then they'll be the one to suffer if that scenario comes. But if you're talking about the whole blockchain and crypto market to be stopped?I don't think so that it'll stop. Btc transactions will stop because of it? No. Because miners are everywhere.It's going to keep going and as shown by franky, there are too many cloud servers and data centers that are in many parts of the world.",

      "body": "If someone nukes the U.S do you think you can still sit here and comfortably trade on the market? Maybe think about what would happen after someone nukes the U.S first, and what their allies would have to do. The world is not an isolated place, 1 nuke will affect the whole world, as it would mean everyone starts nuking each other. If you’re in some isolated place where it won’t matter, then it’s a place where markets don’t matter too. Also Bitcoin is a worldwide Peer-to-Peer network, it’s not exclusively run by data centers. In a post apocalyptic world money won’t matter in the first place, it will be about survival and finding resources. So don’t even get the idea that some apocalyptic events would smh play into your favour.",
