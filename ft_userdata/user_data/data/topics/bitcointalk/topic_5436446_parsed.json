  "content": "Fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain. Fraud and fraudulent activities can be found in every spheres of life. In the online casinos and betting there are common frauds that are perpetrated by criminals in the guise of gambling. They include:1. Bonus AbuseBonus abuse is the practice of joining up for a service repeatedly using promotional offers that are typically only available to new members. There are various terms are used to describe it, such as bonus abuse, casino whoring, bonus hunting, and promo abuse. This practice, known as multi-accounting in the fraud world, frequently targets no-deposit bonuses like free spins or free money. It mostly affects poker, casino, and sports betting websites, but any business that leverages signup bonuses as a marketing strategy may be at risk.The problem is that fraudsters attempt to create as many new accounts as possible, relying on stolen IDs, resulting in synthetic identity fraud and prepaid credit card details to bypass the Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. More sophisticated criminals can also have the resources to use emulators, virtual machines, and even residential-like IPs, such as Socks5 proxies or mobile networks to leverage fresh IP addresses.2. CollusionThe use of numerous accounts by one person or a group of individuals who work together to influence a particular outcome is known as collusion. The most popular target of collusion schemes is online poker. Players occasionally open new accounts to restart from scratch. A poker tournament's big pot may potentially be won through collusion. However, it can also happen in other card games such as Blackjack. Sometimes, players collude to commit bonus fraud.Players might even engage in self-collusion by creating many accounts and then use one account to win over another. For example, two players register and make a $500 deposit to receive a $50 signup bonus. They can lose to each other until they reach the rollover requirements. Upon meeting the conditions, both players can cash out, and each walks away $50 richer.3. Chip DumpingChip dumping is the act of purposefully losing chips to another player at the table. It's something that thieves have been known to use in an effort to launder money they have acquired illegally. They believe that if they lose all of their money to a different poker account that they already own, that the original source of the funds might be lost. They hire individuals to gamble online and lose to a single person. Once that person cashes out, the money will appear as legally earned. It is a form of collusion4. ImpersonationImpersonation is when a player acts on behalf of somebody in a nonconsensual manner. They do that using stolen accounts. Moreover, fraudsters would look for proxy servers using SOCKS5 VPN and RDPs. There, they can conduct impersonation and other fraudulent activities. Impersonation can also happen with consent, like in an affiliation scheme. An experienced player uses an account to play on behalf of a newbie. They will enjoy their perks and fraud online gambling sites for profit percentages. 5. Credit Card FraudAt gambling websites, it is very typical to see thieves using stolen credit cards. If they can get the card to work, they can quickly and easily cash out. Cybercriminals can use a stolen credit card to top up an online casino account. From there, they can withdraw in cryptocurrency.6. Chargeback FraudAlso known as friendly fraud, this is when a legitimate customer files a chargeback under false pretenses to get their money back. It happens rather frequently in online gambling, when a person who just lost a lot of money might phone their bank, say that their card was used without their knowledge, and then get their gabling losses refunded. Gambling establishments may counter the onslaughts. However, if they receive too many chargebacks, it could result in damaging their relationship with card providers. Being unable to support payments from a major card issuer can basically cost them their business. More often than not, just swallowing the loss is more practical than fighting it.Note that - Collusion, bonus abuse and chip dumping are subcategories of Multiple account fraud.That's all for now. Thank you for reading.What other common or uncommon type of online gambling fraud have you noticed?",

From there, they can withdraw in cryptocurrency.That is why it is good to protect your phone against sim swap attack, if OTP is not received, the scam will not be successful. But the most important thing is to protect your card pin, if protected and not known to scammers, they will not be able to withdraw from your bank. In my country, this type of scam is common, the scammer will call you, doing as if they are from your bank, ask you about an OTP sent to your phone or asking about your pin. There are some that do not require pin, but do not give scammer OTP sent to your phone, even do not bother to talk with them at all.",

The collusion and other abuse that categorized under multiple account is next to the bonus abused for the most common issue here. Looking on the scam accusation board that related on casino shows that most of the user that reporting case are those who abuse the casino bonus and using the forum to get support and play victim.The charge back abuse is new to me. This is really prone to abuse if casino allows card provider to charge back their customer loss.",

I actually wouldn't consider this as one in case of gambling, most casinos ask for KYC anyway and they ask for really active/recent ones, so most imposters would easily get caught. If this was the case of impersonating someone to scam someone though, then that's a different thing. Quote from: alastantiger on January 23, 2023, 09:43:03 AMWhat other common or uncommon type of online gambling fraud have you noticed?The usual bug abuse if they can find one. I consider it a type of fraud since whoever found out about it is intentionally using it for their own personal benefit. I'd probably let them go if it was once since it may have been an accident, any more than that and it's intentional imo. Match fixing as others have pointed out as well also counts as one, even if it was sports. Whether the fixing was due to a gamble behind it or just because the teams want to advance selfishly, it'd still damage people who bet on said matches.",

There are platforms don't need to play just hit the minimum amount to withdraw which they do is deposit and withdraw, other also you need to play like 5 rolls before can withdraw which they do it. It was easy money for them but right now it is not possible due to KYC and they can easily detect you.",

I think if the casino has a good enough team, if they know a bug has occurred, they will immediately make improvements and improvements.But the average gambler doesn't want to report this because they can take advantage of it by playing in a game where bugs are happening for the purpose of getting big easy profits so that in the end the casino is the one who loses.So I don't think it's possible for a casino to intentionally carry out or make one of their games bug.",

Thank you for reading.What other common or uncommon type of online gambling fraud have you noticed?Bonus abuse is probably the most used method by many gamblers to commit fraud in casinos because its easy to get away with, especially in casinos with faucets and giveaways, unless the casino is good at tracing this kind of abuse abusers can always get away with it, that is why we have seen so many gamblers after winning huge amount of money they cannot withdraw their earnings because they are caught multi-accounting when it's stated in their terms that they will not allow that.Abuse and fraud is very rampant in the industry its one of the main problem why casinos are going down.",

They may not instantly punish the perpetrators but they're sure to limit those accounts involved in the said scheme. Way better than banning them really, because those perpetrators will have an idea that the casino has the ability to detect such schemes and punish them silently for it.",
