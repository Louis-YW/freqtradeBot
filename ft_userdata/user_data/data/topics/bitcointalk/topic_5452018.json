I feel like another wave of mining frenzy is coming. Time to blow dust off your ancient miners and get back to business! Ordinals appear to be a blessing for miners and an issue for everybody else.",

When I went to mempool to look at some the recently mined blocks, there are several with 11 or 12 BTC in it.Isn't the blocks supposed to only be 6.25 BTC right now?It will actually stay at 6.25btc in its mining block reward. We know that a mempool is a collection of all transaction makers that have not yet been included in a block. And the mempool also contains transactions that have been submitted to the network but are not caught. Or it can also be mined transactionally but not yet distributed to all nodes in the network.     That's why if your mining pool saw 3 blocks of more than 11btc, those blocks probably included transactions that had high fees and that's why. So I think the miners really benefited the most because of the integration of transactions.I have a link that I would like to give you that may help you How many blocks can be made with 1 bitcoin",

But if you think about it, then 5 large pools control more than 80% of all bitcoin mining and if you calculate the total profit, then it is beneficial for them to unite in order to increase commissions.The big rewards on Ethereum may have been random too, but there were just as many big pools there too.",
