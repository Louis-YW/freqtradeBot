  "content": "I came across a new resource that might interest beginners willing to read and learn about Bitcoin. It's called The Sovereign University.According to Ninjastic Space, it has never been mentioned on this forum before. - The platform has Free Courses you can start at any time. They are grouped according to your Bitcoin knowledge: Beginner, Intermediate, and Expert. - The Resources section contains a library of suggested books to read, podcasts, and a builders portal.  - The Tutorials section is divided into Wallet, Node, Mining, Merchant, Exchange, and Privacy pages. Since the courses section is probably the most interesting one, I will cover that in more detail. There are 8 courses, each one with multiple chapters. 3 are beginner, 5 intermediate, and 1 expert course. Each course has a textual tutorial and a YouTube video. Sadly, the videos are in French and won't be helpful for many members.BTC 101: The Bitcoin Journey (28 chapters)BTC 102: Getting your first bitcoins (8 chapters)SECU 101: Information Security & Data Management (10 chapters)BTC 205: Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin Buying and Selling Solution (3 chapters)ECON 201: Introduction to Austrian Economics (8 chapters)LN 201: Theoretical Introduction to the Lightning Network (11 chapters)LN 202: Setting up a Bitcoin & Lightning Node (15 chapters)CRYPTO 301: Introduction to Cryptography (7 chapters)The Tutorial section has a lot of content. There are both textual and video guides. Some of the videos are in English, others are in French.

I really liked the website as even though they have provided the option of registration, but did not ask us to register on the website in order to take courses or learn about anything. Videos are helpful too even though they are in French but sometimes, few tutorials like how to do that or this. kinds of tutorials don't actually need that much audio. Because people are just following the steps in such tutorials. And I think this website is mainly made for French, because at the top of the wallet's courses, they said, special thanks to harman and Parman who translated this. This means the text was not mainly in English. The website is translated into 5 languages. This is also a good thing because here on BTT people find it hard to learn things in their own local language. The course contents of this virtual university are also good. But as a university, they should provide some certificates too. Or maybe some quiz. Or I am the one missing them, while they are included?",

It'll only take few dedication for any bitcoin user to read through all the courses and understand more about bitcoin. I'll personally go through them gradually, especially the lightning network course. The few course sites I've read are not rich with information about LN. Such sites as this, is not only meant for newbies, any body can read them to understand bitcoin and add knowledge to existing ones. I'd advise newbies to ask questions regarding any term or information they don't understand on the website. It'll help the learning process of the newbie or reader and as well put some informative thread on the forum for everyone else to read and participate. Great resource OP.",

I am also looking for the same thing to find for the beginners and to help them but you did it.I am so excited while checking the sovereign university and what I found is that the courses cover a wide range of topics which are from the basic to the advanced level of bitcoin that is cryptography and the lightning network. While checkīng is I came to know that the course is both in the textual and video format which also increased my happiness, unfortunately, the video includes French language but somehow the textual format also present, and maybe the team of The Sovereign University in the future make some English tutorials videos for the beginners.",

I wonder if there is some AI software that we could use to create a voiceover from French into English? I don't care if it isn't perfect and sounds robotic, it's still better than a language you don't understand at all. It would immensely help if we had something like that, not just for the purposes of the videos from this website, but in everyday life where it's needed.",

I wonder if there is some AI software that we could use to create a voiceover from French into English? There are tons of AIs available for video translation for example Maestra.

But the more eyes we have on it, the better we can determine if it's something worth recommending as a learning source or not. I checked random chapters in the beginners' courses which seems good but maybe a little higher standard for a real newbie once they get used to the crypto terms I believe these can be handy but if they give examples then it would be more better for example in setting up the wallet they didn't provide any wallet for setting up, they just mentioned the importance of keeping the seed words safe. I thought it would be better if they gave an example with a good wallet like electrum then it would be easier for one who wanted to learn.",

I thought it would be better if they gave an example with a good wallet like electrum then it would be easier for one who wanted to learn. It would be impossible to discuss everything in the Courses section because then the courses would take days to complete. Detailed setup guides for certain wallets can be found in the tutorials section. Here are just two examples: Electrum and Sparrow.The Electrum one is particularly detailed, explaining how to download, verify, and install the software. It also discusses the differences of running and configuring the wallet on Linux, Mac, and Windows. There is information about generating seeds, recovering wallets, changing settings, connecting it to your own node, etc.",

It's much easier to explain to someone who has never bought or sold bitcoin how to purchase it on a centralized exchange than on Bisq. Even experienced CEX users need to first read BISQ's docs and/or watch a few videos to figure out how to work the platform properly. No matter what anyone says, I don't think it's suitable for a beginner. It offers greater privacy and no custody, but those are different topics. Bisq and Foundation Passport sections exist as tutorials.  Quote from: Upgrade00 on September 24, 2023, 06:45:34 AMThey should have an option where users can recommend an update on the information available.

I am sure the team can be reached over social media in case anyone has suggestions how to improve the site. There are links to their channels at the bottom of the website.",

Ease is not always the best option, cause newbies are more prone to use centralized the exchanges for storage by leaving their coins there and if they start off using them, it will become much more difficult to chabge later. They should be taught the difference between an exchange and a non-custodial and private wallet. An exchange is, of course, not a wallet. Hence its name exchange. A place to exchange A for B, and that's it. Only experienced traders may use it as such because it's inconvenient and costly to move coins in and out all the time. But they will also have to face the consequences if something goes wrong.   Quote from: Upgrade00 on September 24, 2023, 07:26:22 AMSo no KYC exchanges are probably the best options for beginners. No-KYC exchanges are better than KYC exchanges for everyone. The problem is, they are a dying breed. Regulatory requirements are turning them into unicorns, a thing of legends.",

But once you have some sort of feeling for a language, it works somehow to understand enough even when your language knowledge is a bit rusty. At least that's what I can say for me.I had to reduce the speed of the videos to 0.75x, listen carefully and with automated translation to English it's OK for me to follow. But I can't confidently say it would work for newbies, too. I'm no beginner or intermediate anymore, so I'm likely biased and it might be much easier for me to follow than for a newbie.Definitely worth a closer look and a nice complement to e.g. https://learnmeabitcoin.com!",
