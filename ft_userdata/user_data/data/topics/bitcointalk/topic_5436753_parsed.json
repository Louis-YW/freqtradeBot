Buying cocaine can get you shot. What if you could sell drugs online like books or light bulbs? Now you can do it: Welcome to the Silk Road.”This report stated that there were hundreds of items of goods being sold at that time, including marijuana, ecstasy, heroin, LSD, to dry Afghan straw. On the other hand, its terms of service prohibit the sale of “anything whose purpose is to harm or deceive, such as stolen credit cards, homicide and weapons of mass destruction.If this is the goal, Ross Ulbricht, it's time to end it all.no trade-off, Ross Ulbricht, who should be in jail.",

Many people and I also think that criminals (like them) have VIP facilitation in jail to operate old jobs. I have to think like that because, In our country, it's not something strange if criminals still can manage drugs in the jails. The criminal can supply millions of ecstasy pills in collaboration with the warder.",

But IMO it's more important to ask how long they should be in prison. Some people believe Ross shouldn't receive lifetime imprisonment and they even make website about it at https://freeross.org/. Meanwhile SBF action also caused at least $3.1 billion loss and some investor suffer major loss or even consider to suicide.",

It is known that he has influential parents with the right connections that can help him avoid justice to the fullest.These two cases are actually very different. The collapse of FTX is not presented in the media as something very bad (well, it happens), while the story of Ross Ulbricht is initially demonized (as if he is guilty of all mortal sins).",

Wikipedia is get manipulated since the information listed on there are based on vote and people who have power. If there's a Wikipedia's user add a real story where it's against the government's decision, he might get targeted by FBI and he will suspect as spreading fake information and conspiracy.You can read below where Ross Ulbricht is actually not a bad person and don't have any intention to harm any people, it depends on each people who use his free market. Actually anything in this world isn't actually all good and all bad, there's always bad in good and there's always good in bad. Fiat, Bitcoin or any currency, you can use it for a good thing like charity, donation etc, but you can also use it to pay for murders.Become a president, you have full control to develop your country to become better, but you can also bribe anyone to corrupt a lot money.Narcotics, it can kill you if you use it overdose since it's addictive, but it can be used for medical purpose.Anonymity, privacy is really important to prevent from getting traced and to live peacefully, but the government thing we're criminal who done illegal things.Ross Ulbricht isn't deserve to get jailed, but the people who take advantage over the free market is the one who should get jailed!Quote from: https://freeross.org/misinformation/“Ross paid to have people killed”False. Amplified through inaccurate and sensationalized reporting, these allegations were used to deny Ross bail, smear him in the media, bias his jurors and justify the life sentence he ultimately received.Some people overdosed from drugs bought on Silk Road and this was presented to Ross’s jury at trial”False. This allegation was never charged at trial or presented to jurors. Ross was never prosecuted for causing harm or bodily injury and no victim was named at trial. “The book ‘American Kingpin’ is well-researched, accurate and the real story”False. It is not the real story by any means. This book is sensationalized and fictionalized and is a one-sided narrative. It was written to be a page turner, so the author took liberties, with little regard for truth and accuracy. “Ross is a drug kingpin”False. Ross is a website creator, not a kingpin. He did not store, transport or have contact with any of the legal or illegal items sold on the website. He had no relationship with the sellers and no influence over prices.“Silk Road allowed the sale of child porn, human organs, hitmen and other violent services”False. Even the government never alleged this. Silk Road was a free market based on the libertarian non-aggression principle. “Ross was offered a 10-year plea deal and rejected it”False. First, prosecutors made no written offer. Second, the verbal offer prosecutors extended to Ross was that, if he pled guilty to the conspiracy charges he was arrested for, he would face 10 years to life imprisonment. However, they made it clear they would argue for a life sentence with his sentencing judge. “Ross was the only one running Silk Road”False. The prosecution claimed that Ross controlled Silk Road from start to finish and was the only person behind the accounts of the top administrator, “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR, a character from The Princess Bride, who passed his name and identity on to his successors). “Ross got a fair trial.”False. Many organizations and individuals have voiced concerns over Ross’s trial. It was full of due process violations, “Silk Road was created to sell illegal drugs”False. Silk Road was created as a libertarian free market, not as a drug market.Ross created Silk Road for financial gain.”False. Ross was a young libertarian who wanted to provide the experience of a truly free market.",
