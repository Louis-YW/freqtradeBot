They did a long term survey where they tracked the development of babies born addicted to crack comparing it to control data for average performance of youth in terms of academic and workforce achievement.What they found is being born and raised in poverty was more debilitating for a persons health and overall life expectations, than being born addicted to crack.It seems children absorb energies and attitudes present in the environment they grow up in.Perhaps that is a good place to start.",

They go around collecting their neighbourhoods used toothpaste tubes (which in those days were made of leadÂ   ) and melt them down into nickels. When their dads discover the operation they get a lesson in counterfeiting but rich dad is proud of their out of the box thinking.Anyway the first few chapters might be of some use, they start a comic book library and other silly antics as kids which might inspire your children!",

      "body": "Here are some tips for teaching children about money:1. Lead by example - Children learn financial habits by observing how parents handle money. Openly discuss household budgeting and saving strategies. Show them how you shop sales, research major purchases, and balance spending across needs and wants.2. Give an allowance - An age-appropriate allowance helps kids learn money management skills. Let them make simple saving, spending and giving choices with their own pools of money. Require them to help earn extra income though chores.3. Open bank accounts - Help kids open accessible savings accounts and teach them how to monitor balances and statements. Show interest calculations and have them participate in account contributions and withdrawals. 4. Discuss family finances - As kids grow older, appropriate transparency around household income sources and expenses builds financial literacy. Explain taxes, retirement plans, mortgages, interest and insurance without overwhelming them.5. Let kids make mistakes - Allow small failures when shopping or budgeting their allowance while guiding them through analyzing those money mistakes. The real life lessons stick.6. Engage money games & tools - There are many kid-friendly apps, websites and games that make money concepts more tangible through experience. Subscription toy/tool services can also create hands-on learning.The more actively kids participate in daily financial choices with parental guidance, the more adept they will become at responsible money management as teens and adults. Turn money skills into a consistent family learning experience.",
