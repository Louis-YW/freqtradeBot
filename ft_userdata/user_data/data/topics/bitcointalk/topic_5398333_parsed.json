In a pre bear market, is never a good decision to buy anything. I say pre bear market because btc crashed below 29k 2 days ago which in a bull market was the bottom and soon 29k will be the top in months to come, btc likely will crash below 10k in few months before it goes up again.",

I see such threads trying to spread this notion once everyday in this section. Point is that seasoned bitcoin traders know these are dying signals of a shitcoin and how to mercilessly avoid them. Every trader should know this and learn.QuoteJust a bit of advise from a long time crypto investor. It happened to me and became a victim of it so might as well share it with you before you make wrong decisions.  Good thing you learnt your lesson. In the bear market many things are tested, one of which is the psyche of the trader and how they react to changes in prices.I would be buying bitcoin if it drops below 25k which seems possible at the current price range. But I will not be buying any shitcoin, adding them to portfolio means adding in more risk and undue frustration.",

I bet they had many victims thinking it was just a big normal dump but the truth is it was an exit dump. You cannot stay regretting what you did. Move on and make a new investment. I suggest something on the top list of altcoins, For me, Ethereum had been a great choice since Day 1 so I recommend you buy that first before going forward into choosing another altcoin that you want to buy.",

Knowing if the project will last and it won't be a dump. The cheapness of the coin can attract, but the worth or value of the project after careful research should determine If it's worth it. Bitcoin and Ethereum still stand out. Though some altcoins might survive the bear market, one can also invest in them.",

Moreover, a good project don't really persuade people to invest like satoshi don't force people to invest in Bitcoin. Of course, investors talks about making big money in bull market. But they never share their secret in a bearish cycle. It's because that is the perfect opportunity to fill your bags will a lot of cheap and solid altcoins and then hold till the next bull run. I have to learn this hard facts, specially ETH, when they where price <$100 2018 and then suddenly goes for all time high in 2021. So I will not repeat those same mistakes, so I'm going to invest while they are cheap and just HODL them.",

In this bear market I would say it is better not to invest in any new coins. The current market situation, however, is very dire Bitcoin Ethereum is struggling to hold its own market. Every day the market is going down a lot At this moment many new coins will surround the market and give you a lot of encouragement. I would say no matter how much you encourage me not to invest in any new project in this market",

As you can see the percentage of a drop of these 2 high market cap cryptocurrencies is really low compared to other altcoins that already lost more than 50%..Lesson learned, avoid some low market cap coins, especially on the bear market because you are just like catching falling knives, it doesn't mean that it is cheap, it is already good to buy.",

Thanks for your advice Mate, I do believe it really happens because I also experienced this kind of situation, I was bought a particular coin in 2019 and held it in my wallet in a hope that it will rise again just like what happened in the 2017 Bullrun but after months and a year have been pass it was no improvement on the coin price instead it slowly dipped from time to time and eventually the coin dies in the process the coin was still in my old multi-coin wallet and every time I see it I feel bad.",
