The market can move so quickly that many traders are unable to:- Identify high probability trades- Monitor those trade opportunities in real-time- Effectively manage the trade(s) from entry to exit- Consistently grow a portfolioLambda Markets is a unique and comprehensive trading platform that aims to solve these challenges with real-time insights and advanced order execution - all in a single platform. Lambda Markets is built on the Solana blockchain and utilizes data-feeds from centralized crypto exchanges and publicly available yet typically fragmented macro-economic data to ensure that those who use our platform are prepared for every single moment in digital markets. User access to Lambda Markets is governed by the LMDA token. Users must acquire LMDA tokens and activate them in the Lambda Vault to gain platform access.OverviewThe platform will offer real-time trade signals, advanced order types and one-click execution by combining:- Advanced charting library- Directional Algorithm (Lambda Strike)- Real-time trade signals + customisable Strike alert feeds- Macro-economic dashboard- Trade Engine for trade execution + managementUsing a Solana wallet as authentication, you’ll access the full suite of Lambda Markets and have everything you need to extract profits from the cryptocurrency market, at your fingertips. You do not need a TradingView subscription or any other, only Lambda.Advanced Charting LibraryThe Lambda 2.0 charting library will combine our Strike algorithm, orderflow overlays and the charting tools that you're used to to provide an unprecedented trading experience.Trade EngineThe Lambda Trade Engine is the heart of Lambda 2.0 - Focus on high probability trade setups with our algorithmic market screener.- Customise alert feeds to catch trade opportunities first in real-time on your favourite timeframes and tokens.- Integrate one-click trading with your telegram account and securely-stored exchange API keys.- Execute orders fast and effectively with our trading terminal.- Take advantage of passive, delta-neutral strategies.Everyone is able to execute via our terminal with advanced order types — all that you need is a Solana wallet + CEX account to take advantage. The differentiation between subscribed members (‘Basic’ or ‘Pro’) and ‘Free’ users is that; subscribed users have unrestricted access to customisable alert feeds, telegram trading and non-directional aggregation, whereas free users do not.Macro DashboardReal-time, easy to digest macro insights, so that users can easily gauge the wider market context. Including; Economic Calendar, Trader Sentiment Tracker, Monetary Policy Radar, Risk Appetite Indicator and market-moving newsfeed.$LMDA TokenomicsThe LMDA token is the key to gain access to the Lambda Markets platform and the Lambda ecosystem. Users must acquire LMDA tokens + activate them in the Lambda Vault to gain platform access.LMDA token holders are able to:- Access Lambda 2.0: purchase LMDA tokens to activate platform subscriptions and features- Rebates: lock LMDA tokens to earn tiered discounts on platform features and subscriptions. Refer friends + family to receive generous rebates.TokenomicsThe LMDA tokenomic model is simple — 90% of the 100,000,000 total supply is floated to early investors at the Lambda Token Portal and 10% of the token supply is held in the Lambda Vault to bootstrap market liquidity.Token allocation:- Public Sale (Lambda Users): 90,000,000 tokens- Lambda Vault: 10,000,000 tokensThe 10% allocation to the Lambda Vault will never be outright sold on the market and the other 90% of the supply will be in circulation at launch, distributed to participants at the token portal.Zero Insider allocationAs many tokens possible will be in the hands of our platform users from launch. The LMDA token has zero:- Team allocation- Private/VC/Seed allocation- Community allocationAcquire LMDA tokens without the fear of insider selling that has become typical of most tokenomic setups.A Deflationary $LMDA TokenThe major benefit of floating 100% of the LMDA token supply at launch is that we are able to promote a deflationary token market. Availability of the LMDA token on decentralised markets should become increasingly scarce, promoted via a token burn mechanism.10% of the LMDA tokens used to activate product features will be burnt, beginning at launch & lasting FOREVER. Once tokens are deposited into the vault, 10% of those tokens are burnt — never to hit the market again.During renewal periods and new platform feature releases there should be heightened demand for activated LMDA + thus the availability of the LMDA token on decentralised markets should become increasingly scarce in short bursts throughout the year.RoadmapLambda 2.0 will be rolled out iteratively in 2023 with our charting library, strike algorithm, macro-dashboard, trade engine and feature marketplace.Platform PricingPlatform pricing is always pegged to USD values but is paid for with LMDA tokens. Users will have to acquire LMDA tokens on the open market or at the token portal to pay for platform access. Once LMDA tokens have been acquired, users can then use those tokens to activate subscriptions or features in the Lambda app. Note: Your subscription expiry countdown will commence in March 2023 when all trade engine features that are included in your subscription tier have been released in full.
