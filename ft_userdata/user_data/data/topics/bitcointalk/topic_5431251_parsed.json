The typical bug bounty campaign here in the forum is already not that popular since project usually launch this test program on there own channel and not through the forum. They are using discord for a more organize way to distribute information to all the tester.Besides there‚Äôs also some audit company that reviews smart contract of projects that specializes on finding exploit on the code aside from the alpha and beta testers result.",

They expect investors who've invested money in their sham projects to show sympathy once that excuse is made. As soon as that's achieved the projects buy time with that excuse and make their escape plans before the bewildered investors realize what's happening. Investors have really suffered in this space and I guess it's largely due to the fact that it's not yet regulated. I believe that if there's regulation, so many of these abnormalities will disappear overnight.",

It should be up to the platforms to prove that they have been hacked but even then that would be difficult because you would probably need a third party that is not biased to investigate.",

A lot of projects are fairly secure and a lot of devs underestimate how easy a vulnerability is to spot (generally, if one person can spot it, more likely will and some might be less forgiving). A lot of the time, pressure can be put on the dev team to fix something by giving them a limit for exposing the vulnerability publicly but you might be even less likely to receive a bounty then. Most of these sorts of attacks do tend to be inside jobs though that are coordinated - there are some hacks that have looked more legit but in a deflationary economy, there's always a way an attack can benefit the exchange/service more than the individual (such as by paying fiat values)..",

What punishments? Check how many scams have been created in the last five years. How many of you know those who were punished? Precisely because all these projects hide behind anonymity, relying on the idea of Bitcoin, there will be a huge number of scammers.Smart bounty hunters who show errors may realize that it is not worth advertising this or that project. Furthermore, you should not advertise all new projects because nothing new can be created. Everyone repeats each other, only partially changing some things.But people are naive, and this is their right; they do not believe in Bitcoin, but they are waiting for big pluses, which, as we know, very often turn into huge minuses.",

As soon as they received their portion of allocations, they sell almost all and will later abandon the projects and move to a new one abusing decentralization to milk people's money.You see those hacks we often see in the news, I don't believe them, they are most often than not insider work especially in situations when teams are no longer on good terms, I wouldn't buy the story that where the team held the keys worth millions were comprised or bug from their own mistakes, they don't care, trust me when I said so.",
