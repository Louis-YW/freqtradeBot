I think if the operator of the bus do accept mode of payment in Bitcoin then he/she should understand that it need something like knowledge to pay in Bitcoin or to transact with it. It should be worth noted too that it's not instant unless they know something to transact off chain like Lightning Network.",

But unfortunately no one explains what the Bitcoin writing on the bus means. Either it's just a logo, or the bus was bought from a Bitcoin investment.I think Bitcoin is always acceptable when the environment already has a Bitcoin knowledge base. That is the importance of education in an environment that we can reach so that people are more open to digital cryptocurrency transactions.",

Bitcoin being a legal tender, businesses accepting it, traditional investors acquiring, etc, are some of the news that bitcoin users celebrate more now.",

I did a search on the meaning SACCO in Kenya and it stands for Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization. So it is like a cooperative society in which members that has common interest come together to give soft loans to members from a common contributed fund. They are registered by the Kenyan government to accept deposits and give loans to members with less interest. SACCO became very popular in Kenya because of the cumbersome bureaucratic bottleneck Kenyans go through to get loans. I am suspecting that this SACCO is very friendly to Bitcoin. Maybe they accept or have invested in Bitcoin. It could also be that they are Bitcoin fans or lovers.",

Sooner or later they will recognize the adoption of Bitcoin and would proceed to use it as if a normal currency but for now let people know what Bitcoin is by feeding their curiosity on why people are using this. Although, the adoption seems to be expanded successfully it still need people to be wary if they think owning or investing in Bitcoin would get them rich in a day.",

Although, this is just a fairly normal activity because we may have seen and exposed too much, for many parts of the world bitcoin is still very strange, so images like this appearing somewhere where bitcoin hasn't been introduced would also be a good thing and should be spread more so that bitcoin can cover every corner of the world.",

On closer inspection, the owners or drivers of commercial buses also don't quite understand what bitcoin looks like and how it works.Especially for a more advanced stage, regarding payments using bitcoin, but at least bitcoin has begun to be introduced by the public, even those who do not know the concept of bitcoin itself.Putting a picture of bitcoin on the bus like this, is quite impactful, because people will always see it, so bitcoin will continue to be talked about.",

One thing is involved, either he/she is a believes in Bitcoin, made an investment in Bitcoin or has had a big achievement from Bitcoin (just saying). Quotein short several thoughts begin to troop in when i saw this, obviously bitcoin can be a good source of business profitability from this example seeing above, many commercial activities are progressing well with the role and impact of bitcoin on them. Bitcoin has really been a profitable source to most people lately, but many are yet left to consider the process. I started accepting crypto as the 4th means of payment in my business just recently and 5 people has already key in to pay me with BITCOIN, BUSD, USDT and BNB.",
