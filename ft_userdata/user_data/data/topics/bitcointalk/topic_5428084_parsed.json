What are your thoughts on this?I am guessing you are talking about physical casinos where you walk in, because there are ton of live dealers in the internet accepting crypto. However i don't see much significant advance of not having fiat money in the middle of it as it's liquid like no other form of payment.And you are gambling with casino tokens anyway, it's not like you would be gambling directly with crypto on physical casino.And you can cash in your casino tokens and buy crypto or sell your crypto, and buy those casino tokens with your fiat money. It's not the same, but if physical casino accepted crypto payments they would most likely sell your deposit instantly and convert it to physcal tokens that represent fiat money and that you could cash out in fiat money. From the view point of casino just the taxation issues of it all would be nightmare addon of extra work. And just to deal with old timers and explain the liability issues / risks of having their own wallets and what crypto should they choose or not to choose if they don't want to lose everything would be a hard job. In the internet it works with crypto natives, so maybe it will come to casinos some day when people are demanding it and experienced enough.",

What are your thoughts on this?In the future when cryptocurrency finally becomes adopted for use, Live Casino's may still just as people exchange cash for casino chips to gamble with, choose to start accepting bitcoins and other altcoins in exchange for casino chips, and after gambling, say you win, the option of converting your chips back to cash for you or it sent directly to your cryptocurrency wallet will be available in the payment option.",

What are your thoughts on this?You never can tell until you visit a live casino and find out from them if they accept crypto currency payment.I personally believe that 1 out of 10 live casinos will be willing or will accept crypto payment if they get a good offer on the table.And on the question whether there be any live casino around the world that is already accepting crypto payment at this moment, the answer is yes, there are many of them though I don't have a name right now, but I can remember a user of this forum complaining one time here about loosing $2000 in bitcoin to a live casino and planning on going back the next day for a revenge gamble.So indeed, there are live casino already accepting crypto payment and also settling winnings in crypto upon request.",

What are your thoughts on this?That is a lot of work behind this for physical casinos to accept crypto,sure they need a technical team to keep up with their wallet,of course some such casinos have the possibility financially to implement it and the only ones who can make it so are the big ones like Regency,Caesars,the well known big physical ones.I doubt we will see this implemented in the future though,who in their right mind would go and play with crypto in a place full of people and risking his privacy when he can very well do so by playing online,having more options like more slot machines to choose from so I don't see it implemented anytime soon as I see no real interest in such implementation.",

What are your thoughts on this?Physical casinos are still not accepting cryptocurrency as mode of their payment but maybe they are already working with this one, and maybe some are already working for the license to operate and accept cryptocurrency since the adoption is slowly growing and we really need to adopt this change. In time, we might see most of the casinos to have this for now just gamble online with your cryptos.",

So I'm sure the casino will accept cryptocurrency payments in jurisdictions where cryptocurrency is not banned. But it seems to me that such payments are more suitable for online casinos. In real casinos it is easier to use fiat.",

Like having bad luck in the casino itself and then more bad luck because of the market volatility. Businesses don't want to use cryptocurrencies as an option for payment mainly because of that. They'd just stick with fiat and let it run for as long as it can until the market stabilizes and that's when they will inject cryptocurrencies.",

They already have built their networks and user base that are willing and ready to use cash any time and choose the platform's service no matter the circumstances. Also, for them it's easier to hold cash and use it to pay for their winners than switching back and forth from 1 currency to another just to satisfy what the gambler wants. At least, what they have right now is pretty straightforward.",

The possibility and chances of these physical casinos adopting or integrating crypto on one of their payment methods in the future are not even close to impossible but don't expect it to happen right away. There are lots of convenient payment methods out there that's why maybe, you might not see crypto-payment in those gambling establishments for now.Anyhow, gamblers really don't care if crypto payments aren't available yet in physical casinos. That's not even a mass-demand request.",

What are your thoughts on this?The possibilities of a live casino accepting Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies would be largely determined by the country's laws. Bitcoin friendly countries has the higher tendency of accepting Bitcoin than countries that restricts cryptocurrency transactions. Countries like Central African Republic and El Salvador might have casinos offering such services because Bitcoin is a legal tender there and they would receive all the support and assistance from government officials. In my location, Bitcoin usage is still very low due to unfavorable government policies, hence I have never come across any casino that accepts crypto currencies or pay for wins using Bitcoin or others.",

What are your thoughts on this?Frankly, I don't really have any reason why a physical casino would need to include cryptocurrency on their platform as a mode of payment, especially that when you go into a casino that you'll need to trade your money for tokens or chips to play on most of the games such as card games. Also, anyone can just withdraw or trade their crypto to fiat so that they can use it in these establishments.Anyways, it's likely that we can see crypto payments for these chips and tokens on casinos soon with how great online crypto casinos are going great right now such as Stake.",
