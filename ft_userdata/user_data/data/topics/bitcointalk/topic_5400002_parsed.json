Don't try to translate into or from a language you don't understand.Regarding how to do it. There really aren't any tricks there. Translate sentence for sentence and omit and add information you think might be beneficial. You can even click on the quote button to check the design and copy over the original layout from the thread starter. After that, you just insert your text wherever it's needed and remove that in the original language. Don't forget to give credits and share links to the original threads. Some people even PM people to ask for permission, so if you want you can do that as well just in case the person doesn't want his threads replicated elsewhere. I don't see why someone would mind though.",

I hope that's not your idea, if it is, gives it up right away. for such a thing you would probably have to use google translate or something like that and that's not a good idea. in the end, we all already know about that possibility, so such an effort would be almost in vain.I agree with Pmalek, it's probably not too much of a problem to translate into your native language, and it doesn't matter if someone is a newbie here. just make sure you always leave feedback to the original post.",

If you want to translate a topic to your own mother tongue or a language you know very well, you can start with quoting it and removing the starting and ending quote tag so you have the proper formatting. You can use that post as a starting point for yours.Keep in mind that you won't be able to post images.You should add in your post the name of the one who wrote the original and also a link to the original post.You usually don't have to translate more than the first post, clearly not the entire thread.2. Since you were asking about translating an entire thread, it may be that you want to use tools in order to simply understand entire threads in foreign languages.If that's the case, you can open https://translate.google.com/ select the correct target language (you can leave source language on auto-detect) and paste the link to the thread in the source box; the result will be another link which, when you open, will be the translation. Not a great one, but still useful.",

Apparently, if one is able to understand English and able to understand and write in his/her own language, there won't be a problem at all. If I'm not mistaken, OP is interested to translate a thread in a different language he/she doesn't speak into his/her own language. I'm a little confused, however, how a thread written in a language one doesn't understand becomes an interest for translation. In which case, OP is not in the position to make the translation. He/she could instead communicate with the thread creator to have it translated into or simply summarized in English so that he/she could do the translation into his/her own language.",

Do you want to be a verified translator like other forums provide and earn money by doing this? I mean do you offer a translation service? If so, I think no one will trust you because of your rank. I would suggest you buy a copper membership and create a Service thread  in this board with your existing portfolio link. Also, there is no verified translator badge like another forum. So, You have to provide your previous work example.If that's not the purpose but you want to translate useful topics and share them on your local board/thread. Feel free to check fillippone's Help me translate my best posts in your Local Board (This thread). You can contribute to the forum by translating those useful topics. Another suggestion is: Don't translate in a language that you don't understand. Don't use Google Translate or other translators. Don't translate a thread that you don't understand. Even if the thread is written in English, you may not understand many things because everyone doesn't understand technical things like S2F modeling, Bitcoin features and many more.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 25, 2022, 12:36:45 AMI think the @OP is a merit seeker by creating this thread as a fake newbie and ask some guide to seek an attention by merit sources. Question to all: Do you think there's an issues if someone is fluently with English and his local language? It doesn't make sense to ask such question. Can't you take it positively? I have seen on multiple forums that people offer translation services. Since he/she is a newbie, Let's wait for his/her answer and don't judge a book by its cover.",
