If someone does not share them, then they do not deteriorate and do not disappear. If a user is banned, his undistributed merits are not transferred anywhere. I saw somewhere a warning, or rather advice, not to accumulate merits, otherwise, they may disappear, but in fact, I have never seen such a case.For many, the accumulation of merit and then a grandiose distribution with the creation of a high-profile topic sometimes becomes a temporary game of merit sources. But it’s better not to create a lot of noise around yourself, but to be simpler, so as not to be greedy and share merit with other users, without demanding from them posts that are suitable for an academic dissertation.",

A few members were given a few smerit, which I don't remember the ratio to which it was given, and this smerit was the one that was advised not to be held as if it were a coin one was saving to build a house, as they are likely to decay in the future, but I doubt any of that has ever happened before. To know if your own merit has a decade, that's left for only you to notice; if that ever happens, the decade ones are supposed to be minus from your total number of smerit that you should have in your profile, and only you can be able to see that. To know if other users have a decade of merit, I think only a user can know that for sure. Unless there is a way of checking how many merits a particular user has (I don't mean dividing their total number of earned merit by 2), I mean both the merit source and those that were airdropped. If there is a way to view others merit profiles, then I think that can also be possible. At the same time, I still see it unnecessarily until one has to experience it himself before we can push further to know who this works.",

The warning of it getting decayed hasn’t been implemented just yet because we have seen many members who have been inactive for very long time come on to the forum to share merits which signifies it doesn’t decays. The only person that can’t spend their merits are banned accounts. This was a new rule after the merit system got introduced and the banned accounts that got airdropped merits then abused their smerits by trading them. So if this rule can be implemented then we might also see maybe smerits could get decayed in future, who knows? Rules are changing everyday just like DT are been updated almost every month. So it could still happen in the future but for now Nothing of such.Quote from: Orpichukwu on October 11, 2023, 05:35:37 AMIf I read correctly, I came across a post regarding merit decay, which was only to imply that merit was airdropped to members when the new merit system was introduced. A few members were given a few smerit, which I don't remember the ratio to which it was given, and this smerit was the one that was advised not to be held as if it were a coin one was saving to build a house, as they are likely to decay in the future, but I doubt any of that has ever happened before. Not that this members are give smerits, but rather you get half smerits of the total number of merits you have, so those that were airdropped merits didn’t need to be airdropped smerits again but they got the half of the merits as smerits. People that get airdropped smerits every month are merit sources. Which they are just  109 of them and just 33940 smerits shared in different proportion to them",

And how it works? The sMerits decay only of inactive members or active members too?The sentence is a reminder to some people who would want to accumulate as many sMerit as they can just for their personal gain, I don’t even see how it will be of benefit to them because hoarding sMerits will not increase your Merit. They are letting you know that they have rights to decay used sMerit in case you notice your unused sMerits are gone you should not complain about it. There could be a specified number of years it could be before decaying sMerit which i think is known to the admin alone. No one can see your sMerit so only can know if your sMerit is being decayed though i have never heard or seen someone complain about their sMerit being decayed. Just don’t keep sMerits to yourself so they don’t end up being decayed because the term “future” could mean any time which only the admins know how long.",

However, there are a lot of quality posts on the forum that are not being merited, so it is good if we share the Smerits we have.Since my stay on this forum, I have never heard or seen any post where someone says that his Smerits has been a decade, some user has lived this forum for years and letter come back to the forum with their same account and the Smerits in their account are still intact, if their merits have decade, then they will tell us but no any yet.",

We reserve the rights, means that at anytime in the future the admin can choose to start decay of smerits that have been unused for xx number of months or years.There has not been an smerit decay in the forum and with how the system is working, there may not be a need to take such action to stimulate users to spend their smerits.- Jay -",

I do not think that this rule will be implemented, and if it is implemented, its impact will be limited. As long as you have sMerit and see a good post, it is best to send it",

And how it works? The sMerits decay only of inactive members or active members too?As many already mention above. Decay feature on SMerit supposed to be the plan of Theymos since he didn’t want everyone hoarding Smerit that during the initial implementation of merit system. There’s a fear before that merit might be hoard since it’s essential for forum user to rank.Merit distribution turns out to be fine which many user keep sending smerit when they knew that their own merit will not be reduced once you send smerit. I believe if decay will be implemented. Both active and inactive users will be affected.",
