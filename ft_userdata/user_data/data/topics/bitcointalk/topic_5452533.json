      "body": "\"Bitcoin is dead.\" I knew it!  Not sure, but to call this article news is kind of an insult to true journalism and real news. It summarizes some of the not so new issues including network congestion and the usual some-regulation-here and-there-stuff.I am truely wondering, does this sort of article create any value for anyone? It's not particularily bad, just standard with some real info. But nothing that would/should influence any sort of action from individuals as well as companies, right?Just an example: \"While it is yet unclear the catalyst for today’s sharp drop, the volatility is to be expected given the current state of liquidity, especially after larger market maker Jane Street and Jump Crypto revealed they were winding down their crypto exposure,” Medalie said.\"It's so generic and a similar sentence could with some slight variant probably be repeated every month or so./end of rant",

Didn't you people start counting the days until the next halving?  Maybe, hoping not to miss the train, in regret.",
