Alby brings Bitcoin payments to the web with in-browser payments and identity, all with your own wallet. You can use your own lightning node, or a custodial one, it's open source, and it works great. It's worth checking it out if you're interested in using lightning in the web.https://getalby.com/Introduction to the Alby Web Extensionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Em8UISSck",

By generating a one-time credit card, paying for it through LN and entering the details on the payment page directly. I've seen a proof of concept of something like this a while back and I'd love to see it in practice.But just for automating copy and pasting of Lightning invoices, I don't really see a lot of use for such an extension.",

I think he is going to ask developers to add support for bitcointalk (and other forums), and they are currently supporting youtube, reddit, twitter, and other social media platforms.",

Basically, you don't pay the recipient directly, but a middleman that holds the funds and allows the social media account which received the donation to withdraw it.I believe it would be simpler to paste a BOLT12 invoice in your profile e.g. in the MSN text field, since that removes the middleman. But you do need your own node for that.",
