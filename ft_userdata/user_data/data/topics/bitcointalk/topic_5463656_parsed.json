Personally, I would use the DCA method to accumulate more bitcoin to my investment portfolio because of the level of my financial status even not I would have bought in lump. I don't know what happened that dump the price to this amount. Anyway bitcoin is a volatile investment and nobody knows the next price movement. Any investor that sells now due to panic will end up with regrets later because this is the nature of bitcoin.",

Also good for those who do DCA. This is not a bad news instead a good news for me and for sure to other's as well. If there are people who feel afraid they are who wasting the chance to buy more instead.This is the sad things where there is an opportunity a lot of investors are not taking advantaging of the value of Bitcoin, but all in all we shouldn't get panic if the things happens like this.",

The chances are that we might see a dip to the $20k level, do not panic sell. Regardless of the Bitcoin price action in the next couple of months, it is a golden opportunity for the investor to buy Bitcoin at this level. After this correction, the price will skyrocket, and the return on investment will be huge. As Warren Buffett said, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”",

But unfortunately, people will sell their bitcoins on such dumps and they usually become panic. Just a 5% move down and we will see all the negative sentiments. However, those who know the potential of Bitcoin and who are looking to buy Bitcoin cheaply, they will never miss this opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at these prices.However, one must be aware that bitcoin can further dump from here too, so in case we buy bitcoin now and it goes further down, we should not panic. Also, I usually accumulate bitcoin in the spot so in case the market moves against me, I will not be liquidated.",

This is a good opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoins, but be careful because the price is still unpredictable, whether it will continue to fall, stabilize, or reverse.But we can use this time to buy a little to see where the market is going and if we find any signs of Bitcoin's price going down again, we can get ready to buy it again. Everything depends on the results of your analysis and don't panic or listen to suggestions from other people because they are not necessarily correct in analyzing.But now it is approaching the weekend, where usually the price will get even more correction. That's why we have to be more careful when buying Bitcoin and not buy using all-in right away because it's not recommended. Hopefully, the price can reverse upwards and stay there until the weekend ends. And next week will be the time for Bitcoin prices to increase again.",

And this is also the beauty of investing in the sector, you buy when others are fearfully selling and sell when you get to your target. So many reasons have been given for the recent drop in price such as high-interest rates, low economic growth in China, Wall Street publication of the financial report of SpaceX that showed Bitcoin dumps, etc. We know that the main reason is just FUD but I have confidence that the price will bounce back. This is why DCA is the best strategy to use in buying. It allows you to buy Bitcoin at different prices thereby spreading the risk. Just as the OP said, this time is also a good time to buy because Bitcoin will definitely regain and exceed the current price.",

We are, each and everyone one of us, after all, only human. I think the best way to overcome such negative and counterproductive feelings of panic is to step away from the charts and distract yourself with something else.",

But as far as I can see, while many people are happy about bitcoin's price drop, there are also many people who are upset when bitcoin is dumped and they blame Elon for harming bitcoin. This shows that many investors have run out of money for DCA and they have bought bitcoin at a higher price, so they are showing their displeasure at bitcoin being dumped, while wiser investors are celebrating with Bitcoin drop. For me, the more bitcoin drops it is a big opportunity, if the cause of the bitcoin drop is really Elon caused, then I will thank him.",
