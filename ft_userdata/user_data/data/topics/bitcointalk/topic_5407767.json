  "content": "Before answering the question in the poll, please take a look at Forum advertising space for free signature/avatar advertisement. That way you will understand what this is about.After reading the discussion, would you be interested in offering your signature space, avatar, and/or personal text to advertise good Bitcoin projects and services for free?I would also appreciate if those who are interested could write a post saying they are. That way I will know who to contact if this turns into something real.The first suggested project is the decentralized exchange Bisq. CryptoHeadlineNews even created some avatars already. You can take a look at them here.Local Rule: No discussion of projects and whether or not this is a good idea here! Do that in the other thread. This topic and poll is only to find out how many people are interested in participating. ¬† Members interested in free promotion:Pmalek, Rizzrack, Mbitr, BitcoinGirl.Club, Z-tight, eddie13, Maestro75, ETFbitcoin, Ucy, NeuroticFishDepending on availability:PX-Z, YOSHIE, skarais, LTU_btc, CryptoHeadlineNews, un_rank, FatFork, Findingnemo, Agbe, libert19",

Would you be wiling to promote them if we decide to make that our first activity?@YOSHIE, I will put you in the depending on availability list together with PX-Z. You can't take part right now because the rules of your current campaign won't allow you to wear alternative avatars and probably not a personal text that promotes a different service either. @Mbitr Added to the list, thanks!",

There is one more thing I wanted to do before. In the original discussion, I mentioned:Quote from: Pmalek on July 18, 2022, 05:54:08 PMWe would obviously have to advertise the fact that we are willing to advertise good Bitcoin community projects outside of this forum. Social media like Reddit, Discord, Twitter, and other online communities. For that, we will need the help of people using those sites who have good-standing accounts/profiles and are willing to help. I would like to see if this forum has people willing to help on this front as well. Users with a good social media following. I hate the word influencers, so I am not going to use that. Optimally, there would be people doing the promotion via social media as well. They advertise the same projects and Bitcointalk as the place where quality projects can get free promotion.",
