PAIDBITCOIN BLOCK NUMBER:  806,795  - winner Owlcatz Some heroes are made, some heroes are born, and some heroes are chosen. But our hero emerged out of the cry for universal emancipation, in a world system shrouded with the darkness of injustice and oppression. At a very young age, full of determination like one with the spirit of Joan of Arc, she brought hope with the illumination of her sword leading many into a brighter future. And with her golden shield, she defends all who come under her protection to secure their destiny. As she travels all-round the continents of the universe to bring hope, joy, peace, and unity in the lives and hearts of all who come in contact with her. She was not born to die, but to cover the earth like the stars of the sky and to shine brighter and brighter into a glorious future.SIZE 21x27Inch (55,6x70,6cm)Wooden frameEach Collector‚Äôs Edition is hand-signed and numbered by Mx12.Levins and includes certificate of authenticity timestamped on $BTC blockchain via Verisart.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîFeel Free to visit Mx12.Levins Bitcoin Art Threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5362071.0‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîor‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîSALE Threadhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398270.msg60109088#msg60109088",
