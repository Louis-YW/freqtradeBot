But don't get upset about it since for sure if you are consistent taking many jobs similar to what experience those companies ask for sure you became more skilled and can qualify to what requirements they ask once they hire another worker again. For now if there's opportunity knocking on your doors grab it since it will add to your portfolio and can solidify your reputation then be the best choice for them.",

That, and lack of education qualifications that are globally recognised and trusted. Once that kind of alternative is added, the sector will be a lot better.The problem with CVs and portfolios are NDAs and length of jobs. They can also be forged, so companies only look for CVs and portfolios for already successful companies, which undermines application value for some.",

It's a very technical job, and would require more technically savvy knowledge for you to be able to achieve anything great from the job. I also think that there are some online courses you can take to understand it but it's not something you learn quickly especially when you want to be employed for your knowledge on the job.",

I had no prior experience, but gave up along the way due to personal problems and the bear market. If I had kept on writing content for start-ups, I would now be having 4–5 years experience today",
