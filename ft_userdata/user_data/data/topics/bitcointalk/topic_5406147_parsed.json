We all live in a collective or individual bubbles/shield which can be weakened by evil/sin. Once yours is weakening with increase in disasters, simply do this: repent (have a change of heart) spread love to both your CREATOR and man. If you love the CREATOR, you will not abuse/misuse HIS Creations. This is the cheapest way to solve the problem than spending billions trying to stop it. Â  Here is a simple way to go about this: note down when the disaster started, note down the immoral decisions that were taken in that society, then start reversing them to good or suspend them completely ...then watch as the environment gradually returns to normal, as long as no new immoral decision is created. Above all ask your CREATOR for forgiveness... HE Exists & hears your thoughts.. All of them!",
