  "content": "Hi Crypto Lovers,The info I am sharing is only for Educational purpose and are not for any Investment Purpose, so DYOR before any investment.So, we have seen a lot of instability in the crypto world form the last few weeks and everyone is predicting the BTC as well other coins price as per their knowledge. I also did some research and are now sharing it, so new user can have an idea of “How the BTC PUMP works” and “When ALT can be Expected”.Normally, when a new user enter into crypto world and hear about BTC halving, then the only this in his mind is that “After BTC Halving, BTC will sky rocket” but this is not how it works.BTC HalvingBTC Halving is occur after every 4 years and after every Halving the BTC supply/reward become half for miners, that’s the simple concept to understand.BTC PUMPBTC Pump does not happen directly after halving, as there is a cycle for that and for the last 3 Halvings, its follows.First Halving happen in Nov 2012 and the Price Pump after a Year (Nov, 2013), eventually reached to $1200/BTC, which almost 3X.Second Halving happen in Jul 2016 and the Price Pump after a Year (Dec 2017), eventually reached to $20,000/BTC, which almost 16.5X.Third Halving happen in May 2020 and the Price Pump after a Year (Nov 2021), eventually reached to $67,000/BTC, which almost 3.2X.But now, there a difference in the previous Years and in 2024, as in 2024 BTC Price already cross the previous high which expected after Halving. There are a lot of things happen in 2024 and many Big Whale adopt the BTC and invested in it.Fourth Halving happen in April 2024 and the price is also expected to be pumped in Nov/Dec 2025 with atleast increase of 3X upto 16.5X which makes the BTC price to reach $180,000 upto $100,000,0.https://imgur.com/x4NhS1NAs I have already mentioned above that 2024 is different and many Big companies are adopting the BTC and it is expected that many countries will make it legal, which will pump theBTC price to sky rocket.For ALT price to be increased, you just need to keep an eye on the BTC dominance.If  BTC Dominance Increase with BTC Price = ALT DumpIf  BTC Dominance Increase & BTC Price Decrease = Major ALT DumpIf  BTC Dominance Decrease & BTC Price Increase = Major ALT Pump(ALT Season, ALT pump upto 100%-1000%)https://imgur.com/Jsqcci2I hope the information will help new users and now they will have a clear Idea of “How the BTC halving Pump works”.",

Bitcoin isn’t like that at all. Yes, it is volatile and its increase in price isn’t stable or a constant uphill movement however its investors are genuine and aren’t just developers trying to take profits from all the other investors.It’s important to know the difference as you might be spreading misinformation which can cause a lot of misunderstandings regarding the nature of bitcoin.",

It  doesn't really show anything. For example there could be a period where the scammers create a large number of shitcoins hence inflating the sum of all altcoin market caps which would then decrease the market cap ratio (falsely called bitcoin dominance) but that does not mean altcoins are being pumped.The actual trend is that each time bitcoin price goes up or down, the altcoins get dumped.But each time we have a bitcoin-bull-season where \"fresh money\" is coming in, the altcoins can get access to new wave of \"newbies\" who would buy their garbage hence the altcoins also experience the altcoin pumping season.",

Although the impact of some D&P schemes is very little but it does exist.As before the creation of this topic of mine Is Bitcoin truly free of Pump and Dump Schemes? I also thought BTC is free of P&D but when I got valuable answer from OGz I understand that P&D is possible in BTC but the impact of such immoral technique is so little. So considering the fact we can say that positive side is big enough that the bad side of P&D is negligible.",

      "body": "Well, the halving does not guarantee of a good price increase. But as far as history is concerned there have always been new ATHs at least a year after the halving. That's not certain, of course, as those past occurrences can't be a basis in predicting the future, but it gives us an idea. I myself am among those who are expecting an ATH after the halving, that's despite the ATH that was reached shortly before the halving. Anyway, for alt price increase, it can't be explained as if alts are one coin. As always the case with alts, there are those that go up and there are also those that go down, all at the same time. There are those that soar while others die. And I guess it's not as if BTC dominance decreases while its price increases that alt pumps follow. The former doesn't necessarily happen prior to the latter, much less cause the latter. These may happen simultaneously because the decrease in BTC dominance itself could be what an alt season mean.",

Yes, bitcoin is volatile but it is not because of some false narratives. It is rather affected by different kinds of factors such as economic sentiments or global events. They are not made to control the price of bitcoin and that is the difference between a pump and dump scheme and the simple volatile nature of bitcoin.",

But, it all depends on the individual also if he likes to jump here and there, especially in current market conditions plus the factor of personal emotional pressure when seeing the price getting steeper after buying can be a shaky trade defense and certainly cut loss again in looking for a price lower than the initial capital.",
