I think that I can't agree with brah because USD is Woord leading crypto with almost every country accepts it. And it's worth trillions of dollars as compared to the Bitcoin.Bye the way I know that Bitcoin has a bright future and it could be worth more but Still fiat is fiat and this concept could change near a half century where things would have gone much higher than they are now and at that time we might not live after 100 years.",

Purchasing powers of usd change from country to country based on economic stability. Overall, ups and downs in economic stability could cause a currency to lose its value so saying that usd lost 99.88% purchasing power then I do not understand what context you are referring to. Is it due to the BTC? BTC no doubt still has not lost its purchasing power if we look into the timespan of 10 years because by taking start from cents to thousands of dollars. Those who have bags filled with bitcoins like Michael Slayer-type people will say, USD lost its purchasing power well if you see in the timespan of 1 or 2 years then you will realize that btc also lost purchasing power. How did it lost and btc did not lose purchasing power in the period of 10 years? Due to the volatility of both currencies. You are comparing currencies that have no or fewer similarities like USD has no limited supply while BTC has, usd is controlled by centralized authorities while BTC is not. Then how could the purchasing power of both coins will be the same. Btc has high volatile nature that makes it more powerful in term of value due to limited supply and high demand over time. While USD is a currency that is not volatile like the price of it always remains around 1$. A small impact on an economic boost might increase the income or other beneficial factor for countries like a reduction in prices of things due to better imports and exports but it put a great impact on the price of BTC over the USD. So both are two different things You talked about usdt, many say usdt is not even backed by the USA and they do not have enough reserves to back it up then there is still a risk of de-pegging exists.",

You got it wrong. USD didn't lose 99.9% of it's total purchasing power, it lost it's power that is relative to BTC, because BTC increased in value by hundreds of times. But it's a useless comparison. You can cherrypick thousands of things in this world- that have outpeformed BTC, like tech stocks or commodities or collactible items. This doesn't make them a replacement for USD. Especially if you remember that high performance comes with high risk.USD is still one of the strongest currencies in the world. It's not because it never loses value, but because other currencies lose value faster than USD, and in a more unpredictable way.",

This doesn't make them a replacement for USD. This is false if you take long periods of time, at least 4 years, as a sample. If you start cherry picking specific days or months, yes, of course.Quote from: Ever-young on March 20, 2023, 05:39:42 PM Buts it's actually open that's it's better to hold Bitcoin than holding USD for Bitcoin price might drop but it will never reduce its value. This is relative as well, because you are not factoring in volatility. If it is money that you are going to need in a few months, it is better to have it in USD or a stable coin, because if you have it in bitcoin it can drop by 70%. As in the previous example, if we are talking about holding it for at least one cycle or more, bitcoin is better.",

If you saying Bitcoin price might drop, no one will want to store their wealth in Bitcoin because they will not make money. The appropriate sentence is Bitcoin price might drop, but in the long term Bitcoin price high likely will increase. Bitcoin has a value, price and trust while fiat money doesn't have any value and price, but it's have trust since the government is backing up.",

Â It's so preposterous that people are so naive and follows so-called online posts as if a god has posted them. Sensible people will disregard this tweet in its entirety because it's just nonsense, he can't prove this, he just tweeted. My brother and I discussed his tweet just 2 days back, it's surprising that people believed him, well, those that don't give themselves to research.The USD lost almost 100% value in 92 years? This is an example of free speech, one should refine the ones they believe, anybody can say anything.The stability of the USD is d reason why it still maintains its world's reserve currency since 1944, and its current value gauge (Index) was only established in 1973. I don't know where he got his value, and no currency in the world has defeated it over time, but it defeated many in multiples. The set value at the time is $100.00, and the screenshot from \"Investopedia\" below has been its all-time high and low ever since then.The current value is still above the starting level, it's above $103, so that guy (Michael Saylor) is dreaming.",
