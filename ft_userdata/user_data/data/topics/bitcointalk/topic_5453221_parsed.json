  "content": "Hello,I do not understand how bitcoin core chooses the path for the \"change\" when creating a transaction.I've realized that since I do a have a bitcoin core watch wallet (created with bitcoin core offline wallet descriptors), I have received and send a few transactions with it and just imported the same descriptor to another wallets (I have tried with Sparrow and Electrum).Once imported, the balance displayed was not the same as in bitcoin core, so trying to figure out I found that it was one change address missing...checking that address I realized that it was in the path 84'/0'/0'/1/45 and since there is gap limit of 20 it did not show, so by increasing the gap I found the \"missing\" utxo. So in this wallet I have only used two change addresses one Â which it is at path 84'/0'/0'/1/1 and the second at 84'/0'/0'/1/45.For what reason would not start from 0? (it started at 1) and from there jumped to 45?So what I try right now is that I create an usigned tx with the same input, output and fee with all the different wallets (Sparrow, Electrum and Bitcoin Core) and here are the results:Electrum sends the change to the address: 84'/0'/0'/1/0Sparrow send the change to the address: 84'/0'/0'/1/46Bitcoin Core to the address: 84'/0'/0'/1/103I close the wallets and I repeat all the steps and with Electrum and Sparrow it shows the same path for the change address (0 and 46) while in bitcoin core changes each time, now it shows 84'/0'/0'/1/105.",

IIRC one such bug was recently fixed.Appreciate your answer, taking my case as example, after being fixed how it is expected to work a wallet that gap? Since it will not fail to \"return\" the reserved addresses, it will use previous unused change address (from 2 to 44 ? or it will just continue sequentially from the last change address that has been used, in this case 46?",
