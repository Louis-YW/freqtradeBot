This is the thread created by the person who build that site from scratch. There are lots of information you can find using that site like post per day, post per month, edited posts (except when a post is edited within 10 minutes if I remember it correctly right after when it is posted) and also you can check deleted posts too. After the time is up then the posts that will edited will be seen in there and the original content before it was edited. Take this post as an example, when I posted this and edited within the timeframe then it won't show in ninjastic and after the time is up and I edited the post again then you can check the original content as I have explained it in this post.",

I thought that I already included the link in my post and thanks foe that. Well, aside from forgetting to add the link of the thread however I think OP can find it since he found the site after all and I think he did make some research. I hope OP will continue making research to learn more about cryptocurrency and tools or websites that we can use that find what we want to find and would make it much faster.",
