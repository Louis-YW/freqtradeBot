Isn't using a cellphone browser any gambling site friendly enough, I always use a cellphone browser without having to use the app because I think it's more than enough and light, I've tried many games on several gambling sites and it's very easy to use even though I only rely on the browser from phone only, try using it",

You can try Bitcasino.io applications which you can download from their website.Make sure you double check the site by visiting their ANN so you do not download the wrong applications.But as you can use android applications easily, you should have more control over yourself because this can make you forget everything and only play without stopping.This can attract you to become addicted for a long time.",

I have been using Chrome browser for long time now and it is good for those gambling sites. The only gambling site that I have its app was a fiat gambling site which I do not have to mention. First try and change your browser to see if the gambling experience is better. People nowadays are accessing gambling sites more on phones and have good experiences with it with better GUI.",

As far as I know, only Bitcasino.io casino offers a stand-alone mobile app worth mentioning. You can find the download link on their website or in their ANN topic: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4541166.0Quote from: Crypt0Gore on November 16, 2022, 06:54:13 AMI noticed that all gambling websites are good for PC/Computers but not phones, I believe an android application will be flawless and way easier to access.. The vast majority of online casinos feature both desktop and mobile versions of their sites, a design choice known as responsive design. Responsive design means that the site's layout changes to fit different screens. This means that whether you're accessing the casino on a desktop computer, laptop or tablet, you'll have access to all of the same features and games. I don't know what kind of problem you encountered, but I've played at many online casinos and can tell you that none of them have ever had a problem with my mobile browser. If you're having a technical issue, then it's likely that your device or its settings are causing it. First, make sure your device is up-to-date. If it's an old model, then it may not be compatible with newer games or features. Second, check to make sure that your mobile browser is fully updated and that you have the latest version. If you're still having problems, try using a different browser and see if the problem persists.",

I noticed that all gambling websites are good for PC/Computers but not phones, I believe an android application will be flawless and way easier to access.. There are some casinos provide their own android application such as bitcasino, bk8, megapari. Frankly, using browser is better than using application imo. As long as what I know, not all features that you can find in web browser can be implemented in the application. Means that web browser is still a lot of better than application. If you think that not all gambling sites are not good in phones, it means that the casino needs to improve their mobile version and you can suggest them to improve it.",

Pretty sure you can access casinos via mobile browsers. I reckon when the casino was in development, they already argued whether to make a mobile app or not, but seeing as the main platform for the casino was browsers, which encompass both pc and mobile, they saw no need for it. If they do try to develop an android application for it, they'd have to develop it for iOs as well. This can all be summed up as needless expense, which they can probably put out for better use. And in all honesty, accessing it via mobile browsers sounds fine already imo. It's not like casinos have some special features that request the necessity for it to become an application.",

Gambling apps are prohibited in appstore and play store. This is the main reason for which many gambling sites and casinos don’t have any mobile apps. Rather they make sure that their sites are well responsive in all the mobile devices. Op have you tried the casinos in Chrome for android or Safari for Apple? These are the best browsers for the gambling sites. Also make sure that you use good casinos like stake.com . They have the best mobile version UI according to me.",

I believe applications in the gambling industry are highly unappreciated. Almost all companies tend to digitalize their services as their target audience spend half of their day in a smartphone. We love apps for convenience and snappy/user-friendly interface. MegaPari also has an application - our players actually adore it. Almost each positive review contains compliments to the application  In my signature you will find a link to our ANN thread and till 30.

Well, I don't know the kind of mobile phone you are using but I've actually been playing on stake.com from my mobile phone for sometime now, and I think it looks good and the experience has been very good so far.Although i must say that there is an app with stake logo on google play store, but i believe this app is fake since stake have never for once announced launching an app.And as for other casinos, i am not too sure, but i do know that there are several casino apps on google playstore but i can not tell how safe they are, my advice is that you be extremely careful not to end up downloading a fake scam app, i advice you stick with the most popular and reputable casinos here. If the websites do not fit well on your mobile device and you have the means, then maybe you should consider getting a bigger mobile device for a premium gambling experience.",
