  "content": "Nowadays I'm searching for the new coins to invest, and finally I find a unique coin. The name of the coin is 'Cratos'.I haven't heard of this coin before, but some of my friends already invested to this coin.So I searched it on CMC and CG. And the explanation shows the POWER of the project.Look at the explanation below. This is shortened version.\"Cratos is a V2E (Vote To Earn) cryptocurrency designed to facilitate citizen participation in the CRATOS mobile app, a real-time live vote platform, where users can generate a vote topic in her/his preference, and other users can participate in the vote. The demographic data will display immediately after voting. Users on the app can earn Cratos tokens based on their activities.\"I think it will be a great chance to make the world better. TO THE MOON!",

I think you should avoid this project or you should observe for a while to see if this project has real potential or not. We are in the bearish season and today bitcoin continues to have a slump indicating that the market is not ready for a bull run in the near future.Investing in new projects is currently not recommended because it is too risky, old projects are also struggling with ferocious bears, so new projects are easy to become scams. and disappear quickly.",

So it's going to fade as soon as a new hype emerges. And we can even call it scam because of how the way it was created, If you look closely it seems that it has some use case, however, it is so shallow that you think they are just playing in creating this kind of projects for pure pump&dump.",

I don't think is gonna success, governance is the most successful to share some IDEA with the support from community as well.They're gonna to vote while the idea is good, not just because reward.",

YOU LITERALLY WROTE THE ANNOUCEMENT FOR IT right after this -> Link<- And just you know, this is not correct format in announcements so it most likely gets deleted soon.So please just admit that this is your creating and this is just an advertisement tactic used by so many people in here for doomed projects. There should be a voting mechanism on this forum to lock topics. I am just warning people not to invest but i guess this answer gets unread as well and will be part of the problem bumping this pointless ad.I mean op didn't even try to cover his tracks as a team member.",
