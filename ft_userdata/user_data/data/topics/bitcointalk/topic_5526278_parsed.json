The company not only accepts Bitcoin but they say they are planning to keep Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. This is a difference compared to other companies which accept Bitcoin for payment but immediately change it to USD.Quote from: Justin Stiefel, Chief Executive Officer of HDC“Heritage has always been an innovator and once again we are leading the way in the craft spirits space as we prepare to accept bitcoin as a form of payment for online e-commerce sales and to acquire and hold bitcoin as an asset. As noted in our policy statement, unlike traditional investors who purchase bitcoin with cash and are immediately subject to potential pricing volatility, as a company producing goods for sale, acceptable margins between the retail price of our products and their cost of production is expected to offset potential fluctuations in the value of bitcoin we accept as payment. This provides us considerable financial flexibility as we develop product offerings for users and enthusiasts of bitcoin.”I think Bitcoin is now finally starting to enter in companies and countries financial spreadsheets for real.",
