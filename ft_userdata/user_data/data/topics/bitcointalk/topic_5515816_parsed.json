Bech32 is backward compatible, so if you send Bitcoin to a legacy address, your funds wonâ€™t be lost.Quote from: Larreate.x on October 27, 2024, 12:20:36 PMHow can we differentiate between these two addresses?

Taproot input is 10.5 vbyte smaller than Native Segwit input, but Taproot output is 10.5 vbyte larger than 1 Native Segwit output.So whether using Taproot or Native Segwit is better for transaction fees, it depends on inputs and outputs of your transactions. In addition, Native Segwit has better support from centralized platforms than Taproot.",

It's very risky when you send your bitcoin to a wrong address, because you will lose your coins, only if the owner of the wallet decides to return back your bitcoin to the address that sent it. If you are to send your bitcoin to a legacy address of your wallet, and you send it to a sewgi wallet address that is yours, your coins will be in your wallet that has the segwit bech32 address. But if it is not your wallet address, you have lost your coins.

      "body": "The legacy address was the very first address format used by the bitcoin network. It begins with a \"1\" however during periods of around 2016 when bitcoin first started to have congestion problems, developers had to look for a way to fix it and thankfully the bitcoin network makes use of forks giving you the ability to adjust certain things on the network.Around august 2017 bitcoin fork was implemented for the SEGWIT supported addresses which allowed the segregation of witness data in a transaction making it occupy less space on the block chain thus reducing congestions. The SEGWIT supported addresses starts with \"3\". Later on it was soft forked to native segwit which starts with \"bc1\".",

The the SegWit also has their own differences with taproot addresses best used for transaction with multiple inputs and less outputs while the native SegWit are best used for low input and multiple outputs.Quote from: Frankolala on October 27, 2024, 12:35:34 PMSegWit address uses low fee when making transactions from this address because it occups small space in the blockchain compared to Legacy address.  It is not the size that is even reduced in SegWit transactions that makes its fee effective and it doesnâ€™t actually occupy less space than legacy transactions but rather the SegWit transactions have less weight than legacy transactions and since the new fork actually calculate fees base on weight the segwit transactions are cost effective",
