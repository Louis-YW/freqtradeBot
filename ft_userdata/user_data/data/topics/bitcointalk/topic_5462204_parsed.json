Obviously you didn't need any special empowerment getting into Bitcointalk did you? Such statements is an encouragement to laziness amongst the youth... check up most of which they don't wanna work neither do they need empowerment rather wants to be spoon-fedIf you check the purpose of the bitget builders program you're talking about the aim could not be far from creating awareness about the site for more traffic afterwards the so called empowerment of youth is forgottenYouths should learn to get their chicken wings themselves and stop waiting for anyone to push them!",

The crypto business community has the potential of assisting people to gain some financial stability but we shouldn't make it look like a get-rich-quick scheme. The sector is highly volatile and risky so it will be better seen as a side job than a full-time job. The youths should acquire skills and qualifications that will assist them in getting jobs. With their earnings, they can set some funds aside to invest in the crypto sector.The awareness you claim to be promoting is targeted at attracting people to use and invest in your centralized platform. The best crypto awareness is to promote decentralization and privacy. People should learn how to use decentralized wallets and platforms.Quote from: Vivageneviv on August 06, 2023, 08:14:03 AMYou are probably from a country where crypto adoption has reached an impressive level or where you can easily access information and can't relate with the need to educate and create a smooth entrance for youths in less informed regions.

Bitget website is a centralized platform that offers diverse crypto services. Some of its features like discounts and referral benefits make it looks suspicious. I don't think your main purpose is to educate the youth but to make a profit. The truth is that I don't trust centralized platforms.",

I did not check by many months ago, Binance launched their program for cryptocurrency builders and not only them, others have things like Grants and so on. The program from Bitget is not a totally new program type.Having grants, funds for people to develop their projects are great but let's say this blockchain industry has many scam projects and not all projects built with funds from such programs are good ones or non scam.",

Its up for them if they like to adopt or just pass on the information they learn since at the end of the day not everyone has the same passion and maybe there are other young people will like it then some other may won't so introducing it with right information is somehow needed so that we may know the pulse of the people if crypto is good to youth or not.",

I believe that blockchain should also be taught at schools, which i think some universities are already adding it to the subjects, either we like it or not blockchain and crypto assets are here to stay, what really holding others is because they are afraid of change, and also the negative news and happenings concerning with scammers in crypto space, what is need to be done is to assure this people that this are just because of also of users , although there are scams happening big part of this is being careless, educating, also the people that are already in the industry of business and others will boost the adaptation, at the same time the policy and rules should be balance, if the government will push their way and hold crypto in the neck, this will not gonna happen, since crypto is about decentralization and freedom.",

Either way, i think it is good to have alternative ways to earn quick money from these shitcoins. As we all know BTC is less volatile than shitcoin in short timespan.I personally (and many others) have no reason to doubt Bitcoin because it has proven itself through more than 10 years of existence as the only decentralized cryptocurrency that was created with a purpose and has its own practical application. What you are talking about is something completely different, because if someone creates a token/cryptocurrency only with the intention of making a quick profit for himself (or someone else), then that is diametrically opposed to what Bitcoin represents.Quote from: Faisal2202 on August 06, 2023, 11:21:59 AMFor example, those who wanted to make 2x or 3x in one month cannot make that much in BTC so they have to gamble there money on shit coins. In easy words a person even with experience investing in shit coins is near to a gambler. According to what you say, most of these altcoins/tokens are actually gambling chips, and the people who buy them are actually gambling with them because that's their only purpose. In that game, most players lose everything they have, and they say that this percentage is around 95%, while only 5% profit.I wouldn't call it a fair game because all these projects promise something completely different, while in fact they are essentially frauds that only individuals get rich from. In the eyes of the regulator, this is a problem that is being tried to be solved, despite the fact that most people think that someone is taking away their right to trade.",

Because i used to work in bounties and many projects promised that they will do that and this but at the end. All they do is go away with all the investor's money. I also tried my luck with some alts but it didn't go well due to less knowledge so i left it. I totally agreed with your point of gambling chips because shitcoin really are one.

If the choice is given, he will tend to choose more smooth and user-friendly solutions. That's why people should be educated the more early as possible, in order to familiarize people efficiently with them and to enhance global adoption at the end.",
