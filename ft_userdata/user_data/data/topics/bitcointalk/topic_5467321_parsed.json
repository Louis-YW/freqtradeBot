Thailand will tighten loopholes in tax rules on overseas income as the new government attempts to lower income gaps as well as increase income to pay for measures to stimulate the economy the finance ministry last week issued stricter rules on overseas income.Thailand's prime minister told the Business Forum on Monday that new rules that will come into effect on January 1, 2024 will allow authorities to tax foreigners' income if they have been residents of Thailand for at least 180 days in a given assessment year. This is in accordance with the announcement by the Thai Revenue Department. Some people may not be happy that I delve into this area, but inequality is a big problem referring to the growing wealth gap due to tax loopholes.the big question is how many people come to Thailand and stay here properly and live off the money they earn from other sources of income from other parts of the world.I have some Thai acquaintances, the situation in Thailand currently, is not crypto friendly. Is This a crazy policy? They already pay taxes on their income, there is no need to do it twice. What do you think will be the response to this news?

Foreigner is using Thailand as their place most of the time which means they can be considered as residents if they stay there for half a year. There’s nothing wrong with it since they are being resident of that country. Yes, foreigners is paying taxes on their original country but they are using Thailand most of the time for their stay which means they are experiencing the benefits of Thailand which is being paid by Thailand citizens. The duration is half year here which means those will be affected are people that live already on Thailand most of there time compared to their original country.",

If a thing goes right then in the end Thailand will become a good place and it's economy will stabilize itself over time as when there will be less inflation and stagflation.

So I don't think it's a bad step but people still found ways to save themselves from huge taxations. And the downside of it is, that those who think that they can store their funds in crypto now have to pay taxes too.",

Maybe it's true, governments everywhere do the same thing, especially in an economy like this. They believe that they can create changes like this to achieve the goals they have. But they never consider the idea that the people they want to tax always have other options. It's like double taxation for foreigners is tax inequality. Foreigners are taxed in their home country and will now be taxed in Thailand at the same amount. Does Thailand want to get rid of all foreigners?",

Since their sole income source is only from the tourism and few agendas that are not really tourism associated its best decision so far. This can make their country grow properly, in right direction and with amazing funds in their reserves. This is excellent for the locals also since they won’t be burdened with the taxes from their government. It feels like more or less equal opportunity to everyone in the country. Good move.",

Taxing income from crypto can only be justified if a crypto user is somehow dependent on the country or centralized system controlled by any country to earn cryptocurrency. The lesser you depend on centralized system to earn crypto the less likely you will be taxed. Even if you are taxed it will be lesser than people who are more reliant on centralized system to earn crypto. If you are completely independent of the centralized system then you don't deserve to be taxed.So, if you don't want your crypto income to be taxed at all, go fully decentralized in everything.",

What do you think will be the response to this news? I mean, let's say you're a foreigner in Thailand, let's say you have income in America does that upset you?  I will not call it paying the tax twice, because you, as a citizen of Thailand, pay tax on a single product, then pay tax on another product, and if you buy another product or service, then you pay tax on that too. This means, why don't you call those 1st, 2nd, or third tax? Then why are you calling tax paying twice tax? I don't think you guys can do anything about this policy. You guys at least got a better chance, because here in our country, BTC is banned, but it will not be banned in your country; instead, you have to pay some tax, and that's better than bans and punishments. In my view, countries that make bold moves to adopt something new, like BTC, etc., are the ones that will not be left behind in the race for development. These countries will become fully developed one day just due to such a bold move. This time might be hard for the tax payers, but one day the same tax will be used for the development of the country and your country will grow, and if you guys are making some money in crypto, then why do you guys hesitate to pay tax? I know it hurts when someone deducts some money from your assets only for making transactions, but as I said before, what can we do other than accept this fact?",

Besides that, if you're living in a country for over half a year at a time, it is quite reasonable that they be able to start asking for a contribution for the upkeep of all the services within it - beyond what you may pay for things like food or renting.
