Let us know how it goes...  When it's about contest and any such tournament, rules is the most important part to become a valid participant. It doesn't matter how good you're, how high your money etc etc, when you didn't follow the rules, the project can easily say you're not a valid participant and they will reward the prize to the other top user who follow all of the rules.This mean user \"clip23\" isn't a valid participant even though he place the most bet in their casino.@OP I support your accusation and I will leave negative tag to their account.",

      "body": "Hello All,I will be addressing the issue that has been brought up by the OP. First of all, we appreciate that he has brought up an oversight in the contest.What Happened?We ran the contest for the World Cup race, where the player who completed the tasks in the original tweet and had the most bets would win $500.However, as it is the holiday season and the person that originally posted the contest is on holiday, another member of our team posted the \"Winner is Clip32\" post based solely on their bets placed, not realizing that they had not completed the required Twitter actions to be eligible.An oversight and a mistake, nothing more than that. Once notified about the issue yesterday, the post was removed so that we could find the true winner, as none of the Top 10 raceboard leaders had completed the Twitter tasks.The Actual WinnerThe winner of the contest is user Jojo21, which will be announced on Twitter today. He correctly filled out the Twitter requirements and had $6,349.21 in bets during the race.About the OPWhile I am happy that the OP brought this oversight to light, I would like to take a minute to say that just because we work online and in crypto casinos, it is not right to be rude to people.Yesterday, rather than simply explaining that there was an issue, the OP contacted several of our team members to call them \"scammers\", \"clowns\", \"idiots\", etc.These are real people that have a job and sometimes mistakes can happen. It is just as easy to contact people in a civil manner to point out an issue, rather than being rude and making them feel terrible for a mistake that they made.",

Jojo21 had nearly 5x more money bet than the next person who filled out the Twitter requirements. If anybody filled out the Twitter requirements and had over $6,300 in bets on the World Cup, I invite them to contact us.",

The issue did not come from betting in the race, the issue came from the additional requirement of players to like, retweet, and tag 3 friends in order to be considered eligible for the contest.Once we were made aware of the fact that the top 10, which were completely transparent, did not fulfill these requirements, we went through to find the next highest bettor that did. We shared that person's betting amounts and the OP was one of the other two players that fulfilled all the requirements. He knows he did not surpass that betting amount. There is no point in sharing his information (unless he wants us to), because he only bet 20% of the what the winner did in the period.We understand what you are saying and we did not think that players that had bet so much and had an opportunity to win $500 USD would not fulfill the very simple tasks of Twitter. We were completely transparent having the race section on our website for the duration of the World Cup.",

What if you're fake those numbers, of course no one will know it since only internal team have access over it.If you're saying you don't want to share all of the bets in public because you want to protect your gamblers's privacy, what if you're only share it to @OP and 2 other trusted users in this forum?",
