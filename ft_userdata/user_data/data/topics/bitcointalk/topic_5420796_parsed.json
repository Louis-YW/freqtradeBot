Lately I have noticed a trend on one or two occasions and I am curious to ask for your opinion on this particular issue of casinos that do not have an ANN thread in this forum, where discussion on the progress and development of the casinos and also serve as a feedback mechanism to handle issues resulting from members' activities on their site.I don't know if this topic has been discussed before, if it has, please point me to the thread where the topic has been discussed otherwise please leave your views here in the comment section.Some of those casinos already hard a running signature campaigns in the forum but yet doesn't have an active ANN thread or a representative in the forum, so how do players deal with issues from the site, should we contact the campaign managers each time there is a problem from those casinos?",

But it is a plus for those gambling sites with official account and thread on this forum. I prefer to use them.",

Though it is not compulsory for the site to create one, but yes, it is a plus for them, as they reach out potential players. Also, a lot of forum users are checking the threads or discussions first before sending their funds to these casinos.Because a good feedback or review would encourage them to try the site. And with active support, that's indeed a plus.There are other means of contacting them like their social media channels but if they have active rep in this forum, people are more confident that the site can help them in times of trouble.",

Most of the gambling site today have their own ANN thread and its actively monitored by their own representative. If they still have no official thread, then a gambler can create one to ask other players from that site about their experiences and to discuss as well.",

You got the point correctly, I have always been skeptical of a casino that does not have an ANN thread here in the forum as I don't 100% trust the judgment of the online support and I may prefer personal explanations towards issues.I may not avoid casinos without ANN threads but I have more confidence in those that maintain their presence here, well we can also consider running a signature campaign as casinos presence since some of the participants will already have an experience with the site and can answer to some queries and help solve none technical problem from comments and contributions.",

It gives a sense of security when casinos post their ANN here in this forum, even though it is not a requirement. A lot of people usually trust crypto casinos that have great visibility here in the forum rather than some random casino that says they have been in service for years and are padded up with paid reviews. Bitcointalk has been helpful in placing some great casinos in the map for us and I think if you don't see any ANN thread for a crypto casino present in here, just don't bother playing in there.",
