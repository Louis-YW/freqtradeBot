  "content": "The EVERCLUB platform is the development of an international DeFi EdTech startup - the Learn2Earn platform with anecosystem of products making the education fun and easy. It is achieved through gamification of the learning processand systems of passive and active income.The EVERCLUB philosophy was developed in accordance with the Learn2Earn concept and is aimed at both beginners andexperienced Internet users. Through the use of educational products presented in the EVERCLUB ecosystem, users will beable to learn more about such spheres as programming, web design, Internet marketing, venture capital investment, trading;acquire working skills of content making, copywriting and graphic design; master the basics of computer literacy and Internetsafety rules; learn how to use digital assets and earn on them. In fact, the EVERCLUB platform is designed for everyone whowants to start making money on the Internet, but does not know where to start.To learn more about the concept of the EVERCLUB project, you can read in the \"WhitePaper\",which can be downloaded in PDF format by clicking here.Did you know that poverty on our planet is beginning to grow at an alarming rate and is becoming a global internationalproblem as important as global warming, ocean pollution or energy crisis. And if in developed countries, the criterion of \"poverty\"applies to people with an income below 40% of the average income in the country (which, as a rule, is estimated at thousandsof dollars), in developing countries, under this criterion fall people whose income provides consumption of less than $2 per day.In addition, there is even a special international criterion of \"extreme poverty\", which essentially defines the limit level of povertyin terms of human survival. This criterion includes people whose income ensures the consumption of less than $1 per day.It's a very sad statistic.At EVERCLUB, we believe that there is only one way to defeat poverty: by educating people.A famous proverb says, \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.This parable perfectly reflects EVERCLUB philosophy and our vision of solving the problem of poverty.EVERCLUB is not just another educational startup or online academy. We want to popularize the process of acquiring newprofessional skills and quality knowledge, mastering new professions and improving the effectiveness of existing skills.To learn more about the philosophy of the EVERCLUB project, you can read in the \"Minifesto\",which can be downloaded in PDF format by clicking here.During the platform development, it became clear that in order to fully implement our concept, it is impossible to limitourselves only to the creation of an educational service. We need a multifunctional ecosystem that can combine services ofvarious types: educational, charitable, investment, gaming and entertainment.This is how the idea of a decentralized EVERCLUB ecosystem was born. It includes 8 products,which are to be subsequently launched during 2022:EverLearn is the flagship of the ecosystem, offering platform users exclusive access to educational programs,courses and learning products. Hundreds of educational materials in several dozen areas of Internet business; the concept of\"learn and earn\" providing for the payment of rewards for successful learning; integration with other services of the EVERCLUBecosystem - all this gives EverLearn a high chance of becoming a leading product in the field of online education.EverGrow is an exclusive service represented as an addition to the lines of educational products offered by EverLearn.This service provides an opportunity to test the platform users on the basis of completed sections of educational coursesand programs. In case of successful completion of the tests, users will receive rewards: including tangible rewards(in the form of valuable and promising crypto-assets).EverGame is a proper online digital distribution service for Play2Earn games.This is a kind of virtual digital platform, which will feature both Play2Earn, RPG or NFTgames, as well as games from third-party developers in collaboration with other Play2Earn projects.EverBot is a service of algorithmic trading with robotic trading brokers.It is an exclusive offer for a closed circle of investors with deposits on the platform of $30,000 and above.Using this service allows us to maximize profitability and minimize risks. The service uses a specially developed computer algorithm that trades cryptocurrency assets using API. This method allows you to actively trade on exchanges and at the same time keep users' funds safe on their balances.For the convenience of users, the interface of the service is implemented with a telegram bot, which makes it user-friendly.EverWin is a service of bonus programs for top network leaders. The service offers the possibility of periodical competitions among platform users in the official Discord and Telegram, as well as other social networks of the EVERCLUBproject. Participation in ongoing competitions will improve your skills in Internet marketing and provide a chance to receivevaluable incentive prizes and rewards. EverFi is a service for organizing distribution and collaborations with other Blockchain startups and FinTech projects.Using this service provides opportunities to diversify the capital earned on the platform. Investment industry and financial sector are too voluminous and complicated for users to analyze on their own, which exposes their investments to many risks. This solution allows us to maximize the investment opportunities of the platform through access to specially selected affiliate offers.EverHelp is a service for holding charity events, lotteries and contests. Considering the social focus of theproject, the integration of a product aimed at charity is logical and quite predictable. The EverHelp service is to become aplace for the simultaneous holding of many different competitions and charity events. Platform users will be able to take part in one or several events at a time. Besides, no multiple registrations and dozens of the same actions are needed – everything is simplified as much as possible and available within a single service. The economic model for the distribution of proceeds issimple and transparent: 80% of the fund will be divided among partner charitable foundations, and 20% will be directed toEveHelp marketing. At the same time, any foundation or charitable organization will be able to create its own account onthe EverHelp platform. After registration, it will automatically receive its wallet and the opportunity to directly receivedonations/help from all users of the EVERCLUB ecosystem. EverStart is a decentralized service similar to popular crowdfunding sites.EverStart allows users to bring to life the most daring, original and brilliant ideas of their own projects, as well as invest inprojects of other members of the EVERCLUB community presented on the platform. Add to this the transparency of alltransactions and operations provided by the blockchain technology and you get the perfect crowdfunding product, whichwill quite possibly become the starting point for many unicorn companies. EverPay is an in-house payment service fully integrated with all services of the EVERCLUB ecosystem.The use of EverPay will allow for the internal exchange of crypto assets on the wallet balance of EVERCLUB users withthe possibility of withdrawing fiat funds to Visa/MasterCard. EverPay represents a single platform for doing everythingthat was previously done in several separate applications. For example, users will be able to issue invoices to theircustomers and partners, buy and sell crypto assets, as well as pay for goods and services. In 2023, the EVERCLUB ecosystem is planned to be supplemented with 5 more services:EVERCLUB Token - a native ecosystem token.EVERCLUB Bridge - a bridge between Tron Network, BNB Smart Chain and Solana.EVERCLUB Blockchain - a proper highly scalable blockchain.The University of Learn2Earn - a decentralized online learn2earn university.EVERCLUB Metaverse - integration of an online university into the metaverse technology.Although most of the services are still under development, today you can already learn and earn money withthe help of EVERCLUB.
