  "content": "As we all know, Google is a massive tech giant company. Except for those who use iPhone, people who are using android they are getting support from Google and their operating system. How safe do you feel while using it?Recently, Google has changed their map services from maps.google.com to google.com/mapSo now google can access your location not only on map, but you are providing the location to all google related apps while using only one app.Writing your seed phrase using google keyboard has been an issue in the past, as it can auto complete your next word from seed phrase if you write it once. Not as issue for those who use computer but newbie who get into crypto, the majority of them create their first wallet on their smartphone. Now, google implementing this location sharing service with all the app can lead to some problems. And also OTP (One Time Password) to set up your many crypto related accounts comes to Google's message app. They know your email, they have access to your OTP, and now they also know your location.If one can get hold of this information, then you are really in a big trouble. They can literally bypass your security through this. What should be the best way to prevent this? We all know that google has a very good security and privacy policy to store user's data. But it is not impossible to get hacked. Everything on the internet is vulnerable. I have said it in the past, and I will say it here again. Nothing is impossible if the right person chooses to do it. With all the assets you hold, how safe do you feel using google's services?",

No matter it's maps.google.com or google.com/maps, internally they were still able to share your info between their various services.And it's known that this is not good for privacy. Some accept that, some don't. However, your topic comes late. You may want to start reading into #DeGoogle - Take back control of your privacy which is a topic here on bitcointalk, discussing exactly this, just it does it in 2020.PS. The OTP app is the easiest to replace. I recommend Aegis Authenticator.",

      "body": "Simply don't use the stock operating system of your android device. Custom ROMs where privacy is far enhanced exists(e.g. LineageOS, GrapheneOS) — though unfortunately not for every Android device; as they're mostly for commonly-used/bought Android devices.If you're interested: https://www.privacytools.io/android-alternativesI personally use an iPhone device though. While definitely not perfect, it's at least slightly better than stock Android when it comes to privacy. I used to use custom ROMs(and heavily customize my phone and OS all the time) on Android devices in the past, but today I couldn't afford my phone to have bugs even if rarely.",

Some people will advice you to use a kind of phone that can use another OS other than android and iOS, that are  open source.",

Do you think they haven't updated their TOS and privacy policy? I want to get the latest news, not one from 2020.There are good if not the best possible ways are explained in that post, but do they still provide you the same as they did in 2020? I am just curious about the new things they are doing and what it might do to our privacy. No offense. Quote from: NeuroticFish on December 28, 2022, 08:48:10 PMIf we would continue without taking that topic into account, this one may end up with nothing new, or the new things spread out between pieces already discussed in 2020.Well if nothing comes up here that's new then I will delete this for sure.",

If you've be using the service or there services, they still remain the providers here.There are always chances of compromises which ever service you use and that still haven't stopped anyone from using them. Not to mention, your location is often not accessed less you have it turned on.Google provides mailing services too, how so do you expect them not have data or have OTP come through them when in fact, your using that service. It's what you provided for a 2FA (email/phone number) depending on the available that the service goes to.",

But if they use Google or any keyboard which tracks your trying data surely can have your private seeds do its time for the wallet providers to upgrade their security like virtual keyboard while entering seeds at the time of wallet creation.",
