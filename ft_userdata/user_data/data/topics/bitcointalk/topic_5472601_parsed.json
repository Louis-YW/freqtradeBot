Everything is quick to reload when I click thread. Probably due to your ISP. Try clear data on your browser and if possible use VPN to check whether your loading speed will improve or not.I experienced this issue on gambling site and it turns out my ISP is probably not compatible on the website loading speed.",

My point is, it's not as it was before.Other sites and apps are working just fine, no network issue.I am also not facing any type of slowness, even though my internet is slow, but this forum is working just fine, while other websites are taking time due to slow internet. (I think I am using your sources; hehe, that's why your side is slower than before.) Well, the first reason might be the internet, but that's not in this case, so try to clear the cache, cookies, etc. Then try to change the internet; maybe the one you are using has to do something with it.Try to connect with a VPN, then try to use this forum and give it a try on Tor Browser. In this way, the IP and browser will both be changed, and you can detect if either of them are causing the problem.",

It seems like my ISP was causing some kind of problem.I tried other browsers, cleared data, restarted router, rebooted my phone several times, nothing worked. I can't normally use bitcointalk as I used to (for now). It's very slow for me. It took me more than 30 minutes just to reload a page normally and I couldn't even check the comments.Lastly I used TOR as you guys suggested and it worked. My internet connection is already slow, using TOR/VPN makes it more slower. But I have no choice but to use it like this.This never happened with me. I'm 100% positive bitcointalk.org isn't banned by my ISP. If it were it would have shown website is blocked but instead it's just taking forever to reload.Cheers,DYING_S0UL",

Even when I visit threads loaded with a lot of images, it still does not take time to load them all up. Since you are sure the issue is not from your network, it could either be the browsers that you are using or your network provider still blocking something that's making your experience such slow browsing on the forum. You can either try accessing the forum from another gadget, another browser, or even another network provider and see if the issue will still continue; if it does, maybe it could be as a result of the server being down in some location, and you might also be affected, as shown by the image from the above member, so you can try using some VPN and change your location to see what happens next.",

It is kind of weird and can't be able to troubleshoot what caused it since it's resolved on its own in a few minutes but as we discussed it's probably due to the local issue and for the record my internet speed was just normal and every other site works perfectly normally. Also checked the network speed which is more than enough to stream 4K video with no issue at all.But as I said it happened once and lasted very short so didn't know the exact reason.",

My point is, it's not as it was before.On my side, BTT is working great I think there must be an internet problem but If it is not according to your post It might be a cache problem try to clear it or try to change the browser or try to change the device if it still not work for you then try to use VPN and if you are using one and if you are using one already then try to run the website without it. I hope this will solve your problem, you will get a better answer from your local mates because the problem might be in your country so your locals can make sure if there is really a speed problem at the local level or what. But at a global level there is no problem.I was going to suggest other solutions too but many members have already suggested that so.",
