The most recommend way to buy Bitcoin p2p is using a decentralized exchange like Bisq. By using Bisq you can easily buy Bitcoin p2p without even doing any kind of KYC verification.Other way to buy Bitcoin p2p is by using centralized exchanges, this way of doing p2p buying/selling is preferred to those who don't worry much about doing KYC verification. Most people use Binance as a centralized exchange for p2p trading.Why to choose Bisq? It's safe and full of privacy as compare to centralized exchanges.Why to use Binance? It allows you to buy Bitcoin with wide availability of fiat currencies.",

That's one why for the KYC verification so as to keep the system functioning effectively.There are also brokers or gurus both in this community and in the real world who help individuals achieve their dream of owning some BTC ETF, and since the launch and approval of ETF projects it becomes necessary to own some and have someone with the right information or updates or signals about the cryptocurrency world and its market season.",

(no i dont mean end user investing) you need to be involved as both a sponsor and a AP(authorised participant, aka agent/broker) of a regulated ETF(if you dont want to become an ETF itself, which is a harder hurdle to climb)acting as the sponsor, you get to buy some bitcoin and deposit it into a regulated ETF's custodian, only after signing up with the ETF to be a sponsor and AP for them.., then on the ETF's custodian receipt of coins in custody its then for the ETF to hand you a basket of shares which you then acting as a AP(broker) of the regulated bitcoin ETF get to sell shares to end user investors wanting sharesthose shares are not ownership claims of btc for the end user investor. and if you are able to gather enough shares back(unsold or bought back shares from end user investors) to form a basket again, you would need to request a redemption from the regulated ETF if you want to close your position as a broker, the ETF CANNOT dissolves the shares to give you BTC(in-kind), they have to unlock and sell the BTC and give you cashin short by entering coin into an ETF you lose control of BTC and wont get it back. you will instead get cash back if you wanted to redeem a basket of shares via dissolving said shares to exit the ETF via the sponsors back doori feel people like you purposefully say stupid crap, hoping someone will correct you so that you can learn without doing any research on how things actually workstop being lazy and do the research next time, dont act like a baby wanting to be spoonfed",
