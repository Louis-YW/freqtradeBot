Take a look at how people here respond to the tokens you created, there really isn't a positive response and that's true. My advice, value your time to think of revolutionary ideas for the advancement of the crypto industry, not like this $ATC. The website of $ATC also looks so simple, if there's no money to develop a project, don't do it, mate. It will be useless in today crypto era.",
