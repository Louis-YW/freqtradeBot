      "body": "What exactly is the mobile credit you are using is the prepaid load to buy Bitcoin? I tried to check the Coingate about this it seems it was already been deleted.I think you are talking about a mobile top-up where you can buy BTC using a load?I search a bit but it seems there are only two options where you can use that mobile credit and exchange it for Bitcoin. Paxful and localbitcoins are the only options you have.If you are going to buy on Paxful just use the search button when selecting payment methods and use the keyword \"mobile recharge\". The only problem is most of the offers there are 80% above the market.",

      "body": "If you are talking about mobile top-up then you may try Binance p2p trading. I have seen there are traders who offer to buy/sell Bitcoin for mobile top-up. Although I sell for bank transfers, and never try mobile top-up. But it should work since all options work well. However centralized exchange always risky comparing with Decentralized exchange. Try with small amount and use with caution.",

Did you mean this service https://coingate.com/gift-cards/?If this is the case, then you can try this service that I have been working on for a while in this forum Service URL: https://www.coinsbee.com/en/mobile_top-upBitcointalk URL: Coinsbee.com - Buy gift cards with about 50 crypto currencies!Account URL: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2667213they have 0 Scam feedback and working more than 2 years, so maybe trying them will be better than p2p trading as there are some sellers who sell stolen credit or illegally one.",

      "body": "Seeing coingate's ANN about this, OP could be talking about mobile credit in a postpaid plan which means they will be charged in their bill. If so, that's even harder to find. I'm not expecting it to be in demand either with all the additional fees... I do hope you have some sort of situation for this because there are cheaper and more accessible means to buy bitcoin.I'd say look into your local exchanges and if there's none offering the same thing, thats probably all there is.",
