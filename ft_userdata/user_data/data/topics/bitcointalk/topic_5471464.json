I make fitness jewelry and if there is an interest, I can design and manufacture Bitcoin jewelry too. To make things more clear, please see this work of mine:If anyone here also loves fitness and bodybuilding, I can sell this jewelry to you. But since everyone here loves bitcoin, want to hear your honest opinion, would you buy something like this with bitcoin logo? If there is an interest, I can make this happen!",

I don't see it as flexing. I do it to illicit people to ask me about Bitcoin. I don't go around broadcasting how much I have or don't have. But I really do not see it as any different than wearing anything - everything cost something or broadcasts that you have an interest in something that costs something.

The more normal we make Bitcoin seem, and the more people see the logo the more adoption we will have. We can't live in the shadows forever. Just be smart about it.

It is funny....  I wear a Bitcoin t-shirt daily.  All 3 cars have various forms of B1TCOIN license plates.  I try to advertise daily.   HOWEVER, once Bitcoin starts to climb, I fear the reaction of the non-Bitcoiners.   That being said both my wife and I are not renewing the license plates and I will slowly stop advertising as the economics of this country catch up with the majority of the public.   I started off strong on pushing the narrative of Bitcoin to all whom I could, but again shortly I may stop doing so.",

Fiat is the monetary energy of the collapsing slave system. Bitcoin is the monetary energy of the emerging system of cryptographic enabled freedom.  The masses fail to grasp their fiat is not bitcoin and will never spend like bitcoin. A car with a bitcoin logo sticker is a car with a bitcoin logo sticker. The only difference is it reveals your hand and your affiliation to potentially a technology that may become censored and oppressed. maybe it depends where you live. I dont have that issue here. I will not hide my beliefs - that is guaranteed. Everything I do in Bitcoin is above board and on the books. Again, I never say how much I have and if someone thinks a logo alone is grounds to rob someone, they are likely to lose.Quote from: turbodogma on October 25, 2023, 03:55:39 PMI wouldn't wear a ring or jewellery with the bitcoin symbol on it but a useful lightning ring made with gold that operates like the bolt lightning ring would be interesting I have the bolt one - pretty cool.",

For gold version, we still use the same material but cover that in a thin layer of gold, so it's technically still silver and there is a tiny price difference between silver and gold-plated versions. The silver ring costs 55 dollars, silver Bracelet costs 65 dollars, silver necklace costs 65 dollars, pin costs 45 dollars. For gold plated version, you have to pay 10$ more.",
