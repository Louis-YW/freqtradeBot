  "content": "In the reputation board, I saw many accounts been red-tagged because of having transactions to a single wallet from many wallets that have been used in the same bounty campaign. Maybe those transactions from the same person have multiple accounts or a different people I do not know. But I saw most of them claiming that they sell their crypto to a local buyer which lead to this confusion. It is not possible to verify who is actually telling the truth and who is not so I am suggesting honest hunters and newbies use P2P trading features to sell your crypto for your local currencies. I think major exchange like Binance, Kucoin, Bybit offer a wide variety of local currency and payments methods for their P2P traders. This will prevent you from being red taged if you really do any P2P trade to your local buyers because it is possible and logical that some hunters could sell their crypto to that same buyer.",

      "body": "As your topic said, P2P, meaning it is pair-to-pair trading which means most of the time, but in this case, you may not trust the buyer, a middle person is always needed and it has to be a trusted person to avoid scam attempts by any of the traders. Most of the trades that happen here require an escrow (middle man) to ease transactions and sometimes, people do trust the other traders due to the reputation they built here but the bounty hunters are always clear of cheating, you hardly see them use an escrow or trade here on bitcointalk and you expect people to believe you.I have seen cases where BNB between two accounts transactions are ignored but there is one dubious thing you see happening between two or sometimes up to 10 accounts( often operated by one person) sweep tokens from all the addresses into a single address and then send them to an exchange, these are most likely farming accounts that are robbing companies and making other participants earn less.If not that they are always lying, we would have seen cases of the buyers running from with their tokens but you hardly see them complaining about that and these transactions are always input transactions without an output. If you feel you sold a token to a buyer, you should receive something in exchange for that like BNB, ETH and so on but no, it is always the buyer that always received tokens from different users.",

In my country we have many crypto buy sell groups where people buy and sell crypto at their own risk and group admin became the middle man. Sometimes scamming happens with these type of transaction but people still do trade here in these way. Personally I do not use these methods though I know some buyer that's why I suggest bounty hunters to use P2P methods through any reputable crypto exchange.Quote from: Upgrade00 on May 10, 2022, 05:37:02 PMQuote from: DVlog on May 10, 2022, 04:31:02 PMit is possible and logical that some hunters could sell their crypto to that same buyer.It is very possible and is considered in different cases, I'm on DT2 and I consider it.

Though I think most of them are actually multi-users and bring all of their tokens in a single wallet before selling them without knowing they could be caught. Still, I think there are a few who actually unaware of these circumstances and made that mistake. Later they failed to provide any solid proof and TBH proofs can also be fake and made so I do not want to defend anyone regarding this concern. Just create these threads so that some newbies can be careful when doing such things.",

But if there is more solid evidence then transactions keep a role. At least I am not tagging anyone for this wallet connection reason for a long time. Everyone can't use p2p as you said on Binance or other similar platforms. Because tokens should have been listed on that exchange to be eligible for p2p trading.",

I am kinda scared in doing big transactions through P2P to someone I don't know or I cannot trust unless there is a trusted escrow.However in my local city, I did P2P to a couple of guys in big amounts whom I trusted the most without any problems at all via face to face meetup.
