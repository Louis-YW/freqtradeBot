  "content": "Happy new year everyone, I am very glad that as many of us who made it to this year made it, and hope the new year brings unimaginable blessing our way going forward.. Amen. Now, I have something I wish to share concerning the sudden crash we experienced yesterday, which saw bitcoin crash to around 40,000+ from $45,000+. Bitcoin so far have very much recovered, but Now.. What do you guys think about that sudden crash?What do you think was playing out?  Do you really think it was all about Matrixport's report saying all bitcoin spot ETFs will be rejected by the SEC? No, not at all, it's all a game plan, a strategy to make us panic short and spot sell our bitcoins. In crypto, learn not to care much about sudden flash crash, as long as its bitcoin we are talking about, but care more, and be most afraid of slow bleed.. I will explain this below - read on. Investors responds to flash crash, faster than they respond to slow bleed, flash crash is a tool that is used to instigate fear, panic, causing the chicken hearted to instantly (without hesitation) dump their position(bitcoin). Flash Crash is a tool also used by market makers to flush out over-leveraged traders, and trader who are longing late. So after the flash crash, the market mostly recovers in no time or after a very short period of time, and those who sell their spot or short; out of panic always end up as losers. What we investors, should be mostly afraid of is slow bleed, for this is the silent killer. Now, this is an analogy that is scientifically proven to be true -  \"Place a rat in a boiling water and it will jump out immediately, but place it in cold water and be heating the water slowly, the rat will remain in that water until the water gets too hot and kill it.\" Humans are reactive to sudden sharp changes in stimulus, but extremely dull and unreactive to things that occur over a long period of time.When they want us to sell, because it's a good time to buy, they will implore the flash crash strategy, causing several investors to panic sell, thereby, giving them the opportunity to buy cheaper. By when they want us to hold, so they can silently sell at a good price, they'll typically bleed the market slowly, not alerting us - leaving us with a persistent optimism that \"reversal is coming\", until will find ourselves in the middle of a bear market, with no possibility of selling without incurring a huge financial loss. Note that every thing I said here about flash crash and slow bleed is  specifically in relation to bitcoin investments, a flash crash for altcoins may completely mean a different thing, which for example could mean a rugpull, bankruptcy and so on.So lets learn to note that, things won't be always as they seem, market makers and manipulators will always try to take advantage of the chicken hearted investors, learn to be know when to sell, and buy back cheaper later on, and when to actually hodl, because big things are coming and they want you to sell so they could buy cheaper.",

Hodling is a lifestyle, not a plan.Well your approach of buy, lock up, and live suggests a laid-back strategy. Instead of stressing over short-term ups and downs, you're embracing the idea that Bitcoin's value might skyrocket in the long run. It's like letting your investment ride the waves without getting too caught up in the day-to-day fluctuations. The idea is to enjoy life while trusting in Bitcoin's potential over time. Goodluck!",

It wasn't yesterday, it was 2 days ago and it was down to $41.5k or better said the drop was at most -4.5% which is not categorized as a \"crash\" in bitcoin market.QuoteWhat do you guys think about that sudden crash?What do you think was playing out?  It wasn't a crash, a crash would be going to $39k and below.Such small drops are normal after a big rise, specially when the momentum to rise more stops. The short term traders sell to take their short term profit out and get ready to rebuy in the follow up dip.QuoteDo you really think it was all about Matrixport's report saying all bitcoin spot ETFs will be rejected by the SEC? No, not at all, it's all a game plan, a strategy to make us panic short and spot sell our bitcoins. FUD can always contribute by causing a panic sell but when it comes to ETF, people still don't care enough to sell because of its rejection let alone because of some random post about possibility of it. Keep in mind this is like the hundredths time SEC has rejected different ETFs.Quote\"Place a rat in a boiling water and I think it's a frog not a rat Bitcoin is too volatile for your theory to apply here though.",

I appreciate the analysis but do people actually really care about this now or everybody just repeats the same old lines about bitcoin and the supposed elite who want you to short-sell so they can fill their bags?I hope that newbies come up with some fresh ideas and perspectives because these arguments have been hashed and rehashed umpteen times on the forum. I dont think anybody is out there to get your bitcoin from the common people. What the governments would really want is for those miners to just shutdown and people to stop taking bitcoin seriously. The so-called elites could not be less concerned about whatever us plebs hold. Those of them who really want to get in on the game are the ones buying up Michael Saylor's debt bonds.The market has matured enough in terms of volatility that nothing can be explained by whale actions now. The news cycle definitely affects the market just like everything else. Those who want to hold, hold. Those who want to trade the chops, do it at their own risk. There is no great conspiracy theory behind it all. Just that its an ecosystem that needs to keep running.",

It is about 10% correction that is better than many Bitcoin corrections I witnessed since 2017. It is not too deadly correction in my opinion but correction itself is very good for a bull market.Because this market has many people, who are smart, stupid, greed, FOMO, fear and so on. Corrections are necessary to clean up the market, to kill greedy people who gamble with leverages. When they are out forcefully by market crash and liquidations, the market has better conditions to continue its bull run, with less selling pressure.QuoteWhat we investors, should be mostly afraid of is slow bleed, for this is the silent killer. Investors must do some basics for their investment.Store their bitcoins in self custody wallets.Don't use leverages because margin calls are harmful or even deadly for their position and money.With these basic strategy, investors won't be affected by short term corrections of Bitcoin if the trend is bullish.",

Reason why is because generally alot of investors keep averaging down, and they have a horrible average and huge position even the stock/crypto still keeps dipping. Eventually what will happen they won't be able to take the pain anymore and they will just sell. Or they will just sell out of boredom.Most investors don't use high leverage or stop losses where flash crashes would cause the most financial damage.

I will just left it, and most of the time, it will recover. Tho I will still sell it lower than when I entered the market but it still just a small loss. But when 'slow bleeds' happened, my instinct will lead me to do averaging down, buying more of those coin/investment. But then I realize that I loss too much and there are few times I finally give up and I loss more than when the flash crash happens. All that being said, whether it's flash crash or slow bleed, if a traders have good money management and emotional management, and obviously they can do good analysis on the market they won't be 'killed' by any type of crash, sure they might suffer from some loses but it will not be fatal.",

Happy New Year! First off, great and informative post you got here going, there's not a lot of people who know much about the difference between the two, let alone their existence in the first place so contents like these are surely helpful in opening the people's eyes. Now back to your questionsThe thing is that for me, they both are equally as deadly and damaging, but for different locales for that matter. Flash crashes will affect people with paperhands, people who are in it for the quick profit and will sell their spot immediately at the first sight of a dump. On the other hand, slow bleeds will affect those who have diamond hands in this industry—people who are known to hold all throughout the rain and the storm in the name of crypto and profit. Not because they are dull and unreactive to the consistent drops, but because they have complete faith in the cold that they hold. It's way easier to spot a flash crash, a slow bleed is harder to figure out but it's mostly circumvented by the market's pulse anyway so it's not as damaging as most people make it out to be, but it definitely puts a dent to your portfolio especially if you're not careful enough to do audits and shit.At the end of the day, I'd still rather be a diamondhand in the midst of a slow bleed than be a paperhand that yanks at the sight of a dump. Especially when it comes to bitcoin who is cyclical in nature always having a stake in it regardless of the market's situation is going to be the smartest and best thing that I could do for myself.",

Even if it was a strategy or a game plan to cause panic in other for investors to sell of their coins, a good and long term crypto investor doesn't really need to be moved by such a report more especially a Bitcoin investor because even if spot Bitcoin ETFs ain't approved by SEC it doesn't really make any much difference as Bitcoin will still continue to soar among other cryptocurrencies.",
