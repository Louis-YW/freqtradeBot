I do see the public keys.The locking script for early P2PK outputs is simply as follows:Code:OP_PUSHBYTES_65 PublicKey OP_CHECKSIGSo simply look at the locking script, remove the 0x41 from the start and the 0xac from the end, and you have the public key.Quote from: cyberterrorist on December 25, 2022, 10:10:07 PMThis effectively cuts your security in half.This is a pretty misleading statement. Even with a known public key, the best known attack would require 2128 operations, which is so far outside of the the realms of possibility it is not even worth considering. Any additional security which comes from having an unknown public key is the difference between deducing your private key being \"impossible\" and \"no really, it's impossible\". There are millions of bitcoin held on P2PK outputs which have known public keys, on reused P2PKH addresses with known public keys, and P2TR outputs now use public keys directly rather than pubkey hashes, so also have known public keys. The whole point of public keys is that it is perfectly safe for them to be public.Yes you shouldn't reuse addresses, but this is a privacy issue, not a security one.",

This is not Tre, the address was used many times.There is an important distinction to make here.If an address has only received coins, then the public key is unknown (unless the owner has revealed it in some other way). Whenever coins are sent from an address, then the public key is revealed. This is the case for all recent P2PKH (pay to public key hash) outputs.However, the transaction being discussed in this thread is not paying a P2PKH output. It is paying a P2PK output. Rather than paying to a hash of the public key (which we encode as an address), it is paying to the public key directly. As soon as a raw public key has received coins, then that public key is revealed on the blockchain.Quote from: PrivacyG on December 26, 2022, 01:06:01 PMAs the real Satoshi, you can not make so many gaffes.  He is clearly just a con artist.  Gathering control over one of the first addresses used by Satoshi is Craig's dream.100% this. If CSW ever did provide a valid signature (he won't), then given his long history of technical incompetence, plagiarism, poor knowledge regarding how bitcoin works, and multiple blatant and child-like forgeries, the balance of probabilities makes it exponentially more likely he has simply found the private key belonging to an early block as opposed to him being Satoshi.",
