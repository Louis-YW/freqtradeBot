Bitcoin, without a doubt.That's very reassuring, hopefully the cycle will continue to repeat in the next halving period. I also choose BTC if I have more funds to invest. In addition I have two other altcoin options such as ETH and BNB. I think they are the altcoins that are most able to survive when the market is bearish at the moment. Even though BNB still look new I think they are strong. Where as ETH I've witnessed from btc, ETH is the most survivable altcoin to date. This is not an investment suggestion, but I chose the 3 coins above. For other coins I think short term would be safer.",

Best project to invest that will explode and follow the bear market???If you mean after bear market then probably most altcoin will move in same direction and grow with proportional percentage. Only few them will grow higher than normal but I will invest on top project on it's own industry like AXS, Near, Avax and Mana. I really believe they will exceed there old ATH once this current bear market is over.",

IMO, those suspected to become Ethereum killers will most likely boom during a bearish time, the important now is to have a good network that can be useful more than Ethereum and Bitcoin, SOLANA, and might BNB will leading on the list.  Though it's time for you to have your own research first before concluding such theories, investment in altcoins might be high risk and you should have to be careful with it, especially the pump and dump altcoins.",

If you are asking for a coin which has the highest potentials, no other than bitcoin. But i cannot give you an assurance that it will totally start to surge right after a bear market. Still, bitcoin will always depend on the current market trends and events. However, compared to other coins in the market, bitcoin has always an edge because it simply dominates the whole crypto market, and is always has the highest value among others.",

Im with this on where it would be Bitcoin always and there's no doubt on that too and the rest of the coins in the market will surely follow.In terms of trend then we know that Bitcoin would always be the lead.In regarding of the question on what coins would going to explode then no one really knows because if someone do knows on what would happen then he would make out himself rich into this market without any hiccups. This is the hardest part on doing trade on where you do all your best on choosing the best coins which could possibly deliver out possible big profits out of your investment.",

Because can't mislead you by emphasising or portraying that this coin among other cryptocurrencies is next to get elevated after bearish or at point of bearish market of cryptocurrencies. And it's quiet understandable and acknowledgeable that cryptocurrency without bitcoin getting supported of upliftment no any other coins can rise like bitcoin.",

Honestly, no one gets to predict correctly what will happen right after the bear market. It might be a new bull run or maybe this long bearish market will continue. However, bitcoin will always be the best asset in the crypto market and i think majority will agree on it. But you should start buying it from now and hodl in your wallet until you witness the market turns bullish and by that time, selling will be more reasonable.",

Asking about which crypto will skyrocket after this bearish market. Actually, the main answer is Bitcoin, see from the previous bearish and bullish era, Bitcoin always proves the fact that this is always exploding after the next halving. But, once more, this still doesn't guarantee at all because none knows the future, there are only some predictions.But at least, we can lower the risk wth Bitcoin.If you are asking about altcoins, I can't think except Ethereum and BNB,probably they will have higher chances than others.",

Ethereum was called bitcoin killer, but it did not do anything close to that, neither was it meant to because this name came from a group of ethereum bag holders with only profit in mind. Now the term ethereum killer is coming more into view and Solana has been called the same by such same group of bagholders whose job is to pump every new coin and use the hype of sell on the newbies and exit.Hence if you are investing in those coins, exit before you go into the euphoria state. For long term holding take bitcoin and dont stay with said altcoins for too long. You never know which coin is going for the exit scam in the middle of the night.",

Like I believe ETH has a huge chance to blow up, because I believe that during the next bull run, we are going to not just have some smart bull run helping everything to go up a lot, but we are going to have ETH 2.0 by that time as well which would increase the chances of making a ton of money as well.This is not really a bad thing, it just means that we are going to end up with a great result for ETH because it will have 2 reasons to go up, versus most of the market which will have one, the bull run. So, I believe that personally ETH is the best thing we could invest right now.",
