And thank you Bitcointalk.Though it good for family members to aid you in achieving your dreams but however I don't see it as tangible enough for a contribution for an investment of this nature because I know how you must have tried to convinced them before they were able to put it in consideration and decides to contribute money for you to buy Bitcoin. Investing in Bitcoin is an achievement every bitcoiner would want to have but in the quest to buy Bitcoin shouldn't make us go extreme in trying to convince someone or a group of people on the need for them to raise funds for you in order to purchase it. But notwithstanding, seems you've got a very nice family for them to contribute in order for you to be happy because I know you're very happy now that you've bought Bitcoin. You would have also made a more clear and precise detail image(s) of how you bought your Bitcoin.",

Just don't be complacent and start earning money! (unless you're in school.)",

My only advice is that, don't ever do panic selling, instead accumulate Bitcoin as much as you can then enjoy the profit whenever new all time high happens. You could also look for services that offer bitcoin in return for you to have more bitcoin aside from waiting for someone to help you. You could start ranking up your account here by posting threads that are worth the merit to easily rank up and join any signature campaign that will fit your rank.",

From your post I saw how eager you are just because of the halving coming which is not kind of good because you are actually focusing on the profit side of bitcoin only without taking into the risk side. This money given to you by your parents doesn’t look like something you can afford to lose which is one of the focal points of buying bitcoin. Also since you already have the funds with you, I will advice you keep it in your local currency first and then go and have the basic knowledge of how to buy the bitcoin yourself from any exchanger and then set up a personal wallet by yourself, this way you don’t need to trust even a friend to do this things for you as it will be risky to do so",

And do you expect that with that $90, bitcoin will make you millions? Because honestly, 90$ invested in bitcoin won't make a big difference to you, you need to invest more than that. Instead of sitting there and wishing, I think you should find a job, work hard and you will have money to invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin's journey is still very long and we still have a lot of opportunities, not only is the bull season coming and then everything will be over. Don't think and have such a short-sighted view, it can easily cause you to make hasty and wrong decisions.",

Many holders doesn't have that kind of mental strength to hold long. As a matter of fact, they start  selling when price starts to drop. Just buy and hold. Halving is near and I'll make the price go up again. The only thing you'll wish why you didn't bought more.I bought some when BTC was at 26k$ and now it's 42k$.",

Since you are able to invest in Bitcoin because of your parents, I congratulate your parents. All parents should be like your parents and encourage their children to invest in Bitcoin. But your parents got it right and invested in Bitcoin at the right time. Every parent should keep their children invested in bitcoins for future savings.But I request you to keep the bitcoin invested by your parents in proper wallet. Nowadays wallet security is very important and you must be careful about this security. So that your wallet passphrase can never be hacked, keep it in the right place in the right order.",

Congrats on your investment with Bitcoin, I would just like to say that do not feel FOMO with others' experience in the crypto industry especially with Bitcoin cause it might lead to impulsive decision-making. Good thing that your parents are supportive of you cause any amount would do as long as you know what you are doing in this industry, hopefully, you could make a profit with that amount. I suggest that this month there's a lot of opportunity to make money like having a part-time, from that you can use those funds for your investment journey so you can be consistent with your investment.",

I would suggest you to learn about Bitcoin buying and storing it safely in a wallet yourself because in the world of crypto-currencies trusting someone else is always going to be a risky thing. If someone gets access to your private keys then they can do whatever they want with your Bitcoin.Although, you have taken a good step by investing into Bitcoin but it seems like that you don't have much knowledge about Bitcoin storing or how to have your own personal wallet or how to purchase Bitcoin your self. I would suggest you once again to learn about Bitcoin purchasing yourself it's not that hard and then you should also try to learn about Bitcoin wallets. I suggest you to learn about Electrum wallet and air-gapped systems. You should also try to save your private keys and seed phrases secretly because if someone gets access to those then they can transfer your Bitcoin without your knowledge. When it comes to private keys and seed phrases then it's better to store those at 2 places one should be a proper SSD or flash drive that only you can access and that should be totally disconnected from internet based system and the other should be a paper. I would also suggest you to not keep your Bitcoin at online exchanges.",

Furthermore, do you have plans to invest in bitcoin, or do you just want to own some bitcoin before the halving just to satisfy your curiosity? I think that in order not to disappoint your parents, you should have a plan and do something now to create a result that makes your parents proud of you. That's something you need to care about more than showing off to everyone that your parents gave you money to invest in bitcoin.",

I don't discourage you or say that asking for help from your family and friends is wrong, but you should not always hope that they have something to give you. Or, the important thing is, you should know the weight you have. Just because you have capital for investment from others doesn't mean you will not be careful in what you do. You should think about the people that support you.Don't hope that your investment will have an earnings return.

Which means you're not putting in consideration what is required for investment. mind you I'm not tryna criticize your action but make correction. instead of rushing to buy when you don't have something that you can do without is really bad but at least you got something so congratulations to your achievement.

It is good to use your own money to invest and not other people money, so that you will be able to grow your investment. This is because I don't think that your parents will still give your another funds to buy bitcoin.
