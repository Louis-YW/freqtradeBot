And why is this mostly done by a certain niche of coins like xxxxx finance, xxxx inu etcIs marketing crypto coins the good old fashioned way obsolete?Wonder what would happen if dogecoin started burning Coins with its huge support base already on standby.... credit: CryptoInsightsX",

These burning mechanisms have became a trend when companies and projects like BNB has found success on it and the same goes for Ethereum which was one of the latest upgrade that it has got. These marketing ploys that these meme coins are putting with their burning of tokens, it's not really going to work at these times but if they do this on a bull run, there's a chance that it will really attract more investors.",

Don't banks/governments print money or take old coins out of circulation? Don't shares and other publicly tradable assets do the same to keep their values in shape/ to stay agile and relevant in the market? They just call it different or not at all - is the act of buying back stocks/shares so they can keep a low volume circulating, in hopes that will incfrease demand and value. But it can happen the other way around, so is not really a safe or proven practice. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. As in other corporate stocks, this activity can have also its negative - in stocks it happens to backfire and we all know it happens in crypto as well. We just hurry to call it scam here, but in my opinion is just normal activity in a free market, is all possible and whatever works...",

You wouldn't have this problem on the coin's economics, and you would rather focus on other important matters and less about the coin's price. Personally, I wouldn't buy these coins that has burning mechanism embedded towards it. It just doesn't sit well to me.",

I recall most projects tend to include the periodic burning of tokens to give holders a false sense of value or comfort that the value of the tokens would increase in the future, if they hold for a longer period of time.

Mostly of shit tokens were using this mthod caused by they didn't have actual usage. they are being created as a money grabber and so there's no way to create the hype other than doing self burn which doesn't even make sense to be done by so many scam tokens like that. Quote from: Woodie on October 31, 2022, 03:04:06 AMWonder what would happen if dogecoin started burning Coins with its huge support base already on standby.... Since doge coin has not premined coin as the developers of doge coin already sold their coins to bought old civic and it will never be possible for doge coin. The only possible thing to implement burning mechanism for doge coin like what already done by ethereum before it went to the POS.",

I think it is still effective to the current date that's why they are still doing it. Reducing the supply logically can bring up the value if it has enough demand. Just be attentive of those coins that are just burning and burning to just raise their value, I personally doubt those projects especially if they are burning for nothing.",

And the model of having a limited and small total supply means price of coin will be high and should demand rise, this certainly pushes price even higher.Quote from: super bako on October 31, 2022, 03:36:24 PMthe concept of burning is what investors are waiting for because they know from the end after burning their tokens, that there will be a significant increase even if not directly. the increase is only temporary but with the decreasing supply it is a good thing to hold on to long term. the more tokens burn up to 50% the more people buy in large quantitiesUnfortunately this burning of coins works well if both supply and demand are affected without any one side remaining constant.
