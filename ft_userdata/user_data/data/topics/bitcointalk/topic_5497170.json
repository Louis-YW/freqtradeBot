But it's important to note that Bitcoin was originally intended to be decentralized. Satoshi's primary goal in creating a decentralized currency was to empower users to act as their own banks, keeping their funds independent of governments or centralized entities. Despite this, many Bitcoin users today store or transact through centralized entities.Quote from: Floxynice on May 20, 2024, 08:11:03 PMI do not want to use bitcoin the centralized way, I want to have total control of my coins and be my own bank. Is this difficult to achieve?

It's your choice and there's no price to pay. Not everyone will move to centralization as Bitcoin is meant to be decentralized.",

Bitcoin itself is a freedom but people leave the freedom behind and chose after the value it add to them and as long money is made, they be like \"who cares\"?The fact that the rest chose to ignore decentralization, that's there problem, you can choose your own way, run your own Bitcoin node, buy a hardware wallet and be your own bank and support the network by running the node 24/7, you are adding value to the network and those who chose to use the centralized entities can continue to hide their password from a place they don't even own the private keys.",

Bitcoin by default allows you to hold your own money. There is no club you have to join haha. You just send your bitcoin to your own address. That's it.People use centralized services because they are used to them and care more about convenience that taking full advantage of Bitcoin, or for a lot of people they don't even know you can store bitcoin yourself. But in general most people are gonna choose convenience, so it is no surprise that lots of people choose to keep their bitcoin with custodians rather than do the little bit of effort to make a bitcoin key-pair and send the transaction, and then keep their private key safe and secure. As more and more of the general public buy Bitcoin, more and more people are going to be using holding their bitcoin with custodians rather than themselves.We can educate people all we want, but most people are still gonna choose convenience of 'banking' their bitcoin with an institution, even if its not particularly smart or safe. All you can do is decide what is best for you, so just make an address and send your bitcoin to it and you're done.",

Centralized platforms are considered like banks, with KYC and AML procedures and strict policies. They are the primary controllers of your assets and your private keys. Although many decentralized Bitcoin wallets are available for free, the most secure are hardware (cold) wallets that are not connected to the internet and can be purchased for a fee. Custodial wallets, on the other hand, are not safe if the centralized exchange gets hacked, users' data is collected, and their privacy is compromised. However, CEX users might be inexperienced or not fully aware of what they are doing, prefer using features like P2P trading or other types of trading, or want to take advantage of the offers provided by these CEX platforms... These may be some of the reasons besides their laziness.",

But if you're forcing other people to follow what you do, it will drain your life since each person has it's own need. The reason why most people choose to use decentralized exchange is the trading fees is cheap, you only need to pay 0.1% in centralized exchange, but you need to pay miner fees when you trade in decentralized exchange which cost around $0.5 or more. The prices to pay people to use decentralized exchange is the money, they don't want to lose their money due to miner fees.",

But you can locate such people in the forum who share the same ideology. Some members have never done KYC in any exchange because they have devised means of exchanging their coins. In this era where the government is enforcing KYC in almost all crypto-related service providers, it will be hard to avoid this centralized platform. But there are still some decentralized exchanges like Bisq that can help you achieve your goal.",
