  "content": "I have purchased a Ledger Nano x device one week ago, to get started in crypto.I bought it via Paypal.Now I am reading about how to use the device, I can see that there is a 4.25% transaction fee for buying and selling (!!)For every transaction, I assume. This fee is ridiculous and will eat most profit of anyone who buys and sells on a regular basis. I find anything over 0.25% ridiculous. I don't pay any fees at all to send money to anyone. I used to have a bank that charged 4% on the exchange abroad, and I left the bank immediately for this reason.The fee was not mentioned to me by Ledger and I will send the device back immediately if this is the case.If you exchange 100$ worth of crypto 5 times, a whopping 21% of the total value will be gone in fees.Which devices do you use and what are the fees?",

There are plenty of other options on the market, with way lower fees than those you mention, where you can make the purchase and move it from there off to your Ledger device in a jiff.The device is not the issue in terms of fees. What you need to do is use a cheaper Exchange, if that is the procedure you'll use to make the purchases/sells.In general, you’d need to look at the fees that are involved in buying, selling and withdrawals, as well as minimum amounts that may be required in any of those operations. Also bear in mind that credit card fees are way steeper than bank transfers in general, which is probably the case for the purchase. A fee around 4% is not unusual for card payments. Sell orders should be nowhere near that range.People will probably chip-in with their preferred choice of Exchange in terms of fees, functionality and (alleged) trading volume.",

So concretely.. My first purchase will be $500 worth of Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). If I understood you well, I can buy this on Binance first. Instead of buying directly via Ledger Live. I don't know what Binances exchange fee is though. https://www.binance.com/en/how-to-buy/hederaFrom Binance I can send it to my Ledger for a better rate? Or maybe no rate at all. If the 4.25% I saw was a purchasing fee and not a transaction fee, I assume it does not apply for moving HBAR from Binance to Ledger.",

The fees are stated here: https://www.binance.com/en/fee/fiatFee. For Euros, it seems that Visa/Master Card implies a 1,8% fee, which is lower than I expected (someone please corroborate, although it states it on their site). SEPA is 1€.Binance’s buy/sell fees can be seen here for spot trading:https://www.binance.com/en/fee/scheduleThe buy/sell fee should be in the 0,1% range for a regular user.Ledger supports a wide variety of coins/tokens, amongst which lies the one you mention. You can search here to see the minimum withdrawl and the associated fee, which are seemingly low.",

The thing is that the place for a discussion about altcoins is exactly where you opened your topic, and the fact that no one answered may give the best answer as to how important that project is.This is not a reason to mention the same project in the Bitcoin discussion or B&H, because it gives the impression that you are promoting this altcoin - and you also claim that all the big world companies have something to do with it, in one way or another. I stopped visiting that board a long time ago, and I'll tell you the reason - when I was a beginner and years later, I believed in some projects like the one that impresses you now, and they all disappeared as if they never existed.",

Buying with big amount or not, you can still feel the fees particularly buying from the sites referred by ledger live like changelly. As for the suggestion in buying HBAR on binance, your issue is not the withdrawal fee because it is surely cheap. But the fees of depositing fiat there either using card or bank or other payment options. Not to mention you will need a KYC (surprised nobody mentioned it). Although you can use P2P on binance but you need to be careful from scam attempt, though it's rarely happen but Yyou still need to watch your back.",
