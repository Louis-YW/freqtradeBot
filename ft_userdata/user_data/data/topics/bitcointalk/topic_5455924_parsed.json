Google don't care whatsoever about their users' safety or security. As Lucius says, for ever site that is taken down (eventually!), five more will take its place. I would also recommend uBlock Origin, but alongside that, simply stop using Google. You can't fall victim to Google's promoted scams if you simply stop using Google.",

But my question is, won't the ad blocker only protect you from seeing the Google ads at the top of the search results? E.g., if you do a search on 'Electrum website', this 'electrumcore.org' phishing site could still be displayed among the results. Not at the top of the page if it's an add, but further down in the search results. I doubt your Ad blocker can protect you against that.I just did as an experiment, and among the results I see electrum-web.com, which is a phishing site.",

Besides the fake telegram support another obvious sign that this is a phishing scam is that it is pretending to be a web wallet. These types of sites are constantly popping up. I doesn't matter what browser or search engine you use, these malicious URLs still show up in search results. The safest way to avoid this kind of fraud is by authenticating the signature on your download using PGP software. Telling people to verify downloads might not be the most user friendly approach but if someone wants to be financially responsible they owe it themselves to take a few minutes to learn the basics of PGP.",
