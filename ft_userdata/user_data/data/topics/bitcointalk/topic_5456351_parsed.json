But why can't you look for an investor or partner in your locality instead here. If you discussed with any of you friends they might buy the idea and join you. Because many people have come for such request and I don't think their request were having positive outcome.",

I do not have this amount to invest (just to clarify).I also believe that it is right to clarify what guarantees you have on this project, if you have a business plan created and in general how you intend to manage the various licenses/countries in which you want to operate (for example, do you already have agreements? Have you received any proposals?). this Smart contract has been already developed/tested or it's completely new (even here did you have any proposal?) just my 2 cents sats",

What are your investment to this project compared to your potential partner? Does it include anywhere around the amount you were asking for? Or only the idea, strat, etc.?With that great amount of money, are you ready to reveal your identity in case (s)he asks?",

I think he didn't like the questions bitbollo was asking or doesn't have an answer for them. makes me wonder how confident he was with his project, it also makes me think whether he is up to no good or not(no offense to OP), especially when he was asking for $500k-$1M from an investor.",
