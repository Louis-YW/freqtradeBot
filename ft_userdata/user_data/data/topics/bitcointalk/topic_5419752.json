      "body": "The Sports Leverage platform is launched with the sports leverage platform, users can place bets using multipliers 2 and 3, that is, the user's bet amount will be 2 or 3 times the original bet amount.To use the leverage platform, users must deposit collateral tokens. You can do this on the additional page of the site https://wcibets.club / just by connecting your wallet for example MetaMaskThere are 4 types of collateral tokens (USDT, USDC, SHIB and DOGE), and you can also deposit ethers as collateral. Source: https://t.me/Worldcupinuofficial/539249After you have made several deposits, you can try betting with multipliers.Let's say you have deposited 0.1 ether, 20 USDT, 20 USDC, 2,000,000 SHIB and 2000 DOGE and are trying to put 0.2 ether using a multiplier of 3.First, the system checks whether you have enough collateral for this bet.This is done by calculating the total cost of tokens in the ether.It uses the price of the uniswap token and calculates the value of all tokens in the ether using these token prices.Let's say the price of USDT is 0.001 ether, the price of USDC is 0.001 ether, the price of SHIB is 0.000001 ether, and the price of DOGE is 0.0001 ether.Then the total cost of these tokens will be 0,001 * 20 + 0,001 * 20 + 0,00000001 * 2,000,000 + 0,0001 * 2000 = 0,26 ether.The amount of your deposit is 0.36 ether, because you also deposited 0.1 ether.Since the amount of your bet is 0.1 and the multiplier is 2, the deposit amount must be at least 0.2.Your deposit amount is 0.36, so you can place bets.If your deposit amount is less than 0.2, you cannot bet 0.1 multiplied by 3.After you have placed a bet, some tokens are blocked. You cannot withdraw these blocked tokens.The number of blocking tokens is calculated as follows.The cost of each token is calculated on the air.0.1 ether = 0.1 ether20 US dollars = 0.02 ether20 US dollars = 0.02 ether2000000 shib = 0.02 ether2000 doge = 0.2 etherAnd these amounts are summed up until it reaches 0.2.Because 0,1 + 0,02 + 0,02 + 0,02 + 0,04 = 0,2, an amount equivalent to these amounts of ether will be blocked.That is, 0.1 ether, 20 usdt, 20 usdc, 2000000 shib and 400 dodge will be locked.The cost of tokens is calculated in the order of ETH, USDT, USDC, SHIB and DOGE.If you win the bet, these tokens will be unlocked and you will receive the same earnings as 0.6 ether.If you lose the bet, you will also lose these collateral tokens.You can also use this platform to securely store your tokens.",

      "body": "Who minted NFT SHIB's of football from $WCI could notice that the collection on OpenSea is not displayed and gives an error, according to dev, although the NFT contract was verified by Techrate, but as it turned out, the commission recipient seems to have been compromised, which led to the loss of 58 eth from mint money. Dev reimburses the losses from its funds and deploys a new NFT contract, in which users who have installed NFT will receive NFT with the same ID. I myself participated in the #1 minting phase and screwed 20 NFT SHIB's of football from $WCI, we are waiting for the minting to continue. This is what the transfer of NFT development to third parties leads to, I hope everything will be resolved in the best way, by the way, about 2000 NFT out of a total of 10k were minted at the first stage.Source: https://t.me/Worldcupinuofficial/585836QuoteHi everyone,So I would like to start off with “ FUNDS ARE SAFU” . As you may know our NFT contract is audited by Techrate (see below for full audit), yet our fee receiver seems to have been compromised, resulting in the loss of 58 eth from mint money (exact cause to be confirmed). I have the fee receiver on a separate new computer, which I think was compromised during exchange with the NFT dev.1) I will refund the ETH to the jackpot from my PERSONAL FUNDS2) I’m in contact with known devs suggested by trusted sources to redeploy the contract3) If you minted you will be airdropped the same NFTS (same token ID)4) Your funds are SAFU as I coded the dapp myself5) New fee receiver will be a physical ledgerI’m sorry for the turn of events. I’m glad this happened early during the mint with an amount I can cover.",
