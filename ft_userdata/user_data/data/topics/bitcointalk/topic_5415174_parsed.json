      "body": "It seems binance has anticipated questions like this, and they have a tool to verify if a domain/email/channel/phone is theirs:https://www.binance.com/en/official-verificationYou should check for yourself, but to me it looks like binance.me is also an official binance url. (by the way, if you want to be completely sure, you shouldn't click on the link i posted, nor copy/paste it, but actually type it in in a browser url bar. That way you're sure you're looking at binance's site....This being said: why would you take a chance on a .me domain? It seems it was indeed valid, but if you know the official page is a .com page, why don't you just use that one instead of taking risks?",

I wont set you up with a scam page.",
