  "content": "Miniscript is a language to define possibly complex spending conditions for bitcoin wallets.The Ledger bitcoin app supports miniscript policies since version 2.1.0, deployed in February 2023.QuoteVersions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 of the app incorrectly handle the a: fragment, causing the app to produce wrong addresses.In theory this is critical as the device is usually trusted to display the right address. In practice, the impact is limited, as there is no currently deployed wallet software with a full integration with such policies.Any other wallet not using miniscript, or any miniscript policy not containing the a: fragment, is not affected.Users who encounter issues related to spending Bitcoins can reach out Ledger Support.Source https://donjon.ledger.com/lsb/019/Read more in the detailed report by Antoine Poinsot https://wizardsardine.com/blog/ledger-vulnerability-disclosure/Although there are very few (users) who use such functions and will be affected by this vulnerability (this will only happen if you are using advanced hand-rolled tooling), it is necessary to upgrade to version 2.1.2.",

I assume it's got nothing to do with standard sending/receiving, generating addresses, etc. Could it be related to Taproot and the \"bitcoin tokens\" and ordinals? If I understood correctly, for a successful attack, the software you use would have to be malicious, hacked, or manipulated with malware. The second condition is that the user doesn't verify the address on the hardware wallet screen. Apparently, Liana is the only client where the Miniscript feature worked completely.",

I assume it's got nothing to do with standard sending/receiving, generating addresses, etc. Could it be related to Taproot and the \"bitcoin tokens\" and ordinals? No, Since bitcoin script is a stack-based language with too many edge cases, miniscript is the function representation for these stack-based scripts and designed for Tapscript (BIP342) embedded scripts.what is happen above is vulnerability enable bypassing some spending conditions which was not allowed in the previously generated script and thus enables a third party to the possibility of spending.Quote from: Pmalek on May 14, 2023, 04:31:09 PMApparently, Liana is the only client where the Miniscript feature worked completely.   even Liana is not effected because there is no release of it that allows the user to create descriptor that was affected by this vulnerabilityYou will find technical details, sources and more here https://wizardsardine.com/blog/ledger-vulnerability-disclosure/Quote from: https://wizardsardine.com/blog/ledger-vulnerability-disclosure/The Miniscript fragment a:X was incorrectly encoded by the Ledger Bitcoin application. Instead of translating to:Code:OP_TOALTSTACK X OP_FROMALTSTACKIt was encoded to:Code:OP_TOALTSTACK XThis opens the possibility for the spender to always provide the return value of the expression preceding a a: in a Miniscript. This implies any type of check (preimage, signature, timelock) preceding a a: may be bypassed (just feed a 1 at the correct place in the witness).",
