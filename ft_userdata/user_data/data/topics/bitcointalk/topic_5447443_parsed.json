The topic would fit in the Beginners and Help board so that it can easily be seen by newbies since they visit the board a lot.But it's really not necessary to add sensitive information to the home screen; instead, it should be hidden for security's sake. The day my friends encountered rubbers on the street, the rubbers collected their phones, and when they saw the banking app on their phone home screen, the rubbers asked them to open the app and transfer all funds to their account, and they made off with it and their phone.",

By having it on your home screen simply means anyone that have access to your phone or computer automatically have access to your forum account.",

It is Chromium-base browser and it broke its motto to build a browser for user privacy but later ask KYC to claim $BAT reward.Pin your profile on the home screen or on task bar is bad. It directly exposes it to anyone who by any means can access your devices. It is like you self-break a first protection for your account.Like you show them, I have a Bitcoin wallet on this smartphone, come here and see what you can deal with it.Important question, do you always log in your account on your devices?You did have bad practice but it is time to change it. In addition, you should sign a Bitcoin message (with Electrum wallet, available for Desktop and Android), stake it. Later you can use it as proof of account ownership and it is useful for your account recovery.How to sign a messageStake your Bitcoin address hereIf you want to use Electrum wallet[GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum",

It is true that your account in terms of rank and reputation is not worth much, but some other accounts for hackers would certainly have a significant value if they could be hacked and be in their possession for at least a few hours.Quote from: uche6215 on April 04, 2023, 06:07:00 AMI can use my self for instance, nobody knows what am doing with my cellphone people always think am chatting with someone or playing video game with my cell phone.

You may think that no one knows, but do you know who is looking over your shoulder - whether you are sitting on a bench or riding a bus, there are always curious people.

More importantly, is not good to share your cell phone with friends, especially the ones that contain your important details. Lol what?Nobody cares about our account?Tell me something, there are people with more than one accounts (let's take the case of jamalaezaz as that was the recent I remember due to his apology thread). If someone takes his mobile ffs, he/she would easily be able to get into his personal world and would get all the details of his alt accounts he is currently handling or have abandoned. That's one thing.However, those with single accounts like you (probably), me and everyone here would definitely not want our accounts to either be used or compromised and there are several things that one can add on their homescreen, like gambling websites where they gamble often, informative websites where they read a lot (like news sites), websites where they're learning something through online courses, etc. But nobody does that because if someone (even if your closed ones) know about it, where's the privacy here? Would you like to shout loud about what you've been doing in your life and keep things super transparent about yourself? Then it won't bother you, else you'll definitely not want to share your phone to anybody with all major things available on your home screen itself.",

More importantly, is not good to share your cell phone with friends, especially the ones that contain your important details. I slept in a co-worker's house recently because I needed to carryout a task at my work place the next day and staying with him will help me save some transportation cost. This guy almost made me scared because of they way he was staring at my phone. Each time I wanted to post on the platform he was always coming close to me and wanted to know exactly what I was doing. I had to go to a barbershop to take an unplanned haircut because I needed some privacy. The belief that nobody cares about what you are doing with your phone is not true. Currently scammers or hackers don't even need to handle your phone to carryout their nefarious activities, just looking at your phone is just enough. Adding my Bitcointalk profile to my phone homescreen is the last thing I would do because it cannot only attract scammers but criminals. Almost everybody knows that bitcoin is expensive and seeing bitcointalk on you phone screen might give criminals the idea that you own bitcoin. I have been introducing people to bitcoin and forum but there are some persons I will never tell that I have any relationship with Bitcoin.",

Be very mindful with your btt account mate. Btw, if your account is a member account there are people who wishes to have legendary account and I believe no legendary here would even try to do that shit on their profile by putting it on home screen so for me I care about my account if you don't know.",

Let's assume that you made this statement out of curiosity but how do you advise and convince a newbie that nobody cares for your account and because of this you shouldn't protect your phone by not giving it out to random people how?Your phone is your privacy and being a member here you ought to have learnt about the importance of security and privacy else you will easily fall for hackers or scammers who will likely gain access to your phone as a result of lack of security. In less then one minute a smart hacker will hack into your phone or system and all the information in your phone will be gone, I won't support adding bitcointalk profile to my phone screen because I will put my self in danger.",
