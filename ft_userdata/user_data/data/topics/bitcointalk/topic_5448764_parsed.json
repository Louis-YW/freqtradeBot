Last year it was amazing and the same as the year before! Last year BTC was clocking in at around 45k if I remember correctly. Now leading into the conference we are looking very bullish and I think we may have a chance to get to where we were at the 45k mark like we were last year, do you agree? Does anyone know of any special events happening at the conference this year? Last year they had the sound money fest as well, is there going to be another concert again like last year as well?",

Yes, around that price seems quite plausible. It looks like the worst of the bear market is over and we are following moderate and sustained rallies, although I suppose that with a month left, the price may be a little below that figure.",

I wonder if this conference has a large affect on the price of bitcoin, does anyone see a positive correlation of this? That would be pretty interesting to see actual proof that it does, if it actually does. Anyways, I personally think that it doesn't have a huge effect but there are lasting impressions scattered across the web every year with what has been discussed or the happenings of the event which always hit all the top social media / news company headlines and get posted viral but a copious amount of influencers/ consumers/ users.",

And in conferences like this, I think there is a high chance that what happened in the past will happen again, I'm just not sure if my feelings are right.     But anyway, no matter what the result is, I am sure of one thing that there is a high possibility that the value of bitcoin may be around 40k$-45k$ this time, although it is at 29k$ right now, but we know that it suddenly increases the value of bitcoin and suddenly drops.",

Sometimes I don't care about events or any conference in a specific country or place, because is not much hype that can make people buy more Bitcoin. Because as I know, the people who come there is experienced and expect crypto, distance i see new investor brings a lot of money and invest immediately after the conference finish. So that case, I won't speculate much if the Bitcoin price will growing up after the Event. Or maybe accidentally happen because the price should have grown up (because of a halving situation).",

It is a very optimistic outlook personally just wishful thinking, I just think that would be very cool. And who is to say that it wouldn't and couldn't happen? These days anything can happen.

I also said to my friend in whatsapp group that we may see 50k in near future ahead of bitcoin miami. I think price expectations will stay bullish if 30k resistance can toughen up to break.
