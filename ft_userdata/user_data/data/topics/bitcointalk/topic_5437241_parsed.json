Because web3 is still a virtual world.Tell me your opinions on Web3 and nft coin, let's communicate.",

Web3 just simply take the advantages back to the user where big company cant sell, rent or hijack their private dataWeb3 will definitely continue be developed. On github, there are thousands of on going projects and many companies play important roles in funding, research as well as promoting cryptocurrency to the people.",

      "body": "NFT and Web3 are quite interesting and promising technologies, but so far their finest hour has not come. By stardom I mean large-scale application, not mere speculation. NFT, in fact, got a bad name, because these tokens were used as a way to cheat and get rich quick, and very rarely as art or some kind of token that gives the right to something in real life. There are very few uses for them now.",

Both will continue to grow in the gaming world and will become more popular in mainstream art. I can see partnerships for gaming companies and artists left and right so it's only a matter of time before we see real or solid projects for web3 and nft.",

      "body": "NFT is even more useless compared with token or coin. There are a bunch of garbage NFTs that have no value being issued every day by unknown person. NFT is not as promising as people think. Web3 has not yet proven to be one of the interesting thing in the crypto sector and why? i don't see any usefulness from web3. I would call that BS rather than a tech that is exist in the market. You shall not be fooled by the word of web1 web 2 web3 etc. It's all that words were a way for people to create new hype by making new contents. QuoteThe term \"Web3\" was coined by Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014, referring to a \"decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.\" In 2021https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3Does any blockchain is web3?",
