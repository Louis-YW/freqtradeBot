  "content": "DirectBet was one of the first crypto sportsbooks of its kind in that no account or registration was required. Instead, you would simply send your bet to an address that represents the bet. If you won, they would send your winnings back to your address (or another user-specified address), and if you lost they kept it. It ran from 2013-2017 and did an honest closure, meaning they settled all bets (er.. most bets) before riding off into the sunset.Quote from: DirectBet on May 22, 2014, 08:01:58 AMFor those of you who prefer complete anonymity, DirectBet is the only Bitcoin Sportsbook where you can bet on sport events without an account and without providing an e-mail address. No deposit is required. You transfer Bitcoins per individual bet.http://www.DirectBet.euIt was pretty ingenious but they usually had slightly worse odds than regular bookmakers, I guess to compensate for the additional labor involved with manually settling each bet & paying for tx fees involved with each win. Back in the day I bet millions of Dogecoin on tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, it was a lot of fun.Am just wondering if there are any other casinos/sportsbooks currently in operation that employ the same kind of business model.",

      "body": "Nothing close to it this time. Even when the casino claims to be running on blockchain, somehow they ask users to register. But there are casinos where you can only connect your metamask, this I guess is the closest but are using ETH.It might actually be popular if there is another betting site like Directbet.eu again even with a not so favorable odds. Because at least you can be sure that no KYC procedure is to follow. Now that there is LN, I think it should be a good time to have something like this.It's the b building of its reputation however that will make it difficult to kickstart. Unlike before we are ready to just jump in and bet since the scammers are yet not exploiting the blockchain industry.",

      "body": "No, there's not successor to directbet.eu or at least that business model. Partly it might due to the crypto regulations that really killed that business model. Now you need to at least create an account to a crypto based platform. And then that casino will provide you with a address to deposit in order for you to play. Some casinos charge free for withdrawals, but for the majority, they will deduct it from your crypto before you can withdraw from the address that you want to. And on the side note, again as a offshoot of regulations, the casinos might ask you do to KYC if let's say you win big or if they suspect that something is not right with your account, i.e. they have suspicions that you are cheating or there is an intent to cheat.",

Also, @OP has been explained as well compared to a centralized casino they have worse odds compared to regular casinos. However, with a small casino like this they are running for more than 3-4 years is really great.Most the time not even more than a years.",

Weird to see they only accepted Bitcoin.https://100bookies.com/dbet-review/ I used to place large live bets at directbet.eu with DOGE (back when it was far less than 1 cent) because you could lock in the odds you wanted faster than waiting for a BTC transaction to confirm.I guess the era of direct crypto betting is now over.

Just imagine we can place bets without the need to do KYC or registration which will really help users who don't want to be complicated in doing KYC or registration. But even though the business model they offer is quite attractive, after all a business needs a continuous economic circulation and it seems that the management from Directbet.eu don't get that, so they have to close the business. Even so, the innovation they offer is very good, it's just that luck is not on their side.",

There were few sites that tried to follow directbet but none of them could survive. yes, on average, it never lasts for a few months, maybe not because it's not good, it's just that maybe casinos that are similar to the directbet concept don't have enough budget to hold campaigns for promotions and others, so it's hard to get active users so they have to close or it could be people prefer official casinos to create accounts and use KYC , as we can see directbet does not require KYC for all its players",

The reason for that is probably because of regulations and laws imposed all around for money laundering and stuff and casino businesses don't want to get in trouble and stay on the safer side because it's not easy to establish a business and then see it being taken down by the authorities.So casinos mostly have a centralized structure these days so that they can comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they operate. I think someone can actually try creating a business model like that, but I'm not sure if it will get enough success and recognition.",
