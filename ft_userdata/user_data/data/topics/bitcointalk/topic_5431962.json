  "content": "I was encouraged by this information  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5430921.msg61479047#msg61479047This guest house was inherited by my husband from his family,I run and manage it,it is located in a small village.After reading the information that cryptocurrency banned will soon be uplifted and legalize in Nigeria,I decided to help in fast adoption of bitcoin in my country by accepting btc payment from customers who came to lodge or entertain themselves in the guest house. I also want to use the guest house as a medium to give bitcoin awareness to customers that comes to the guest house,due to the fact that it is a place where different people from different places comes to entertain themselves in the evening.I am very happy for this new strategy and upgrade on how to serve my customers best next year on whatever form of payment,they will be using to pay for their accommodation. Yesterday evening, while I was checking one of the rooms,my bar attendant came to me that a customer wants to see me,meeting with him,he asked if he can make payment in btc for my service and I said yes. He opened up to me that he was on an assignment in research of some plants and he has already gotten a guest house where he is lodging but he has some challenges with them since they only prefer fiat currency which has been a challenge for him to meet up to his demands due to less fiat currency on him. He told me he will be spending up to a month in the village before going back to his state,he then asked how much is per night,which I told him and immediately he made a payment for twenty days with btc into my wallet,that he will move in the next day.I decided to come and share this experience with people in this forum about the luck bitcoin acceptance has brought to my business this festival period. The truth is that,I have never had any customer that have lodged for straight two weeks due to the environment where the hotel is located. What are your contributions on this new change and suggestion in accepting bitcoin,does it means that businesses are suffering from fiat entrapment ?",

Based on many statistic and research, Nigeria is the top 1 country with the highest usage of Bitcoin P2P platform and I think it's already become a new normal if people transacting using Bitcoin or accept Bitcoin payment on a merchant. Also the high inflation make it worse, people wouldn't protect their wealth in fiat.Unlike the other countries where inflation isn't really that high and many people still can't accept Bitcoin as a currency, so it force people to use fiat to pay anything in their country.",

But I am not losing hope that one day I will travel around my country to see stores that accept bitcoin.    It also brings uncommon joy and excitement to me each time I read about businesses accepting Bitcoin as an alternative form of payment. No matter how small or insignificant this effort might seem, it has the potency of spreading the gospel of Bitcoin. At least any customer that comes in would get to know that there is an alternative currency to the local fiat.I want to encourage you to keep up this good initiative, although you might not have regular customers but ensure you inform the few you come across about Bitcoin. You can even give a little discount to customers that are willing to pay with Bitcoin. I know most people in rural areas are unbanked, one advantage of this innovation is that these rural dwellers would have access to Bitcoin transaction services. Congratulations mate.",

The advantage that I see bitcoin gives businesses is that they will have more customers because nowadays, bitcoin is becoming more and more popular and widely used. Especially foreign guests, because they will not need to bring too much cash, nor need to convert to your national currency, and can use bitcoin directly, which is really convenient.But I want to ask, accepting bitcoin payments, will you continue to hold bitcoins in your wallet, or after receiving your bitcoin payment, will you convert to fiat immediately?",

Others would prefer to convert it directly to their own fiat because they need that money to add again to their capital as it needs to keep rolling, but there are also others that will be holding it for a short period of time when they need to buy supplies and will then use it. The majority of bitcoin adoption in business is to raise public awareness that you can pay with it, and if the owner's goal is truly to accumulate the bitcoin, he or she should be saving it to gain profit in the future.",

But anything to help expand the knowledge and use of Bitcoin is welcome. Bitcoin has been and is succeeding, but it didn't go in the right direction from the beginning with its original purpose, we considered it an investment from the beginning due to its volatility. Honestly, given its volatility, it is more suitable for investment than a payment method. Nobody wants to use their bitcoin when everyone knows its value is going to go up, and nobody wants to spend more bitcoin on a product when we are in a bear cycle.If bitcoin is not so volatile, I agree it should be used more as a payment method, but when it is too volatile, it is clearly not suitable.",

Many people don't like to lose their btc easily, not even in this bear market that it will rise in the future.Congratulations and we will never cease to hear this type of stories and testimonials They save their bitcoin and spend fiat.",
