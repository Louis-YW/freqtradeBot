Obviously, this is not a good start for any casino, I am afraid. Still, I am open to give the benefit of the doubt. Who knows, you could prove wrong...",

Don't have a test run during a LIVE operation.Several months since then, is the platform really ready for the actual operation? Don't rush if there are still lots of problems from minor to major. Running a gambling site is not a joke and since you have a concern about funding before, trust issues might be a problem and you might have difficulty finding and attracting users to play on your platform.",

What is still lacking from your site? Maybe you can give an idea about your casino site.

For sure he will continue this thread if he find a lot of response but if they see only few post on this thread maybe they create another one.",

It won't be the best decision to play at this casino with a decent deposit. A similar casino had appeared in the forum in 2021 with the same games, same UI and same signup option (ANN thread). But they had to close their business as it didn't get much popularity.Moreover, OP had created a thread a few months ago as he was looking for investors to manage the casino hot wallet: Looking for Investors for my Upcoming PvP crypto CasinoQuote from: vilely on February 16, 2023, 09:51:27 PMAlso I have already plans for the marketing, all we need is the money for the hot walletOP was looking for $5k only, which is very low amount for the hot wallet of a casino. Now it's up to you whether you will feel comfortable to play in such casino or not.",

Keeping your potential customers on suspense. Only two words \"coming soon\", have triggered the interest everyone here. The only time this strategy doesn't work is when Op finally comes with something below standard, many people will easily lose interest in the project. But if OP and his team manages to bring something substantial to the table, the project has a very great chance to sell.Op, as you have been advised by many, buy copper membership to enable you post images.",

The main issue seems to be related to bankroll because OP looked for investor months ago. I have no idea if he got some investors already but maybe he got some funds already so he created this new thread. I will not expect too much and will not waif for it to be launched officially because I think the OP is not really serious in having a gambling site if I look at how he describes to tell us about his casino.",
