Oh good that you have them in a hardware wallet and so you are not affected by the hack.But seeing it drop 70% because of this news, I know what you are you feeling right now. But it's hard to give you advise as we really don't know what the future holds for this project.Maybe it will go back and recover or continue to go down because of the hack.",

      "body": "ALBT holders will receive compensation (airdrop) from the team. This is specifically for holders who bought before the hacking incident at Bonq. According to them, there is no compromise on the smart contract from ALBT, but they will mint a new ALBT. Here are the details.Quote from: https://twitter.com/allianceblock/status/1620887765058727936Next Steps:1️⃣ A snapshot will be taken just before the attack2️⃣ A new ALBT token will be minted.3️⃣ All affected users will get an airdrop of the new tokens.NOTE: Any trades (buying and selling) done after this announcement will not be included in this compensation scheme!So, for OP, if you are still holding your ALBT, better to wait for the next update before selling yours, maybe you get better price after snapshot.",
