If there is no good reason, I request that the thread be unlocked. Thanks!",

There was no need for such topic, most of the posts in the first 8 pages could have discussed in the World Cup threads. The remaining 2 pages were filled with discussion that clearly fits  Football Transfers Speculation, Odds and Predictions. All the World Cup threads have been locked and I don’t think the moderators were wrong to locked your thread. It was a good report in my opinion.",

At this point it probably should just be renamed Sports Discussion.  I bet now the thread will receive hardly any comment/replies which proves that thread mainly used for spamming and nothing more but OP if you intention is not really to create spam but most users especially in gambling section took far away and I think many more threads should be moved in such a way to cut those posts from weekly quota.",

Oh no! From frying pan to fire. This is obviously not what I wanted.

Could a Sports Discussion child board be created so that we will all see how irrelevant the Gambling discussion board will be?Hilariousandco, you may decide to send the topic back to gambling discussion and lock it twice , it will be better than moving it to off topic. Locking the thread.",
