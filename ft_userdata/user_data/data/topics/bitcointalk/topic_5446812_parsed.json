You read the topics well and then post.But you want to know your comments why your posts are deleted? There are many reasons for post deletion which have already been mentioned by many.

Newcomers to Facebook and Instagram quickly learn how to use them because they know what they'll see and what their purpose is. But most people do not know how the forum works.Before making some posts, I think reading the rules is necessary, and, dear OP, you can read all the rules and regulations from the help tab, including what is what and how things work on BTT. Your account might be banned due to many factors, like instant bans only due to the usage of plagiarism content or if you are using AI tools and directly copying and pasting here. which harms the BTT's reputation because the internet is full of content, 90% of which is trash. That's why on the BTT, everything should be legit and contribute to the community or the community's members. I am not mentioning the same rules that previous members have already mentioned like Zaguru12 and hosseinimr93You should also try tools like the Telegram notifier, which makes you more active whenever someone mentions you. A notification will be shown on your Telegram handle. BitcoinTalk Notification BOT or you can use this guide to for more ease. How TryNinja's Notifier Bot Can Make your life easier. This forum is filled with wonders, the more time you spend on it the more you will explore and the more you will learn about BTC and how much this forum has contributed to the origin of BTC.",
