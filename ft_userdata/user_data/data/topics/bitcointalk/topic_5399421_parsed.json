Once trust is lost then community wont really be turning back or trust up no matter how Luna team will really be trying to cope up everything via means with those fork or  something in related with Luna specially to thosewho had lost up huge money specially to those who had bought on the peak.Well, its a very common story or scenario for project to have those depreciation or dump in price but not as bad as on LUNA which it dropped 100% which is considered devasting.Now the team is trying out to have some recovery plan? Trust isnt something that you could really able to assemble easily or take it back.",

Despite all the software development and the hardware behind this market at the end everything comes down to trust, once a form of money does not have the trust of the community then it does not matter what kind of promises the developers may try to make they will never recover that trust and their project will collapse sooner or later, by the way this is something that also happens to fiat currencies and we have seen a great deal of them collapse through history as well.",

I maked one rule for me, if something brings you down once, u should stay more critical and cautious, and its rule X2 when its fork on any crashed coins, also we know ETC and ETH, it was the same fork, but i we look now to eth, we can see that he make rebirthed with new life and feels good now",

Now whether you should buy this or not is up to you.Most likely it won’t be a top 10 coin anytime soon. Especially after all that happened. However many in a few years it might gain traction again. So might be a low risk high reward situation. Personally I would just stay away from it.",

I think both LUNA and LUNA Classic will not relate to UST but because the core team move to new LUNA, the future of LUNA Classic is very gloomy.It will be like Ethereum Classic that does not have too good development many years since the hardfork after Ethereum DAO Hack.Even Do Kwon and Terra did not mention about UST, do you think they try to rebuild a new LUNA and pump it to cover their loss in UST and compensate their investors.",

So many votes have been done by various parties and it seems the holders are still wanna using the old luna instead of the new luna. Im sure that holders will never stop to use the old luna. The price of new luna will be even deeper than old luna before the attack. We have so many fork coins in the market and the history of these fork coins can be tracked easily especially for the price performance. Fork is always leading to the worst thing like dumped at the bottom or it will be leaving by the community and none used it anymore",
