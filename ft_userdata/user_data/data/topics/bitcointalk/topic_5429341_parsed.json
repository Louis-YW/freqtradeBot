  "content": "QuoteCasino credit is a simple way to secure funds from your checking account to allow for easy access at the table games and slot machines. This credit can be used to request chips at the tables or funds at the slot machines. Casino credit is provided via a marker, or counter-check against the credit line that will be repaid with funds from a checking account, generally in 15 to 45 days; in effect, the patron is writing a post-dated check in order to use the casino’s money. No fees or penalties are associated with the debt.Casino credit is primarily for high rollers—those who bet big, lose big, and, like the abovementioned whale, pay off big for the host casino, even when they get a markdown. But it’s also for those who’d rather play against a line of credit than carry cash, or who exceed the daily ATM limits imposed by their banks.While I am a big fan of casinos I would never buy the idea of casino credit. The risks in my experience far outweigh the rewards especially for those who may have the disposition to become gambling addicts. Besides, I see no reason why anyone who already knows that in the end, the house always wins will go ahead to get casino credit for a game.Do you have any experience with Casino credit or what is your opinion on it?Source:https://www.hardrockhotelatlanticcity.com/casino/casino-credit#:~:text=Casino%20credit%20is%20a%20simple,funds%20at%20the%20slot%20machines.https://ggbmagazine.com/article/casino-credit-calculating-the-risk/#:~:text=Casino%20credit%20is%20provided%20via,are%20associated%20with%20the%20debt.",

I have no experience in this after all but I guess you need to always be aware of your limit if you're using your checking account. There's pros and cons in here but I think for those who don't want hassle pros outweighs the cons.",

But same ethical problem applies to credit cards, as those can be used by people with problems handling their finances and risks as well. And they are often being used to get even more debt.So i don't see casino credits any different. They could be used responsible way and it's not like they have infinite credit but connected to your personal credit score. And i don't think that people in danger of losing everything would get them very easily.",

A credit line in a casino is something that will allow a gambler to lose more money than he originally planned to lose. That is why I am against such initiatives.",

And we all know that casino has the edge, so it's double whammy for gambler if they lose all of it and then they have to put funds on their checking account to pay the casinos. Of course, I do agree that it is the gamblers responsibility, but then again, when this whales have deep pockets, sooner or later they are going to fall for this trick and become more addicted.",

      "body": "This sounds like an idea, that has nothing to do with the concept of responsible gambling.Getting addicted to gambling and getting into bigger debts are basically connected. The online casinos, which implement such casino credit feature are simply incentivizing their gamblers to fall into bigger debts(and bigger addiction). All regulated casinos must be incentivized(or forced) by the authorities to reduce gambling addiction, not the opposite. I wonder what kind of bank would allow it's customer to connect his checking account to a casino. Maybe such banks exist in the countries with a more liberal approach towards gambling. It depends of the gambling regulations in the different countries. Some countries are more strict about such practices than others.",

I'd prefer using crypto like btc for example where you will know how much btc left you have instead of seeing casino credit where you may have to check the casino again about the credit value. Casinos can create their own token, coin or in this case casino credit where it's value depends entirely to the casino. Not long ago where I check this gambling site where you can deposit and withdraw crypto but once you check your balance, it won't be crypto but their own credits, chips or whatever you call it.",

Casino credit? Not advisable for anyone. It is the same as been offered an access to loan to fund an addiction that the only thing limiting you is money that you don't have. It is not good you even start it because you are at the danger of being used to borrowing casino credit anytime you feel like gambling and don't have the money to use. Getting used to using casino credit will put an extra hole in your purse.",
