That means the ignored user never totally disappear in your eyes.Another annoying thing is if you click on post history of the ignored user, you will see full post content. I know, question will be, if you ignore that user, why you click on his post history?However, it is still a bug of the forum.For email notification, I think forum should have a new option, Don't receive email notification when users in your ignore list reply in your topic.

That means the ignored user never totally disappear in your eyes.Correct, the administrator Theymos when making that ignore button only had the idea of ignoring a member's posts in a topic you are reading, and not to completely ignore the member or whipe them completely from your sight, it should be called an \"ignore member's post\" button, until the administrator changes how it works.If you ignore a member, you will see the member's name and a button to unignore the member below, for the meantime the administrator can replace the member's name that still shows with \"ignored\". So it will be like this: if you see a member's post that you have ignored, you won't see the username, but instead 'ignored' so you don't know who it is, and then the 'unignore' button below.",
