I didn't got a single thread or single reply of @colinistheman which was merited. I think I don't know the way from which we can know about old merited threads.",

Just search the username of the individual and the merit history will be displayed along side other details such as merits sent and to who, top merits received and from who, merits earned in last 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 120 days. Other information like ranks, trustline etc are also there.I guess the reason you cannot see much about the merit history of the user is because the merits were earned beyond 120 days or probably airdropped",

As for people who said to check through Bpip.org, there's no answer you will found like \"this user get airdropped\".@OP you're open too much topis, it's better to use search engine first. Quote from: Odohu on October 25, 2023, 09:58:45 AMI guess the reason you cannot see much about the merit history of the user is because the merits were earned beyond 120 days Nope, you can still view it in the earned merits.",

Quote from: cafter on October 25, 2023, 09:57:21 AMjust randomly i was reading a thread where i seen his profile to capture and post hereWhat you said in that post is wrong.The user is not a legendary member, because of low activity. The user has enough merit for being a legendary member and he will be still a hero member even he receives 1 more merit. The user was a legendary member when the merit system was launched and received 1000 airdropped merit. It seems that he/she deleted some posts and lose the activity and rank.",
