  "content": "Hi so i have been in bitcoin for a long time, dont really want to get much into it but i used to use the silk road back in the day and had a couple wallets. i tried using this wallet named \"armory\" and i deposited a bunch of bitcoin in it but when ever i tried accessing it, it always was updating the ledger. needless to say i left it alone for like a decade almost. i am having trouble accessing it, does anyone have any advice or can guide me through the process of recovering my funds? Ihave the seed codes and whatnot.",

      "body": "Armory requires a Bitcoin node to sync to, so make sure you have a Bitcoin Core node running on your machine first of all.Then let us know whether you made a paper backup (this is the easiest to restore) or just a copy of the wallet file. There are different instructions for recovering each as mentioned in this post:Quote from: HCP on January 09, 2021, 02:52:32 AMIdeally, you should have your Armory \"Root Key\" paper backup somewhere... this would allow you to easily restore your wallet in a new installation.Theoretically you could simply copy the .wallet file over to the new install, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other option for recovery.To get Armory up and running on the new computer, you'll need to:1. Download the latest version of Bitcoin Core: https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/2. Install Bitcoin Core and get it fully synced (do NOT enable \"prune\" mode!)3. Download the latest version of Armory: https://btcarmory.com/releases/ (currently v0.96.5)4. Install Armory and run itOnce you have Armory+Bitcoin Core running successfully, let us know what files you have available to continue with the recovery.Also there is a tutorial for restoring a paper backup here: https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/tutorials/armory-basics/restore-wallet/",

Ihave the seed codes and whatnot.You can restore it to the latest version and synchronize the blockchain or export your private key(s) and import them to another wallet.For the latter, here's a simplified instructions on how to export the private key(s) from Armory: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5233141.msg54037227#msg54037227But for security purposes, I suggest you to verify Electrum: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-verify-your-electrum-download/And you may consider restoring the private key(s) on an Air-Gap machine, more info: https://bitcoinelectrum.com/creating-a-cold-storage-wallet-in-electrum/",

If it was a decade then the Armory that you are trying to make it work is the old version of it you might be using v0.90 or below.There is a new forked version of Armory developed by goatpig and take note that there are no seed codes you may be referring to rootkey there are 5 backup types when restoring the paper backup. Since it was an old version of Armory the backup you have may contain \"rootkey\" and \"SecurePrint\" If you don't want to download the full blockchain you can simply install the most recent Armory wallet and import your backup and then backup it again from Armory but this time choose export key list to backup only private keys that you can import to Electrum it doesn't need to download the entire blockchain so you can send BTC right away after import.",
