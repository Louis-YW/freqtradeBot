Maybe into a ROTH IRA or traditional (tax deduction). It sometimes does follow the US stock market's movement — but if you zoom out, not that much.Personally though: 70% crypto(like 60%+ BTC depending on the circumstances), 30% stocks. (not including cash). I'm able to take these risks simply because I don't have children(nor a wife) yet. But, I slowly but surely move out of crypto down to probably 30% at some time as I grow older.Also, I have small businesses that earn me money semi-passively, so there's that.",

Diversification is good but somehow you should also make sure that you are investing in the right coins, otherwise all your investments will never give you profits because you end up in wrong coins to invest. The reason why people still only focus on the most promising and reputable coin in the market which is bitcoin. Atleast you know that no matter how low its price falls, it won’t settle on any low value but always manage to recover and surge again until it reaches a new all time high.",

I guess diversifying your investments will always be profitable as long as your investments or businesses meet the demands of the clients or customers. That way, you won’t have to worry for their future. For me, while I’m into crypto investments which is more focused on bitcoin, I also invest in a small business near our place which   is also giving me additional income right now. But I know for some, diversification not work so they end up investing in bitcoin alone which I think is also a smart and wise idea.",

Somewhat like the following.AgricultureThe value of plants and trees could rise significantly if food shortages hit in earnest. I've invested a little in plant HODL both as a potential food source and investment for the future. Also I spent time learning about agricultural processes, gaining experience in growing and maintaining things. MetalsIf fuel prices continue to rise and the shipping industry continues to experience issues. The price of commodities like metal should rise locally. I have tried to do very small scale metals and commodities HODL. There are local scrap markets that deal in scrap copper, steel, aluminum, etc. Depending on the area and availability of scrap. It could be a decent future investment. ManufacturingIf supply chains and related issues persist. A transition towards DIY and local manufacturing could increase due to rising demand. Things like 3d printers could be useful in the future. As well as the knowledge and skillset necessary to use that type of equipment. I have CNC equipment that I use and plan to acquire more in the future. I'm also learning more about concrete and other basic process.It may not be difficult to see which direction future trends are taking us.
