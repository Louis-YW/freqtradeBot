  "content": "So, after reading a thread and realizing that paying with Bitcoin would mean that you'd be paying with future returns, I went on to research the topic of paying for goods and services with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized meaning that it can be transferred to anyone without the interference of intermediate/ central authorities. This also implies that buying goods and services would be faster and easier if more people owned and accepted Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was adopted and accepted as a means of exchange in many countries then there would be a huge improvement in various and global economies.It'll enable more people to access financial services and knowledge, reduce the rate at which bank charges are being paid, values gotten by sellers will increase rapidly, anonymity and many others. Apart from the loss on the buyers's part, Bitcoin has lots of disadvantages which would be challenges and pose lots of unhealthy risks if adopted.After doing my research, I came to realize that this may probably be influenced by personal choices. Because looking at it thoroughly, some people would pay for items using things like Gold, Land, and other assets. But in the eyes of a money literate, that may be totally wrong.So, I would love to ask and get this confusion over with. Is it ok for you to purchase items with Bitcoin? If yes or no, please state your reasons so we can all learn from it.Thank you",

My own experience over the last 7+ years on this forum, I have seen crypto grow from a cultish thing to a maintream buzz and this means we are growing steadily.At present, merchants accepting bitcoin are few and gift cards are another option (fees hurt!). Directly selling bitcoin for fiat and using the fiat to buy your goods is another option but it might not be feasible in many countries.",

      "body": "Why not? I don't see anything wrong if someone is willing to pay in Bitcoin and the other party is willing to accept it. That's perfectly alright! But unless it is a cross-country transaction, Bitcoin transactions will cost you more than banking system. So it all depends whether the person is willing to pay a huge fee for a simple domestic transaction or not. Also, the risk of loosing future gain is real. We all are holding Bitcoins because we are optimistic about its future value. So if someone is willing to accept that fact and still wants to go ahead. That's fine as well. It's impossible to see a perfect solution here. It all depends on the individuals who are paying and who are accepting it.",

Bitcoin is digital currency which is meant to buy things and pay for services digitally. So if anyone likes to accept bitcoin in his or her business and you have bitcoin to pay for it then you pay and get you product or person render the services you paid for so what are you asking us to tell you our reasons of accepting bitcoin. This is ridiculous. If using bitcoin to pay for gold and land is wrong as you said after your research then there is no need to argue again because you have read it by yourself and yet you are saying it is wrong. Then you let it be.",

Paying for something with Bitcoin is just like paying for something with your TSLA or MSFT shares. You can technically do it, but why would you? Bitcoin might be a good investment, but it's turned out to be very poor for transactions, as they are extremely slow and extremely expensive compared to the available alternatives.So don't pay for things with Bitcoin directly, just convert some of your BTC to USD (or whatever sovereign currency) and perform the transaction the way you normally would. There's no advantage to paying directly with Bitcoin (assuming the payee even takes it), and lots of disadvantages.Although it didn't start out this way, today Bitcoin is in all practicality an investment instrument, not a currency.",

If you have stores around you that accept BTC or there are commodities and services you want to pay for online, and they accept BTC payment, paying with BTC is a cool thing to do. The idea of spending BTC is different for many people, i prefer to spend BTC on cheap commodies, i.e. a cup of coffee, but it will probably be different for an early adopter or someone who has a lot of BTC, such people would not mind buying a luxury car with BTC, so you should do things on your own level.",

But here I want to point out that you, op, are talking about the positive impact of wider Bitcoin adoption, whereas it's not that simple: Bitcoin can't handle too many transactions, so that sort of adoption requires off-chain solutions.

It can be used as a savings asset and wait for profit, or you can use it here and now or convert it into currency and pay it all at the user’s discretion.For example, I have different categories of savings in cryptocurrency, the first is a reserve that I systematically replenish and the second is something that can be converted and spent and traded or used in various activities, this is an advantage since I am not tied to only one source.",

Taking bitcoin this special by some people is because it is a digital currency that is yet to be completely legalized globally, and many people also wants its global adoption, if not it is just the same as using your money for payment.You main question in this aspect is because Bitcoin is a digital currency that have potential of becoming globally accepted, and the amount of bitcoin you are using to pay your goods might worth 10x more its current value that is you are curious and asking why spending the bitcoin instead of fiat, but the truth is that, you can only use what you have to make payment, if you only have bitcoin, then you have no choice than to use the bitcoin you have for payment.",

Bitcoin from now onwards will be treated as an asset class. After the ETF approvals I can say more confidentially that now with the transaction load we cant use Bitcoin because its way more expensive to use the Bitcoin network.",

You can also trade with your agreement with the seller personally. I mean if your country doesn't legalize Bitcoin and crypto as a means of payment. but the seller of the service or goods you are targeting understands and uses Bitcoin. You can ask and make a personal agreement with the seller regarding payment using Bitcoin.I have also done that for buying and selling computer equipment. Coincidentally he is not too far from my area. I asked if he accepted Bitcoin for payment, and he said yes. then the transaction can be carried out. it would probably be seen as bartering. between goods and Bitcoin assets that I own. This applies in countries that do not legalize Bitcoin as a means of payment.",

If yes or no, please state your reasons so we can all learn from it.It is perfectly acceptable to purchase items with bitcoin; after all, it was created to serve as an alternative to the traditional currencies we use. Paying for items with bitcoin is dependent on whether the person you want to transact with is willing to accept payment in that currency or prefers fiat or another valuable asset that can be traded. Bitcoin, like any other asset, is highly volatile, and while it has many advantages, it also has some drawbacks. If you can weigh your chances and decide how long you want to keep them, you'll be profitable; otherwise, you'll be at loss.Quote from: GideonGono on January 30, 2024, 04:26:33 PMIt would depend on the transaction fee if I could save more on using crypto or Bitcoin then Yes I would use it, even if it means losing a chance to earn more in the future specially if I really need what I am paying for.But if it would only be the same as paying with fiat and I do have fiat to pay for it then I would rather use Fiat than my crypto.So for me it would depend on the situation.This is the same as knowing what you stand to lose or gain when trading any of the currencies available with the person. Transaction fees could be considered, but it doesn't really matter to me if I can get more than what I'm using to send plus the value I'm sending in the long run, depending on how much I want to keep that asset. Every method works; simply calculate which one will be most profitable for you.",

Privacy concerns can be replaced by the ability to easily manage and retrieve bank accounts. A normal person tends to choose the latter.In El Salvador, economic success comes from the publicity that BTC brings to the country, helping to attract tourists and investment. This would not have happened if BTC were widely accepted globally.Additionally, governments do not want to give up economic management through fiat. I'm not saying the government is always right, they can even make the situation worse, but at least the government has the necessary tools at hand to save the economy when necessary through fiat.Therefore, I think I should just continue to consider BTC as a financial tool in the investment field, I am not willing to spend in BTC, and I am also not willing to accept payment in BTC",
