  "content": "Hey guys,Just came across a cool platform UniFarm. Here we can stake a single token and earn multiple tokens as staking rewards. Very recently they came up with new farms on ETH,BSC & Polygon Chains.Guess what?!You can earn top Cryptos and even Index tokens as rewards with upto 400% APY. I did my staking and here is the experience.. Staked $200 worth $UFARM and the first week i got $30 worth of rewards with an APY of 150% and the second week I got $20 with an APY of 120% .. still earning rewards. The beauty here is 36% APY is guaranteed Give it a try and let me know.. How you are  earning.https://twitter.com/unifarm_/status/1545350816172691457?s=20&t=I4lmpVQ08dAzRZnwBjEtQw",

They should deploy on more chains though. I know that Celo and Candle Chain both have generous grant programs. Hedera does too but the easiest one to get is CNDL. All of these chains are EVM compatible, so it should be easy to deploy.",
