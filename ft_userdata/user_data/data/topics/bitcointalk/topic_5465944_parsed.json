Just saw this announcement and first thing that came to my mind was NovaSol and the recent one Solaris. Has the same vibes, website included. Even the block explorer is similar.Proceed with caution!",

      "body": "QuoteNovaSol NetworkNovaSol is a decentralized cryptocurrency that was launched in April 2023 with the goal of creating a secure, fast, and flexible cryptocurrency that is accessible to a wide range of users. The NovaSol blockchain is powered by both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms, which ensures that the network is completely decentralized and resistant to censorship and manipulation.One of the key features of NovaSol is its masternodes, which perform advanced functions on the network such as instant transactions, governance, and voting. Masternodes also help to increase the speed and efficiency of the network.Custom tokens can be created on the NovaSol blockchain, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as fundraising, loyalty programs, and more. This adds flexibility and utility to the cryptocurrency, and allows users to create custom tokens that are tailored to their specific needs.The NovaSol blockchain is designed to be fast and efficient, with transactions processed quickly and securely. This makes it more appealing to users who value speed and reliability, and helps to ensure that the network can handle a high volume of transactions.From: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449113.msg62103441#msg62103441QuoteSolaris is an innovative cryptocurrency that focuses on sustainability, scalability, and smart contract capabilities. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Mesh (PoM) which allows it to achieve high transaction throughput in an energy-efficient manner.Some of the key things to highlight about Solaris:    It is eco-friendly and aims to reduce the energy consumption associated with crypto mining through its use of PoM consensus. This makes it more sustainable compared to coins that rely heavily on power-hungry mining.    It has high scalability and fast transaction processing enabled by its mesh network architecture. This allows Solaris to scale efficiently as its network grows.    It supports smart contracts (in the future), so developers can build decentralized apps on the Solaris Network and expand its functionality.    It incorporates masternodes, which provide added security to the network while allowing masternode operators to earn rewards.    It enables both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining, giving miners and stakers ways to participate and earn.    It has a fair initial distribution and governance mechanism that gives the community a say in decision making.    It prioritizes user privacy through anonymous transactions.    It offers easy-to-use wallets for seamless transfers and payments.Overall, Solaris brings together a unique mix of sustainability, scalability, smart contracts, and community governance. It's an innovative project aiming to drive decentralized solutions while minimizing environmental impact. Joining the Solaris community allows you to be part of this movement towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized future.From: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462447.msg62662888#msg62662888QuoteLumanex is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks.

One that is a bit older and one that's more recent. I do understand the concern, but judging on an explorer layout is a bit too far thinking.
