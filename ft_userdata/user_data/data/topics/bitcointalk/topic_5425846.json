      "body": "Collecting 1 Bitcoin is like collecting any other amount of money.  Both deserve a job and make an effort and get paid for it.  Maybe the easiest way to do this is to invest successfully in a specific project, but it is not easy to identify these successful projects or to distinguish them among the thousands of investment opportunities in the market.  This would be a kind of gambling, but with better guarantees, perhaps.  I do not know for how long you want to collect this amount, but logically the amount is relatively large and it will take some time to collect it, whatever method you adopt.  I think it is better to move this topic to the beginners section, because that is the best place for such questions.",

      "body": "You have to acquire money and then convert that money to bitcoin! DUH!Here are some ideas on how to acquire money:1. Get a job! Get paid! Invest a certain portion of your paycheck in bitcoin.2. Get a secondary job to earn some extra cash. It could be anything like live streaming games on Twitch or whatever you can think of and suits your skills.3. Manage your expenses better so that you are left with some extra money. For example if you waste your money on smokes, stop smoking and buy bitcoin with that money that you used to waste.4. Sell stuff you don't need like a garage sale or something. For example if you have a second hand bike laying around that you won't use, sell that and use the money to buy bitcoin.This way, slowly but surely you'll accumulate bitcoin. Specially now that we are in a big dip and bitcoin is undervalued.",

Every month at payday you buy a certain amount of BTC, depending on what you can afford.Plus, if you get some extra work in your free time - no matter it pays in fiat and you also convert that fiat into bitcoin, or it pays in bitcoin, or it pays in altcoins (just make sure you accept only altcoins that are actively traded) and you convert - that's a nice bonus.If you are too young and you don't have a job yet, I advise you learn as much and as good as possible and don't spend all your time chasing bitcoin. Maybe only parts of it though",

There are many ways to collect bitcoin and I think you should do your own research to see which works best for you as it is difficult to give you specific advice. But there is one thing I want to tell you, it is very different for you to hold 1 BTC and hold $20k for a long time. So I advise you to take advantage of when bitcoin is still cheap, so collect as much as possible, and don't leave too much money in your bank account when you can buy more bitcoins.",

And also it’s not a must to have 1BTC as target because everyone can start small @ 1mbtc and just increase once you achieve it. Having a different level of achievement is more encouraging rather than setting the bar high even if its too unrealistic for your current financial status.My target before when I’m newbie was 0.1BTC when Bitcoin is still around 300$ then later on I manage to accumulate 1BTC after I get my first job and purchased Bitcoin using half of my salary. My target increase that time as I progress on achieving round number amount until I cash out my Bitcoin to purchase my house on 20K and maintain an amount that I’m contented in fiat not in BTC.",

Genuine method and i know it will take time.\"Investing is a long term one\" China wall not made in one day\"There are only two options to obtain 1 bitcoin: either someone gifts it to you or you buy it. That is the quickest way to obtain one bitcoin, but it is extremely expensive. You can also earn it by doing tasks, and your salary is paid in bitcoin, but it still takes time and is not stable. The signature campaign is also there, but you need to save it until you get 1 bitcoin. So if you have money, then buy it directly; if not, try to earn it through signature campaigns, trading, etc. any task that you get paid in bitcoin.",

But try reinvesting what you have earned from projects to somehow help the progress of having a bigger capital to invest. Earned rewards from campaigns could be invested to profitable tokens. You may engage to trading if you have the knowledge. Or anything which could help you earn more, that's just the point.",
