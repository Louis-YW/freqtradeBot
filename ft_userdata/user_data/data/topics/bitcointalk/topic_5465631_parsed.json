      "body": "As far as I knew, China was facing deflation. And we all know high deflation has bad impact like inflation (of course not at the same level but to emphasize the fact that they both have bad impacts). I have read many posts from stompix about china and the conditions are not good there. Prices of things are made so cheap, a gold bar is gifted to those who wanted to buy house (which in reality is just to fake the actual price) well that's another thing. The point is people are not buying and the production level has increased so much in china but consumption is lower which caused deflation. Of course there are other factors involved too. Well, I think you are generally comparing the economy of China with other and I think in that comparison China might be doing better than others. Like for example better than Canada and to be honest Canada really is facing situations but people still are going there for educational purposes or on work visa.",

Another important aspect is outsourcing. This is not done by China but the entire global network depends on China's power of acting as a contract-based entity meaning everyone manufactures from China and they assemble within China. Imagine the amount of money they get from other nations. They produce cheap and other nations need to pay the tax toll all the time. No wonder why they also turned into deflation this time.

I agreed with your point as if we see at the bigger picture and try to compare the GDP of China with all other countries besides the fact that China is facing deflationary situation and other countries are facing inflationary situation then if we would compare the numbers and stats then we will definitely find China as the biggest  seller or exporter. China is famous for making all kinds of thing at any cost. For example if we say we need a memory card at the cost of only $2 then they will make that for you and if we ask them to make a memory card for $20 then they will also make that for you.

I will tell you very primitively and simplistically In the beginning - a huge but backward, agrarian-oriented country. No offense, there's nothing wrong with that. But they managed to become almost the second economy of the world.So what went wrong in China, like other third world countries?China started offering its territory as a site for manufacturing. That was the first stage, and it started to work. Yes, the country had a communist dictatorship (no, not at the level of North Korea, of course), but they realized that they could make money and develop their economy. Many western manufacturers came to the country, built their factories, and got good labor, and cheap labor. Then manufacturers realized that it is possible to produce not only primitive goods, but also high-tech products. Plus - the AMAZING position for reducing logistics costs in the Africa-Asia-Oceania region.And so it began - everyone who could not help themselves came to China and brought technology! And the technological revolution in China began. New technologies, whole production facilities were brought to China for decades, local specialists were trained.....And that's what jump-started all other sectors of the economy. China from resource-agrarian China became a technological giant with a well-developed industry.But this is very simplistic",

Perhaps that competition exist in detriment of the life style of workers, but that is a different topic.On the other hand, they have fairly good education programs, if we ignore that those are probably politicized so the youth would obey and respect the CCP, they are seemly also quite competent when comes to development of science.Also, Canada & USA are quite vulnerable to drug trafficking and the entrance of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs, in China there are harsh penalties against traffickers, usually death.

For example - A country has 999 residents living in poverty and one billionaire. So as per the GDP calculation, their per capita income is 1 million. Similarly, a cryptocurrency has 1000 units in the market and one unit got sold at 1 million. The market cap of that cryptocurrency becomes 1 billion. Both are flawed!",
