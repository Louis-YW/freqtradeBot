As much as we want people to join bitcoin community, we should endeavor to pass the right information and not fairytale stories of how bitcoin can solve all your financial problems.",

The coin could be in the exchange still and your neighbor has no plans of getting it out. Nothing wrong with what you did, it's fine I guess the best advice you can tell your neighbor is to hold for now and sell by the time the profit is enough for him.",

This extremely necessary, coz he was so open for making investment decisions. If he is so new in crypto and immediately bought bitcoin after you tell him about it, then imagine what he is able to do if he gets surround by scam investment. He would invest in every single one of it. You know, it isnt hard to invite a person to make his very first investment into bitcoin, but it is hard to keep friendship after, as you are now responsible for his funds.",

I think this is too fast but somehow you have to teach him first about bitcoin, not inviting him to invest directly, this is not the right way, while he is only persuaded by the seduction of big profits without thinking about the risks, even though you have warned him, so it's clear that without learning, it's not the right one for you he who knows nothing.Wrong or not, what is clear is that you will definitely be held accountable if your friend doesn't want to lose big because he doesn't know the concept of real investment in bitcoin, especially since you are also a beginner who is still new to bitcoin.",

There is no harm in helping your friend acquire Bitcoin; perhaps you never forced him, and you also told him some risks. I hope you told your friend that you are also new to Bitcoin so that he doesn't have to conclude that you are a pro and would have to depend fully on you to spoon-feed him information. It is not bad if you continue to teach him what you have learned so far, but at least letting him know your capability will also prompt him to do more research for himself and learn. Some people only like to depend on spoon-fed information, which limits their knowledge to what they should know. I hope you warn him not to store his bitcoin on the CEX, not to share his private key with a third party, not to publicly announce his Bitcoin holding. I hope you let him know he needs to keep his Bitcoin safe in his wallet as prices appreciate and by so doing, he needs to safely secure his wallet phrase.",

The guide says do not leave your funds in an exchange because you will end up losing it. I will advice you to learn more about wallets and tell your friend the disadvantage of keeping his coin in an exchange. Too fast move you did,anyway the forum is here to teach you very well.",

If you just lead them here, the bulk of topics that they will see can be overwhelming and they may not really learn anything or it will take a longer time to learn. I know we can be in a rush at times, or an inappropriate position, but there is always the possibility of scheduling another better lecture session maybe online or better offline. Taking some time to really give lecture to an interested person goes a long way.",

Even though you explained bitcoin and warned him about the risks he would take, it still wasn't enough for him to understand what you were talking about. What you need to tell him is to learn about bitcoin before instructing him to download the trading app and buy bitcoin on the spot. What if after buying bitcoin and you are not there? If he loses those bitcoins, he will definitely blame you.",

This is too risky mate. At least, you should ensure yourself in this Bitcoin investment. I know that you have explained to him the risks of investing in Bitcoin. But, have you understood the exact risks? And moreover, has he really understood? I am wondering if you are also telling about how many people able to earn so much money because of Bitcoin investment that your friend is also desired to earn that much money. I doubt that your friend will be really okay with the risks. If I were you, I will not invite him to join in the Bitcoin investment. I probably will tell him about my investment and about cryptocurrency. but I will let him understand by learning more at first. So, he himself decides going to invest or not, not by invitation from me. Because, once the price of Bitcoin is dropped again and he shocks, he may blame you. But hopefully, this is not what I am thinking about you and your friend. Hopefully, you can be really fine and ready enough with all conditions of Bitcoin investment. The positive thing is that it is Bitcoin, not altcoins.",

We should always try to acquired much knowledge about Bitcoin before we should invested in it.Bitcoin is not what we should rush into because it is not what will use few years us but what will stay with us forever,and it also involves some risk which everyone need to know first and again their are many unique things  about Bitcoin and Bitcoin blockchain that why we need more knowledge about it. From your words I can say that you just explain about Bitcoin profit to your friend because with no that your friend can not just believe you like that and decided invest it immediately and if is that what you used to convince your friend, it may not stay long in the system because it aim will just always be on profit making which not supposed to be. As you have said that you have introduced he/she  to this forum you have done a great work for that step you take.
