      "body": "Of course you need internet connection if you are going to generate in some applications. I know that some apps require you to send information or something to them and then while creating a wallet, you would re-enter the seed for them to completely verify. I do think that it's a bad idea but you need to be sure that your device is safe and secured in terms of viruses or malware. The best thing that you could do, if you are going to regularly use wallets, is that you need to have a reliable hardware wallet, just like what the other members recommended.",

Also, if you want to create a new wallet within the application, you do not need to be online because the seed is not generated on a remote server but on your device.I guess you know how to turn off mobile internet or wi-fi on your phone?",

If you are worried that your seed phrase may be intercepted by hackers during wallet setup, the simplest solution for you would be to just disconnect your device from the Internet and continue your setup. If you're on mobile, your seed phrase will be protected by a secure element that every modern mobile phone should have. However, it doesn't guarantee you full protection from hackers and remote attacks because the moment you come back online and unlock your wallet, your keys stop being protected by strong encryption and, therefore, may become subject to theft. In conclusion, I would add that if you created something like private keys offline, they should remain offline all the time, otherwise that doesn't make much sense.",

You can keep it offline while you generate a wallet, but then you would need to go online to be able to broadcast that transaction, and so it isn't airgapped. Further, given that Trust wallet is closed source and owned by Binance, it remains a terrible choice for even a hot wallet.OP, if you want the security of an airgapped wallet, then the first thing you need to do is get yourself a device which you can make permanently airgapped. This means that it will never connect to the internet again, not even momentarily. Ideally this should be an old laptop or computer, but you can also achieve this (although not as well) with an old phone. Once you've done that, you format the device and install a clean OS on it, set up your offline wallet on this airgapped device, and then use your device with an internet connection only to monitor your addresses and create transactions which your offline device will then sign for you.",

Further, given that Trust wallet is closed source and owned by Binance, it remains a terrible choice for even a hot wallet.This is quite clear to me and no one here is talking about creating an airgapped wallet, but about whether it is necessary to be online or not at the time we install the app or make a new wallet within the app. The OP mentioned the Trust wallet and that’s just why I took it as an example, although I wouldn’t recommend anyone to use mobile wallets for any serious stuff, whether they’re open source or not.",

If you are infected with malware which can steal your seed phrase when you set up a new wallet, then that same malware can steal your seed phrase or private keys whenever you unlock that wallet. Your wallet is either permanently offline or it isn't. Being \"temporarily offline\" is the same as being a hot wallet.",
