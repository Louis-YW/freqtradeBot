  "content": "Energy use in bitcoin mining has been a thing of consideration as the challenges is becoming contending on miners from the government, but all thanks to research and development from various advanced technological companies and individuals that has been providing support to help tackle the energy utilization and demand, this also is one of the good news from Samsung Tech company as it develops a 3nm chips technology to be use in bitcoin mining. A statement from its official webpage says.QuoteSamsung said the first application of 3nm chips would be for high-performance and low-power computing, with plans to expand to mobile processors.https://forkast.news/headlines/samsung-produces-3nm-chips-bitcoin-mining/On this note, it is believed that the production of the 3 nanometer chip will cause a relieve on miners from the current situation of the bitcoin high cost for energy demand in mining and the dip in the present market price, according to the Samsung, it said this will bring a dropdown in the amount of energy consumption and increasing the overal efficiency of bitcoin mining from the 3nm chips.",

I think 3nm chip technology is a fairly new space though and it'll probably take a while for bitcoin to start using 3nm chips in ASICs.According to a quick search, I can find most chips are 7nm or 10nm (bitcoin currently mostly uses 7nm chips afaik - there are also 5nm chips on your article that haven't even been produced for crypto mining yet too). Realistically, all three should be coming at some point, it's just a case of when (and if these chips will be able to provide the same operations the larger chips can).",

I think it's not just about the technology it's also about the competition which can be very beneficial for people who are involved in mining since competition produces good cost price and also improves the overall technology.",

What he is saying is that the reward dictates how much money miners could theoretically spend in order to keep being profitable, the reward is the cap on energy consumption.  Efficiency matters only in terms of hashrate generated with a $x reward per block, or for personal finances not global.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 22, 2022, 07:20:18 PMIf using the same amount of energy, all the miners upgraded to more efficient devices, difficulty would increase and, therefore, so would the energy required per bitcoin (AKA, energy consumption).No, it doesn't work that way, if everyone would replace a gear rated 300W and 100th/s with one rated 3000w and 200th/s the consumption will not grow, the margin rate will neither since you get the same share for the same cost, the hash rate will go up but without increased energy needs.The income per th/s vs cost per th/s generated is affecting global energy consumption, if the revenue is higher more miners will put gear to mine, if it goes negative so does the hashrate, as it's happening now.",

(let the fabricator rental costs come down a bit)yes the efficiency gain of watts/hash is 45% better in the 3nm compared to current nm chipsbut if the chip itself(due to production cost) is more. then the efficiency:economics does not equate to be any more rewarding, and instead more costly to mine on new equipment if the equipment cost is too hightake this years batchthey have 2 variants of 19 generation ill use as an examplehttps://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020220711185109085o99L6nF90644Bitcoin Miner T19 Hydro - 145thash - 5438watt  hardware cost $2,175https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020220210152002039CHAR8f2i0636Bitcoin Miner S19 XP - 140thash - 3010watt hardware cost $11,620as you can see the wattages are different by far but the hashrate are about the same (3%+-margin of error)but the hardware costs are more noticable. now guess which one is cheaper to mine with if based on a 4cent/kw electric cost and spreading the hardware across 2 yearsanswer below(scroll over to see white text)[answer: answer.

Isn't efficiency strictly correlated with the cost? If you find a more efficient way to calculate the hashes, it means you've found a cheaper way. If using the same amount of energy, all the miners upgraded to more efficient devices, difficulty would increase and, therefore, so would the energy required per bitcoin (AKA, energy consumption).By \"cost of energy\", I mean the cost to purchase a joule of energy. In short, the energy consumption (in joules) to produce a bitcoin, E, approachesE ⟶  P  / CwhereP is the average price of a bitcoin in $C is the average cost of electricity in $/JThe reason that hash rate and efficiency are irrelevant is that the difficulty adjustments keep production constant, regardless of the hash rate, the amount of energy used, the efficiency of the equipment, and the amount miners are willing to spend. However, assuming that miners (in the aggregate) are striving to be profitable, they will spend as much as they can on energy up to the value of the bitcoins they produce. So, the value of the energy consumed producing a bitcoin (E x C) approaches the value of the bitcoin (P). Thus, E ⟶  P  / C. Note that there are other variable costs, but energy is the biggest and it's what we are concerned about here.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on July 22, 2022, 07:20:18 PMIf using the same amount of energy, all the miners upgraded to more efficient devices, difficulty would increase and, therefore, so would the energy required per bitcoin (AKA, energy consumption).Small contradiction there. If using the same amount of energy, the energy required per bitcoin would be the same and would not increase. Note that I am assuming a time frame that includes difficulty adjustments and time for miners to add or remove equipment. An increase in efficiency would reduce energy consumption at least until the next difficulty adjustment, but consumption would return as miners compete for a bigger share.",

What does change, based on it, is the hashes required per bitcoin. But there isn't a strict correlation between the cost of joule and the cost of calculating a hash. Quote from: odolvlobo on July 22, 2022, 11:40:55 PMSmall contradiction there. If using the same amount of energy, the energy required per bitcoin would be the same and would not increase.Let me rephrase: If using the same amount of energy, all miners upgraded to more efficient devices, difficulty would increase and, therefore, so would the hashes per bitcoin. So, what does change (specifically decreases) when mining becomes more efficient is the energy required to calculating 1 hash.",
