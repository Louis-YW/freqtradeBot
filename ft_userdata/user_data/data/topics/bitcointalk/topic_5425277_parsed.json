  "content": "Hey Guys,Thought I'd share my experience through this new ASIC mining hosting facility located in Tennessee, only 8.5c and they not only sell brand new miners from Bitmain there, but also will host certain models (they prefer next gen miners) that you own. It's worth giving them a look, especially at thatÂ  price point and them being in Tennessee, USA. Currently have 50+ miners there and no issues ever plus the owner is really easy to deal with.https://www.pursuitlink.com/",

      "body": "According to you we have to buy Mining power from this guy or you or anything else. Or is there some kind of you want to sell your Asic miners. If you are selling your mining power than you should mine and get your profit for your own good because in 2022, it will be worth good fortune than selling this mining power to the users. By the way it's depends on you and what your thinking.",
