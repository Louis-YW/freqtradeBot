In my opinion, there is difference between future and perpetual trading, but both are on the same derivative market which is different from spot trading because their profit or loss is set at a predetermined date (future trading) or price (future and perpetual).In future trading, it can be weekly, biweekly, monthly or quarterly. If a position is opened, there would be future date set for the trade to close. In perpetual trading, no future date set for the open position to close, a trader will close the trade by himself if the liquidation price is not reached.Perpetual trading and future trading are both derivative trading. Why are both referred to as futures on exchanges when no predetermined date set for perpetual? Even if perpetual trading is left for long, maybe it can be considered as future trading? If sclaping with perpetual, should that be regard as future?Can perpetual trading be regarded as futures?",

      "body": "Some people consider a perpetual contract or perpetual swap as a type of futures, except that it has no expiry date like the traditional futures contracts.  Personally, I think the two are different. There is probably just a mix-up between the understanding of Derivatives and futuresWherein there is a perp ---> No expiry date, Futures ---> There's an expiry date in the \"future\" and all are derivatives. I believe some exchanges are supposed to tag them as \"derivatives\" rather than \"futures\"",

In forex, if take long position then exchange will pay you interest (after 24 hours or next day) and if you take short position and if you hold beyond a day then you need to pay interest for your open position.As per your explanation, we can say perpetual trading is a kind of spot trading with all other characteristics of futures trading?On a side note I like recall one more definition I learned from other topic here: spot trading can be treated as zero leveraged futures trading (still we need to bother about price differences and expiry date).",

In spot, orders are filled from spot price and not at derived price which should be slightly lesser than spot price in most time. Also that in spot trading, your gain or losses is in when you buy a coin, not by opening or closing a position. If you are a trader, and you day trade or scalp, going 1x long position is like spot trading, but with some differences too. In spot market, you can not open short position is another difference.",

Which means between traders. Funding rate are paid based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot market price, bringing the perpetual contract price close to spot price and not allow further divergence.Those that open a long position or short position can be given the funding or deducted from them. If the funding rate is positive, which means the perpetual contract price is higher than the mark price of the asset the trader opened a position for, in this case, those that open long position will pay those that open short position. If the funding rate is negative, those that open a short position will pay those that open a long position.

Funding rate will be charge negatively or positively on all open positions base on the current market condition. Funding rate shifts to negative or positive every exchange reset period so it’s not necessary that your open position will accumulate more interest since it depends on the market trend from time to time during your open position. You can gain or loss value on your margin based on the rate sign. This is how funding rate works on crypto.

You can go up to 3x for isolated margin and 10x for cross margin on most exchanges. Margin trading uses spot price.Future and perpetual are both derivative trading. They both use derived price of the future and perpetual price. You can go up to 75x, 125x and even 200x on some exchanges. But it is very risky. Millions of dollars can be liquidaed in seconds, minutes or hours if using high leverage.",

There's funding rate that keeps changing from positive to negative every 8 hours according to most derivative exchanges and the market conditions dictate it, not how long someone keeps their position open.Also, the exchange does not benefit from the funding rate, as the traders pay themselves depending on what side of the funding rate they are. The exchange only benefits from trading fees, theoretically.Quote from: febriyana on December 17, 2022, 02:56:49 AMOk. Thanks for the information.That is seem very risky.
