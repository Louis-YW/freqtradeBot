Because right now I don't see anything thing better than to wait, double bottom is always possible with Bitcoin in bear markets.",

They once say new years lead to people dumping bitcoin because they need money for presents and travels, etc. and another time they say it goes up because of new year.I'm also with @davis196 on this, you shouldn't give financial advice to others so that they can blame you when they lose money specially in a very volatile market. You also shouldn't introduce Bitcoin to others as an investment (which is two birds with one stone), since bitcoin is a currency and people who buy it should want financial sovereignty. Also that way when there is volatility they won't just panic then dump and blame you for the loss since they didn't buy bitcoin primarily to make profit.",

If they invest immediately, they might lose interest easily when the price of the coin is falling, so investing at a time when it has just started a pump would be a very good idea. One would have had a better assurance of the bullish trend if it were at the time that it reached the low of about $15,500 last year. At the price, BTC would always recover, and even if they lose, it will soon recover, unlike this time when it almost hit $24,000.Conclusively, be their guide through chart analysis to know the right time to invest and divest.",

If you got yours at $15-17k, you could just honestly tell them that. But nobody knows whether Bitcoin will fall again, and IMO the price is still good as long as a person believes in full recovery of the process and is willing to wait for it.",

Wasn't Bitcoin banned in China?The best advice you can give is that Bitcoin is an investment that is most successful with a target of 4 years. It is economically designed this way. No one has ever failed when hodl'ing for more than 4 years, the charts prove it!Quote from: davis196 on January 30, 2023, 06:48:37 AMWasn't Bitcoin banned in China?According to this article, Bitcoin has been banned by China on 3 occasions. I remember reading another article around the time of the last China ban that the count was in excess of 7 occasions. Yet, many Chinese exchanges and services still operate today. So this tells you how effective these so-called bans really are.Bitcoin Cannot Be Banned!",

Specific things were banned in most/all scenarios, however every time a ban occurred the mainstream media were quick to go with the catchy phrases that gave the idea that \"Bitcoin is banned\" rather than properly stating the specifics of the bans. Here was one of the campaigns that alluded that using Bitcoin as a whole was banned by China:China declares all crypto-currency transactions illegalI couldn't find any sources in the article that actually validated the contents of what was published, of course",

And if you tell or tell bitcoin journey that bitcoin is a very good long term investment I think you and they don't really care about the current price of bitcoin and as long as they believe in the long term they will continue to buy gradually until they feel they have had enough and hold it.and what i mentioned i was suggested to some of my family members that bitcoin is very promising long term investment and also tell my profit when doing long term, and aims to keep them motivated.",

It's really better, to be honest, and talk about the volatility first if they are risk takers, they will gonna invest even though the price of bitcoins is currently high and they will not gonna put the blame on you if they messed up as long as you have been clear and honest to them.

It doesn't matter the price you buy your Bitcoin now as in the future we all will be in profit. The only time the price of Bitcoin matters is when you're a trader. If your friends aren't buying Bitcoin for training purposes then I would advise they should get their hands on some bitcoin today. The price might be too high for you today but you can never tell if the price will drop lower than this or not. All they just have to do is not to invest money that'll be needed in the nearest future instead they should invest as much as they can afford to lose then hold unto their investment. As an investor or newbies picking interest in investing, we should note that it isn't always about our entering point but how far is our patience to hold unto our investment for future gains.",
