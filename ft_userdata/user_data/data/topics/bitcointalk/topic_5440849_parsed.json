      "body": "lol. I know you from mix martial arts topics, but never thought that you are old school rts fan  This brings good memories of skipping classes, running home to play warcraft 2 on CRT monitors. I remember the day when I got Starcraft cd, how cool those marines looked in first mission  Those Korean guys are crazy. The game is so old and they keep running tournaments. Specially on old version of the game, not remastered. Btw, there is a hint for those who wants to bet - always bet on a Korean player if he plays against someone from rest of the world, and never bet on an underdog in a match between two Koreans. Miracles never happen in such game. All the strategies and counterstrategies are already invented. These robots never fail at micro and macro. Underdog never wins.",
