Has anyone been to one? and do you think its a valuable experience?If you have knowledge about bitcoin then going on conference is just a waste of your time because for sure they will just tell you the basics and the history of bitcoin. But if you don't know about it better start with it since somehow you can gain knowledge with them, but make sure that you go on legitimate conference where main intention is to educate people about bitcoin and not those scam platform who hype people then offer scams.",

If the entry fee, transportation costs and other logistics are expensive then I might not attend. But one of the benefit of conferences is connection.

The privacy risk is high when attending such conferences, and this risk increases when it is around your locality. Literally every information one would need about Bitcoin is available online, so the only reason, I see, to attend a conference would be to network. This is useful for a social media personality or one selling a service, but regular Joe's who are into Bitcoin, can do without that publicity.If you must attend one, be wary not to disclose personal information and be sceptical of any offer or service being marketed.You get to see first-hand the interest of others about Bitcoin and maybe get it off your bucket list.",

Right now i dont really have anyone i could talk to ab btc or crypto.Its a beautiful choice of priority. Miami Bitcoin conference will give you the best experience you may ever think of but how about talking to people in your neighbourhood about Bitcoin before the conference. That way you can groom new Bitcoin enthusiast and also people you can always discuss about Bitcoin with while you keep plans on attending 2023 conference",

Because the knowledge they've shared isn't really new. They're like the ones that are being taught in the forum by the experts here then.But I think that conference isn't all about sharing knowledge about blockchain, bitcoin, and the entire crypto but just for socialization and I think they're, the organizer, was successful if that's the case.",

If I'm correct of what you've described of yourself im not to social of a person, you seem to be an introvert. So, I'm wondering why you still want to get in the mix with a crowd of people you truly can't judge what they're capable of? There are many \"what ifs\" here. What if those putting up the conference aren't genuine Bitcoiners and aren't out to actually teach but to get contacts of people they're likely going to snoop on later? What if they're scammers who might likely ask to trade for you or provide one signal or the other? Besides, you've to reckon that once you put yourself out there and mingle with people you truly don't know; your privacy is compromised. You've to consider all the salient issues raised here and then decide whether you want to go that way or simply continue to learn online from the comfort of your room.",

Sure, I won't go to a dodgy part of town to some shady conference, but I also won't stop me from doing some things just because there is a minuscule chance of a bad thing happening. @OP It might be worth your time if you are looking for employment in that sector, but otherwise its nothing special.",

Has anyone been to one? and do you think its a valuable experience?Attending any conference that talks about BTC/cryptocurrency is definitely worth it. Not only do you learn firsthand the fundamentals of BTC but you also have the opportunity to ask questions to all the people that attended. This kind of interactive experience makes these types of conference very essential and helpful especially if you are new to the cryptocurrency space.Back in 2017, I also attended this conference (unfortunately, it was a ponzi conference USI-TECH) in our country. I was able to talk to various people who invested in this scheme and they provided and taught me the basics of cryptocurrencies. Though I highly advise that you prevent investing in ponzi-schemes. But my point here is that, conferences discussing a certain topic will always be worth it!",
