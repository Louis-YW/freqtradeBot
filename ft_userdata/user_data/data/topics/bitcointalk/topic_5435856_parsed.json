The reality sucks for them because they've got no longer hold their money and it's already in the Ponzi scam(o)pany. They do selective hearing and they only want to hear from the same folks that have already been a victim of that scam. It's tiring to see that many are concern and give warnings and reminders to never invest into ponzis but, the people keep coming and many new folks are getting in on it without knowing what they do.",

That is why I learned a lot. I am working in other country as well and based upon your opinion. Most of the time, those Filipino workers are the victim of scam. I have been there when one of my Filipino co-worker is trying to invite OFW's without knowing that it was a scam. After that, she was sue by many OFW's because they fell in a scam and even her was a victim.",

Prior to Lele, there's always been a notion that our SEC is only doing this to extract money (registration fees + taxes) from these investment projects/platforms.The sad thing here is that a lot of these people already know that such schemes are not allowed by SEC but they still go for it. They will try to beat the gullible latecomers (new investors) and exit before everything crumbles.Like I said in another thread, it's a never-ending lesson learned for them.",
