  "content": "If russia attacking those countries they are their own.It look like this Can the NATO really do something ? I don't think so becouse If NATO countries not touched you cant start article 5 If russia decide to attack them then as long as russia dont Cross the border to Norway or Baltics to any NATO area then by international agreements and rules NATO cant do much about it.If the NATO Will get involved to protect not NATO countries then the russia could use nukes.What's most important here that international laws are like business conduct laws it means you can see that something is wrong and you want to get involved but If you do that by rules and agreements you are the one who make mistake.USA NATO and all the Western countries want to play the game by the rules and follow to agreements.",

I don't also think that Russia is considering attacking Finland, Sweden or any other non-NATO countries in the Baltic region. The war in Ukraine was underestimated and the cost and consequences of going to that war is becoming overwhelming. Ukraine is bearing the most consequences, while Russia and NATO are gradually coming to terms that dialogue and not war is the best way of settling conflict. Do you also think that Russia would be able to bear the cost of starting and fighting more wars? I also don't think that NATO would be able to assist more countries in case of another invasion. The world in generally might not be able to withstand the consequences of more war. But my candid advice to you mate is that you stop starting threads on issues that seems to promote more external aggressions and lets focus on promoting peace and freedom",
