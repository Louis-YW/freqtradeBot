My worries is about beginners who are coming up, and if you make research most beginners in crytocurrency and on social media were once a victim to scammers and till date some beginners still fall for scammers. To me,  the social media would have been the easiest way to fight against scam, to make beginners get aware \"the strangers  you meet is at own risk \". This can always be in the mind when one encounter a stranger who want to offer free money or do business, one will have to think how real can it be.Beginners don't get awareness of scam on social media,  some mostly get aware of scam with personal experience.",

I'd say social media is the place who have higher chance to get scammed, even the account have a blue check to prove it's an official/real account, it can be hacked and promoting scam. Anyone will believe since it's a legit account.I think it's okay to get scammed for the first time since most people learn from their experiences, but it's just sad to see a same person get scammed for multiple times.",

To me, being on social media means you are not longer a kid and you don't need to be told about scammers. Although creating awareness can reduce scam as you proclaim but self caution is the best. And besides not all strangers mean harm. I'm sure in one way or another, we all have met new people online and transacting without fear.",

Obviously, the scheme was made for scamming purposes only, and newbies without asking the community can easily scam by this scheme. I'm also one of the people who was being scammed before that is why I search for places where I can ask how to retrieve them that is why I found this forum but their answer told me all Bitcoin transactions are reversible and no one can able to retrieve Bitcoin from a scam website. That's why I learn and always be careful with any deal that I made with anyone who trades with me that involves Bitcoin. I learn a lot here on the forum and I hope this forum can be easily found on google search because I have different search results on my son's laptop but this forum won't show up, unlike on my PC.",

Unfortunately, no one tells children (at least not enough) that the Internet is dangerous in its own way, just like real life, so if in real life they should not get into a stranger's car or take any food or drink from an unknown person, then they should show such distrust and in their online activities.

That's why we should always try to be one step ahead of scammers and think critically in every situation, no matter how convincing something seems at a given moment. Each of us can help to make as many people aware as possible by warning a friend or relative, regardless of whether he is involved in buying/trading cryptocurrencies.",

The greed is the most important part in these scam attempts where people beleive they are among some lucky people who have the chance of getting free rewards in form of tokens and completely forget nothing comes free in this world especially crypto internet world.The scammers on social media make fake profiles or hack account of renowned person like Elon musk and ask people to deposit coins to get them double in few seconds and people blindly follow them and send coins to those addresses and loose the money.So they need to realise that what they see over net is not true and proper investigation needs to be done but we still see lot of unawareness or say they have some greed factor inside their mind which made them loose money.Quote from: BitMaxz on September 02, 2022, 10:09:15 AMHow to retrieve them that is why I found this forum but their answer told me all Bitcoin transactions are  irreversible  and no one can able to retrieve Bitcoin from a scam website.

The experience one gets from having been scammed is often to show one how to better secure their privacy and keys. The awareness of how scammers operate is everywhere even on news channels, but these scammers also follow up the awareness campaign created to modify their scam techniques. It is always better to at an initial stage, ensure your privacy when using or login into new devices, new sites, new applications. Also, not saving passwords or keys on browser might be helpful as well as taking advantage of an authenticator app.",

We all knew how scary those scammers who are using a lot of social media processes down to more tight up technical malwares.People dont get scammed easily. Its either you let your guard down or literally tried the giveaway or some sort of of freebies and eventually falling into trap.

I was traumatized back in May this year when I just attempted to buy my long dreamed GPU through Facebook and the scammer I talked to was vouched by plenty of people so it would seem legitimate. I took the bite and got scammed for amount of $200+.Social media sites has been plagued by these scums already and they would not hesitate to adapt to how much you try to bust their scams and of course support of these social media site would do little to no help because their users are the customers in the end anyway. My trust for the Facebook groups/marketplace has been damaged beyond repair, so if I would have to involve money if it is crypto-related or not, I would stay away from social media.",

In my opinion, in the case of scammers and hackers it is different. Scammers perform tricks to trick users into buying something from them or following directions to spend money without having to hack an account. While hackers really aim to hack and then steal money (if the account has a balance)So, regarding the warning mentioned by mk4, it is a warning for social media users to pay attention when they are talking each other about investment, buying goods or anything related. If that person reads an article/news about a scam, and follow the tips to avoid scam, then that user will be safe from the scam.",
