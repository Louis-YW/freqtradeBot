  "content": "In 2010 forum user lazlo payed 10.000 BTC to buy Pizza for him and his family, this would later become famous under the name of \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\". As the days is now approaching again I was thinking about how bitcoin and especially the community has evolved since then. In my opinion there is an incredible amount of smart people that hold coins and try to make the bitcoin ecosystem better and better. Those users many times strongly believe that bitcoin is better than fiat money, but not so many of them actually use Bitcoin in everyday payments. It is even a good behavior under bitcoin enthusiasts, to hold Bitcoins and never spend them. Most of that users would not pay a pizza with bitcoins but instead pay it with fiat to not stop to HODL. In my opinion they want to show with that, that they believe in the future of Bitcoin but actually it stops it from being more widely adopted and just shows that it can actually not replace fiat.So maybe everyone should once in a while stop HODL for a bit and buy something in a store or online with Bitcoin, so it is used for what it was originally designed for. In my opinion we would never celebrate a \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\", without users like lazlo that spend coins on real goods even if the amounts might look stupid from todays perspective. What do you think, why is there not more use of crypto in everyday scenarios?",

Everything we enjoy today, there are people that paid the sacrifice for it. I can say that Lazlo is one of those people that followed strictly what Satoshi wrote in the whitepaper. Bitcoin was created as a currency but it has metamorphosised to investment asset. Again, the price of btc then was extremely low, no hope for wide adoption. If Lazlo had the idea what Bitcoin could become today, he wouldn't have spent that much for pizza.So, it could be said that bitcoin hodlers learnt some lessons from Lazlo historical transaction.

One of the things i do target on is on which i do accumulate as much as i could and wont tend be using it for some purpose on buying something even though there are merchants around me which i could simply make useof my crypto to purchase something but i do still remain on doing it with fiat which i do believe that most people are really having the same behavior since we know the potential profitability that it could give outthats why instead on spending it on casual ways then it would be more sensible if you do save it up and make out profits in the future even though its not an assured thing but at least we do have that kindof point of view.",

It is just an investment, but as you can see, most of the people now talking about bitcoin are about gaining profit from their investment.

But they would maybe come to be able to pay for their coffee..I think you're reading too much into the situation. Those that have the opportunity to spend Bitcoin in a physical shop, probably would. However, unless you live in a major city, those opportunities are far, and wide in between. Besides, we don't need to be spending them offline to reach a new all time high. We've got where we are because of how Bitcoin is designed. Bitcoin is being spent, you only need to look at a Blockchain explorer to figure that out, but a lot of people are now using Bitcoin as a reserve currency, which to be honest I don't see the problem. The main benefits of Bitcoin to me are; decentralised, freedom to be your own bank i.e cut out the middlemen, and a finite limit which actually means Bitcoin is deflationary in the long term. That's the real reasons, not because I can or can't spend it offline. Offline transactions come with more adoption, we aren't quite there yet.",

Another reason is that most people think that the fees for sending BTC are too expensive since crypto exchanges charge them very expensive fees, which they think are blockchain fees.In addition, even sending from a non-custodial wallet can be problematic if we do not understand the importance of input/outputs, transaction size, and mempool status at the time we want to make a transaction. In other words, don't be surprised that there are no more physical places where you can spend your BTC, because it's a complicated way of paying for most people.I pay regularly with BTC, it's mostly online because I don't have too many choices in that regard - but also because I don't want to attract extra attention.",

Basically, by using fiat you're accepting you'll forever be in the rat race, up until you retire, and what you've worked your entire life for, is worth jack all in retirement due to the inflation. Bitcoin, gives you the opportunity that I believe other investments don't, mainly because I actually believe in the fundamentals. For example, the freedom, not relying on a third party, and the fact that you can't just keep pumping Bitcoin into circulation, means it should actually counter inflation. So, obviously we're all in it for profit, but it doesn't mean when it comes to using it, I'll be converting to fiat, I'll be using it to better my life.",
