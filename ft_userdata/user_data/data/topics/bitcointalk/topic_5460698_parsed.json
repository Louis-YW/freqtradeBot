Base on your article,online casinos are taking over the whole world gamblers because it is easy accessible and convenient for gambling from whatever place that you are. Also online casino makes gambler to gamble in their comfort zone without any risk of been attacked by hoodlums when gambling in a traditional casino. In a traditional casino everyone will know that you are a gambler and when you win the jackpot everybody will be aware of it which might be a threat to your privacy. It is bad to gamble with your credit card,as it is the same thing like borrowing money to gamble. This shows that you can't control your gambling activities.",

There is where some of the enthusiasm for the so-called Web3 casinos and decentralized gambling platforms come from.",

I would say on this matter is that the older generation may prefer fiat because they understand it more while the younger generations, the gen z who are tech smart would prefer crypto. Because who uses fiat anymore for stuffs like this? Besides, I think that online casinos make more money from crypto gamblers than from the others.",

Another thing, we pretty much know what the ins and outs of gambling in between these two fields is since most of us here (and I know I speak for everyone when I say this) we've already used cryptocurrency gambling, land-based casinos, and fiat casinos too so we pretty much know what the strengths and weaknesses are of these things. Lastly, your site isn't allowing us to access it for some reason. It tells us \"You have been blocked\" or something which I would guess is because your site is region-specific. If you want to advertise a casino this is not the best way let me tell you.",

Taxes are the main thing I see as a pro for crypto gambling platforms; winning bigtime won't be taxed in an instant. When it comes on accessibility, this is the downside for web 3.0 wherein there are instances minors are able to play and gamble freely. Last is with mode of pyment, wherein I could say withdrawal & deposit are faster with cryptogambling sites.
