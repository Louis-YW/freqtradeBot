I have been tracking the progress of a few projects but I am not happy with the outcome for now. Maybe in the future, they might gear up and prove they are worthy of investment.

I know if they succeed in the smallest margin they would maximize my investment.   1.Sentinel2.Akash3.DysonWhich one do you think is good enough for 2-3 years of investment and for a short-term return on investment? Edit: It seems a lot of members here are not aware of these three projects. I also assumed that you might be able to just do a google search about them but unfortunately, no one did and that is the reason I have added links for you guys to know more about them.If you know any projects similar to them in their initial phase then do leave your comment tagging me.[/list]",

There are also many claims of solving scaling problems in a decentralized manner but couldn't deliver that promise.

I haven't been looking for a new project to be fair and haven't followed updates of more established coins for a considerable time. There are more productive things to do right now but I will probably start again after the second or third quarter of the year.",

Tbh i've never heard of any of these three coins/projects, but since i am not really interested in new projects i don't look out for them. Do you mind elaborating why you think these projects have any sustainability, and are different from the usual scam projects with fake promises and no utility.Quote from: elevates on March 08, 2023, 02:28:18 PMIf you have any other in your mind then do list them with your reason for investing. Please do give me an ROI timeframe.In response to this question, users are basically going to tell you to invest in projects that they have invested in, maybe the more people that buy it, then the higher the chances of the project pumping (only to dump later). I'd advice you stay away from pump and dump projects and stop gambling with new cryptocurrencies, it could be really risky.Quote from: elevates on March 08, 2023, 02:28:18 PMI find happiness whenever I see a project meant to solve world issues as Bitcoin did and has been doing.You'd be better off sticking with Bitcoin.",

Technology and projects do adapt whatever is on the trend and it's hard to say what will be the next projects that will be on the spotlight solving problems of the world. But before that, most projects should solve their own problems first like having their own chain problems.",

How do we suppose to take a look at what it is all about?Since the only certain project is Akash, I didn't found it to truly solve the world's problem, in fact, I didn't even know what its true utilities. I get computing power/resource marketplace has some potency of customers, but it does not necessarily mean it requires a blockchain or a token. The fact that it incorporates a token with how they operates, makes it shady since it is the norm that cryptocurrencies scam project, always use real-world problems as their solution.",

Not all same type or ideology can solve the flaws of blockchain cause there will always be one. Bitcoin is decentralized and solve the potential problem of control.

I would like to hear a more detailed answer.Most of the projects are trying to take advantage of various world problems and hype on it. At this stage, none of them really come close to this, and for many problems crypto-projects is not needed at all. Of course, some projects will be useful, but at the moment, they are still in their infancy.You seem to want easy answers for easy profits. Even ask the payback period of the investment.Investments without your own market research are more likely to fail. It is unlikely that someone will be able to voice you the real ROI, because these are risky investments and extremely unpredictable.",

I think though that just because a crypto project is trying to solve a real issue or is trying to be a green project and therefore good for the environment does not automatically mean, that it is successful. A few years back a project called Energi was pretty popular for a while. There appraoch was to be environmetally friendly because they were full PoS and they also had Masternodes. Nowadays though the project is not really successful anymore and the price is only going down.If you want to pick a project that is relatively safe to hold for a few years, then i would look for bigger and already established project. I recently bought Cosmos and now i am looking into buying NEAR because the price per coin is now below 2$ again.",

I am not sure how did you come up with such statement about bitcoin, but would you care to explain? Bitcoin is the most widely used and accepted cryptocurrency in the market today. It has so huge influence on the crypto market that if bitcoin goes doen, it takes the entire market with it. I honestly think you need to re-think your statement about bitcoin!",

I've seen a few projects before but the most they discussed were about economic issues, and not really helping/solving them directly but rather just investing in them of sorts.

Most projects are like that though, and some are actually just saying it for the sake of making them look good.
