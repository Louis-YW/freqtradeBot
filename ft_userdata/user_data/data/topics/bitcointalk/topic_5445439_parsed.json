I assume they don't even have 14K. Unfortunately Curaçao license is not a guarantee in these cases. 14K is really worth it, try to reclaim the money, for example, during a weekend trip to the country they accept: if ok, then its cool!

I think this story of yours should be moved to the scam accusation board, but I don't know how you're going to reach out to them because I doubt if they have any representative here on this forum. I'm going to stick close to this thread to see how this case is going to be handled and how this info is going to get to the project team.",

It looks like all of these happens in October last year, so you're still trying to get your winnings now? Since most of those websites have already been blocked and labeled that site as scams, I don't think you can do anything more than that. As others have mentioned, they don't have any presence in this forum, so while it is nice to warn others, it won't help your case that much. I think you should move on or hire a lawyer to help you sue them or something if that is even possible. They probably don't give a damn about your post on social media as long and will claim that they do nothing wrong since your deposit has been sent back to you.",

The Curacao license doesn't help though because back then one of the top crypto bookies here used to accept USA players while having that same Curacao license.Getting those winnings back might be unlikely even with our help because based on their response that you shared it sounded like it was already resolved by only crediting back your deposit in full which is what other casinos would also do if they see winning players that are breaking their rules.",

Not exactly sure how you'd go about this though, pretty sure casinos just change the static pages in their host server, and unless they willingly give out prior versions of the website version, I don't think you'd be able to get it. I dont' really know how to ge the \"google cache\" you speak of so maybe you can show that as initial proof whenever you post about this issue? Additionally, I've seen your inquiries in other sites, I don't think you're gonna get the traction you want here since I don't think iNetbet is known here nor do they have a team here.",

I imagine there are many people who the casino may have scammed but haven't or don't want to spread the word so the casino may still be operating and scamming other people.But it seems difficult to solve the problem @OP because the casino does not accept crypto and no casino representative exists in this forum.
