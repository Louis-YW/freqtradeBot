  "content": "When I first created my account, it was just to try out the system, and I didn't anticipate putting a significant sum in my PST.NET account. So, I didn't bother about the name and focused on my privacy. After buying and using my card for a bit, I decided to transfer $120 from the $28,000 I got from a business partner's contract into my PST.NET account to buy a virtual card. However, I mistakenly sent $27,500 to PST.NET because I had the PST.NET BTC address copied from before.Once I recognized this error, and given my lack of trust in your company, I immediately contacted the PST.NET support team via telegram. I even suggested that they keep $1000 if they could return the rest to my wallet, as I needed it to pay my partner's contract fee. But PST.NET informed me that the minimum withdrawal was $300 and must be done in USDT (TRC20) and would take 14 days to process. I was willing to give PST.NET another $1,000 since I needed the money for a business contract and a 14-day wait could ruin the contract and put me in a difficult position. PST.NET declined, so I requested a withdrawal to my TRC address on July 25, 2023.After making the withdrawal request, their support team asked for KYC and source of funds proof, which I submitted via email, including my utility bill, US ID, Webcam ID verification on Sumsub, and my Consolidated Retirement Plan from Dole Food Inc as my source of funds. After this, I noticed a $591 deduction in my account for card charges, which their team refunded after I questioned them, claiming it was compensation. This raised my suspicion about their credibility.Their support team then asked for information about every party that has used my wallet address, which I found impossible, given the length of time I've used the address and potential issues like the death of a business partner. They asked for my name confirmation, and after further discussions and clarifications that I'd provided all documents I could, they deleted my account and brought up a fake AML report.When I verified my wallet address through Bitcoin Who's Who and Chain Abuse and there were no risk or scam alerts. This proved that their AML report was fabricated to take my $27,500. I also conducted a BIN check on the card they initially provided and found a discrepancy in the issuing bank's name, further pointing to fraudulent activities.After fully completing their KYC process, they deleted my account with a remaining balance of $591 and a pending withdrawal of $27,500, claiming to have reached out to FINTRAC without a specified response time. They provided no evidence of contacting FINTRAC and seem to be illegally withholding my funds.Additionally, their office address, which I found to be a virtual one managed by REGUS.COM, and their real roots traced back to Russia, convinced me they're a scam. They deactivated my account, claiming to be investigating money laundering. It doesn't make sense for me to launder money through PST.NET, and I don't understand why they won't return the money to the original wallet:: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3548015: Here are links and proofs:Withdrawal Request  Verification RequestVerification PassedAccount DeactivatedPST.NET flagging my review on Trustpilot. $27,500:Payment method: BITCOIN:Proof of payment  Message from them after i requested withdrawal:",

It all sounds strange to me, and I have no way of judging whether it is a scam or not. It appears that they're operating out of a virtual office with no one directly accountable.

What if these parties are dead? Does this grant them the right to deactivate my account and hold onto my $27,500? Why didn't they request this information when I was funding my account or when I made my first card purchase? It seems like they're making these demands to stall the repayment process, falsely claiming they've contacted FINTRAC, perhaps pending their disappearance from the internet once their regulation expires this year.Quote from: PSTNET on August 03, 2023, 12:14:28 PMHi MarisWe must note, that none of you money was taken, they were frozen at your account until the investigation is complete.

How hard is it to issue a straightforward refund? You profess to have a transparent business model, yet you've chosen to withhold $27,500. What type of investigation justifies locking my account and retaining my funds? You're fully aware that cryptocurrency operates without central authority, which leads me to believe you're scamming me, and you must return my money. Why did you deactivate the account of the individual who tried to withdraw $3300? I assume this is one of your dubious tactics. If you truly reached out to FINTRAC, why wasn't I included in the correspondence? I challenge you to provide evidence of your communication with FINTRAC regarding this transaction, whether it's through email, phone call, or fax.Quote from: aioc on August 03, 2023, 03:16:01 PMQuote from: PSTNET on August 03, 2023, 12:14:28 PMThat is untrue and we take pride in our clear business model, and we strive to provide our users with the service of high quality and do not stop them if they decide to stop working with us.We advise your friend to drop a message to our support as well to check the status of his/her withdrawal.

PST.NET is a SCAM!!!Is there any chance you can find rest of information they are asking from you or no?I gave them temporary negative feedback for now, but you can go ahead and create flag against them, so that other members can review and support it.My feedback can be corrected later if they change their decision or consider returning confiscated coins to you.How can I create a Flag against them?",

I am sure that they're not going to return that money, that's a lot of bitcoin for no work at all besides being a scum of society so I doubt they will deal with that problem, pretty sure that they will prolong the issue here and talk about different reasons why they can't return the money and blame the victim.This is the reality - they're merely fabricating unreasonable excuses. I don't understand the term \"high risk crypto\". If it's indeed high risk, why are they retaining it and shutting down my account? Why can't they just give it back?",

Nowadays we've seen far too many scams hidden under the KYC and \"high risk funds\" umbrella. I fear that what they do now is that they're stalling, maybe they get another big fish before they have to change their colors to \"rinse and repeat\".I think that the best choice may be to ask the authorities for help.Quote from: Maris Lunt on August 06, 2023, 07:50:20 AMHow can I create a Flag against them?You can start with https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;addflag=3548015PS. Try to edit and add to posts instead of creating consecutive ones.",

Moreover, any information from your side about how your retirement bonus became 100% high risk crypto will be most welcomed and would help much the investigation process.Does OP need a lawyer for this case? OP just mistakenly sent his money and he even offer $1000 so you will send it back to the sender's address, there are too many explanations, I don't think OP created a fraud for him to go through this strenuous and depressing process, this will ruin your business and it will cause your bankruptcy because it's an honest mistake that you cannot correct by sending the money back.Let's see in the coming days if OP will give us a positive update, I hope OP gets his money back, there's no fraud here, it's just an honest mistake.",
