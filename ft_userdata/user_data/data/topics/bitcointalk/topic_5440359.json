  "content": "In our German local section, mr.relax committed already an offence recently: mr.relax luring readers into risky trades (and therefore losing Sats)After his previous offence, it didn’t take long for him to commit a new one, where he once again made misleading claims about his technical analysis (TA) trading strategy - and then sent me a negative trust after I criticized him...In addition to his unproven and bold claims, which he made already previously such like, that his technical analysis strategy would be \"4-7 times more profitable than HODL\" (archived)\"outstandingly better than HODL\" (archived)he created a new topic called \"Trendtrading\" (trend trading), where he claimed to \"prove\" his strategy. So far, there’s nothing wrong about creating such a topic and documenting his technical analysis strategy. Quite the opposite: I’m in favor of new and interesting topics. But the problem of mr.relax and his topic: it has been intransparent from the beginning and just to be there to \"prove\" that his recent bold claims about TA have been right by using misleading strategies. To \"prove\" his strategy, mr.relax resorted to a number of clumsy manipulations to make his strategy look better:his entry time for his first trade in his topic was misleading: while mr.relax started his topic on February 07, 2023, he dated his trade back to January 14, 2023 – while Bitcoin’s price had already risen massively making his trade look better. And if his trade from January 14, 2023 wouldn’t have worked out, we would have never heard from it. But now, he presented it as \"successful\". It's always easy to point out, that a trade has been successful after it happened. His fraudulent tactics have been covered in mr.relax luring readers into risky trades (and therefore losing Sats) already. After I asked him to post a trading chart to prove that his indicators were indeed showing a change in trend at that time, he refused to do so because he claimed he doesn’t want to reveal his strategy and if he does, it would result in endangering his strategy because \"everyone would use it\". Sure, if everyone on Bitcointalk had such a power to move markets and decides to use his unproven strategy...  He didn't make realistic considerations to add trading fees and taxes into his trades – refusing to include fees and taxes would benefit his trading strategy even more – but to have a realistic review of strategy, he need to include trading fees and taxes – so far, he didn't make proper considerations. mr.relax repeated his misleading claims of \"4-7x more profitable than HODL\" several times. After I criticized his intransparent approach and misleading claims (because his calculations are massively sugarcoated) and I suggested to be more transparent and less misleading, he childishly demanded from mole0815 to close his topic (because I exposed him) and mr.relax left me a negative trust feedback - LOL. It’s outright abuse of negative trust from mr.relax. tl;drIn our German section, mr.relax abused negative Trust, which he left on my account, just because I criticized his misleading claims and intransparent Technical Analysis (TA trading) strategy topic. Since mr.relax is DT2 currently (nowadays many clueless and / or fraudulent accounts are in DT2), he should be distrusted for abusing negative trust feedback. Conclusion: ~mr.relax",

Long story short and completely unrelated to this topic, I finally tried to tweak the trust list around one week ago, and just a few hours ago, I realized that apparently it leads to me made things a bit too complicated for my brain... and what's displayed on my trust page, but talking about it will be OOT.On to the topic, your post that I underlined, I don't think it's necessarily true. On one of the thread I read on my attempt to fix what I currently broke --or failed to understand-- I searched throughout the forum for clues --which also how I ended up on this board and nosily read this thread-- and read that,Quote from: TalkStar on February 18, 2019, 06:06:39 PM[...]Is it possible to be removed from DT list ?Yes, That is the advantage of new DT system. DT1 members can remove anyone from DT instantly if he/she is corrupted. For example if Majority of the DT member exclude you than you will be removed from the DT list. Suppose you included by 3 DT1 member but 4 DT1 member exclude you than you will be removed from there. [...]So, on this relatively new decentralized DT system, mr.relax can be kicked out of DT2 without having Buchi-88 to remove him from his trust list, you just need more DT members exclude him [~mr.relax].Please tell me I am correct, because this whole trust settings is a new territory for me.",

Maybe a couple of you have ~ him already and knocked him off but i'm not really sure because I don't think BPIP updates that quickly.Yes, probably he's not DT2 anymore, I've looked it up on wednesday and it might have changed by now. As far as I know, he's just one exclusion away from getting kicked out of DT2 since he has been distrusted by Nestade, GazetaBitcoin and me before the incident (see LoyceV's trust list viewer). Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 18, 2023, 08:53:38 PMI had to Google translate that trust feedback and I agree:Negative tag is not OK to be given for insults.I've not even really insulted him, but he likes to paint himself as victim...  Obviously he doesn't like it when his fraudulent tactics are criticized or his questionable positions in general. It's quite funny because he has been the one pushing lies repeatedly like the unproven claim, that Nestade would be my alt and that my trust from November 2022 would be a negative trust. He has even sent unsolicited and harsh PMs to other forum members.  Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 18, 2023, 08:53:38 PMNegative tag is not OK to be given as a result of disagreements.Exactly, there are so many disagrements. What a shitshow if we would start to give out a negative trust for disagreements for example in Bitcointalk's reputation section.  Quote from: yahoo62278 on February 18, 2023, 09:47:34 PMNow.. I see some sort of oddity too.You are trusting Buchi-88 (DT1), he trusts mr.relax (and makes him DT2) and you distrust mr.relax.Buchi-88 is a trustworthy member and it's just a coincidence.

And the current DT selection is very favorable for mr.relax because normally, GazetaBitcoin, Nestade and I are usually DT1. (edit: I misread that part, mr.relax loses his DT2 position if there are more DT1 exclusions compared to DT1 inclusions)Quote from: yahoo62278 on February 18, 2023, 09:47:34 PMBut if my logic is correct, an idea would be that maybe you also discuss with Buchi-88 review his trust list. After all, I see he's a fellow German and may be more aware of the context too.It's a suitable approach but I don't want to bother Buchi-88 right now, especially because I expect that DT will exclude mr.relax quickly. I expect at least 4 new DT1 exclusions for mr.relax due to his abuse listed above. So, let's see next week.",

If Buchi-88, as a DT1 member, keeps trusting mr.relax, it needs 2 DT1 exclusions for mr.relax to be kicked out from his DT2 position. Accounts are DT2 as long as one DT1 inclusion is active and are kicked out if they have 1 more DT1 exclusion than DT1 inclusion.

But I rely on the statements of 1miau and this thread.  According to our DT standards, we should be hesistant to give out a negative trust for the abuse mr.relax did. Distrusting him would be more appropriate because it would remove him from DT and his left feedbacks would only be visible under \"untrusted feedback\". Such feedbacks would not show up as default. Distrusting works by adding ~mr.relax to your trust list, which you'll find here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trustOf course, it would be the best solution if mr.relax realizes his abuse. But I doubt it after his recent abuses. Here's also a good beginners guide about DT: LoyceV's Beginners guide to correct use of the Trust system",
