  "content": "A total war breaking out worldwide would be a massive catastrophe with potentially unimaginable consequences. Such a situation would generate fear, chaos, and destruction on a global scale. Nevertheless, there are certain actions we can take in the event of such a dramatic scenario.1. Safety and protection: The first step is to ensure our own safety and the safety of our loved ones. It is important to be familiar with emergency procedures and ways to act in the event of an attack. Identify shelter locations and learn how to minimize risks in war conditions.2. Food and water supplies: If a total war erupts, access to food and clean water may become difficult or even impossible. Therefore, it's wise to secure a stockpile of food and water for an extended crisis period. A well-stocked pantry can be a key element of survival.3. Communication: During a total war, disruptions in communication systems will occur. It's, therefore, worthwhile to have alternative means of communication with family and loved ones. This may include battery-powered radios, walkie-talkies, or other alternative methods of transmitting information.4. Medicine and first aid: Prepare a first aid kit with essential medications and bandaging materials. Learn basic first aid skills. In the absence of access to medical care, these skills can save lives.5. Cooperation with local communities: Mutual assistance and support within local communities are crucial in crisis situations. Establish contacts with neighbors, organize meetings and discussions on safety, and share skills and resources.6. Wilderness survival: If the situation necessitates evacuation from your place of residence, it is beneficial to know basic wilderness survival principles. Learn how to find shelter, obtain water, and search for food. Survival skills can be invaluable in a total war scenario.It's important to note that these suggestions provide only a general outline of possible actions, and each crisis situation will be different. In the event of a total war breakout, the most important things are to remain calm, make rational decisions, and adapt to changing conditions. It is also crucial to monitor information, pay attention to safety recommendations, and collaborate with authorities or organized groups that can provide assistance and protection during a crisis.",

      "body": "Very healthy set of considerations. With the latest turn out of events, it's no doubt that one needs to learn some survival skills just incase one is found within the terrain where any kind of war exists.For those who feel like this doesn't concern them, don't also forget that people travelled to Palestine when Isreal gave a reprisal attack and they needed no formal announcement neither was there any emergence evacuation provision. Survival skills is a must for all of humanity.",
