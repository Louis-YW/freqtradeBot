We all know that most players who come from the Italian league does not really perform in English premier league for example, is players like Tammy Abraham who couldn’t perform effectively in the English Premier league went on to become one of the best player in AS Roma, we see players like Gonzalo Higuain who didn’t perform at all in the English premier league but was one of the best players in the Italian league , Victor Osimhen is a very good and strong player, can he adapt to the English Premier league?",

Weghorts is not a class of United, temporarity I hope and bye in this summer. If not United maybe Tottenham in future when Harry Kane will leave, maybe this or next summer. But will be very interesting transfer window with him.",

He has performed excellently in Italian League serie A with many goals and assists. I have no doubt if he is going to perform so well in the English premier league regardless of the strong players that English league comprises of. Though it is going to be a little bit hard for him but with all confident, he will still be among the best strikers in the English premier league.",

Lol.What exactly do you use to measure the toughest league in the world? Because Southampton got a draw with Arsenal? C'mon!! Getafe is 18th on the league table and they got a draw with Barcelona who are one win away from winning their league. Three game weeks ago Napoli draw with Verona. Verona is 18th on the table while Napoli will soon be crowned league winners. My point is that happens everywhere. Its not exclusive to the EPL. And you said the Serie A is defensive and boring, really? There are four teams from three leagues currently in the Champions league semi finals. One from England, One from Spain and two from the boring league. In fact, the Serie A got more interesting in the last couple of years.As for Osimhen, he's got to be careful the team he goes to. A striker needs a team that can create chances for him to finish. If the team don't create enough chances, there will be no goals for him. Chelsea and Tottenham are not going to the champions league so I won't advise him to go there. So that leaves Man United.",

It is the toughest league in the world because there is a very strong competition amongst clubs. EPL is the only club that a club that is topping the league,can end up losing the league to the club behind. EPL is not just the right of one club to win the league all the time,instead the league is rationed. Their tackling pattern is also different from other leagues. Osimeh is a world class player and has been the most popular striker recently in Italy. If he comes to EPL,I believe he will do better there,since he has the quality and fitness to a superb performance.",

Elite club scouts have made bids for Victor, but he will take his time in selecting his next club prudently. Victor Osimhen is a world-class forward for Napoli, and he had a fantastic season in Seria A. The Nigerian-born attacker has always aspired to achieve at the highest level, and he is currently the most valuable player in the Napoli team. He won the Seria A Golden Boot, which raised his market value; any team interested in bidding for him should be prepared to spend exorbitant figures.",

I can't wait for him to lock horns with Haaland in same competition to via for the highest goal scorer and best striker categories. The guy in the person of Victor Osimhen is a force and a phenomenon to watch. Another thing is him joining a top club, not Chelsea or Manchester United, because there he would not fit in and have game time in order to adapt quicker to the game pattern of the already established team or the one with a new manager. He can of course perform well, but he has to join the right team most importantly.",

Why not just make possible contribution to the already existing thread that would suit your discussion preferablyfootball transfer and speculation. This will reduce the spam level on this board as same or repetitive thread are constantly posted to account on user activities.",

Nothing is impossible and Victor Osimhen is also not the type of player who waits for the ball to flow to score goals, he is the type of player who works hard and has good skills on the ball. The Premier League is known for having a tough style of play and most of the players who play there are injury prone and I think what Victor Osimhen needs to look at is this problem to avoid injury. As for whether he can adapt to the Premier League or not, I don't think it's a big deal and I'm sure he can do that.Quote from: Sakanwa on March 28, 2023, 09:28:44 PMWe all know that most players who come from the Italian league does not really perform in English premier league for example, is players like Tammy Abraham who couldn’t perform effectively in the English Premier league went on to become one of the best player in AS Roma, we see players like Gonzalo Higuain who didn’t perform at all in the English premier league but was one of the best players in the Italian league , Victor Osimhen is a very good and strong player, can he adapt to the English Premier league? That will also apply to Victor Osimhen and there is a lot of concern coming from some football pundits, but it is not necessarily proven and I think Victor Osimhen has to prove the concerns of many people regarding his future in the Premier League.",

I don't think that any player would do well in any club he's featured in, it's ain't no guarantee - mostly, for the mere fact that he's best and scores more goals in his previous leauge.Secondly, English premier league is one of the most competitive football league in Europe - I don't see the same case with the Italian Seria A league. On the contrary, that's not also a prove to thwart/underate him on being signed into a club in the English premiership. It might as well turnout to be the best performance in his career too, who knows??! (Rhetorical)Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

If Napoli is unable to keep him, he will likely leave for the English Premier League unless he agrees to extend his contract with the club. Ofcourse he will fit in the style of EPL. He's a superb striker who has good footing on the ball and understands the position in front of goal. He has the strength and height to compete with his opponent, and I believe he would be a significant loss for Napoli if he were to depart. In Napoli, Victor Osimhen is in the spotlight. Victor won the scudetto with the Parthenopeans, another market dimension to be valued for the Nigerian borne attacker.",

It is really difficult to adapt in the league but Victor is a player who is dedicated and a player who plays with passion and heart when in the pitch he gives 100 percent, such a player can hardly fail wherever he goes. It might be difficult but I don’t think Osimhen will fail to perform in the premier league. His style of play is very similar to Haaland who is giving premier league a show in his first season so I don’t think Osimhen should be different though his performance still depends on the team he signs for. Manchester city has always be a top team and maybe the reason why Haaland finds it easy to adapt to the league. Players who struggle in the league aren't truly fighters; when things don't go their way, they simply give up and quit battling. One of the things I enjoy about Osimhen is that he never gives up until the very last second. He plays with effort and emotion and is a very energetic athlete. I’d really like him to move to the premier league so we can have a Haaland - Osimhen competition, it will be an interesting challenge the league will ever witness.",
