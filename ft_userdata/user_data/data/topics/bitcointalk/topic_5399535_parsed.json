Bitcoin hitting $15k is unlikely, although there's its volatility but I don't think that it will be that low again.But if you're waiting for that price before buying then I'd say good luck to you. That price could be reached just because of any possibility but based on different all time lows, I don't really think it will.",

Not that I want to believe him, but his thesis basically is.. we always pull back 80 to 85% from the peak... which was 69K. This makes sense looking at past cycles, and let's face it, in the current economic climate... do you see Bitcoin bouncing back to 100K anytime soon ? But I could definitely see it going lower... and not only for a month or two... maybe for the next 12 to 18 months. It doesn't look like it could happen, until you realize you're already there... and it's too late to get out.",

Bitcoin may not hit the price of below $15k again, that could be a big crash again but for sure whales will catch the price at $20k. If you really want to become more profitable, you will buy during the bear trend but make sure that you will only buy good projects that keeps on growing even if we are on a bear market.",

It was like everyone was panicking already since the corrections were so low that some people thought that it is now dead. I cannot say the same for the altcoins since they don't all just go the same way. Some do survive, but most alts that some called shitcoins aren't just barely enough even to pump back even if Bitcoin was recovering already.This is why I do not invest that much in altcoins back in the days and now I am full into Bitcoin.. maybe for now. It's my money anyway.",

But unlike the bull market these will be pretty hard to predict and enter into, in bull market no matter in which coin you put the money in eventually all of them are going to explode sooner or later however the same isn't true in bearish market so coin selection becomes highly critical.",

It usually happens when investors pour liquidity into some altcoins, there is a spike, sometimes even reaching a new ATH, and then there is the same rapid drop in price, following the fall of bitcoin. So don't expect that while bitcoin falls hard, the altcoin market will live and thrive. No, it will fall even harder, overall, but some altcoins may rise briefly.",

If you see an altcoin you like that's down by 90% or more then you may as well start accumulating. We are probably one pr two years away from another run.

Yeah and why not? as long as there was a huge update and it can against the major trend that happened with the market. I just remind you if you can also take a look at the gainers and loosers on CMC. that proves that if there are still tokens that ourperformed the altcoins.
