After a few days of syncing both titles start with no errors. In the Armory program I am trying to Restore a wallet from paper back. Easy peasy. However, I am getting:There is an error in the data you entered that could not be fixed automatically. Please double-check that you entered the text exactly as it appears on the wallet-backup page.The error occured on line #1I have checked and rechecked this line and I am imputing it exactly. What am I missing? Do I need to install an older version of Armory first?Prethanks to anyone who helps.",

Do I need to install an older version of Armory first?There is no need to do so. The root keys generated by the old versions of Armory are supported by the newer versions and they should work. How did you make your backup? Did you print that or did you write it down manually? If it's the latter, maybe, you made a mistake when writing the root key.",

The software is failing to produce the expected checksum from your input, and the error is big enough that it can't autocorrect, suggesting at least 2 characters are wrong.",
