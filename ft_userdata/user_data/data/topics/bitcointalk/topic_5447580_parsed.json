Of course hard working is consider as your discipline and consistency for you to achieve your goal. It will also payoff for you in a long time since you can adapt those consistency in the future. Actually you have a great point, it's also the presence of mind and your smart skills. You'll need to be smart for any decisions you make in life, its fine to make mistakes it will be part of your experiences and your character development. Let's be honest, smart people have a wise strategy to achieve they want unlike to hard work, since they focus on achieving their goal with repeatedly scenario without the change of character development.",

Success is our priority in the space and we can't give you if our targets are not reached. I know it's all a matter of time before we explore in enormous profits but our time differs. The amount of time it will take before your targets will hit milestone is different from mine, it doesn't mean if we started together, we're going to win together, that's not how the market works, I tell you for free. To be a pro trader, it usually comes with top sacrifices which might affect you for lifetime, the question is, how you ready to take that bold step that will change your life?",

I haven't known any trader who didn't feel like giving up when at some point they were making little to no profit and on some days losses. Successful traders that I know have the highest form of grit, perseverance, I would even say it isn't about talent or intelligence that makes them keep going it is the two aforementioned qualities. It makes them persist through the trading journey until they reach their goal.If you are a trader you cannot do it alone especially when you are starting out you need a community or network of people to fall back on for emotional and moral support when it becomes tough.",

The process varies depending on how easy or difficult it is for each individual. Those that do not give up and confront the obstacles ahead are the ones who enjoy it in the end. Facing a challenge as soon as you hear about it may be advantageous, but we often look away from it and want to see how far the process has progressed before taking on the challenge, which may result in the process already being hardened and one being unable to face the burden it entails by then.This is similar to the early holders of bitcoin, today, they're the ones having the rave of the moment just how bitcoin has shoot up since its inception. They join in early, and faced the challenge that came with the process and today they're enjoying it.",

Once he did it then he realize that his journies most beautiful part was the time when he was confused the smile on that time on his face was worth more than anything called success.Trading is a good career but it tests your consistency and dedication after testing a few years when you start making huge gains then you realize that the past is the reason that you are successful today. I use to recommend everyone who is new to trading that  bro be consistent profit and loss is just a matter of time if you quit then you lose otherwise everything is good just keep moving.",

The reason is that they are not ready and lack the knowledge to face difficulties and solved them.  Many people overestimate themselves and dive into the venture without any preparations or plans.  As a result, they often give up even before the journey reached the middle point.Yes, I am saying that success and failure do not depend on the confidence of a person but on the careful and smart planning of steps that are needed to be made in order to grasp the torch of success.",

I mean if you do that, you will forget your mistakes. It is important to learn from your mistakes and move on, move forward so that you never do the same mistakes. I got your point on what you are trying to say. But isn't it better to suffer first and learn to never do that again. After that, if the results are on the positive side, you will enjoy it even more than what you said. We are humans, after all. We are not perfect, we make mistakes. But those who wants to become somewhat perfect, for them the process of keeping records of past losses are important. I don't know, how are you going to be happy if the history keeps repeating itself?",
