My bad, I didn't understand anything. I wondered how this guy got 500 merits with this writing skill (Later, I realized those merits were airdropped). He never uses any comma or full stop. So I tried digging a little bit and saw this account's email changed recently. Susp 1Susp 2 Posting Section: This account was Probably bought by a bounty Hunter. This account was created in 2014 but never posted in the bounty section. The current account owner started posting in the bounty section on 02/08/2022. Susp 3 Writing Style: The previous owner used to buy and sell some of his services, and he had some posts with good English. But, Look at the recent posts. I don't think you will understand what he is writing now. Previous Post: Quote from: CPNpr on August 12, 2015, 08:56:03 AMWe can deliver UK Giftcards as well.

I don't have a problem with it. You should have a problem with account sales if bitcointalk means anything at all to you, because there's nothing good that comes from an account changing hands.  The new owner could leverage the previous owner's reputation to scam someone; they could be an account farmer or a bounty hunting shitposter who's going to leave a trail of nonsense posts all over the place, and probably more, too.Nice research on this one.  When I pulled up this dude's post history, I could only see some posts from 2015 and one from 2019, but there's definitely been a change in writing style.  Some might argue that it's not proof an account changed hands, but to them I say: it's more than enough for me to tag someoneWhich I just did.  Account buyers and sellers are all in need of a nice red paint job.",

He also applied to Stake Signature Campaign Without answering the question.  I assume that some accounts that are sold or changed hands especially high rank accounts are highly motivated to join this signature campaign. Do you know what the main conditions are? The manager only requires each user to improve the quality of his posts for one month and be sufficiently active in the gambling section before he is accepted into the campaign.That campaign will quickly turn into a spammer field where some the accounts are actually owned by one person. If the stake does not allow participants to register an account on their site using a VPN or TOR, then they really know who has joined multiple accounts in their campaign so far and is receiving payments from the same IP.",

Why do few people think that account sellers deliberately do not sell accounts with a password change? After all, it has already been proven more than once by the account buyers themselves that they have a rule not to change the password immediately after waking up.",
