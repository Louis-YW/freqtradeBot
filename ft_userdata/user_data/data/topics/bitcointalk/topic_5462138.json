Im sure Amazon keeps that data. If you ever had a financial review by a government, or in the future the government became increasingly tyrannical about cryptos and he was to force either Bitrefill or companies that accept to have their giftcards filled through Bitrefill, to disclose this information, the government would know that you have or have had Bitcoin, this is a problem.An alternative would be to use this only for physical redeeming codes or something like that. I've heard this can be done. But again, how do we know the physical shop we go into will not ask any information when you use such codes? Which would link the usage of the code with your dox. And if you mix your coins and end up with tainted coins, or someone that paid you had tainted coins whether they knew or not, you will be the one that gets doxed while using said tainted coins and you don't want that. This is why im not sure if using Bitrefill is a good idea.Could someone elaborate on this?",

You can buy gift cards from Bitrefill or other gift providers without using an email (unless you're looking to buy large amounts).As for the second scenario you mentioned, then I find it to be a bit unrealistic. Sure, you could be buying these cards for yourself, but you could also be buying them for someone else who happens to be a non-crypto user. The government has no way to prove either.If you're that worried then I think you could also exchange your crypto to fiat (P2P obviously) and then buy gift cards using the fiat.",

Use mixer or coinjoin or exchange between different currencies, like exchange BTC to Dash and then buy Amazon Gift Card via dash. It will be best if you are able to exchange bitcoin into monero and buy Amazon Gift Card via Monero. You can use BISQ exchange for high privacy.2. Use Amazon locker. You can easily confirm your mobile number by buying online mobile number anonymously or if an amazon locker is not an option for you, then use freight forwarder company, idk where you live and if there are any local FW companies. Be sure that they let you to pick an item via locker without ID verification.That's all.",

This is why im not sure if using Bitrefill is a good idea.Could someone elaborate on this?1. As far as I know you will eventually need to do KYC on bitrefill if you keep on using it. Also, according to their terms, they might ask you to do the KYC anytime they wish. So your first transaction might get flagged (its going to happen if they know you used a mixer) and you might have to pass the KYC to continue using their services. 2. Yeah, if you use the card on your amazon account, they will eventually get your details, so they can trace you and your coins. But there is no way to certainly know who bought the coins. What if someone bought the cards for someone else? Yeah, the alternative solution might work, but for only some cards. Like you can buy a walmart gift card and use it on a self checkout machine. They don't ask any information about the customer.",

There are many ways to achieve privacy when it comes to the BTC you have in your wallet, but some things are not desirable to discuss publicly.

When you pay with cash, the cashier just puts it in a box, they aren't put into an eternal immutable blockchain with all the details there to see, which would only require your dox attached to that transaction for a government to try to see what's up.

The activity is definitely legal, since it's marketing, advertisement of a service, however im not sure if they'll like you promote mixers. As a best practice I would avoid any problems, and by that I mean not showing up with these coins on either KYC exchanges or building using services that go along with your dox on each payment. Also if you have other sources of income, it all adds up for taxes.And also, if in the future BTC goes to 100k+ and you have coins you haven't touched for years and you want to buy a house or whatever, you are going to need to show up with these coins in a bank etc, you will raise alarms and get audited, in this situation, you would need to disclose your coin history and they would see you sent it to Bitrefill to pay for stuff. I guess if you stick to small purchases you could claim you didn't need to have that money taxed prior usage for payments, but with BTC I just know these guys hate you by default for owning any of it.",

The coins are in escrow before any fiat transaction is made. If Bisq solved nothing as you claim, it would have collapsed due to endless scams years ago.Quote from: takuma sato on August 07, 2023, 03:39:55 AMIf you have never had BTC in KYC exchanges, the gov does not have you as a \"bitcoin person\" on their records, so you don't want to be found using BTC to pay for stuffIf I go to a merchant in person and pay with my non-KYCed bitcoin, or if I use my non-KYCed bitcoin to buy a non-KYCed giftcard which I then spend in person, how are the government going to track that?Quote from: takuma sato on August 07, 2023, 03:39:55 AMAs a best practice I would avoid any problems, and by that I mean not showing up with these coins on either KYC exchanges or building using services that go along with your dox on each payment.Correct. When faced with some centralized service which is actively attacking bitcoin by proclaiming some coins as \"tainted\", the rational response is not to let them attach your KYC to all your coins and submit to their endless surveillance and invasion in to your life. The rational response is to not use such a service and instead use an alternative which does not do any of this nonsense.",
