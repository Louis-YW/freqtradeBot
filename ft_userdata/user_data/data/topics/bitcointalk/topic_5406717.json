I really want to know if I can actually invest into Bitcoin at this moment.It depends solely on you, really. There's a saying that's always the right time to invest in Bitcoin. I would add though that you have to make sure you know what you're doing and you should not invest money you cannot afford to lose (or keep invested for longer than initially planned).The price is low now, but especially on short term it may go lower or may go up like crazy. (There are other possible scenarios too, also similarly likely!). I don't know. I usually recommend DCA - buy more smaller amounts in different days - but, again, it may be good or not.Bitcoin has a history of making the investments look great after 4 years, no matter how bad they look earlier. I hope it'll keep this performance  Edit: keep in mind that all advises on this forum are ideas, not financial advises; you have to decide for yourself what you do with your money.",

      "body": "Bitcoin all-time-time was $68900, now at $22000, a very good opportunity to invest. But if you know you can not wait for long term like 2 years or more, I will advice you not to invest, or invest what you can afford to lose. If you hold, you will make profit. You can as well use DCA investment plan which should be better.",

Any price point after the peak or ATH is surely a great opportunity for investment. This is not a financial advice but rather just an insights on how valuable Bitcoin is in the future.We might not see Bitcoin at this price level for a long time once the market already recover and break the ATH.",

Now the market is slowly increasing again.  It looks like the market will not go below 20k. Now the market will gradually move upwards. so in my opinion i think now is perfect time to invest in bitcoin and also altcoins. we can get big profit in short time by investing in altcoins.

If you want, then you can buy more. It would help if you also took care of the risk you will take because you might lose everything with it. It's better to believe in the coin you are buying than buy more and more. Maybe that could make you richer. What is your aim or what is your \"why\" on investing?",

That's the easiest assessment that you can do, if you're thinking of selling then you just have to wait until price goes up.So, current price is $21,600.
