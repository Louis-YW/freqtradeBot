  "content": "I was a professor. And as a professor, I have had students threaten me with violence. I did not get much information about the nature of this threat. It could have been with a gun. It could have been with anything. I therefore naturally cancelled class because I did not want to get fucking murdered. And as a result, I was punished for fucking cancelling class. This is an atrocity. Universities simply want me to get murdered because universities lack all professionalism and decency and they promote violence.Do you think other professors supported me? Fuck no. More often than not, they just want me to shut up whenever I speak out the incident. And they are more angry at me when I rightfully associate them with Adolf Hitler than they are at the response from the university. They usually refuse to acknowledge that universities do anything wrong.I am going to keep on speaking out against universities until people acknowledge that their education is garbage and that universities promote violence.Michigan State University needs to dry its crocodile tears. MSU is only fooling people who are too fucking stupid to realize that universities are the ones that promote this kind of violence in the first place because universities are very bad. I have had enough of this garbage! Until universities apologize, they deserve the violence because they are evil. Nobody should shed any tears for the f***ers who were shot and killed at Michigan State University until universities acknowledge that promoting violence against me is very bad. Because those tears are extremely offensive. There should not be a single flower at their funerals because universities promote violence and are incredibly evil.I know that there is about a 0% chance that I will get any official correspondence from any academic institution that says that the violence that universities promote against me is wrong. And don't fucking tell me that it is just one institution. If it is, then all other institutions need to fucking call that institution out! Universities refuse to do so because they are a disgrace.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

I am now ignoring your incoherent ramblings and obsession about Adolf and let's focus on your problem: You have said the phrase \"Universities are promoting violence against me\" over and over. Do you know how weird that sounds without any context? That doesn't mean anything to anyone else but you.As you haven't even explained what that means. Do you think we can read minds? If so, i can try to interpret what i think you meant by that.Maybe your students might have reported your odd behavior and security has escorted you out in cuffs, which you turned to \"promoting violence against you\". Could be that you are hearing voices or someone stole your breakfast.Am i getting close? Maybe you have a sane answer. Only you can explain yourself.",

Canceling classes is a very serious offense in the academic field. If you have received a threat from students the ideal thing to do was to report it to the school or law enforcement agencies. I am also sure that it is not all the students that issued these threats but a few misguided ones. Even in my home country university lectures are threatened and sometimes killed by some students that are cultists because of trivial issues. But these few incidents shouldn't be used to generalize that universities promote violence. You might get another appointment at a university that promotes peace. It will also be nice if you cease calling people names that promote violence. All the best sir.",

And as a consequence, the education produced by those institutions is complete garbage, and the graduates from those institutions are garbage. \"Professor, I want to sympathize with you for your unjust punishment by the university.\"-Good. Then if you have a degree, you should burn it. And do not associate with any entity who has an unburned degree either. Universities refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem because they are full of bloodthirsty evil Nazis.\"Canceling classes is a very serious offense in the academic field.\"-I don't give a fuck at all what you think. If I am being threatened, I will cancel class. And if academic institutions do not like this, then they are just promoting violence, and they are just pumping out worthless degrees, and they deserve to be shamed relentlessly for this. There is no excuse.\"If you have received a threat from students the ideal thing to do was to report it to the school or law enforcement agencies.\"-The public safety office informed me about the threat, and I cancelled class as a result.\"Even in my home country university lectures are threatened and sometimes killed by some students that are cultists because of trivial issues.

I will generalize until I have sufficient evidence to believe differently.\"You might get another appointment at a university that promotes peace.\"-These institutions do not exist because all universities promote violence and nothing but violence. Why the fuck do you think they refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem?\"It will also be nice if you cease calling people names that promote violence.\"-Well, universities are not going to acknowledge that there is a problem, so why should I be quiet about this issue. People are just going to hate me for standing up for my own safety because most people are incredibly evil and bloodthirsty.Do not suggest I work at a university that promotes violence against me. Do not suggest for me to subject myself to violence. That is very bad.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Creator of Circcash",
