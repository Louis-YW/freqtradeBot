  "content": "Hey guys!I've won a ticket to the Bitcoin Conference in Miami in may this year.Unfortunately I won't be able to visit the United States this time of the year so I wanted to sell the ticket. Its an Industry Pass for the whole conference incl. exclusive areas to go to, drinks included and much more (see https://b.tc/conference/ for more infos)The original price for the ticket is 1.649,-$. I would sell the Ticket for 1.000$.Payment in bitcoin preferred, as I'm from Europe (if you're too, then bank payment should work fine as well If you're interested, please send me an DM. I appreciate any shares to people who might be interested! Thanks a lot.I hope to go there sometime, but this won't be my year",
