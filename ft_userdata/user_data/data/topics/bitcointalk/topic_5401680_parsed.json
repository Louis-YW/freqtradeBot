  "content": "Hello --Excited to show off something that we've been working on: the Bitcoin Note. The Bitcoin Note is a cash instrument that is backed by Bitcoin via multisig. Each note is printed with beautiful, currency-grade elements that use secure printing techniques typically reserved for government documents like microtext, raised print and foil. More importantly, each note includes a secure NFC chip which is where a multisig lives that allows you to claim the Bitcoin at any time.We were heavily inspired by OG Bitcoin physical money like Casascius coins, however, we wanted to created a design whereby (1) anyone can spend, gift and share the Bitcoin for years to come without having to worry a sophisticated attacker who extracts a private key from under a label or scratch off and (2) trust was minimized on that part of the printer (us). This lead us to the design we landed on for the Bitcoin Note --An NFC chip readable by nearly all modern smartphonesA two part multisig where (1) we write an encrypted private key to the note (and don't keep a copy and (2) you write a user key to the note in plaintext and then load the noteWe only release the decryption key when someone cuts the note and reports this via an authenticated and encrypted way to our serverThe multisig reverts to only your key after a printed expiration date on the noteYou can re-key the user key on the note you receive if you want to hold it for a long timeThe result is you do not need to trust us as the creators of the note. While, as I noted, we do not keep a copy of the encrypted private key this doesn't really matter: by the construction of the multisig, this key can never access the funds alone. Likewise, the expiration date means that even if we aren't around or refuse to allow for the claiming of a note by cutting it, the holder can wait and then use the user private key to claim.We believe that the result of this design achieves the goal of Bitcoin that's incredibly easy to use -- like cash -- but still preserves the important quality of self-custody. Take a look at http://bitcoinnote.com/ to learn more and reserve a spot in line for our release later this summer. Any and all feedback is appreciated and I would be happy to answer any questions.",

We needed to have a condition where the multisig reverts from 2-of-2 (the user key on the note and the encrypted key on the note) to 1-of-2 in the case where we go out of business or simply refuse to release the encryption key. This happens after the expiration date. It's a bit of weird concept, but we always want to make sure you retain ultimate control over the Bitcoin.",

It's a bit of weird concept, but we always want to make sure you retain ultimate control over the Bitcoin.How exactly does your chip change the multisig configuration when the expiration date is reached?I'm assuming that the unlocking script is already etched inside the NFC as 2-of-2 multisig (user-key and your own key).This raises two situations where the unlocking script would have to be updated:- You want to change your own plaintext PK- (as I mentioned) the expiration date renders your key unnecessary.From my understanding, you can't simply create a new unlocking script for the bitcoin without knowledge of the private key. You would need to have the expiration date check coded inside the unlocking script (I'm not sure if this is even possible), but it doesn't explain the other scenario, how can you change the user key and modify the multisig unlocking script to use the new key?",

I mean that nothing stops you have something else than you claim (i.e. you can keep private keys, maybe make it 2-of-3 with 2 keys in your hands, and redeem yourself the funds after a couple of years).* Will these items get redeemed only after expiration or by destroying them? I mean that usually collectibles do have a value even if they are redeemed (if they are not destroyed).",

When you re-key the user key you are really sending from the first multisig to a new one. We're going to release the script for review prior to note shipment as well as have a more detailed article on security.> Will you open source / peer review your technology?The script and mobile app will both be fully open sourced for review.> Will these items get redeemed only after expiration or by destroying them?Exactly; those are the only two conditions where you can redeem. \"Cutting\" doesn't require slicing the whole note in half, only a portion of it.",

The Bold Card for example uses NFC and allows lightning transaction by just tapping it.We designed these to be long-lived with few transactions throughout their life. We thought about Lightning but decided to start first with vanilla Bitcoin. As a payment instrument that you pass from person to person, on-chain transactions should be fairly minimal (unless you want to re-key the note). The Bold Card makes way more sense for frequent on-chain transactions, e.g. like a debit or credit card.> Also, is there any open source app, library, or standard that can be used to confirm that the bill actually holds the funds it says it has?

The apps will implicitly authenticate the notes with us (although, of course, that's trusting us) and we're investigating making them capable of auditing the multisig independently from us. In either case we hope that open sourcing the apps means that folks have an alternative means of verifying the multisig and how the apps function if so desired.Yes, definitely -- the UX of the app is really important in helping less technical users understand the notes and their limitations.",
