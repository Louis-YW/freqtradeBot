Mining secures the Gamepass Network and ensures its decentralization. Anyone can become a miner and join the Gamepass Network community. All you need is a compatible GPU and a mining software that supports the KaWPoW algorithm. You can find a list of recommended mining software on our website. You also need to download the official Gamepass Network wallet to store and manage your GPN coins. The initial block reward is 2000 GPN coins, of which the miner receives 51% for keeping the chain secure. The block reward decreases by 1% every month due to our custom halving algorithm. Mining is a great way to support the Gamepass Network and earn GPN coins while doing so.",

There is nothing suspicious on the mining pool and the KaWPoW coin algorithm is not new. The only thing that a miner can lose is to get some altcoins that cannot be sold. These are adequate risks for the miner that everyone knows about, but I decided to make a warning.I will keep an eye on the development of the project, and may remove the warning after a while. Further I will discuss only mining.",

      "body": "Important news on Discord\"Hi allIt is with deep regret that we have to inform you that one of the founders of our GPN project, known to us as G, has disappeared. In addition, more than $50,000 was stolen.We all work together on the basis of complete trust and there is no way we could have foreseen this situation. Unfortunately, we were unable to contact G after the withdrawal and we still do not know the exact reason for his disappearance. Perhaps the funds were vital to him.This news came as an unpleasant surprise to us, but we want to assure you that our responsibility for the project remains unchanged.We are forced to continue raising funds by adding the developer's share received from each new block, which consists of a development fund and developer salaries. Thus, the MEXC listed fund will receive 49% of the daily issuance. Funds withheld from GameFund will be treated as a loan.After listing on the MEXC exchange, we will begin to burn the developers' share until the loan amount is repaid in full. Combustion processes will be announced later.We have some assets in the development fund, both GPN and USDT. However, using them to cover losses will be irrational, since this will not cover even a significant part of the losses. Thus, these funds will only be used to maintain the operation of servers and equipment, while the developer's shares will be burned.We are conducting a security audit now and in the next few days.We will have to launch additional rounds of over-the-counter sales to recover the USD amount. We will announce new rounds of OTC sales at a later date.\"https://t.me/journalmainera/3005",
