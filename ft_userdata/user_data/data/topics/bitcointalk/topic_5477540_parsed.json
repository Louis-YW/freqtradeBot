Before doing any more recovery first of make a backup of your current wallet.dat file to avoid accidental data loss. checkout in the raven community https://ravencoin.org/community/ if anyone faces similar issue. Maybe someone solved same issue. Review the configuration settings of Py Wallet. Try to update the wallet to to new one.",
