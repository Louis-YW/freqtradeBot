  "content": "I am excited to present a proposal for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with the BitcoinTalk forum. As you all know, the BitcoinTalk forum has been around for over a decade and has a massive amount of data stored on it. This data includes discussions, opinions, and insights from the Bitcoin community on various topics related to cryptocurrencies.However, the vast amount of information on the BitcoinTalk forum can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate, especially for new users. This is where AI comes in. By integrating AI technology, we can create a more user-friendly experience for both new and existing users.The proposed project aims to use AI algorithms to analyze and categorize the forum's data, allowing users to easily search and find information on specific topics. The AI would also be able to identify patterns in the data, which could provide valuable insights into the Bitcoin community's sentiment and trends.Some potential applications of the AI could include:Predicting market trends and identifying potential price movements based on sentiment analysis of the forum's discussionsDetecting and filtering out spam and fraudulent activity on the forumProviding personalized recommendations and content to users based on their activity and interestsGenerating insights and reports for traders, investors, and other cryptocurrency enthusiastsThe AI could be accessed through an API or a web interface, and could be integrated with other tools and platforms in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Overall, the integration of AI technology with the BitcoinTalk forum has the potential to greatly improve the user experience and enhance the community's ability to share knowledge and insights. I would love to hear your thoughts on this proposal and any ideas you may have for its implementation.",

The search option is here for us to use and navigate around the forum, and things are being done manually just as they are being done. I think this forum is respected the way it is today because of the way things are being done manually by individuals opinions; everyone shares ideas; problems are being solved from different users experiences and ideas on every particular matter; no machine or AI is involved in gathering information to conclude what is what.In my opinion, I think the forum is just better off the way it is. There are lots of members here to help show newbies around and correct them if errors are being made. Spam is not moderated, but it is also manually detected with solid proof by members who are here.",

When theymos and/or a lot of community member doesn't support implementing an option to visualize Bitcoin price on any corner of the forum, do you think theymos will ever consider implementing this? I really doubt it. theymos would never take the risk of predicting price movements and then get blamed lol. I don't see a reason why the forum would implement that.However, as a user, you or anyone else can offer such a service through the help of AI and I'm sure that would be appreciated by a lot of community members including me.2. How would AI detect fraudulent activity? I don't think there will be such an option anyhow. You can never know who is a scammer and who isn't. Maybe based on certain criteria, AI will be able to detect some scammers but it can never guarantee who is a fraud or who isn't. At the end of the day, theymos has to take the responsibility which won't happen, doesn't make sense either.3. That would be something cool but you can still be personalized by ignoring a board, enabling notification of thread creation, etc.4. Same as 1.",

      "body": "I am not entirely convinced about using AI for this purpose. Sure, it could make the forum easier to navigate and help users find what they are looking for, but I am worried it might take away from the personal touch of the community. There is just something about a forum where people are posting and replying to each other that makes it feel more personal, that cannot be replaced by automated algorithms. Besides, there have already been cases where AI-powered content recommendation systems have gone wrong, such as when Twitter's algorithm started recommending conspiracy theories and fake news to users. The same thing could happen with forums. I think it would be more beneficial for us to focus on improving the quality of our existing posts instead. Maybe we could find a middle ground, where AI is used to assist human moderation instead of completely taking over.",

The bitcointalk platform has lasted almost 1 decades without AI, why is that still necessary?Also, assuming that AI will be integrated into this platform, even if it is known that it will not happen. It will come out that the communities here will be lazy to think mostly because they will just rely on AI that the individual should be the one to do. The other community members will no longer research in a natural way because they will think that there is AI, so the growth of the maturity of each community will instead of increasing what will happen will decrease even more, this is the insight that I visualize in the future.",

Members know their interest boards and wouldn't need any recommendations, sounds like we're on twitter where it's hard to navigate every content on the app. The forum is arranged in boards for members to easily ignore or utilize any content based on their activity. I don't think AI would achieve that for members unless through PM, a bigger red flag. What's the essence of visiting a board if AI, eliminating other topics, chooses the thread it feels would be nice for me? Basically it'll winnow out threads with little or no conversations.Quote from: RocketSingh on April 30, 2023, 06:19:59 PMDetecting and filtering out spam and fraudulent activity on the forumAI will see human written contents as spam and read AI generated contents as quality. Leaving the forum moderation in the hands of bots, is not a good idea. Members devote themselves to keep the forum clean and it's been perfect without any alteration; nothing changed, same process. The AI wouldn't work like humans and they'll be lots of complains from people who their contents were filtered out by the bot, and the bot won't be on the meta board to defend why it removed the content. But, users here give reasons why they reported a content as spam, can the AI give us unique reasons?",
