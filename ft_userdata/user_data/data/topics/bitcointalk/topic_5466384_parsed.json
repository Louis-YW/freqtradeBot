  "content": "today i want to show you 4 slides about the topic 'security budget problem'. since the whole thing is more related to mining, i deliberately chose this section for it.and since we expect next year again the next halving, the topic currently fits even more, because what is in 15-20 years when the block reward will be much less than 0.5-1BTC? should/will then increase the transaction fees in this regard?on the following website you can run through various possibilities: https://www.btcsecuritybudget.com/with this thread i would like to open a discussion related to this topic and we can write about all the consequences. the slides should serve for a better understanding of the whole issue  https://twitter.com/BTCillustrated",

And indeed, people won't be paying $50 for a transaction. So, either there have to be so many transactions that there will be well-paid by large companies, or the mining income has to come outside the main layer. I count on the latter.

The central bank prints fiat out of thin air and everyone is happy (minus inflation-concerned people).For better or worse, there's no BTC central bank to bail out failed exchanges. Unless Satoshi came out of the woodwork and donated his stash or something. There needs to be some kind of innovation, that it's hard to predict right now...When IPv4 was invented back in 1981, nobody could have imagined RFC 1918. Hell, engineers back then didn't even think we would have or need more than 4 billion devices.Internet initially was invented for military/university use. Nobody could have envisioned Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok etc. RFC 1918 made IPv4 truly scalable (we currently have 15 billion devices, with only 4 billion 32-bit addresses).It seems Bitcoin needs its own \"RFC 1918\" moment, but nobody can predict with absolute certainty what could that be or when it will happen.Of course there are superior solutions for scaling (such as IPv6) with no ugly hacks such as NAT, but I don't see it replacing IPv4 any time soon.Maybe because it would cost trillions of dollars to upgrade all internet-connected equipment and nobody is willing to spend that much money, so IPv6 is still a niche thing.IPv6 in BTC terms = a fork with bigger blocks",

Most node (with default setting) doesn't broadcast transaction which has fee rate lower than 1 sat/vB. Assuming block is full, it guarantee at least extra 0.01BTC per block.Hmm, I don't get it!?I assumed in my calculations 0.70 BTC, I just put the dot and not the 0 like Phil did so to avoid a mistake while quoting himSo, I don't understand the minimum 0.01 when we already assumed 0.70 , what did I get wrong here?Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 16, 2023, 10:36:30 AMI'd just say it won't happen anytime very soon. It's only matter of time before people realize maximum block size limit need to be increased, even with existence of LN and sidechains.Define soon and a matter of time by Bitcoin standards, cause that could mean 1 year and 10 years and it would till fit both both being extremely fast or extremely slow judging by how things evolve nowadays. And this is one thing I would like to point out, it's no longer 1900 and not 1970, you can't compare the spread the penetration of cars and the internet with embracing a bunch of code that takes no manufacturing, no distribution and furthermore no accessibility problems.And I'm going to be skeptical about it anyhow, one thing that Bitcoiners have besides other qualities is a sky-high ego, no way they will accept big blockers were partially right.Quote from: cryptosize on September 16, 2023, 01:18:40 PMValue-wise it seems BTC can go a lot higher:https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/bitcoin-btc-to-reach-100000-by-end-of-2023-and-1-billion-in-2038-predicts-industry-giant-fidelity/Yeah, another bitcoin IOU papers wanna be seller claiming random numbers, did he say he will eat his *** too?I need to bookmark this one:The strict value of BTC or the fees or anything on its own is quite irrelevant if we talk security.Bitcoin can be 1 trillion or 1 billion, the fees can be 1000$ or 1$, what matters is the ratio between those two- the entire wealth guarded in the blockchain and at stake in case of an attack- the amount of money needed to launch such an attackIf you're going to protect 100 trillion with a hashrate that can be bought with 1 million then you (and us collectively) have a problem",

Is that extrapolation or what? Currently you need 250 billion $ of ASIC equipment and 4 years to manufacture so many chips (assuming you have a big, advanced fab like TSMC) if you want to perform a 51% attack.TSMC manufactures chips for many clients (Apple, nVidia, AMD etc.), so good luck with that.If BTC becomes more valuable (not necessarily in terms of USD, but in terms of purchasing power -> how many sats you need to buy a barrel of oil or a gold coin), then miners (and thus the hashrate) will keep increasing, since they will earn more wealth, even via BTC fees only.I don't see any scenario where miners will abandon the BTC network, unless its purchasing power remains relatively static over time. In that case, yeah, fees alone won't be enough to secure the network.",

It's only matter of time before people realize maximum block size limit need to be increased, even with existence of LN and sidechains.Who determines what's the ideal block size increase? Regarding Satoshi's 1MB decision, he's most likely no longer alive, so let's spare him.And if we're going to increase it, why should it be static and not variable (like XMR does)? Variable sounds more elegant to me.Let's say the ideal size is 32MB or 4GB... what will happen to the forks (BCH, BSV)? What's the usefulness of them if BTC adopts a block size increase?Currently it's possible to fork BTC into a new chain, but not the other way around (merge forks into the BTC blockchain). And please don't tell me you're going to exchange worthless tokens (BCH, BSV) for a valuable one (BTC) at a 1:1 exchange rate.And if the ideal size is 4GB, doesn't that mean that datacenter equipment will be absolutely necessary?Jumping from a Raspberry Pi to Azure cloud equipment is quite a huge jump, don't you think?I don't see anyone seeking a middle-road solution (something that can be hosted in a regular home PC). I'm not saying a Raspberry Pi, because it's too weak, while Azure cloud is too strong.Just because a minority of people already have a huge warehouse ready to host a 4GB block-sized BTC blockchain, doesn't mean that everyone has the same luxury.Loss of decentralization is of no concern to them it seems, judging by the fact they support BSV, along with a narcissist leader and a pedophile.Of course someone could argue that ASICs also reduced decentralization in the sense of being specialized equipment, but on the other hand they make 51% attacks almost impossible (some people argue that Monero can be easily attacked by Microsoft/Amazon cloud, since it's CPU-based).I think it would be nice if ASIC PCIe cards existed (like GPU PCIe cards) and if more vendors started manufacturing BTC ASIC chips (Intel at least tried to enter the market). Maybe it's too early for that.Nobody has been able to answer these questions so far. Give it a try.",

That's the point of a deflationary currency.Even if miners earn less sats, they will be worth more over time.Transactions will keep increasing, because the network will have more users over time.And by \"users\" I don't mean just regular people, there will also be entities such as BlackRock and others using the network.More users = more fees overall.Sure, some people will be priced out of the market.That's where Lightning and even some alts (such as LTC or DOGE) come in. There will be DEX to exchange coins with each other.I don't envision a future where only a single, all-encompassing currency will exist (whether it's BTC or CBDC) and nothing else.Probably not what you want to hear, but oh well...We could increase the block size to 4GB and let Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS host the monstrous blockchain, but I don't see what's the point then. We may as well adopt CBDC if BTC becomes so centralized, no difference really.",

Is that extrapolation or what? No, it's an extreme example to underline the problem.Fess in the last 24h were 26.52 BTC, that's around half of that!QuoteCurrently you need 250 billion $ of ASIC equipment and 4 years to manufacture so many chips (assuming you have a big, advanced fab like TSMC) if you want to perform a 51% attack.To overpower the network right now you need around 4 million S19pro, each was sold at 2k, so that's 8 billion.Since the hashrate doubled in the last year, obviously you need just two years at the current deployment rate, not a possible production rate!Quote from: cryptosize on September 17, 2023, 12:09:48 AMQuote from: stompix on September 14, 2023, 09:43:21 AMAs I've said it too a lot of times, the security to market cap ratio will definitely fall if it's not propped by the still going up block reward, because if BTC goes up x4 times the fees will not automatically do the same, people won't pay 4x in tx just because a BTC is more expensive now.What if each satoshi is worth more? That's the point of a deflationary currency.So if Bitcoin goes to 1 million next month, you will feel it's normal to pay $40 instead of $1 when buying a pizza?I don't see anyone claiming that a tesla charge could be x100 more expensive and people will till use it just because since their shares have gone x100 times in the last decade! You're still transferring value at a cost, as long as that value is convertible and you have other means of transferring it cheaper then people will migrate to that.QuoteWe could increase the block size to 4GB and let Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS host the monstrous blockchain, A blockchain with 20MB which would give the same 20 times capacity would generate the need for a 300euros evo ssd in 10 years!I'm willing to bet there are 100 times more people who have that much porn than there are Bitcoin nodes in this world!",

Are you sure a 10TB SSD costs €300?",
