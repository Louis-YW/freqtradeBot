Was it required to have the PEPE name on new narratives or likely these developers can't think of a name? And, look at that last statement waiting for Elon. Guys it's 2023.",

You begin to understand that PEPE is generally some kind of soap bubble. No idea, no tokenomics, no roadmap. Just a means of quick profit. For a couple of weeks, the topic will be in the TOP, and then fade away.",

The golden rule of investing is to invest when no one knows about it, not the other way around. Now history is repeating itself, like with SHIB. After everyone knew about it, thousands of clones of this coin began to appear on the market. But none of the clones could repeat the success of SHIB. And what happens to SHIB now? The same will happen to PEPE and its clones.",

Will you change it?¬† My question is when will you tell elon to mention your coin in his tweet? it will send it to the pluto. SO, what's your tokenomic? Do all of tokens go for the community for the fair distribution?¬† This seems a clone from pepe. I don't even see any good reason to call this as legit coin until you prove it.",
