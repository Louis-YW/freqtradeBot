If it contains facts outside of BCH's vision it might be useful.Well given that Roger Ver is a big blocker, of course the idea of Bitcoin not having a larger block size is repulsive to him.I didn't watch the video but this is probably going to be a recurring theme within it that I am going to infer now.I mean, if people actually thought that big blocks were all that was going to be needed to make Bitcoin a fiat-killer, then that is misleading. Governments would never accept Bitcoin as something like that unless it succumbed to a lot of regulatory concessions that would have been easier to implement with big blocks (i.e. less nodes).",

You're one of those people who wear mask on their face because gov said so ? and took untested \"vaccine\"  ?Government is not our friend, it's just a bunch of people who want more power.

Nope. Why ? Because it's decentralized.Quote from: Lucius on August 23, 2024, 03:49:30 PMThe price of BTC is currently driven by some other factors and has almost nothing to do with whether BTC will be used less and less as a currency.Yes, this other factors are: Speculation, Speculation, Speculation.Edit: Forgot about Promises, endless promises of L2's fixing this unscalable junk. L2's that can't even work properly when network has too much traffic due to too small block.You are talking about possibility of paying with Bitcoin anywhere sometime in future while with Monero you can already do so, you can buy anything from Amazon using Monero:https://monezon.com/Now let's say EU decides Bitcoin is illegal, now what ? it's F-ed because it's transparent and so too dangerous to use.Privacy by default on protocol level ensures that whatever this gov monkeys decide, we will still be able to use it.The problem with Bitcoin is that people don't want to use it because it's too expensive and too slow to use even today.That's why Steam platform and other big companies have ditched it, that's why it failed to adopt in El Salvador.",

The reason it's mandatory to people who care is because people are brainwashed like you are now, there's no twisting of anything - only facts linked to true events which are all visible to anyone who wants to know.Fortunately more and more people are aware of the true situation, whether you like it or not.But feel free to stay blind, no one is forcing you to know the truth.  Enjoy Bitcoin Core, just don't call the whole cryptocurrency scene a scam when it collapses  Bitcoin Core (what you call Bitcoin) crypto market dominance is currently at ~55%, I think it's fair to say it's an altcoin as well, and not a very good one...BTW, it's funny how people like you never have any proofs or facts to say against Roger Ver except generic \"he is a traitor\".You know why it's funny ? because it's obvious you didn't do any research and just repeating what other Bitcoin Core evangelists said.I'm all into Monero but it's obvious to me from reading all the facts and hearing both sides that Bitcoin Cash is more in line with Satoshi vision than Bitcoin Core.The whole drama aside, code speaks for itself and Bitcoin Cash is just better Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, remember that ? \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\".It was not meant to be: \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-CeX-to-Peer Electronic Real-Estate System\" or more likely today: CeX-to-CeX.https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf",
