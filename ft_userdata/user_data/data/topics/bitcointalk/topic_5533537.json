Diversification of investment is to alternate your source of income income you don't have to put all your eggs in just one basket. Why? Because there may be leakage where the values of your assets in that one source would either depreciate in values or total lost of value to zero.Be aware that this crypto market is a highily volatile market which diversifying of your crypto assets would give you confidence to increase your incomes from different basis when the evaluation of the market goes towards your favour.So this isn't just about for those who don't know what they're doing or if they don't trust where they invested.You just need to be aware that no amount of huge income is ever enough for living because we all wish to live or afford expensive things that's best to our tastes, so getting to that heel will require an additional hustling so you can always reach your goals.You as an investor is not only advised to Invest on crypto currencies but on the other side of the economy so you can always give your assets on the volatile market some breaks until it could bring you income. That's why investors are expected to have investment target and be disciplined with their holding.Bitcoin is highily recommended due to it reputation and holds an hedge towards inflation While diversifying to other cryptocurrencies is required to make thorough research so as to find potential coins that'd be worth investing on.",

I agree that diversification is very unfavorable if too much especially if you store altcoin more than what we have in Bitcoin, I think that bitcoin should be more than 70% in the crypto portfolio that we have to get more exposure in the crypto world and also maintain the safe portfolio of even if you want to take Altcoin as diversification.I saw many people who made the wrong decision when they took more altcoin than the bitcoin they had, of course this would make them difficult if the bearish market came",

Why not go all in on the best performer?Same question I ask. I think what many people call diversification doesn't work here in crypto. Unless you are sharing your portfolio between stable and non stable coins. Take for instance you have your funds in bitcoin and Bnb. Now that the market is bloody, bitcoin is down and also Bnb is down. You'll be losing two sides and and during recovery, you could be surprised that only BTC will be fast to recover while your other coins collapses.In my opinion, just invest in bitcoin and if you wish to diversify, look for shares, bonds or real estate and buy. That will be fine.",

Probably because they have \"their own laws\" (hype cycles) and don't care about what the other coins do. It's of course not needed to say that memecoins are orders of magnitude more risky than Bitcoin.But all other altcoins seem to move mostly in the same direction as BTC moves, so there is not much value in \"diversification\". It's also very difficult to spot \"emerging\" altcoins, and holding most alts too long will also lead into disaster often because most of them are long-term bearish (called \"Degenerators\" in this famous article).",

So for me it's better to spread your investments across, like real state or stocks or even gold.There's no question that in order to be a good and successful investors, you really need to diversify so that when one fails, you still have other options. Unlike in trying to diversify your crypto with Bitcoin and then let's say Ethereum or any other in the top 10-20, doesn't make sense as most of them are way below Bitcoin specially right now wherein Bitcoin already had a lot of all time high's, while most of the altcoins is like 40%-70% behind their all time high and there are no signs of so called altcoin bull run.",

For example, in this case bitcoin with gold or with other investments other than crypto.When diversifying within the same scope it is not to make us feel comfortable but to make us feel worried especially for now there is still nothing that compensates for bitcoin in the investment made.Doing it with altcoins? I may have done it a few years ago but it was a mistake for me because seeing from the way things work today even though both are risky but obviously altcoins are much riskier than bitcoin so why force yourself to be in a riskier one other than bitcoin?Precisely by diversifying with altcoins as you say it will actually make us more worrying especially apart from bitcoin I think nothing is suitable for long-term investment.",

However, with such analysis of difference between gambling and investment, what is now the truism of not putting your eggs in one basket?Therefore, despite the general saying that bitcoin is a good investment, we can also see some coins that we can diversify too. For example, dogecoin has done quite well lately and people who invested in it didn't regret it. Likewise Eth, binance and some few coins have also given some returns.

And I do not think that you understand how crypto works as it has a bull run or bear cycle. Obviously, in a downturn you can make a sell and take your profits. And then you can continue to invest in the bear market as this is the best time to accumulate as obviously the price is very weak and that's where the smart investors take action. So what crypto are you going to invest in a downturn when everyone of them relies to Bitcoin market? All trading pairs if you are not familiar is BTC/X altcoin. That alone means that they are all dependent on it and where Bitcoin goes, altcoins goes. And at least with Bitcoin, you can definitely sleep good at night without thinking that it can literally go to 0 overnight.",
