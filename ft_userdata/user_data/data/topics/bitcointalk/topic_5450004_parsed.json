Gambling is also against our family values so I will just get scolded if I share my feelings since they will not understand my side. I create this thread to help users like me express their stress when they are feeling down so that we can help and hear each other.

      "body": "This is a welcome development OP. You know people go through lots as a result of they opening up to their various families about their activities. Sometimes they have the support but sometimes they get scolded by their families. In this case of gambling, most families are not too ok with it while some keep mute over it as it is the source of income for their living and some are open and bold about being gamblers. I once raised a topic of this nature on this same board and it was taken down but before it was removed I had a glance of replies and comments and it was touching that many people had similar experience to the topic I created and are looking forward to continuing with the thread to  getting response and possible remedy to their predicament but it was unfortunate that the thread was removed.OP your topic is ok but I think this topic is quite alright and educative and not only that it is educative, it is result and solution oriented and I am looking forward to seeing positive impart of this thread in the lives of many here.",

Be disciplinedDo not spend more than the amount of money that you can afford to lose on gamblingSee gambling as fun and entertainmentAvoid temptation of spending moreSet a weekly budgetDo not let your weekly budget be more than 5% of your weekly salary or wages. Do not see gambling as a way of earning or incomeQuote from: Beparanf on April 24, 2023, 01:42:02 PMAll off-topic post that violates the rules will be deleted without noticeDelete or report?

Rules should be rules, this is not about local board or anything local, this is a forum people from all over the world are visiting.Quote from: Beparanf on April 24, 2023, 01:42:02 PMDays without playing gambling:Days were good until I started gambling in 2014. I got addicted because I thought it could be a means of income for me. I lost so much and I quit gambling in 2019. I started gambling again in 2020, exactly one year that I stopped. I lost so much and I quit again for like three months and started gambling again. I realized that gambling should just be taken for fun and nothing more. Although I am earning income now from work, unlike that time, maybe the little I am earning now makes me not to depend on gambling.Quote from: Beparanf on April 24, 2023, 01:42:02 PMWhat is your experience for the day(Related to gambling;Leave blank if none):Not fun when I was addicted. But now fun when I know that I should only use small amount of money to gamble. It is now fun because if I lose, I stopped. If I win I stopped. I am even busier than gambling all the time, I only gambling during weekends, sometimes that I have free time to spare.",

Since this is in the gambling/sports section I expect a lot of post hunting comments for signature campaigns. Hopefully this thread remains clean and on topic, unlike other topics in this area.",
