      "body": "The first to vote here. I think Fury will win. I just don't think Usyk can take Fury's size and power for 12 rounds. Moreover, Fury can jab. And he also normally extends his arms to keep his opponent at bay when there's an attack coming. He could definitely use his reach advantage for this. Usyk is a great boxer, no doubt about it. But Fury simply belongs to another level, and probably size as well. The certain thing is that Usyk cannot finish Fury. So the only way for him to defeat Fury is to outpoint him. That could happen, of course. But what is hard to happen is for Usyk to absorb all the powerful blows of his heavy-handed giant opponent for 12 rounds.",

      "body": "Usyks did a great job defending his belt against Anthony Joshua but I doubt that he'll be able to go against Fury who is also as  aggressive as he is. Usyks is good and shows very good ability on the ring, but Fury is better to me as he can counter match Usyks attacks with same speed and power, plus he will not be as rigid, unresponsive and unaggressive as AJ was. Fury had this to say after Joshua fight, clearly he wants Usyk to put it all on the line with some good money as motivation for him.Quote“I've just seen Joshua lose for the second time to Usyk – out of his depth.“However, England has been relieved of its belts. Yet again, as usual.“There is a remedy and a solution that I can suggest. If you want those belts back then send in the Gypsy barbarian of England. Come on!“Send me in. I will relieve the Ukrainian dosser of his belts like I did the last Ukrainian dosser.“But its not gonna be cheap. If you want the best you've got to pay, it's gonna be very expensive.“So get your f***ing chequebook out and I will relieve that Ukrainian dosser.” source",

On the other hand, if you remember how many hits Fury missed from Wilder (and in fact won only due to a stronger head), then I would say that if Usyk is fast and Fury cannot knock him out, then Usyk will win on points.In any case, I would love to watch this fight.",

      "body": "What happened to Tyson Fury wanting an exhibition fight with UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou? Usyk pushes a high pace with his elusive head movement, angles and defense. But I think Tyson Fury is too big, has too much reach and is too savvy a boxer to have trouble landing punches on Usyk the way that Anthony Joshua did. Fury throws more punches per round than Joshua. Inactivity was one of Joshua's biggest failings. AJ took too many rounds off as rest rounds. He tired quickly. Even though he only threw around 10 punches in some rounds. Usyk will have a harder time outworking Fury to win on points. Its interesting to see modern day heavyweight boxers throw low volumes of punches. The athleticism and endurance of boxers appears to have significantly declined. When Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis and the other greats were still competing, boxing was a much more action packed and exciting sport.",

And then Fury's jab will also play a key role. He has fast hands and for sure he can hit Usyk more than Joshua did on their two fights.",

It's hard to see who will have the upperhand as far as the hand speed because both are very agile and too quick hands for a heavyweight. But I would say that natural and bigger HW will have the advantage and that is Fury. Remember that Usyk is a natural CW and that is why he seems to be very \"light\" for a HW boxer. But Fury is a freak of nature, at his height and weight, he is naturally gifted boxer and had a power in both hands. So for me, maybe Usyk can stay with Fury early, but Fury can match his speed and will eventually caught Usyk a couple of times for a decision win.",

Regardless of the trash talk or alleged trash talk, when they get in the ring do you think Usyk will really win?Quote from: Daltonik on August 22, 2022, 04:40:03 PMAlthough I'm rooting for Usyk, but objectively, Fury has a better chance of winning, if the fight takes place at all, of course, he is also hardy and fast as Usyk, besides, he has a powerful knockout punch. Among other things, the \"Gypsy King\" does not have too much of a break in order to lose shape, so if the fight takes place, I think it will be the greatest event in boxing and may delay the departure from boxing of both Fury and Usyk a little.Having a favourite is a good thing but in practical terms usually people can make a distinction between their favourite and the probable winner. I like Fury and Usyk but I think Fury will win based on what both of them are bringing in to the ring.",
