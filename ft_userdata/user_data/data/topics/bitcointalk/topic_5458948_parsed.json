But all of it was a scam and many have been a victim of it. And that can be the same whenever an official Twitter account of a project gets hacked. That was one of the craziest hacks ever and from there, it had made another BS thought from no coiners that crypto is just all scam. I do hope that people won't be scammed by that account.Teen 'mastermind' pleads guilty to celeb Twitter hackMan Behind Infamous Twitter Celebrity Hack Charged With $784,000 Crypto Theft",

Also it's a good habit that you always check their partners Twitter handles to see if the facts are corroborated, it's going to save you a lot of heartache since that habit as a first line of defense is going to protect you against scammers.",

Don't blame the victims, it's not greed from the people who gets scammed that needs to be blamed, it's the scammers that we should be blaming, who wouldn't say no to something when there's a sign that says it's free? I'm sure some asshole out there would pretend that they would say no to that just to be different but my point is, you're blaming the wrong side in this, the victims just needs to be informed and educated about the different types of scam and they're good to go.",

If they cannot secure their social media account how much more when we talk about the more bigger picture? Its crazy to think that they are been hack so I guess its better think twice than feel sorry later about them.Also if there's sudden tweets like they offer something impossible then its good to ignore it since most provably their account same like this is already compromise and the hacker of that account want to scam their supporter by offering to shady offers.",

So get in the habit of being skeptical of any offers even by reputable people especially regarding free lunch money.No one deserves to be fully trusted on the internet, but greed and laziness are the main reasons people get scammed which bypasses important processes to identify scams.A scammer always plays with our emotion of greed, and that's the most powerful weapon of the scammer. I have seen multiple scams happening these days in the name of crypto currencies. They are basically breaking the heart of the investors about crypto-currencies because those scammers are targeting the investors who are new in the world of crypto-currencies, and they are investing in new pre-sale projects to earn some good revenue when the coin officially launches. I have seen there are many such type of scammers who are offering fake giveaways to manipulate the crypto currency users. And, on Telegram I have seen that those scammers put picture of a very hot female on their profiles and seduces the users to send them crypto in order to have sexual relationship with them. Those females are males actually, and the worst thing is that they use AI voice changers to change their voice as a female. Many users have been scammed that way.When it comes to Twitter, then there are so many scammers who sometimes copy the official account name of a project, and then they get fake followers for their account. Once they successfully make more than 10K followers then they target the members of the project, and send them messages in the name of fake giveaways or other social engineering tricks. They have compromised many users money that way, and they are still constantly doing that.",

Scammers have not hacked popular accounts and posted fake giveaways for the past few months, now they have started again. So now it can be said that more such incidents will be seen in the next few days.",
