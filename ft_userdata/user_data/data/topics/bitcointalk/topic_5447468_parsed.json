Having some technical knowledge, is a must but of course there will always be someone to correct or rectify the idea buy thats pretty normal. Apparently, discussion on bitcoin forum is not strict but be someone responsible when doing one. Having to stanf out is based on your wits and logic to have a good content.

The fear of not having anything interesting or valuable to say is something that many people can relate to, and it can be especially daunting when you're in a community with other knowledgeable and experienced individuals. But, it could also motivate us to be better. The best way to overcome this fear and gain confidence is through reading and learning. By taking the time to read and research, we can expand our knowledge and understanding of the topics we're interested in, and use that knowledge to provide insightful and helpful contributions to the forum.In order to bring good posts and insights to this forum, we need to invest in our own education and personal growth. By always learning and getting better at what we do, we can become a valuable part of the community and provide reliable information that can help others learn as well. So let's all take a page out of the original poster's book and commit to learning and growing as individuals. With dedication and effort, we can become more confident and skilled in our contributions to the forum and ultimately help each other achieve success in our respective fields. Cheers!",

Read more or be interested, but do not rush to run for merits (I saw your posts as well as the merit application).Newbies often start in the wrong place, trying to stand out by creating a ton of new threads and unnecessary posts. Watch how people feel about your posts; if the posts are bad, your posts will be deleted. But that doesn't mean you have to give up.I think a lot of newbies can attest to how frustrated they were initially when their posts were deleted, and how they found their style to make posts readable.In addition, it is useful for you to learn how to use the search, as a lot of information is already posted on the forum. Thus, you will be armed with knowledge about what will be interesting to read and what will not.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5276341.0",

Be an expert, you will be a different user from the average user.I believe that this advice may be suitable for the average beginner who is new to bitcoin, but over time they may develop an interest in certain things such as learning the technical knowledge of bitcoin. As a new user, I think it's good for them to learn something relatively easy instead of jumping into hard stuff, but like I said, over time they can learn it especially if they have an interest.I think every beginner should have an interest here rather than be confused about what they should learn. Bitcoin knowledge is not limited to one thing, it is very broad and requires a lot of time and consistency and high interest to learn it.",

Because basics are what will follow you forever and if you have holes in basics knowledge and practice, those holes can be deadly ones for you in future, for your capital in Bitcoin investment and your Bitcoint storage practice.If you ignore basics like \"Not your keys not your coins\" and store your bitcoins in online accounts at centralized platforms, you will lose your coins someday if you are unlucky. Basically, don't try your luck like that whilst you can fully control it with your choice like using non custodial wallets to store your coins.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsQuoteI am from a region where Bitcoin is legal so I have been more open to bitcoin investment and trading.You must know that legal regulations can be changed. It can be legal at the moment locally at your region but it can become illegally in future.
