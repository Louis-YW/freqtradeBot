      "body": "As mentioned above, you can easily access your fund using electrum. To do so, you can import or sweep your private keys.If you import your private key, you won't make any transaction and your fund will remain in the current address.If you sweep your private key, you bitcoin will be sent to a new address generated by electrum. In this way, you have to pay the transaction fee. As the wallet in question is a web wallet and it's not safe to keep your bitcoin in a web wallet, I recommend you to create a new wallet in electrum and use \"Sweep\" feature. Warning:Download electrum only from its official website and do not forget to verify your download.",

Select \"Standard wallet\" and then \"Create a new seed\"2. Write the 12 words you see in a safe place and click \"Next\".3. Enter the seed you wrote in the previous step and click \"Next.\"4. Select a password for encryption of your wallet file. Leave it empty, if you don't want to encrypt your wallet.5. Click on \"Wallet\" at top of the window and select \"Private key\" and then \"Sweep\". 6. Enter your private key and click \"Sweep\". If you want to import your private key:1. Select \"Import bitcoin addresses or private keys\" and click \"Next\".2. Enter your private key and click \"Next\".3. Select a password for encryption of your wallet file. Leave it empty, if you don't want to encrypt your wallet.Note: Whether you want to import your private key or sweep it, you should add a prefix to specify your address type when entering it. Use \"p2pkh:\" if your address starts with 1, \"p2wpkh-p2sh:\" if it starts with 3 and  \"p2wpkh:\" if it starts with bc1.For example if your address starts with bc1, you should enter your private key in the following format. Code:p2wpkh:YourPrivateKey",

I mean, does it start with 5?If so and you've imported it to Bitamp before then used either the \"SegWit Compatible\" or \"SegWit Native\" address, it's automatically converted into WIF compressed.You can get the compressed WIF private key in Bitamp's key icon near the address or in the account tab.Also, take note that Bitamp's code s pretty much abandoned since the last update was two years ago: github.com/bitampcom/bitamp",

For me, I have not tried this web wallet before and frankly I do not recommend it. There are many safe wallets for bitcoin on desktop and hardware. You can imagine if the website of this wallet was hacked at any moment or hackers managed to slip through any bug, all wallets will be exposed to theft, also if the website goes down for any incident, all users of this web wallet will certainly be affected, also Bitamp wallet has a mobile application on Android and I found a lot of negative reviews about it and there are only more than 500 downloads on GooglePlay, it looks unpopular and whoever wants to risk his bitcoins, let him try it.",
