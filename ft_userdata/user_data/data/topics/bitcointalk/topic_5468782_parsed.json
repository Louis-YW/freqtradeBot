They can adjust the requirements to make it more competitive instead of removing all the benefits to user just because he keeps winning. It's not player problem if he is very lucky.Sharing this experience to be an eye opener that we can't have a consistent profit on a casino without being restricted.

You are lucky you are not considered the next Dana White who has been banned from playing in some major city casinos' due to winning all his wagers. Casinos give deposit bonuses to attract gamblers to their platform in order for them to use the deposit bonus to deposit and use the advantage of the bonus to win big from the casino. That's for those that have favourable wager conditions; they never expected you to be winning that much from them, and they can't take it any more before you use their bonus to win them out of business, and considering this, I believe the casino is not that big. I mean to be able to be offset by your winnings.",

It's not player problem if he is very lucky.Casino bonus is just a temporary promo to lure new players to try their casino. Bonuses is not permanent or if ever some casino promise long term bonuses, they usually adjust the difficulty or decreased the reward to the point that user will have a hard time claiming any of them. Does your win mostly consist of bonuses because you will sure be restricted if every deposit of your is always attached with bonus. Casino hates this kind of players since they can consider it as taking advantage only to their promo because you don't play without any bonus. You are lucky that they didn't pull you the KYC hold trick which is the common problem of people that winning too much.

This may be the first time I have seen one of this cases by myself around here.Unfortunately, this will happen specially if one is lucky enough on small casinos which liquidity cannot afford some gamblers to be consistently lucky with deposit bonuses. In the end, those deposit bonuses are more like a tool to catch the attention of the public, rather than a boost for actual profitability, as other have already mentioned.",

That's really strange. I know you have hidden the site name but even if you told the name, it would be better for the community to know which site takes such a step.Can you tell, which games you play mostly and how you win often? Any strategies which can be helpful for us too so that we also become consistent winners and get such an email from the casino",

So the restrictions in meant for bonuses and that doesn't affect your ratio of winning with your deposits,  well since you already stated a 20/20 winning record,  it shows the casino was done with you on that note and you have to walk away with your bounty and keep playing with your deposited balance.",

[...]wow congrats bro, it's the first time I see such a mail from a casino. To be honest I was starting to think, like other people, that restrictions were only happening at sportbooks, but obviously some casinos are also applying them. At least they've sent you a polite and honest mail and they allow you to freely continue to bet there while insuring quick and smooth withdrawals. That's not the same thing for sportsbooks where they usually also reduce to ridiculous amounts like few dollars or even cents the maximum bets you can place on most of their markets, in addition to lock the remaining funds on your account while asking an unattainable top level KYC to unlock them like random scammers.May I ask you which games you where playing at? It was mostly table games or slots?",

There are some bonuses that are temporary but there are some bonuses given permanently if you've reached or met certain prerequisites like VIP benefits which is what OP has been restricted on.But still just like OP, we can understand the casino's point of view of restricting him from these bonuses due to how he managed his winning in combination with the bonuses given but still it's kinda unfair to continue playing if you'll be the only one being restricted from that platform while knowing other players enjoy theirs.Just like everyone, this also the first time seeing these situations happen especially to be restricted not because of being an bonus abuser but just by being good and lucky.",

These gambling sites are looking for losers and people who constantly leak money into their profits, but they also actively take steps against people who only ever withdraw money. They are well within their rights to do so and it is the game we play. Don't take it personally, they have a dedicated team that reviews all accounts on a regular basis to determine whether they should still be eligible for promotions. There are so many different options out there when it comes to casinos, that you should simply take your business elsewhere and move on.",

I casually play slot too but not that hard core spinner because my slot luck is terrible. I’m actually feeling already that they might limit me because I’m only playing with bonus applied then rest whenever the bonus is in cool down for few days. This is my first time to experience this kind of restriction but I’m glad that they never apply KYC to my funds on my last win.

They probably do not anticipate someone consistently winning, which is why they might restrict or change the terms for bonuses.
