My speculations are atleast 10x for each of this coins which means the least 10k investment na 100k cashout etc. Why I dey monitor this two be say Ethereum obviously go dominate the space again since Solana dun dey shake and BNB go follow am for back and if the government no go over attack BNB and with all the burning then dey do, $3k per BNB go dey very possible by 2025 and $10k ETH.

I hated the project immediately I understand say SBF get plenty interest Invested into the coin and this was before the whole FTX saga self, like the way the coin self been carry grow been dey too suspicious to me. Make we sha dey careful and only invest as much as we can afford to lose. I understand plenty VCs get interests in the project that's why e dey do like say e still dey alive. The moment this project lose their backing, na downhill e dey go like dis. Wetin you think, this coin get any potential to compete with Ethereum for development in the next bullrun and among BNB and Sol which one you think say get more future price potential?",

Baba among the altcoins that follow Bitcoin closely in the cryptocurrency market today is Ethereum and a few other coins and as far as I know, I divide my portfolio to be between Bitcoin vs Ethereum because those are the best possible coins to hold at this moment and as a matter of urgency, one needs to look into the possibility of other coins, but in doing that, we must be accurate in our research and analysis of the market because it will give us the insight as for what the best altcoin to choose from and the coin with the best ecosystem for long term potential.Altcoins in the same category with the like of BNB ETH and Bitcoin are the best formations of a portfolio against the next market ride that is anticipated ahead.",

Ether is also good and the second that can be gone for after bitcoin, but ether too is centralized. What I know about Solana is that the coin is very volatile, and altcoins are gambling. If you are able to speculate the price accurately, it would be one of the coins that will rise significantly during bull run. But still the main coin is bitcoin which is advisable to be gone for.",
