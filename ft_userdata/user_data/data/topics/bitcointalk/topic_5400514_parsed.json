Another factor that you must consider is, preparing a huge fund of it because when it comes to marketing, you will needed it.Here in the forum? No one will trust you --sorry for this but this is true, people here did not trust putting investing in someone they did not know and I hope you are open-minded on this. You must have a partnership outside that people personally know you.",

I want to bring them into the web3 world. Through the funds that clients have been flowing, I want to build their reputation.",

If you are a developer, either focus on developing or be a manager by yourself. Yes you could do tokens and casinos and trading platforms, but all of those requires focus to have the best outcome. If all of those would be connected with each other, maybe focus on a little field such as have a token that could be used on a small casino (offers little games) and is tradable as well in your trading platform. Don't make a huge step instantly, take a little babystep towards all of those fields and focus on small progress one at a time.",

Some of these casinos do have a built in exchange but I believe that what the op mean is he develop the three platforms separately.It's not a casino that has a token and a built in exchange but indeed that combining all the three features in one platform is much harder and more complicated than having a single featured platform only but the advantage is that you can attract more people to use your platform as it has all in one solution and there is no need for them to go for other platforms just to do some of these features.",
