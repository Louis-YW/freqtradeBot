First, you mentioned that your friend had invested in Bitcoin, but later stated that he linked his wallet to a malicious website. However, from what I understand, Bitcoin wallets do not typically offer support for WEB3 or decentralized apps. So either your friend hasn't actually invested in Bitcoin or there is something missing in his story.That being said, scammers are known to create fraudulent sites and apps that mimic legitimate ones in order to trick users into giving up their private keys or other sensitive information. So it is possible that your friend was tricked into giving up his private key by a fraudulent site. However, this is not something that would typically happen.",

Greed really will bring you nothing but will take everything from you. Your friend learned a lesson here, do we know how much we're talking about in here?If it's quite big then certainly that's an expensive lesson for him to learn but I hope that it's not that much for the lesson that he has to learn that he should trust no one if it's coming from Telegram since it's a place for most scammers.",

It is an attribute not to be accommodated unless it can be met with strong thinking to ensure that the drive that greed brings does not make you make a wrong decision. The greed that most people have is what makes them more prone to becoming victims to scammers who know how to always entice and lure these people.",

Or maybe the OP's friend just lost altcoins because there's no way bitcoin can be linked to web3 like you said.It's a little confusing too.",

A greedy person is actually living in a misconception. No one needs a lot of money to live with a small amount you can live but for achieving the comfort zone a person gets obsessed by money and other things and this whole time a person forgets his destination.End is death always and no one can escape...

I believe the information you shared will help some people understand that greed is not a good thing and it really affects many investors' plans, and I advise we shouldn't be greedy to give a scammer an opportunity to enter our wallet.",

Like the OP's friend went through a lot of trouble he invested. He lost everything in an instant because of his mistake. I agree with you that beginners should first get good experience from here and gain skills then invest otherwise they will lose all their balance at any time and be totally broke later.

No one will be deceived like my friend. This is what always happens when you decide not to be satisfied with what you have and also when yo let greed get the best of you just as in the case of your friend.One thing I have noticed about greedy and lazy people is that even if they find out that a particular stuff is not legit as long as that site has promised to give them a significant amount of money, they are still going to risk everything they have just to get even if you investigate the site and find substantial proof that the site in quest is a scam site they will still pay a deaf ear and continue with their activities there. They only time they do actually listen is after they have been scammed that's when they'll finally sit down to listen to reasons. And now that your friend has been scammed I'm very sure he won't just go around anymore connecting his wallet to random sites, if at all he wants to connect a wallet he should have a separate wallet and a separate device (if it's able to get one) to use he should have a wallet he uses for airdrop.",

Investing BTC in a HYIP/ponzi scheme, which promises 10000% return? What was the name of the scam? More people should be aware of this scam and stay away from it.Yes, greed is a big sin, but greed also makes the people invest in assets like Bitcoin.

You didn't state the kind of wallet your friend had and how he got greedy but generally it is accurate to use a decentralized wallet and never be greedy. These scammers keep devising different sophisticated means of swindling people of their hard earned money that's why we need to be very careful and keep our password and secret seeds safe.  But I don't understand your link between covetousness and death but I assume you are referring to some religious teachings that states that covetousness leads to death.",
