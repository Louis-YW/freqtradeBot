I would be very happy to offer you this trade. I am not a trusted member, but I find this as an opportunity to increase my trust. I will pay first.

Good luck.I get it but it's a kind of paradox. Nobody will trade with me because I have no trust. And therefore I will never get trust. I know it's my problem and not yours, so I will not continue the conversation because it's not relevant to your post. Cheers.",
