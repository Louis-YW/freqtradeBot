Such indeed is a vision institution and Worth remarked as some others which has formally been given famouslism after this public awareness of this exchange.",

The media is multifaceted and they probably did their part as one of the news providers. The question is how hard did they push bitcoin to become what it is today and weren't they also one of the ones who always said negative things about bitcoin.Quote from: TravelMug on January 14, 2025, 11:23:27 PMIt's also worth nothing that they mentioned that it's not yet being used to buy a latte, but I think with LN it's possible to make this small transactions already as we have seen it in the last year or so.So this is truly a legendary video for Bitcoin enthusiast. These kinds of things happen and even bitcoin grew so fast beyond our imagination at first that it was basically not something that was interesting. Now there are a lot of people talking about bitcoin using their respective online platforms and I think it's much faster than some of the other online media outlets that are affiliated with news providers. Bitcoin can also be used to buy some things that people never thought of before even though it is not common in all countries.Let's just say they have done their little bit to make bitcoin grow like it is now and if there are still many people who can't see the truth then maybe certain people are not affiliated with something that is true based on the facts that have occurred.",

Those who really wanted to bring Bitcoin down no matter what, and those mainstream media who published other assets like Gold. Not sure if you guys are familiar with Zero Hedge a financial blog and then the pen name \"Tyler Durden\", who was also a big critic of Bitcoin back then. I haven't followed the blog though for five years or so, so I don't know if he chances his stance on Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Great points, TravelMug! The mediaâ€™s role in Bitcoinâ€™s journey has definitely been a mixed bag. On one hand, theyâ€™ve provided exposure that helped Bitcoin gain recognition. On the other hand, many outlets quickly criticized or dismissed it in the early days, focusing on the negatives like volatility or its association with illegal activities. Itâ€™s ironic now that some of those same outlets praise its growth or cover it as a serious asset.You're spot on about Lightning Network (LN). Itâ€™s made microtransactions like buying a latte not only possible but practical. Adoption is still growing, but itâ€™s exciting to see more real-world use cases emerge. Videos like the one you mentioned are legendary for showcasing Bitcoinâ€™s potential and inspiring enthusiasts. They remind us how far Bitcoin has come despite skepticism. ReceiptifyUltimately, Bitcoinâ€™s growth has been a combination of grassroots efforts, technological advancements, and yes, even a push (intentional or not) from media coverage. Those who still doubt it might just need more time or exposure to the.",
