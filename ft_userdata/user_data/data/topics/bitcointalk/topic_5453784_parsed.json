  "content": "I remember the good-old days where you could stake coins like Peercoin and Blackcoin on your own node in a decentralized (trustless) manner. After ETH announced its intentions to become a PoS coin, those days are over. Most PoS coins require you to \"lend\" your coins to a validator or third-party for you to start earning income right away. ETH, Polkadot, Polygon, and many others now work this way. Isn't crypto's intended purpose to eliminate the middleman? By requiring trust in a PoS system, you're bringing back centralized banking to crypto. Money talks, so don't expect this to change anytime soon.Do you think there's hope for PoS to become decentralized again? If not, why? Can we blame governments and VCs for the path PoS has taken lately? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

From a purely technical standpoint, this does shift the crypto landscape towards a pseudo-traditional banking model. The original appeal of crypto was the prospect of disrupting and redefining how value is stored and transacted. However, as with most developments, the implementation often does not align with the theoretical ideals.The necessity of validators in PoS systems has been a technical compromise to address the issue of scalability and energy consumption found in PoW systems. Validators or staking pools also help smaller investors to participate in the staking and earning process. However, this doesn't necessarily condemn PoS to a future of centralization. Blockchain projects are tirelessly working towards innovative solutions. The introduction of sharding in Ethereum 2.0 and parachains in Polkadot are examples of this. There's a silver lining here; the sector is young, and the opportunity for evolution remains ripe.",

      "body": "Perhaps we will know that POS is not completely decentralized or fully centralized. It can scale from partially centralized to a degree of decentralization depending on the implementation and design of each coin. Currently, however, most PoS coins are using a more centralized implementation that requires users to allow others to borrow their tokens to secure the network and receive rewards from censorship. transaction check. This can cause dependence on third parties and create re-centralization in the network. However, that is not the only reason. Some of the major PoS coins have developed with support from major financial institutions, including banks, and can therefore have a say in the design of implementation. Governments can also have influence over token management from a legal and tax standpoint.In the future, there is hope for PoS to become more decentralized. Several PoS coins are working on more decentralized implementations, including removing reliance on third parties and creating new PoS models that could potentially help reduce centralization in the network. In addition, many crypto communities are emphasizing the importance of decentralization to help ensure transparency and integrity in the cryptocurrency system. In short, PoS becoming more decentralized is entirely possible, however, this depends on the design of each coin and the commitment of developers and the crypto community in building. build a decentralized and transparent network.",

I saw some individuals might hold hope that technological advancements or changes in the crypto landscape could lead to a more decentralized PoS model in the future. Others may be skeptical, citing the influence of governments and venture capitalists (VCs) as factors that contribute to the current path PoS has taken.

When there are 2, 3 and so on parties that require us to entrust staking coins to other validators, then everything related to decentralization has been cut off. Today's PoS is worse, validators can stop the flow of bets at any time and are definitely not secure at all. I still believe in PoW and so far this option represents sole proprietorship of the owner and no interference from other parties. Highly oriented towards individual decisions to make a profit.The role of the government cannot be blamed because from the start that was the goal, namely to gradually shift the principle of decentralization as if it had not changed under the guise of encouraging crypto adoption to a better era.",

Too bad though, we small investors/users cannot do much about this since it is what makes these things thrive despite the strict regulations. Two good things to be positive about this though is that it reduces scams and aids mass adoption even if it's just a little. Where PoS goes from here is something that we can only speculate about at the moment. Until we see favorable regulations for this industry, we really can't tell for sure. I'm keeping my hopes up though, since there are still a couple of people that are leaned more on privacy rather than just profits.",

Nah, I don't think that it will go back to where it used to be, unfortunately.With the way the validators are making huge money (although it takes as well to invest a lot, but the returns are good). And with so many crypto investors willing to be a validator and everything now is a business? no one is willing to get back from the past. It's might not sound goods, but money matters has taken over the market already. Decentralization has been put aside, everyone is pursuing on how to get rich easy and quick right now.
