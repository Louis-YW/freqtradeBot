They will make you think they have genuine intentions here, and yet they don't. There was one serial scammer who was good at doing this, and one of his favorite boards was currency exchange.He would go as far as exposing other scammers in order to gain merit and trust, only to end up scamming someone. He was also good at leaving retaliatory feedback from the many of his alts that kept getting busted. I won't be surprised if he's the same guy.",

Quote from: aew on November 14, 2022, 03:04:02 AMTg @eatth90[...]I would agree with examplens that more context is needed on the refund; whether it is due to paypal's policy or extrarakeback is finally fulfilling his part of the deal. And that the alt account is a completely different issue, perhaps an even different thread --or you can simpy just edit the title-- for an accusation of merit abuse, alt account --this one is actually not prohibited by the forum-- and fake credibiity.With that said, and a fair warning that my post will borderline out of the original topic at hand, if I may add a little bit to the scale for the case of merit abuse and --as I said above-- fake credibility, I actually have took interest on his account for a while, since I stumbled upon his colorful reply on a neighboring scam accusation thread, where he gave a... rather incorrect statement that I've been itching to reply but decided against it because... well, the thread went to sleep after someone else told him that his smart ass reply is wrong.But that's not before I looked into his merit history which instantly rang an alarm of abuse between him and aew because they gave each other a lot of merit. Which prompt me to rake --pun intended-- both of their post histories. Unfortunatelly, I can't find a strong evidence that tied them as one person at that time --it was around late October.The closest was how aew choose a very similar name-style for his TG handler --extrarakeback himself changed tg handler several times throughout his \"career\"-- @eattheblock which funnily also used by a tagged account martinglecalculator. And such weak evidence linking both account is not good. Little did I know that after I stopped looking, the evidence came to myself as extrarakeback slipped.That's for merit abuse and alt account. Now, for fake credibility, extrarakeback has a site of referral where he would share his earning from referrals back to the people who joined through his link --not sure if it's still running or not, I can never accessed his site no matter what browser I use-- guess what? Aew come to be the first who join and happen to give a good impression, which if they're indeed are the same person --and which the evidence so far strongly pointing that way-- is kinda a clever marketing... in a dirty way.Quote from: aew on August 07, 2022, 09:06:31 AMQuote from: Extrarakeback on August 07, 2022, 08:29:02 AMQuote from: aew on August 07, 2022, 06:53:48 AMUsernameaew986I think you mean aew1986 right ? Anyway bonus sent to aew1986 . Thank you. My bad   . Thank you Quote from: Extrarakeback on August 10, 2022, 06:31:34 AMQuote from: aew on August 10, 2022, 04:43:24 AMGot my payment last Sunday thank you. Also joined Windice by your site Thank you for the feedback.

My username at windice aew334I wagered a lot but lost allSentOh, extrarakeback also threw a generous wager competition, presumably to persuade people to bet more often and gave him more revenue from the referral, and how fortunate it is that only one participant joined the event:And let's not leave this issue behind which will probably lead people to trust him and deal with him:Quote from: Extrarakeback on August 25, 2022, 11:01:17 AMQuote from: aew on August 25, 2022, 10:53:23 AMQuote from: Extrarakeback on August 20, 2022, 05:58:25 AMAgain need 120$ paypal for 120$ btcYou still need ?
