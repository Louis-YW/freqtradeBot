  "content": "Updated: 20th December 2023.First things first: What is P2P-Trading?Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is a way of buying and selling cryptocurrencies where traders buy and sell directly with each other on a cryptocurrency exchange app or website.The cryptocurrency exchange provides an online platform to connect buyers to sellers and sellers to buyers. The exchange also acts as a regulator between both parties to ensure safe trading.To further explain, think of the cryptocurrency exchange platform as a marketplace where a buyer and seller come together to trade with each other.As it happens in the market, a seller can set their own prices, and the buyer can choose to buy from them or move to another seller with preferable prices.Source: https://blog.obiex.finance/what-is-p2p-trading/What should you to think about before you start your P2P JourneyResearch about what platform suits you best, be sure it has a good and safe Escrow service and also that it's good traffic with the payment option's you want to use.Never keep funds on the ExchangeDon't keep more funds then you need for your trading in the Exchange wallet. Most Exchange's offer a custodial wallet service and yo don't want to keep funds there, you want to use a non-custodial wallet.Rome wasn't built in a dayP2P trading is a marathon and not a 100m race. Always re-invest your profit back to the trading so you increase your trading volume and also your profits. In the beginning it will probably be quite slow until you earned some reputation and got feedback on the platform you using but don't panic, have patience and keep grinding.Two-factor authentication (2FA)You should activate 2FA directly after creating your account, it will pretend unauthorized people from accessing your account and give you a higher security.Never share your contact info or sensetive infoNow I see many scammers trying this one, they open a trade and then in someway trying to do so you share your e-mail. And if you do they will send a phising e-mail and if you open it they got access to your account.Two factor authentication?At least I think everyone should activate two factor authentication with an app and not e-mail. This will increase your security A LOT!History does not matterNever trust anyone regardless your history and past trades together. you never know the reason of why your partner is trading today. Example: always be careful when someone offers to make a trade and ask if they can make the payment later, even tho your partner has been honest in the past you don't know what's hes next move is and why. Rather play safe.  ðŸš« No cash No crypto. ðŸš« Watch out for dishonest tradersScammers will try to send fake payment link/email/SMS/notifications. Always verify that you have received the payment with checking if the money is reflected on your account.It's possible a scammer will pretend to be \"moderator\" in a Dispute and in that stage trying to send you phishing links/e-mail.Minimize feesFees is something everyone in the crypto world is well know to, everyone probably dislike them but they fit's their purpose and need to be here so we accept them.

The one's says it hard have probably never P2P-traded. It's so easy you buy for one price and sell for a higher price.BUT you need to farm and get a good network so after you bought you must be able to sell fast (So you don't risk the currency go down)Cheers buddie.",

Also that Binance remains the best exchange to do p2p trading transactions, because I know that they have more traffic of transactions than other exchanges. P2P trading on exchanges sounds simple if the trader is knowledgeable about these simple facts that are mentioned, otherwise it can be difficult and unproductive for someone that doesn't understand the information supplied by you and the OP.",

I think that's the best advice for P2P-Trading. If everyone did this, a lot less scams would have happen. The scammers often target new accounts.Example: My account is old so I never get any scam attempts, but I just invited two of my friends to the crypto world and P2P-Trading and damn scammers open trade with them and try the most stupids scam I ever seen.But lucky they always ask me first and I told them before they started always check your balance, never share contact info in trade chat and more.Quote from: safar1980 on December 19, 2023, 11:39:43 AMQuote from: Bitcoinpoly on December 19, 2023, 04:24:55 AMP2P isnâ€™t hard as people perceive it to be.

I stopped using Bitget after their rules changed.Often the one's with KYC have much more traffic, at least that what I think but maybe I am wrong? But that's the reason I use them. I am 100% honest with P2P trading if you use good payment options and are active you can make sick %-profit. Of course I have being scammed sometimes but I never get scammed the same way twice and it was only low amounts so I can survive it, the biggest was BTC for $220 around two years ago.But what you maybe can do is what I did I used my driver license that expired one week later and now it's not valid as a ID and they have not asked med to update my ID yet (The P2P-website). Also before you had to verify your address but some P2P-Exchanges has removed requirement now.And also I have tried that website that don't require KYC for register but i felt the traffic was to low. I used this LocalCoinSwap",

With patience you can easily increase your crypto holdings but it's very important to always have patience and not be greedy and of course always watch put for scammers.It's sad that we need to keep our eyes for scammers but sadly that the world we living in and also one negative thing is the KYC & AML, but I can understand why they need to be there and if you can see pass that you can do very well with increasing your totally Bitcoin holdings for example tho I have to agree with what many other says on this forum the safest way is to just hold your Bitcoins and not go out and trade with them, but for us that not are super rich and came in late to the crypto world I think it's a good way to increase your crypto currencies holdings in general. And IMO P2P-Trading is much safer then Trading if your goal is to increase your crypto holdings but as I said, must always be aware of scammersÂ  & scams.Â  Quote from: Richbased on December 30, 2023, 04:28:53 AMQuote from: bettercrypto on December 29, 2023, 05:01:07 PMThe p2p features on an exchange are a great help for traders who used to transact in their fiat currency.
