For what's it worth I think it's a attempt to try to steal the skins, and yes I see that Escrow is accepted, but that just a fake sense of security since in PM or somewhere else he probably would try to avoid it.1. 01 November 2023, 06:23:33 - Registered on the forum. 2. 01 November 2023, 08:09:25 - Asking for a $4500 USD loan here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472383.msg63085605#msg630856053. 02 November 2023, 01:45:07 - Start to offer a service \"(Traffic) Exclusive SEO Service Packages Tailored to Your Budget!4. 02 November 2023, 05:18:09 - Offer a new service again \"ðŸ“Œ[TOP] Supercharge ðŸ”¥ Your Group Chat Engagement with Our Pro ChattersðŸ’¬ðŸ’»!\"Nothing strange in that expect the early loan request right?

Right or wrong is not up to me to judge I leave that to others, but if OP is serious about his request I want to warn him.- Regards BabyB. ðŸ‘¼",
