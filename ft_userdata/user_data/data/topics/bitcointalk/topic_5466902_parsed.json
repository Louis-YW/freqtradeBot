One thing that makes me interested in these attacks is that the slot cannot be played/out of service since don't really know the work of physical slots. I always think the physical slots have their own system (not connected to some server or something like that) because the slots are physical.Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cavxJjgGNno https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq9rnMh2lhgThe hack also leaked customer data like (Social Security, etc). What do you think? last week we had (Stake) hacked and now land base casino just got attacked. It's there some chance we have an insider person for these cases?By these cases? do slot can be manipulated ?",

I'm not sure how this happened but I remember playing on physical slot that literally doesn't have server connection. Maybe new slot nowadays also works like the online slot games which they are all connected to each other when playing same games from one provider?",

I always think the physical slots have their own system (not connected to some server or something like that) because the slots are physical.By these cases? do slot can be manipulated ?Slots machines at there are still connected to the network, probably local/intranet for billing and data telemetry gathering at minimum. Some old machine has their RNG embedded into the device (hardware RNG), so it can't be manipulated by a network hack CMIIW. But for physical machines that are only like clients to the RNG Server, like Pragmatic Games played on our computer, no network means no RNG so it won't function. So yeah, both types of slots will be down in case of a network hack. But it doesn't mean the machines are compromised to give manipulated results.",

It's there some chance we have an insider person for these cases?By these cases? do slot can be manipulated ?This is very interesting- normally you see gambling websites or exchanges being hacked online due to its nature. Very rarely do you see people hacking a physical casino due to the risks involved with it. I wonder on how can these perpetrators receive the cash on the slots. Perhaps they can manipulate it to some advantage where betting can be one-sided? Still, the risks involved is greater compared if you do it online.Well from the link that you have provided, I think this is concrete proof that even land-based casinos can be hacked. Though I am not just sure on how their network got compromised in the first place.",

It's there some chance we have an insider person for these cases?By these cases? do slot can be manipulated ?I used to work in a physical casino many years ago as Junior IT at that time and all the slots were sourced from Germany/Austria/Switzerland and what they had in common was that they were all powered by Red Hat Linux Enterprise operating system.I don't want to say that Linux is not susceptible to ransomware attacks yet at that time these attacks were not common at all as I am talking about 10-15 years ago.However we never had any such problems,this means that the slots were powered by another operating system as a physical slot machine should have some sort of operating system,even a small foot print one which should be connected to locally if there are several slot machines of the same game,(LAN-Local Network) but I also am finding it difficult to think that they have been connected to Internet to get ransomware or maybe it was an inside job?",

      "body": "Well, this is rather another shocking news, but one thing I personally have always believed concerning hacks is that, they don't just happen, if it is possible to trace, I tell you that we will always trace majority of this hacks to an insider, but unfortunately, it is very hard since it's pretty impossible to monitor employees 24*7 round the clock, for when they close from work on the casino, we do not know who is contacting them or who they are in contact with, hackers may approach the staff and offer him or her a really mouth watering reward to let them access into the casino's server, such offers are hard to ignore most especially if the staff feels he or she is under paid, or if he or she is a greedy person; of which we have a lot of such people in the world today .Gambling casinos will really have to step up their game in securing their servers and data base, hackers are getting really sophisticated, casinos and other platforms should also do same .",

They were saying MGM was not willing to pay and that's when the hacker disabled their systems including the emails, and they were forced to send the money. This guy is telling a different story actually https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDqDU_G8kho He is saying the casino is on the brink of bankcruptcy. Was there ever an article confirming they sent BTC? It's logical to only ask BTC for the ransom of course but there was no mention of it in any article I have read about this MGM hack.",

I think 3rd party service providers can access them remotely to update firmware or to run software updates. I also had a friend that accepted employment with a casino group in their IT section and he is a Network specialist, so they have some network running there.. but he is not allowed to speak about that. (It might be for the CCTV and payroll system and email etc... I dunno, because he is not sharing)",
