Perhaps to $28k+So in General, I think the Market will be Bullish for the next few weeks or month.",

      "body": "If you put your fate on the movement of the crypto market, I think you are taking too much of a risk. Or maybe you use your monthly money for trading? ah, that's more unlucky.there is nothing wrong if you are looking for daily income in trading, but it is very risky. even though you are very good at trading and can make a profit every time you trade. still, maybe your fate will not always be lucky.Slowly I suggest changing your working pattern in the crypto market. turn your trading into a long-term investment plan. start with small assets. I think in the future you can be calmer and not panic when you have to hope the market is always in good shape.",

Perhaps to $28k+So in General, I think the Market will be Bullish for the next few weeks or month. The way I see it, if we remain above $24k for the next 2 weeks, then I'm not seeing a pull back. On the contrary we might experience another push maybe as high as $28k again and could be in the bullish sentiments short term.Quote from: Zilon on July 30, 2022, 12:02:09 PMThe crypto market doesn't consider your bills or expenses it moves according to the wave of the trend.

It's up to us to adjust to it, not the other way around. And we have the make the best out of this circumstances to be able to survived this bear market.",

We're at least seeing a good sign that we are bouncing again. This kind of pump always want people to come running jump on the ride to also want to make profit out of it. Well if youre going to cashout to pay your bills, its your obligation. Ifnyou expect more, waiting will be more rewarding.",

However the market is not normal because it keeps moving for little gains for traders even without huge pump. Get more jobs to do and earn from that also.",
