I live in a country where Bitcoin and all other cryptos are ban. Few months back, I started a business and was doing great. And out of curiosity, I started accepting Crypto as a payment method.

It was in a gray area for some times, but the law enforcement is arresting those who are involved in crypto, and this is the reason.So what I want to talk about today is, those countries who legalize bitcoin and crypto. What was their first push?  What led them to legalize crypto. Is it totally depended on Government decision or some individuals can convince the Government to do it?I know it will take a lot of effort for one to convince the whole country to accept cryptocurrency, but what is there to try in order to make it possible. I know there are many senior persons in this forum who has contributed their effort for their country's legalization. So I want to know from them what can I do to make it possible. I know if I start, many will join me too. It's not possible by one person. Share me your knowledge on what I should do. What is the correct approach and what step should be the first. For your information, many in our country doesn't even know what cryptocurrency is.",

None of the wealthy countries have made Bitcoin legal tender the most they do is regulate it. I do not think we can convince the governments of the wealthy nations to adopt bitcoin but I think we can convince them that banning it is worse for them and the people because it would be a reduction of freedom but they profit of accepting bitcoin because they can claim taxes on it. if you remove bitcoin from the economy it would be like removing 1000 of jobs. I would not worry too long about your country banning Bitcoin most of the countries that have banned bitcoin in the past like Russia and China have accepted it again a few months after the ban. What country do you live in btw?",

Every policy of the government can be determined by the ideology of those in government or public opinion. If those in power see the importance or need to legalize cryptocurrency, they would make favorable policies. But some governments are rigid and close-minded which propels them to make policies against the crypto industry. Citizens or groups can make moves targeted at making the government change its negative view on bitcoin and other. Citizens can present a bill in the parliament through their representatives seeking to promote bitcoin or lobby some parliamentarians. Public enlightenment programs and peaceful demonstrations and rallies could also be good instruments to push for bitcoin adoption.",

What I can see is that not really all of them are optimistic about bitcoin but they just want to source out some taxes from it. So, either they like it or they have no option because their people are already on it. Whilst for those countries that have been vocal about their crypto adoption, they're seeing the posivity of it that it will create a huge billion dollar market and they don't want to be seen late on it.And with your plan of trying to spread the word in a country where it is banned, I think you really have to deal with this hardship or if else caught, you'll be taking the consequence of it. I think the best start is to know the other people that are also in crypto in your area and make a small community from there.",

So you're wrong for saying many countries right now are accepting Bitcoin as a currency.Both El Salvador and Central African Republic are started from their president itself, there's no citizen ask the government to legalize Bitcoin.

Is it totally depended on Government decision or some individuals can convince the Government to do it?One way of looking at this question is from the utility for the government perspective.You should expect resistance from governments (the centralized authority) in all countries without exception simply because bitcoin is decentralized and they can never have any kind of control over it. But if bitcoin has a certain utility for the government or has a certain utility against the government, they will choose a different approach.Lets see some examples.El Salvador government adopted bitcoin because it offered a lot of utility to the government. They could invest in it and in the long term build up a good reserve currency that would be worth a lot of money. They could also attract a lot of investment to their country and build their economy. They still tried a centralized approach with a government created closed source non-custodial wallet!US government has been against bitcoin and they have been trying to ban it and is enforcing bans little by little simply because bitcoin offers an option to dump US dollar and it ruins US government.China has been putting a lot of restrictions on bitcoin because like US, bitcoin is used as an option to dump Yuan and China was also creating a CBDC which they tried to get everyone to adopt and bitcoin was and still is a serious competitor.This doesn't mean things will remain the same though. For example in a year from now we may see a complete ban in US and in a couple of years when US economy is fallen apart completely we could see a mass adoption of bitcoin in US completely replacing dollar.",

I have never thought of anything like this. This could work like a charm. But getting people to come together in order to do something which they have no knowledge about will be a real pain. But as we, the youth are the majority of the population and have the power of voting, we could really turn the table this way. If I am to follow this path, I will have to let the youth know about bitcoin first. I have taught many people who are close to me, and it was not that much of a hard thing to do. So I think I can pull this off. It will take some time for sure. Thanks again for your wonderful advice.",
