  "content": "An article I found says what I think is true about what's happening with Bitcoin and crypto.The market is going through bear days, it's a bit bad, but this is not the end of Bitcoin, it's just the beginning of a revolution called Bitcoin.Quote(Remember, there was a time in the early 1800s when multiple governments even outlawed bicycles because they also considered that technology ‘dangerous’.)Before bicycles became popular and widespread, they also faced a series of suspicions and bans from around the world.QuoteThere were plenty of idiotic ideas and useless companies that went public in the 1990s during the dot-com boom. And when the bubble burst, many of them were washed away forever.But there are plenty of successful businesses which still dominate today, including Amazon, Google, and Nvidia, that were founded during the mania of the 1990s.Dotcom bubbles have burst, but the internet has become an integral part of our lives today.QuoteThe price of Bitcoin is now down ~70% from its most recent peak. And, almost on cue, the crypto grave-dancers (like Bill Gates) are now insisting that they were right for predicting its demise.Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, many skeptics are now dancing over the graves of crumbling crypto companies and claiming to be right. But they forgot one thing, technology markets always attract capital and boom, then restructure their markets... Those are the stages of a new industry's maturation. The price going up and down in a moment does not reflect the primary value of that technology, It only reflects the current sentiment of investors. Amazon's stock in the period 1997-2016 declined by 50%, 60% at one point, encountered many challenges to become a giant in the technology industry.As long as Bitcoin exists, we will always hear \"Bitcoin dead\", \"Bitcoin bubble burst\". Currently, Bitcoin is dying at 20k and we will wait until next ATH season they will come back and tell us the Bitcoin bubble will burst at 300k.Internet speed has increased 1000 times since the Dotcom bubble. This was followed by an increase in users and super companies like Google, Facebook, etc...We are at the beginning of this Broadband phase with Crypto. We will move to super assets and number of users after that...Try to survive and grow with Crypto in this golden population age.The bicycle and the internet have gone through these things before becoming important parts of our lives, so I believe the same is true for Bitcoin.Read more: https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/history-not-side-cryptos-grave-dancers?fbclid=IwAR2DZea2N92-mler5X0WZNYpzfq0awYfxEtuFOb7TwUBwsl5FbXy8E0ech8",

(Examples : Property Bubble / DotCom Bubble / stock market bubble ) ....but look at them now... they recovered and they are much stronger than before. All commodities goes through a \"Boom\" and \"Bust\" cycle... and Bitcoin is not different, so we expect that this will happen sooner or later and also that it will recover. The things that are hurting Bitcoin the most, are the scams related to Stable coins and NFTs and Ponzi schemes, where bitcoins are used as a payment option. All of these scams are linked to Bitcoin, because they are Crypto currencies, but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.",

      "body": "An interesting comparison of Bitcoin to bicycles, so even though I didn’t know they were banned a long time ago - I would personally ban the bikes you portrayed in your post because they were really dangerous to anyone who rode them because of their height - imagine falling without a protective helmet that did not even exist at the time, a blow to the head would often be fatal. In addition, there are few examples where Bitcoin is banned in the true sense of the word, and these are mostly countries with very low human rights and a degree of democracy. In most countries, Bitcoin is not illegal and no one prevents people from buying/selling /owning it - but the problem is that most people still have a rather negative attitude towards such things. Therefore, I think that it will take a long time to progress in that sense, because it is not just ordinary people who are in question, but also those who decide everything and we call them politicians.",

That isn't Bitcoin's problem at its core, rather it's the problem of people, and dare I say it capitalism actually encourages people to try, and find a way of escaping the rat race as some people put it. So, naturally people resort to crime out of desperation. I mean, just look at all the statistics out there, and it'll suggest the poorer a region is, the more crime there is. I'm not saying that the rich haven't pulled a scam or two, because they definitely have. However, crime is more prominent in low income regions or those with high levels of poverty. Fundamentally, Bitcoin isn't at fault. It's the system, and people that are. We can't protect against that. I know Bitcoin being a currency which doesn't allow chargebacks can be seen as a negative, and a way of encouraging scammers, but I think a lot of people forget it's a two way street. Sellers, as well as buyers get scammed, even with chargebacks. Sellers get hit the most with chargebacks obviously, and it's a real problem. Paypal for example will almost always side with the buyer. Sellers are currently getting the short hand. That doesn't happen with Bitcoin. Instead, its encouraged, and almost the unwritten code that a escrow is involved, therefore you're safe from chargebacks fundamentally with how Bitcoin works, as well as reducing the chances of a seller pulling off a scam, because of the escrow. So, scammers do exist in Bitcoin, and will always exist. Exactly how they'll always exist in the fiat dominant world. I could put in a common search phrase into any search engine right this second, and be served up a site that scams. That's the reality, but people seem to forget this when comparing Bitcoin, and fiat. The only difference is in fiat you have a safety net, if you're on the right side of the transaction. However, in another way there isn't enough protection for sellers, since chargebacks can, and do happen frequently.",

A kind of clueless at first but enrich your knowledge as you progress to know what our ancestors went through. It's just like history repeating itself but we look forward to the brighter side of a different concept.We can't escape the fact that Bitcoin has been around for a decade but there are still doubters, it's okay, it's part of it. As long we are here that more understand this technology, how this works, and how we use this, I think that is what matters most. Bitcoin and blockchain technology, in general, give us freedom in our financial aspects. We know to ourselves how this innovation helped us in this modern era, from online transactions, contributions, developments, etc. that make our online works more convenient and beneficial.",

Everyone knows about big ground-breaking innovations that changed the world, and how they started small and had critics, so it's tempting to compare any innovation, in this case Bitcoin, with them. What gets ignored is millions of innovations that ultimately failed. Tons of innovations didn't go past the prototype phase, or they had fatal flaws that became obvious at early stages, or maybe they just weren't needed, or their flaws far outweighed their gains.Also with your logic that Bitcoin is destined to succeed simply because its innovation, one could say that ETH will kill Bitcoin, because it's innovation over Bitcoin, and then some \"eth killer\" shitcoin will kill ETH, because it's also innovation, and then it will repeat again and again.",

Kudos OP, although you have offered hope to many here with your comparison of the innovations of the bicycle and the dotcom bubble, but just as pointed out, how about those ideas that were called innovations, went through this phase, but never made it through? We have to anchor the survival of bitcoin to something more than just analysis. The structures that are in place already as regards bitcoins ensures that it doesn't just cease to exist.",

(6x minimum wage of years salary)where thousands and millions of bulbs were still being traded in the 17th century at normal prices..even today you can buy regular tulips for a loaf of bread value. and rarer tulips today for more..people think after it has been several hundreds of years that no one buys tulips anymore.. they are wrong. people still do and people still make money selling tulips. (visit any garden centre and surprise yourself with a bunch of tulips sitting behind a price tag)just think about that. tulips still exist and bought and sold today.. oh.. and even in the 21st century.. in 2005 there was a rare orchid that sold for $200k.. ,,, i guess the mania didnt end (Shenzhen Nongke Orchid)",
