It went as high as $20,300 if I'm not mistaken, unfortunately, it was not sustainable, as the price goes to $19,750. So this could be the pattern for some time, it will just tank and trade sideways. Why not look at it for at least this month and see how it goes? But for me, I'm not seeing any major movement. So maybe it can go to $18,600, maybe not.",

The movement of bitcoin this week after the gains has decreased slightly, but the green candle is still visible in the market after getting the red candle. It's still hard to predict where bitcoin will go, but if bitcoin holds up, there's a good chance the price will return to the $20k level. In addition, there is still a possibility that the price will drop back to a lower level, so before that happens, you better prepare yourself. Hopefully, this July will bring some change for bitcoin, and it doesn't fall to a lower price than now.",

I can see that comparing the previous week, this week Bitcoins are moving up very slowly.So yea not expecting any miracle from Bitcoins at least when this week ends.BTC will probably struggle in the 20,000 margin only.Don’t know if BTC will fall below 18k usd or not, but yes it won’t move up also.This time this bear market has really hit hard to all the investors. But still let’s expect positive results soon.",

I do not think it matters that much, even if this is some key level which could indicate a further drop in the price, something which I doubt, this is not really the moment to think about such things right now.What matters is that the price is cheap enough already so we can justify buying bitcoin right now, maybe you do not want to buy it all at once in the case the price goes lower, but that is why strategies like DCA exist, so you can employ it and get even cheaper bitcoin in the case the price keeps dropping.",

Though it's unpredictable and we know it, but I'm still hoping that bull run will come this month.There's a few good news that I've heard around the community and I think that will be triggered the Bitcoin price increase. Technical analysis sometimes will lead you to nothing if you will not also look at the fundamental analysis, they should always be there when you predict the market.  But I don't want to scratch my head thinking about it so much, I prefer to wait until the bull trend will come.",

In a bear market, it doesn't matter if we are going to closed the weekly with positive or negative. We even have like 8-9 weeks with red candle but still we are standing close to $20k.It's better to look at the long term perspective though. Unfortunately, analysis still show a long hard grind that maybe this will be the price that we are going to see this December. And we don't know what we need to break it, I guess there's nothing we can do but to let the market goes into its course.",

Although prices are practically impossible to predict, I believe that in the current context of reduced liquidity it will be difficult for prices to pull up strongly, at least in the short and medium term.",

But these buyers are waiting for confirmation of a bottom aren't concerned by this either. They're prefer to buy at $25K rather than $15K, because they want to buy opportunity not price. In the same way they'd prefer to buy $15K if price dropped to $10K. $5K if price dropped to $1K, etc. In summary, they aren't concerned about buy 20-30% from the bottom, as arguably it's better than buying the lows before price drops in half again...",

You can see the direction of the price on the following days since Bitcoin already rejected on the price above 20K and this weekends might be the strong bloodbath once again if Bitcoin continue to print red candle on daily basis until Friday. Technical or fundamental both are still the same, there are still no guarantees. The only good thing about technical is that you have the charts in which you can see the flow of the prices and by there you can guess intellectually. Quote from: Eternad on July 05, 2022, 11:26:18 AMThere’s no positive news that will reverse the current bear market trend so I will be bearish for the rest of July unless a good news coming from global economy.You mean there will be no positive news that will come nowadays? Or you mean to say that a news is only just a news but they don't have an impact on the price? No, this can't be because I see that you are hoping for a good news from the global economy. If you believe that a positive news can do wonders and it can help up lift the price then you should also be positive and don't say that there might be no more positive news that will come because it can come true and you will regret it.",
