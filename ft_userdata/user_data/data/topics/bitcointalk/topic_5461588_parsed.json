  "content": "hi everybody, i tried to ask help on the french version of the site without success, i try here (sorry for my english)I used Electrum without trouble since one week.Usually when i send mBtc, my balance considers the amount of the transaction+feesbut now only fees appearsI sent 2mBtc but electrum try to send 0.00738..https://i.ibb.co/hHbVdwH/Capture-d-cran-2023-07-25-115007.jpgI tried a new transaction of 1.638https://ibb.co/kMCWtwksame problemi finally tried to send all my mBtc to another address and all appears unconfirmed------------------------------------------------------On the french forum, they told me that i sent to myself mBtc, i dont understand why.. or that my fees were not big enoughI tried to increase them and add more mBtc to do it, but i get this messagehttps://imgbb.com/DVp8J93I saw that i could try to do new transaction with high fees to treat the transaction and past unconfirmed transactions but i fear  they are also blocked..I tried  \"BTC Transaction Accelerator\" https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ to accelerate the process :  \"Transaction fee is too low\"there is a paid version but i dont know if it works.I tried too to unselect \"select a server automatically\", I tried several but zero result.I would appreciate if someone can solve my problem, there is already one week i tried everything without success  here's the blockstream explorerhttps://blockstream.info/tx/ba2c48b7497a10bd5dae0d74f2954bb14d1c29cfc82e5d6fcc581ad905ff7a06thanks in advance",

You just said it yourself that you did it.Well, your transactions are  a mess, to be honest, I assume this is the last one :https://mempool.space/address/bc1qt503lsmgnq2yt5hzshnfj83232h8wcxa0ys84lIt has 3 unconfirmed parentshttps://mempool.space/tx/ba2c48b7497a10bd5dae0d74f2954bb14d1c29cfc82e5d6fcc581ad905ff7a06https://mempool.space/tx/c99c67fd780ec3874b233001ce7d1e7b51d5552345fcd225c663699cacccb590https://mempool.space/tx/6139e73dc590a72ccbc59fcf5011617d92ee0bf477dbeb0b1913538e4b964f29And the effective fee rate is around 5sat/b so unless the mempool drops to that level you won't get them confirmed adn I don't see that happening too soon.Is bc1q7haaawetza8t4pu9glnpsnyph2kcdpc5s4nt4y yours I guess and you tried to bump ba2c48b7497a10bd5dae0d74f2954bb14d1c29cfc82e5d6fcc581ad905ff7a06 ?Then it's pretty simple you tried to increase the fee by too little, try putting a few extra sat otherwise you will probably not get it confirmed even in an extra week.Also, Viabtc won't work with your fee which is below their 10sat/b and the paid version will charge you more than your entire sum.Wait a bit before trying again, somebody that is way better than me at math might give the minimum necessary fee to bump that one or you could try adding 1 sat directly.",

      "body": "You have made all those four transactions between your own addresses and that's why it's only the transaction fee that is deducted from your wallet.The solution to get rid of those unconfirmed transactions is right-click on the one you made first and increase the fee. I mean this transaction: ba2c48b7497a10bd5dae0d74f2954bb14d1c29cfc82e5d6fcc581ad905ff7a06With increasing the fee, you will make that transaction confirmed faster and you will also make the other three transactions invalid. The error message you get when increasing the fee is clear. As mentioned by stompix above, you should increase the fee a bit more. If you want to get a fast confirmation, you need the fee rate of around 10 sat/vbyte. Take note that the required fee rate is dynamic and it may change over time.",

Although, I am surprised that the parent (the first transaction) was unable to increase in fee. But how about increasing the child transaction fee. Probably that should work.BIP125 says that: Quote3. The replacement transaction pays an absolute fee of at least the sum paid by the original transactions.4. The replacement transaction must also pay for its own bandwidth at or above the rate set by the node's minimum relay fee setting. For example, if the minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte and the replacement transaction is 500 bytes total, then the replacement must pay a fee at least 500 satoshis higher than the sum of the originals.The thing I am not sure about is what exactly \"original transactions\" refers to.Does it mean the transactions that have the same input(s) as the replacing transaction or their unconfirmed children are also included? Considering what happened to OP when trying to increase the fee, it seems that it's the latter. If that's the case and OP wants to replace the first transaction with a new one, there are four transactions that must be removed from the mempool.The absolute fee that is paid for the replacing transaction must be bigger than the total fee paid for those four transactions which is around 0.000039 BTC. According to rule number 4, the replacing transaction must pay another ~140 satoshi too. In the case my calculations are correct and OP wants to replace the first transaction with a new one, the replacing transaction must have the fee rate of around 30 sat/vbyte.",

So if the unconfirmed transaction you intended to replace has 5 unconfirmed children, then you must pay a fee higher than the total of all 6 unconfirmed transactions which are to be evicted.The total size of OP's 4 transactions is 2,933 WU. The total fee paid is 3,891 sats. The combined fee rate therefore is 5.307 sats/vbyte.To replace the first transaction and evict the other 3 child transactions, his replacement transaction would need to pay a fee of at least 4,031 sats for a 140 vbyte transaction, which would be a rate of 28.8 sats/vbyte.So I would agree with hosseinimr93, and pay 30 sats/vbyte to be on the safe side.",

It's very close to the tip of the mempool given the high fee, so it will almost certainly be confirmed in the next block.

But dude, seriously, the destination address(es) are probably the most important thing that you should always check very carefully when you are about to send out coins!Clipboard malware could replace your intended target address(es) by some address(es) of a thief. You want to be sure that you have exactly the right target address(es) in the send dialog. It usually is enough to check a bunch of characters at the beginning (exclude the bc1 prefix), in the middle and carefully the last 6-8 characters.If you want to practice sending transactions properly I suggest you invoke Electrum in Testnet mode, create two new Testnet Bitcoin wallets, fetch some Testnet Bitcoins for free from https://testnet.coinfaucet.eu and play around. Send coins from Testnet-wallet-1 to Testnet-wallet-2 and vice versa. You can also play around with Coin Control and Send-Many and whatnot.Practice, repeat, practice makes perfect!",
