Naturally, the fact that bitcoin is becoming less expensive may deter prospective investors from purchasing the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the second reason is that, unlike last year when the events in the originals and ETF spots in bitcoin were approaching, the hype has subsided. Yes, the hype is really intense.Then, after everything was over, the excitement and anticipation subsided, correct? And since 2018, there has been a noticeable trend in the decline in the quantity of new bitcoin wallets created. Though, in my opinion alone, it's too soon to determine with certainty what this signifies for bitcoin's future.",

And it had a description which said QuoteThe number of unique addresses that appeared for the first time in a transaction of the native coin in the network. Chart uses 7-day moving average. So if that's correct, he used data from address that appeared on the Blockchain during the period he had stated. Of cause, such addresses would have to perform some transactions for them to be recorded on the blockchain. So no, your address would not be counted if it was never used.",

Wallet is where you place your coins or tokens.If you send some coins to a specific address, it will go to a specific wallet. However this does not mean that only one address can be created in one wallet. So this report is inaccurate and misleading.",

People are looking at the price who have never invested in crypto before and they are star struck. The new price is a little intimidating, probably new folks are afraid that they will buy in at the top and then the market will suddenly crash and they will be down, although I don't know this for sure. Its definitely one opinion, but lets hope that the up trend continues. If what they say is true we are still sooooo early to Bitcoin even now with the same amount of users now as the internet in like the 90s or something like that.",

Means that between $57K to $67K there is an increase of up to $10K.Correction if I am in this case.",

The general knowledge of an average crypto investor has continuously increased as well over time, with more people knowing about what bitcoin is and cryptocurrency in general than someone, say, from 2012, so it's no surprise that a lot of these new bloods gonna get their hands not on bitcoin, but on other cryptocurrencies. It also has to be said that bitcoin's reached a status and price point that discourages the uninformed to invest in it at all. The average schmuck will think it's over for them and they can't invest in bitcoin anymore since it's already that expensive, when they could, and bitcoin could very well increase in value even more in the future.

I guess the part where you're interchanging Bitcoin wallet address to meaning same thing as Bitcoin wallet goes to show the lack of basic knowledge on the part of the blog that did this analysis and his inability to getting fact straight before concluding on such analysis. But that being said, if we're considering the possible reasons behind a possible reduction in the numbers of new persons that are joining the Bitcoin network and creating new Bitcoin address after the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF and and the the whole halving event, it's either one of the following reasons.1. Most newbies that are joining the Bitcoin ecosystem in general are mostly driven into the system by hypes mostly from those that are already in the system and I guess that's why we had a lot of new persons that even joined the forum as the halving approaches because they would normally want to benefit from the whole post halving bull and I guess that is what also played out during the development of the Bitcoin spot ETF.2. Others might just be investing into different meme coin hoping that the much anticipated bull will affect the price of meme coin drastically. Like in my region, what's now trending is airdrops and a lot of new folks that have little knowledge on crypto are delving all in because they are mostly in search of quick gains.Quote from: bbc.reporter on May 20, 2024, 04:45:15 AMYet six months on, just like in early 2018, the number of new addresses joining the network has cratered as the fervor around new Bitcoin projects dies down. it's not as though Bitcoin address is what you create everyday right? If the analysis is true that prio to the Bitcoin spot ETF, lots of address where created and that in anticipation of the halving, it also helped increase the number of people that are joining the network, it only goes to show that most of those joining the network are short termed driven folks that only come in when they see a potential profit and reducing there actively when there willed expectations doesn't come through in the shortest possible time.It's not even about the numbers of new address that we have in the system that determines if Bitcoin is on the bullish side of not, new Bitcoin members reality don't even have that good chunk of holding in Thier wallet and so regardless of thier numbers, it's not a serious factor that plays any big role in determining how bullish ot how bearish Bitcoin is .",
