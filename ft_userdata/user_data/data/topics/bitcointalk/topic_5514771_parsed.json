YTD profit of Bitcoin is already at above 70%. It might even double within the year. And if we consider the growth of Bitcoin since its inception, it's way higher. Did the others achieve this level of appreciation? Even gold hasn't reached its ATH yet if we take inflation into consideration. Inflation-adjusted ATH of gold was reached decades ago.",
