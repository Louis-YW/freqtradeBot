  "content": "The token is not something you find, it's something you realize you've been standing on all along. The concept of a token is often misconstrued. It's not the prize at the end of the race, but rather the subtle, unassuming growth that occurs beneath your feet. Chasing the horizon is a futile endeavor. The true power lies in the blockchain, where every transaction, every pace, and every quiet development takes place. That's where the real magic happens.All new tokens expand and when they do, your wallets are happy.https://i.ibb.co/VxvzNFq/testsat.png",

      "body": "Better start with educating yourself about Bitcoin first as it seems you’re being misled by referring to it as a token. There’s no need to describe Bitcoin as “crypto” when you want to talk about it, just use the word “Bitcoin” as it’s the the king of crypto, and tokens belong to the altcoin category, and honestly, most of them are just shitty tokens, not worthy to discuss.",

Will the token work out?Bitcoin is a blockchain.BTC is its native coin. It's not a token.The question is too vague. Just keep reading the forum and you 'll get all the answers you need.What do you mean \"send it around\"? To use it as a currency?",

What you have posted indicates that you have little knowledge about cryptocurrency and if I can advised you as someone who is not so old in cryptocurrency as well but older than you are, I say you should bring your mind down to learn about it and ask smart questions that can add to your knowledge. Welcome to the forum because this is a very good place to learn.",

Was just typing a reply to the OP, because it seems he’s not following up his own thread; instead, he’s just making some bunch of off-key points in his own thread… But luckily I think the moderator responded to your report real quick, and the two replies are both nuked down.Edit:  Now here comes the new madness, editing the Op with what ever he feels like… maybe the entire thread should be wiped out.",

      "body": "I keep hearing people call bitcoin a token, it's not, it's a coin..to be specific.  It's a solid store of value but gold is far far better as such/hedge asset and will be for some time (has been for 1k years or something, after all).  For me there's many reasons...I'm an FA and learned to absolutely despise banks and the fed reserve a decade ago and found btc and it just made too much sense.  I am still in the camp that it needs to become a legit currency.  I mean it is, I buy stuff all the time with it, but that's because of the \"circles I'm in, others will accept it\".  If bitcoin can figure out how to scale better, reduce transactions fees and make it even easier to use..it will reach 1M or something insane some day NO QUESTION. If not, I dunno,I always wonder where bitcoin would be if our greatest punks and minds in the field were all alive and working together full time on the project.. to name those most inspirational to me personally ..Gmaxwell, Szabo, Back, Andreas, Hal, and one of my biggest heros, elite hacktivist Jeremy Hammond ( Was watching a silk road doc the other day and just realized that the same DEA agent who caught Ross also caught ..\"anonymous\"..I had a good chuck.  He caught sabu, a rat, who gave up Lulzsec, and elite group of around 8-9 Mr Robots who joined forces with anonymous and were the strongest \"arm of it\".  But yeah it's all thanks to Sabu..but getting off topic.  Also besides a better currency, as I've talked about many times over the years, whenever Satoshis proposed 2 party escrow is finally figured out, and it's done through bitcoin, man...watch out.",
