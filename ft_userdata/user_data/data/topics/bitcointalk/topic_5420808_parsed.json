In my opinion, now is the time to limit investing in altcoins, we are going through bear season and anything bad could happen again. jJust focus on bitcoin and stay away from low cap altcoins, they are really too risky. The lesson of luna is still there and most recently FTT. Be careful with altcoins.",
