Thank you.Then it would depend on the DeX you're using. DEX's are not always anonymous as well. If the DeX operates on a .com domain, your ISP still can track your activity and then you won't really be anonymous. Also the DeX you are using might collect/log your data without letting you know.When you are on the internet it is pretty damn hard to stay anonymous. If you do some shady shit and the government decides to learn who you are, they will succeed it I can guarantee that.",

It probably looks obvious on places you spend coins if the underlying protocol takes a % of a fee and batches it with your trade transaction as a smart contract, this would mean external sources might be able to track where your \"change\" is and denonymise you that way.That's excluding the other issue of sending fixed amounts to mixers or exchanges (are you going to analyse this)? A non custodial dex might be a \"safer\" alternative than a mixer (fewer devices to hack - although a mixer acts well fairly autonomously and has their own funds to prove they're secure) but comes with the risk of making you easier to denonymise (most dexes aren't marketed for privacy mixing - they might be a good step to include but aren't great on their own) if you send a specific amount that looks odd or the dex doesn't have high enough volume to mask your trades.",

The goal is not only to break the link between your deposit and what you will get as a result of the mix, but also to be smart and use mixed coins with a time delay to make it difficult for someone to connect deposit A with withdrawal B.",

I can have a handy supply of mixed coins I can access at a moment's notice at any time.

Swapping Bitcoin to Monero is a viable mixing technique, but you should then move the Monero around, wait as long as possible before swapping it back, swap it back in a different amount than you traded in the first place, and with a different third party. While this is entirely possible, it is slower, has higher fees, is far more cumbersome to do, and potentially less private if you mess up.Also, if you are using a centralized service which is discriminating against some bitcoin because they claim they are \"dirty\", then that service is actively attacking and undermining bitcoin's fungibility as well as monitoring and censoring you, and you would do well to find a different service to use.",

They can look for an ETH transaction of an identical value to the BTC transaction you made occurring around about the same time, and then be able to make a reasonable guess as to which ETH are now in your possession. They can repeat this again in reverse to link your new bitcoin to your old bitcoin. This is impossible with Monero.You also have to consider how you interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The most popular Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask or multi-coin wallets, are in no way private, and harvest lots of data including your IP address, crypto addresses, and balances and transactions. Monero, on the other hand, can either be run via your own node or connecting to another node via Tor to mitigate these risks.",

Or do I miss anything?What do you think is the on-chain visible difference between someone selling their Bitcoin and buying it again and someone mixing? How do you tell that one of the 2 happened?

Isn't changing BTC into another crypto and change them back, not the much better solution to cut off the trace?This definitely has the risk that the amounts match up and you can enhance this heuristic by looking at both chains and checking what happened with the altcoin right after it was acquired.A mixing service like ChipMixer, or the scheme I came up with here, break these heuristics by allowing you to basically withdraw more or less than what you deposited. ChipMixer does this through their voucher system.On the topic of taint: me and most others here strongly disagree with such notion of taint and we just avoid any service continuing to proclaim this garbage.A simple to understand rationale is: there's no way to tell when coins left a criminal's wallet and entered a non-criminal's wallet. Since in Bitcoin no identities are tied to wallets and anyone can have as many different wallets as they want, there's no way to tell whether a thief is bouncing coins between their own wallet or whether the coins are used / traded.Now, imagine someone pays you in BTC and the next day it is discovered that whoever gave them to you, had stolen them. Do you want those coins to become worthless? Now, that you already gave them the valuable product you sell? Because I wouldn't want that.So, here we collect the exchanges and services that we do know for a fact, are pushing this idea forward, as a reference to avoid using them:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401468.0For a more convenient solution long-term, we also have a thread for any thoughts or ideas one may have that could improve layer 1 privacy, hopefully making it much simpler to use Bitcoin privately. There would be no need to attempt 'cutting the trace' when there is no trace anymore.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410526.0",

Or maybe those addresses are used again in the future and leak information that way. There are a lot of other sources of information that blockchain analysis companies can draw on.Quote from: Mbidox on October 16, 2022, 08:33:24 PMSo if someone knows, that a particular BTC address is mine, and then I make some transfers to another BTC address of mine and only then make the switch to ETH, this person does not know, until which BTC address the BTC's are still under mine possession.Maybe. Or maybe your addresses can all be linked together because they are all part of the same SPV wallet. Or you look them all up from the same browser fingerprint or the same IP address. Or even the software you are using includes unique identifiers within the transaction data itself.If you are going to go through all this hassle just to avoid using a mixer (although I'm still not clear why), then why would you use anything other than Monero?",
