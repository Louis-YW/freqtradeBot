This is their first attempt to revive LUNA and there’s so many speculation with this one, no one knows what will be the result so for better to stay away. Most probably HYPE will happen, but that can’t help on long term, LUNA should be more secured this time.",

Maybe will just look at its progress and pricing but I'll not throw my money on it.I just don't trust them anymore if they've failed already.",

Their reputation is tainted already, so just ask your self what are the chance that this problem will happen again?So for me, it's better to just stay away from this projects as the people behind are not to be trusted. Many have lost their money and even lives here. It's better to just invest or solid projects, the profits might be slow, but at least the chances of being scam are slim.",

We can either vouch for someone to put their money at risk as we can't just easily erase from our minds what happened in the past. I'd rather choose other coins, those who have clear potential and we know already their market credibility where we can get assurance from them, not in a project that has been such a scam issue. Yes, that is eventually another plan but of the same ending scenario.",

Rebranding from Luna become name with LUNC and Kucoin last few houra have been listed this coin. Not any surprise because Lunc as new rebranding coin from Luna have cheapest and lower price like last time Luna coin before suspend trade. I think not good for investing although have rebranding because price drop drastically and not interested try make mistake twice when investing on Luna coin.",
