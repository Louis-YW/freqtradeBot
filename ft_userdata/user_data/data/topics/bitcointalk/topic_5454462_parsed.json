  "content": "Hey guys. I am a p2p trader. I automated my trades on HodlHodl and I am now the top trader on there.https://hodlhodl.com/users/PepeLapiuI am now looking to expand to Robosats. But I don't know much about Lightning.I just opened an account with Voltage to run my own node in the cloud.Now a question about liquidity.Say I open a channel with Bob. And I commit 10 BTC to the channel and Bob commits none.I understand this way, I can only send BTC, not receive any.But say I send 6_BTC out of the 10 BTC I commited. Does that give me a 6 BTC space in my channel where I can now receive 6 BTC?Or is the only way to receive Bitcoin to find someone to commit coin to our channel?",

      "body": "And if the only way to get both inbound and outboard liquidity opening a channel where both sides commit BTC, where can I find someone to connect with me?The way I understand it is I can open a channel with a well connected node and commit 10 BTC to it while not asking the other side to commit any coin.Once I have sold my 10 BTC, I can go to my supplier and buy more coin and have it sent to my LN node. I imagine if all my 10 BTC are sold, I can top up with 10 more BTC. Is this accurate?",
