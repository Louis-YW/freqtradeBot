Does this gives a free hand to scammers as they know that they cannot be punished by the court of law  If you are the crypto owner and you want to exchange it on fiat via P2P then I guess your assumption is correct since crypto doesn’t have any value on a government that is not legal. It’s same when you are selling illegal items and the counter party didn’t pay. If you knew that you are dealing an item that is not legal on your country then you should protect it  by all means. Also P2P on Binance has a dispute function. No one will  scammed if they will just check carefully.",

The government don't have any hand in this kind of scam especially in countries where crypto is Banned because taking a case like this to the authorities will create a red flag for you to be apprehended both you and the scammers will be in trouble. Another thing here again is that the scammer can Denny this kind of case in court since your P2P other don't have any form of legal backing which could be used as evidence to file a case against your scammer. Now their is only few option left for anyone who is scammed on any P2P platform this option is either you report the trade even when it's concluded you can go to the trade history and report the trade to the support team which they might likely look into but their is no guarantee. Or you can click on the name of the person and see if they have other active orders their in the forum that's if they bought from you and refuse to send money, you can check if they have active buy order in the market, if they do, place exactly scammed amount as an active order and click on paid, then allow the seller to go to appeal, from the appeal you can explain your situation to the agent assigned to the case which will make them lock/restrict you both transaction till the issue is fully resolved.",

What you should do is that since the country doesn't recognize such trade or even legalized cryptocurrency you don't have to take it law where by you take law into your hands. It will be ideal you avoid taking up the case into legal way rather report such to the exchange probably when next  funding his or her account all funds are automatically frozen.",

I think it has more to do with people burying themselves along if they try to report the scam.I wouldn't say they cannot be punished provided that there's a law that fits. Scams are scams at the end of the day. For instance, if someone used bitcoin for a crime, it doesn't mean their action would be un-crime'd, right? But finding the perp would be no easy feat (unless they're dum dums) since buying and selling of exchange accounts are rampant + most small time scammers get little to no attention from authorities.",

Does this gives a free hand to scammers as they know that they cannot be punished by a court of law  I have heard about such scams that were taking place on Binance platform. It's a common practice for some scammer to loot money from innocent users who would like to exchange their crypto with fiat local currency where they live. The scammers are doing editing works to share fake screenshots to innocent users and the innocent user releases the crypto without any confirmation. The court and law won't be helpful in such cases because if a country and its justice system hasn't considered a thing legal in this case crypto-currencies than why would they even punish someone who's doing such transactions that the government warns its citizens to not do. They whole thing is on a persons own shoulders in such cases and the scammers know this thing, that's why they are doing such scams.Only hope in such cases is the platform where users are doing such p2p transactions. In this case only Binance has the power to punish the scammers who are misusing their services for looting the money out of innocent users. But, I have seen that the ones who post their ads for either buying or selling crypto on the exchange are mostly favored by Binance platform. I recommend everyone who trades using p2p to first check the past trades of a dealer and if a dealer has done more than 200 trades in the month and 99% of the trades went positive then you should trade with such dealers. Otherwise the dealers whose trades are mostly negative then a user should avoid trading with such kind of dealers because if ratio of negative trades is high then it's risky to trade with such dealers.",

Thus freezing the accounts of those who are innocent and had zero clue about the scam. Then their is a hectic process of trying to unfreeze the account that involves visiting to the police station. Almost every cop in our country doesn't have a clue about crypto or will act like one. The solution is to have a bank account dedicated for only cryptocurrency transaction. Always transact with verified vendors. Do check the feedback and rating and never fall for u realistic buy and sell price.

The only way to remain safe in this situation is to make P2P transactions cautiously so that no one can scam you.Does your country explicitly state that trading crypto is illegal, or crypto is not allowed as a means of payment (like how fiat works)? If it is the latter, I think you won't get jailed as long as the government is not doing something behind the scenes. If it is the former then prevention is definitely the only way to protect yourself. Relying on somebody else is not a good idea, to begin with.

That level of traffic also attracts scammers. That's the reality. However, there's something everyone can do to reduce the level of scam attempts they encounter. My method of sieving through the murky water of scam has always helped me and that's simply never to be in a rush. Once it comes to financial transactions, I take my time to attend to it. I'm never in a hurry. That haste is where the mistake comes in. Scammers know that and they utilize it on their victims. Once someone is trying to hurry you up in a transaction, don't fall for it. Again, don't take the bait of high buying offer or low selling offer. If it's too good to be true, then it's a scam lurking. Another is to check the number of deals executed by traders before you patronize them. Read the feedback on traders also, that's very important.",
