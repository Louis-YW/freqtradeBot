  "content": "Ok I'm tired of issues with Sportsbet.io- Big issue regarding verification and they locked me out a couple of months ago with a good balance in my account, then they unblocked after few days- Then again they blocked later- Now one big issue thats been running Since July and Sportsbet team is loving and enjoying to waste my time and I cannot take it anymoreTime since the issue is running - 4 MonthsI am out of patience, I'm not waiting 1 more dayIssue details :-A bet was incorrectly scoredBet ID # 62ded91dbce765d1e4afdaffAmount = $1,250 bet amount + 4.07 Odds Potential Profit so actual amount is $5,000+Bet was won, but they changed scores and made it a lossI had the proofs of it win on Sportsbet.io which I emailed them several timesBut since it was a Virtual sport therefore there's no verification on the internet of itSo they cannot prove their own change of results, so I had to contact Curacao Gaming License Authorities to check this matterNow it's been 4 months, Curaco is not helping, they said they will help in this case, they took every single info and proofs from me nd sportsbet.io 3 months ago, and they said they're making the verdict After 3 months they replied nd guess what their verdict was ? \"Give us more info\" thats their reply to sportsbet.ioThey reply 1 time every 3 months onlyAnd with this speed I can expect my result in 10 yearsSo I'm done, 4 months was enough time- Do I think Sportsbet.io is scam? Not sure, because last month I played 2-3 million dollars (Yes Steve, check my September + October history) and they've always paidBut this matter is making me nuts, Its freaking me outEven if it was a matter of 1$ I would still be upsetI am one of the biggest clients of them, and they treat me like TRASH, like some pathetic beggar of the streetI cannot take that disrespectI need this matter resolved right nowUntil that timeSPORTSBET.IO SCAM, Don't DEPOSIT FUNDS because they can SCAM YOU and STOP REPLYING ABOUT IT",

Customers service are humans, not bots, and if they ask for more information, it means that what you provided wasn't sufficient, just like what you did here, a wall of text with no proof.Is it possible for sportbet to manipulate virtual game scores? I don't think it's possible because they're only acting as a host for the game provider. I'm a big fan of sportbet virtual horse race and I've never had any problems with it over the years.",

If you have been scammed by them then you must have those proofs, give those proofs here only then it will be convenient for everyone to understand whether your complaint is true or not. If they disrespected you, then you had a lot of conversations with them. Still waiting to see what their representative gives you the exact answer. And what is your reaction after that.",

      "body": "I will refer an answer from sportsbet.io's representative e.g. Steve, actually they're already respond your accusation in their thread, so I will put here to let now for anyone who still don't know about this.You're just a mad gambler who always complain to the casino when you're loss, IMO you must have a communication with sportsbet.io first rather than make a complain like this one. In some casino there's a rule where they're forbid you to talk false about their casino and they can block your account.Quote from: sportsbet.io on October 28, 2022, 09:36:01 AMHi J,(I can refer to you as J as we have had this same conversation previously on bitcointalk)As you are aware, our (Sportsbet.io) communication with you on this matter was closed 3 months ago. We were more than 100% happy that everything was settled correctly with the physical and technical evidence we have on hand.You then raised a complaint with \"Curaçao eGaming (\"CEG\")\" so your time frustrations need to be aired with them.They have asked us for more information regarding the matter previously and we have complied with their requests in a timely manner.If for some reason they wish to ask us for more high-level technical information to back up our initial reply to them, we will promptly do so for sure upon that request.Confirming that the time issue you believe is of major concern is in fact with \"Curaçao eGaming (\"CEG\")\" and not sportsbet.io. Please follow up with them.On the second matter, your statement about \"do not deposit funds with them, they will scam you\" I have to take you up on that comment as I believe your views are quite contradictory.In the previous 6 days, you have deposited in DOGE, ETH, TRX, USDT, LTC and BTC... quite a vast array of deposit methods.You also played a great amount on Sports and Casino and we thank you for your custom on those products.As always, we paid out in a prompt manner to your wallet each time you requested a withdrawal. I also see you had some winners whilst using our in-play 'cash out' so we are glad to hear you are using all of our features onsite.It would be appreciated if you could take down the statement \"I am tired of issues with sportsbet.io\" because we are not aware of any that you have had this week.. many thanksAs you can imagine, I don't have any more information to add to this matter.For now, I can assure you that if any request from \"Curaçao eGaming (\"CEG\")\" comes to our inbox, we will promptly act accordingly on their requests and decisions.regards,Steve.Sportsbet.io",
