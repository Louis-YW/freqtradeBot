As of now, one must access these things on a desktop, in order to make it work. Anatoly Yakovenko quoted, “It’s time for Crypto to go mobile”. Earlier also attempts have been made to make crypto-based smartphones a reality by companies like PundiX, Sirin Labs, HTC, etc. None of these attempts has really gained the attention of the masses yet because of several issues or litigations. As told by the CEO of Solana Labs, their team has been working hard for the past five months to make this software platform and hardware, a reality. Their main motive is to improve Web 3.0 access and crypto functionality on mobile. Finally, can Web 3.0 based Solana Saga really turn the tables?Solana Mobile StackSolana team launched its software platform called Solana Mobile Stack or SMS. It’s a Web 3.0 layer for Solana built on the android platform that will allow developers to build Decentralized Applications (dApps) with ease. In fact, the team has made Solana Mobile Stack Software Development Kit (SDK) available on its GitHub, for which the link is on its official website to help developers build dApps on Solana. Additionally, the team introduced a few features of SMS, which are:1. Seed VaultThe name itself is self-explanatory. It is a key custody solution that will secure all the seed phrases and private keys. Private keys and seed phrases of the crypto wallets are used to sign the transactions. The keys and seed phrases will never be shared with Android OS or even with the apps on Solana Play/dApp Store.2. Mobile Wallet AdapterThis adapter will be used for signing the transactions in conjunction with the seed vault. It will not just be signing transactions on the apps available on the device. It will further be capable of signing transactions on nearby devices like desktops or laptops in addition to web-based applications.3. Solana Pay for AndroidAs the name itself suggests, it will be a decentralized payment solution. With this in mind, it will be more of “pay with any token anywhere”. The innovative team is further ready to launch payment features like QR Code Scan or Tap to Pay and more.4. Solana dApp StoreThis will be a Web 3.0 based decentralized app store for the dApps based on the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, it was also announced by the team that there won’t be any extractive fees for the developers to get their dApps in the store. This will certainly help a lot of developers and encourage them to get their dApps on the store. In addition to the dApps, one would also be able to get digital goods and tokens in the store.Solana Saga: Flagship Android PhoneSolana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs has partnered with OSOMprivacy to make Solana Saga, a reality. OSOM was supposed to launch its OSOM OV1 in Q4, 2022. The privacy-focused company has confirmed that OSOM OV1 is no more in production and they are collaborating with Solana to produce Solana Saga, the blockchain-based flagship android phone. OSOM team is positive about this partnership and is hoping that this step will further take their privacy initiative to next level.Solana Saga will be a Web 3.0 based phone which will also enact a hardware wallet. As announced by the mighty team, the phone will run both Google App Store and Solana’s dApp Store, which means the phone will be Web 3.0 based along with the compatibility of Web 2.0. The team further announced its specification, which seems pretty competitive to the high-spec phones available in the market presently. Solana Saga will be based on Snapdragon 8+Gen 1 Mobile Platform integrated with Solana’s Secure Element. This high-end phone will be packed with 6.67 inch OLED, 12 GB RAM and 512 GB storage.Price and ReleaseThe phone will be launched in early 2023 and is expected to be priced at around $1000. The pre-orders for the same have already started and the wishlist can be joined on their Solana Mobile Store by paying a refundable deposit of $100 USDC. Initially, the phone will be available only to the citizens of the US, CA, EU and UK. Those who place a pre-order for the same will also be eligible to receive a special NFT called the Saga Pass that will mark the phone’s debut. To test SMS and Saga’s design and identify any flaws before its release to the general public, the futuristic flagship will initially only be available to developers.Leave your comments below and share how positively you feel about this upcoming flagship Smartphone?",
