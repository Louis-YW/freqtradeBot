But I think we should gradually change that concept as well as change the way we call it, bitcoin is no longer a risky asset. Recently AllianceBernstein, an asset manager with $699 billion, called bitcoin a safe haven and even more attractive than gold. For me, this is the first time I've seen a traditional company admit and call bitcoin a safe haven and consider it superior to gold.

But gold is still superior because it is the asset with the largest marketcap in the world.",

What do you think about this and should we stop calling bitcoin a risky investment? The economy in most countries is quite unpleasant at the moment and has become very worrying for citizens, many companies and even private business are folding up because their profit has heavily been affected and reduced and they can no longer sustain the high cost of running the business hence the choice to shutdown. Bitcoin provides a way out, an opportunity, a safe haven for people to make investment in something that is not affected by their economy and government. As things toughen up, many people who never like bitcoin are coming to the realization the importance and relevance bitcoin has.",

Alphabet (google) lost 10% of its market cap recently. This is very alarming imo. If the conflict between Israel and Palestine spreads, we may see very wild moves in the markets. This reminds me of the covid drop which we had in 2020. These might be the last days of capitalism. We are only 6 years away from 2030. By 2030, we will not own anything they say.

It is safe to invest in bitcoin for a long time and you will be having a good profit compare to that of gold. But this doesn't make it a safe haven, because we don't know the fate of bitcoin in future but gold has been in existence for a very long time which anyone that invest in gold can beat his chest and say in the next 50yrs, I will make good amount from my gold investment because gold is recognized world wide and is acceptable as an alternative payment method.

Safe haven aims to secure assets with minimal risk. The goal is to secure the value of his assets, not increase his wealth. In essence, the value of his past and present assets is the same or only slightly reduced. So I think gold is still the best choice to save assets from decreasing value. Correct me if I'm wrongBitcoin is indeed a safe haven for \"now\". The reason is because of the fact that the price of gold over the last 5 years has risen only around 60%, while Bitcoin in the last 5 years has risen around 350%, in the last 20 years the price of gold has risen around 431%, while Bitcoin in the last 10 years has risen around 22,250%, so you can concluded that Bitcoin is better than gold.But remember, no system is 100% safe. Gold tends to be stable, because it is a clear, multifunctional asset, many people still use gold as a safe haven. Even though the decline will not be extreme like Bitcoin and vice versa. But don't just think about safe havens, you should also consider the risks.",

I think one of the reasons why people call it a high-risk asset is that it can give you good returns, but investing at the wrong time can also cause more losses. When its price can drop from $67k to $15k, people will definitely think of this fear while investing. However, it is definitely safe in terms of investment, If one has the patience to hold on and can wait.I think Alliance Bernstein's position is absolutely right. Bitcoin may be more attractive than gold ,because its profits are much higher than gold. Therefore many people prefer Bitcoin investment over gold. It would be wrong to call Bitcoin a risky investment, and of course saying so would be disturbing for those investing in Bitcoin. There are certain risks involved in every investment, it would be wrong to associate the risks only with Bitcoin.",

But if we were talking about long term investment, then for sure this is literally the safest haven for people especially the rich one, as they just simply invest and their money grows in a period of time. If we're gonna compare Bitcoin to Gold in which is the safer haven, of course mostly it's the stable one where you won't get stress and would expect profits as well in years, especially now Gold is in demand.",

For instance, Blackrock could ultimately reject Bitcoin's ETF listing and send it into a downward spiral. However, I understand that your opinion stems from the idea that, so far, it keeps recovering and cannot be a simple coincidence. That's true, but there isn't enough statistical data to make assumptions for the distant future.I deem Bitcoin a relatively stable and safe investment, something similar to the S&P 500 index, which has been showing an increasing trend over the last two decades. Does that make it a safe haven? Probably not, and it's exactly how I feel about Bitcoin too. Just because both the S&P 500 index and Bitcoin have been showing an increase in value over the course of the years, it doesn't necessarily mean that this pattern will always follow.",
