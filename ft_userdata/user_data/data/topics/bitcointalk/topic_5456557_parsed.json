To offer 10%-40% shares at $3 million per 10% share, up to $12 million.Email:jbtkk00001@mail.comAdditional Important Information1The 4km Crypto Gaming Challenge is a private community. We do not ask about the past and we do not look forward to the future even we do not ask your name and address, we just focus on what is happening right now. It does not matter how much you've lost in the past or how much you aim to win in the future, the more you forget, the more you gain. If you have not yet entered the gambling, stay away. It's extremely difficult to get rich by gambling, but it's easy to make you poor and broke. For those who disagree with this statement, just leave. Long-term winning (5+ years) boils down to one thing: follow the supreme rule and go with the flow. The supreme rule focuses on the stop-loss, which is generally a daily loss of 0.2 to 1 percent of the principal. The law of large numbers is an objective fact, should narrow the bet in the downwind or swing period and increase the bet in the upwind. If you cannot determine the up/down/swing wind period accurately, then strictly enforce the stop-loss and stop-gain orders. (Judgment of the timing of the upwind period, swing period and downwind period can be obtained through long-term training and real gaming practice, and it is by no means to master the essence in the short term. Long-term training is a recurring process, the funds can be up or down or go to zero, and cannot be avoided.) Before acquiring the ability to determine timing accurately and surviving in the market, keep your betting funds within an affordable range, such as 5% of your monthly income. Even if you make a good judgement on timing, it is not a sure win scenario due to various unplanned factors. Always stay humble. These basic skills of mentality and money management are the minimum requirements for professional gamblers. Gambling is gambling. Uncertainty will always exist! Fraud will always exist! Down period will always exist! It is too disrespectful to the law of large numbers, human weaknesses or casino bosses who always emphasize providing a \"fair game\" to let ordinary adults win in the long run. Can any ordinary adult be smarter than the top mathematical scientists all over the world? We may not contribute much to the community, but not making self a joke is one of the few things left we can achieve in rest of life. Those who have been winning are still winning, and those who have been losing will most likely continue to lose.2Gambling behavior can deliver serious terrible consequences for yourself and your family, so do not gamble until your mind is in control. All gambling games are designed by professionals in accordance with the strictest mathematical logic, it is impossible to obtain long-term gains through scientific methods. By following the natural rules and managing yourself well are far better to search ‘must win’ method. It is okay if you cannot do it in short term, at least do not bet randomly. If you belong to a special group of people, whether it is extremely luck or talent, this is the wrong place for you guys.3There is no application fee for the 1,576 founding members.

Two topics I posted here are about gambling. Asking fund from investors to do some shit business here and there. All the content just show my purpose loud and clear. If you believe and have fund, then we can talk. If you don't, all the shit equals scam to you. I do believe you have a stake account. Why not leave it here and get some blessings. Maybe you can get some coins from pl 5 named sylviegreta. This is real business project here if you read in details. All the fucking gambling is scam, why not you just leave and never come back? This is a valuable and free advice for you. Eddie is fucking so many gamblers every single day. He runs the scam site called Stake wisely. So, what's your point again? You believe You pay. Is that easy to understand? Buffet said BTC is 0 value and scam shit. You buy or not? Just go away brother.",

And we made some profit from gamblers before they lose all to casinos. And maybe, only maybe, this challenge can save some of them and give them a little hope. That's fucking it. All real gamblers will lose everything without doubt. Why not save some of them and make some nice profit at same time? Gambling equals scam. If you gamble once in life, you can't judge others scam or not. Because you are playing with scammers with trust and deposit money to them. You have no ability to distinguish scam or not.
