Exchange can freeze your coins, get hacked or hold your coins hostage. Funds on centralized exchanges are not your fund, it is always owned by exchange and exchange can freeze it any time, as stated in TERMS OF SERCIVE from exchange. Many exchanges don't have government license and no government will bring your funds back. I don't know for etoro, it's from Spain but has it license in your country? Even, exchange can be hacked. It's difficult to trust exchange. Maybe pay higher fee, do it P2P or BISQ (it’s what many professionals advise), is better because it is still higher fee BUT you won’t suffer any disadvantages from centralized exchange, where your loss can be bigger. In P2P, it will be YOUR coins because storing it on your own private key is recommended. Not your keys, not your coins.",

Remember that this is the fee paid on conversion from £ to Bitcoin. You will pay transaction fees to transfer the Bitcoin out of the exchange and into your wallet which you have custody of.And for the amount you are buying you need to use a non custodian wallet.Quote from: sudonym3 on September 16, 2023, 04:08:27 PMI would also be interested to know if some platforms/exchanges would adjust their transaction fee as a percentage depending on the size of the position that is being taken.

Percentage means the fees paid can be higher or lower depending on the total amount being bought or sold.",

You may have bought your first BTC's there, but there are better places you can buy and sell BTC and you should probably use one of them when buying subsequently.Quote from: sudonym3 on September 16, 2023, 04:08:27 PMI would also be interested to know if some platforms/exchanges would adjust their transaction fee as a percentage depending on the size of the position that is being taken. For example, if someone were to buy $100 of BTC, should they expect to pay higher transaction fees as a percentage when compared to someone who purchases say $100,000 ? No, let's say the exchange charges 2% fixed trading fees, for $100 it would be $2, but for $100,000 it would be $2000, it doesn't mean they are charging different fees in these two situations, it is just 2% of whatever amount you are trading. As for withdrawal fees for BTC, it will depend on the price of BTC when making the withdrawal, because exchanges usually have fixed BTC withdrawal fee, for example on Binance, withdrawal fee for Segwit is 0.0005BTC, and with the current BTC price that is around $13.2. Take note that all of this is off-chain transactions, when making on-chain tx's, the amount you are sending doesn't affect the fees, but the size of you tx, network congestion and the BTC address you use.",

You pay a lot of transaction fees on Etoro. I am a Binance user, and there are no fixed or variable fees on withdrawals or deposits like there are on Etoro. But unfortunately, Binance is banned in your country. If it were unbanned, you would be able to make transactions at a lower transaction fee.I'm not familiar with any other type of exchange that deducts lesser fees, but after doing some research, I can recommend Bitstamp. I don't know the reputation of this exchange, so take it as a disclaimer, and please try to do your own research too before using it. I hope you won't mind my words.QuoteWhy we chose it: We chose Bitstamp as the best crypto exchange for low fees because of its highly competitive maker/taker fees, free bank account transfers and strong cybersecurity.  SourceAnd welcome to your new journey towards BTC and I hope you will find your way here that would lead you towards financial freedom. If you are looking for long term investment then you should avoid to use centralized exchanges.",

If Binance is banned in the UK, then find a similar exchange that supports p2p exchanges. So you have to pay only withdrawal fees, which won't be a big amount.",

If you are new to crypto space then first try to learn about Bitcoin in detail and once you have learned enough about it then you should purchase some of it but since you already purchased your Bitcoin from Etoro then it's better to learn about personal wallet and its safety. I would recommend you to use a software wallet for storing your coins and the best option currently is Electrum. When it comes to fees then every exchange have their own set of fees. I personally use Binance for purchasing of Bitcoin because I have found their fees better than other platforms but I won't really promote it because it's a centralized exchange and it requires KYC in order for someone to use its p2p trading feature. I often convert my Bitcoin to USDT and USDT to Bitcoin at Binance platform and there is no fee for conversion. The withdrawing fees are high at that platform and you can't set your own fees at Binance during withdrawal.",

First of all the fee exchanges charge is not for \"bitcoin transactions\", it is for the service they offer you. And the only service you should use is their trading services. In other words never store your coins in an exchange.Secondly, more than the fee you should concern yourself with the legitimacy of the exchange and the risks involved in using them. For example the Etoro exchange you mentioned seems like a very risky and somewhat shady service with complaints against it. So even if it were free of charge, you should not have used it.QuoteI would also be interested to know if some platforms/exchanges would adjust their transaction fee as a percentage depending on the size of the position that is being taken. For example, if someone were to buy $100 of BTC, should they expect to pay higher transaction fees as a percentage when compared to someone who purchases say $100,000 ? Exchanges usually charge only 2 fees:1. Trading fee which is where you buy or sell bitcoin on their platform and usually it is around 0.2%. Some exchanges have extra options to \"reduce\" this fee depending on your activity in long term, or if you buy and bag-hold a shittoken they've created and stuff like that.2. Withdrawal fee which is a fixed but high amount they charge you each time you want to pull out your coins. This is almost always fixed regardless of the tx size, your activity or even the network state.",

Paying $1.5 to $1.7 per withdrawal of $50 may feel like a lot to you, then save the money up to $150 maybe or $200 before buying Bitcoin, for me, using 2$ on every Bitcoin purchases isn't much, very affordable for me. No matter where you are in the world, the withdrawal fee remains the same, they don't charge you than when you plan to withdraw, I believe this charges already included with the services fee, if you deposit 100$ on the exchange, you can use all the 100$ to buy Bitcoin, and withdraw 98$ successfully, the remaining morning is withdrawal fee, probably with the services they provide.",

Thanks for bringing this exchange to my attention so I will not bother considering them as an option as I do see their advert on youtube and other platforms. Nevertheless, if Coinbase is accepted in the UK, then I will advice you use Coinbase for buying and Withdrawal to another wallet where you have control. It is not a good practice to save your funds in centralized exchanges so always put this in consideration when managing your digital assets. I recommend Coinbase because it has one of the lowest withdrawal fees for Bitcoin, just around $0.12. According to this article, there are also cryptocurrencies with zero withdrawal fees such as Stellar (XLM) and others. Since you are considering Bitcoin a lone, the fee is good and highly competitive.",
