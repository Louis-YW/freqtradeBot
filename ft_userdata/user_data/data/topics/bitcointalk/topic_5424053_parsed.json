This doesn’t matter if you have bullshit trading portfolio due to trading full time compared to a accurate trading from casual trader. Sharing your trading portfolio will be more interesting rather than just ask whether user is full time or not on Binance. Also you should not leave your balance on any exchange including due to the risk of losing it once Binance run or experience same fate with FTX. Doing a full time trading on centralized exchange is very risky because you are leaving your money exposed to potential risk.I’m not a full time trader but I do casual trade every weekends, my salary and significant event that will make crypto volatile than normal volume.If binance will follow to FTX then who else you can trust anymore ? But Im not talking this Im just talking who's full futures traders i am i trade everyday.",

Also in overall discussion, trading is risky, especially future trading.Quote from: Portocervo777 on November 29, 2022, 10:05:09 AMI cant thank the binance enough to provide this opportunity to us.Binance provide the service because they want to profit from it, why then thanking them when there are alternative exchanges that are providing the service?

No trader will start with future trading, they all start with spot. If they learn future trading, likely they are not switching back but to go for 1x leverage or they just buy and hold which would be better on noncustodial wallet. Spot traders are mostly people that do not know how to trade in derivative market because 1x long position is just like spot trading.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on November 29, 2022, 10:13:30 PMSpot trading can be so brutal too. Just ask people who bought Luna right before the crash and had no stoplossThat is true, just that future trading is riskier because of leveraging. What is the real trading in forex, stock trading and crypto trading is for a trader to be able to buy (open a long position) and sell (open a short position), although spot trading is trading too.",

On a centralized exchange, it is necessary to store only that part of the deposit that is necessary for trading. An even better solution might be to use DEX.",

About the country people come from, example is the country that I come from, if I convert our minimum wage in a month to dollar using parallel market exchange rate, it is not up to $40. Assuming you earn 5 times more than that, that would be $200 which you can use to live good in my country every month and still have little savings. That is less than $7 daily profit in trading.",

It’s unrealistic for cryptonians here regardless of our experiences that we can make trading a full-time career. Not even some pro traders out there are actually calling it full-time.I have a friend who is a pro trader and is actually been doing well in both spot and futures trading on Binance. However, he did said to me that he is not considering crypto trading as a full-time job despite the gains he have. He still maintains his day job for sustainability.

Binance only facilitates trading and charge user fee on every trade that they made. Every liquidated position will be sent to the lenders that lend you your margin and some of it goes to those position who win against yours. You’re just competing to other traders when you are doing spot and futures trading. All the liquidated positions doesn’t go to Binance! This is the most common misconception on trading. Binance is just the middleman on every user trading. They always win no matter what is the trend but there profit is only limited to the fees and not all the liquidated assets because traders is not competing on exchange when trading.",

Regular spot trading do already require an analysis so how much more the futures trading? It obviously need more of it because it is more risky. Focusing full time on it can make us improve but it again like I said earlier it can also be damaging to our finances.",
