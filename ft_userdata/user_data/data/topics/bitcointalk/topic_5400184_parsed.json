For example, you pegged with \"FIAT\" then your stable coin must have the same value and you can exchange the crypto stable coin with the asset you are pegged.I think, stable-coin is the most easy concept.",

Basically creating the smartcontract was so cheap but the problem is how many funds that already owned to backed your stable token. If you own nothing and im sure that your stable token was just another useless token. There shall be a fund to backed your stable token. This will be using the fiat money as a way for you to create stable token. In my opinion that if there was no standard for this. The range was random but this is also totally depend with the reputation of yours.",

There are other models like collateralized, partially etcYes but that was a failed model of stable token. UST has proven it. There was no reason to use it again rather than getting sued by so many people if your stable coin become zero like UST. The stable token mechanism backed by the fiat currency was the best model in this case. It's more reliable compared with the algorithmic stable token model and it can sustain during the dump and defend its peg easily. BUSD, USDC. These stable tokens are reliable stable tokens.Algorithmic stable token was a failed experiment.",

You need a huge budget for the asset that backed it and also for the developers of your smart contract and security plus blockchain if you want your stable coin to become unique since most of the blockchain has their own native stable coin so you can't barge in on random blockchain and build you stable coin there. Most of the mediocre stable coins didn't have any trading volume since no one will trust to use your coin if you have no proof of funds to back the supply of your token for their face value.",

In the first place you need to have 1:1 reserve with whichever fiat currency you will peg your stablecoin on. So if you are planning to mint even a million stablecoins that means you will also have a million of the fiat your coins is based. That does not include development yet. You will definitely hire programmers and security experts for this project to get started.",

There are lots of coins out there has been created to make things complicated for the investors when they converted their money to those coins but in the end, it's not sellable whether it is stable coins or not people should really take care and do serious research about the developers because if they don't do so they just wasting their money and getting nothing in return.",

But the difficult thing about being stable a coin is that there has to be a guarantee for the coin to be stable in order to keep its price constant. Examples like USDT are said to be backed up by fiat USD. Building a stable coin must be collateralized by a tangible asset, such as a company, land, gold, silver, or anything that can produce real and sustainable.",

To be on the safer side, a billion dollar hard cash would do the trick. Ask Bitfinex's customer support about your idea maybe they'll teach you a thing or two but don't get your hopes too high.",
