Instead of rollbit to provide prove of the second account, they keep it within themselves and make it look childish. Is this the new way that Razer and Rollbit has come up with to deprive people from their wins. An account on Rollbit can accept deposit but when it is time for withdrawal after a win, the story of alts comes in play.
