If you are directing it to the rich and wealthy society, I will say you are right, but if it is to the world entirely, you are very wrong, because let's not even forget about the luxury brands and clothing.

I don't the source of your information or how you got the inspiration to put up this thread because it lacks some basic facts. Luxury goods will always be available for those who can afford them, and old products will be dumped. Your assumption that the price of luxury goods will fall in the future is not true because there will always be people who can afford it. You should also know that the price will never fall because of the cost of production. Most of these luxury goods are expensive to produce and you don't expect the manufacturers to sell the product below the cost price. I want to also advise that if your basement is filled with clothes that you don't need anymore you can donate them to NGOs so that they can be distributed to people that need them. Prisons in my location will be willing to receive such clothes because many inmates don't have clothing materials. The truth is that the rich will continue to buy what they want and the poor will be satisfied with their basic needs.",

Well, if a certain individual does have that financial capacity then they could really buying things on which they do want or like to have. If you do like clothing then you would really be focusing on that, but its true that on the time that you do get matured or able to realize things then this is where you would be starting on thinking that you shouldnt have done that.Eveythings too much would really be not relevant anymore or simply you are really just that wasting money on something which isnt worth.Human beings doesnt really have that kind of contentment on which it is normal but you shouldnt really tolerate it.It would be much better if you do really put up focus on other things or simply spending onto those which are more important or worth.",

In the economic world of today, things change. Many people go for the expensive clothes, still leaving those clothes like gucci at an expensive price rate. These terms about demand and supply in economics is referring to a general market, not just a brand. These brands have different customer base and work according to the rate of demands they get on their next production. And generally the fabrics industries can't run out of demands, people keep on changing new clothes. You're right, the world is filled with what people don't need anymore. Lots of rags wasted in the bin, every single minute. Humans upgrade their wardrobe to look neat. So, it'll be difficult for those designer brands to fall in price. Instead the price will keep on increase. Same is with the car industry. The demand of cars are still high, although second hand cars are getting cheaper, hence, only few go for brand new cars in the third world countries. The listed goods and products in your list, human rarely would do without it. Some food products like potatoes go cheaper because the demand is less and the production rate is high. Many other nutritious foods have gone extinct, due to the downfall in demand. Farmers no longer produce them anymore.",
