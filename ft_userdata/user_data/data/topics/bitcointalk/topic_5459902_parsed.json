Professor Goke Alamu from Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado-Ekiti, made this known in a statement.   Prof Alamu said He was invited to China to teach Yoruba in 2020 but that was during lockdown so He could not travel so he started teaching through online classes alongside three US professors for students of the Beijing Foreign Studies University in China. Before it was published it was first approved by the China Government.   He stated here this: QuoteI worked with three professors who had the opportunity to study the language in the US. This is the product of our efforts after three years. I will be going to China in September to test-run the book. China begins studies in Yoruba, produces first textbook",
