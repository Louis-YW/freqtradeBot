(EG your using their app)they have both keys for both sides. so you would need to ask them to close session to credit your CEX account and then withdrawif you have a LN node/wallet you can send those msat to your node.. but here is the thing. currently LN is a double layerwhen setting up LN for first time people set up a LN wallet seed.. they move BTC network coin to a address of LN wallet seed key for the LN node(a 'master' LN wallet key) in the node. and then move again into the channel LN key.. where the channels withdraw/close session destinations are back to the LN master address of the LN seed walletyes you can import that seed into a bitcoin wallet. by finding the LN seed in the LN wallet and copying it over. but some LN nodes methods of backup/access to that seed is not easyso then some people just make another tx from the LN node to a bitcoin node wallet",

Cause I need buy bitcoin on DEX frequently, and withdraw bitcoin to my segwit address, segwit withdraw fee is a little bit expensive,but LN address withdraw fee is cheap, so I want withdraw by LN , and transfer to my hardware wallet by myself.I'll try Electrum on Umbrel, after Bitcoin core data synced.

      "body": "just be aware of the fee's thoughsilly idiots promote LN as being cheap..but thats if you are only paying a channel partner whilst already in LNit takes real bitcoin tx fee's to get value in. if freshly starting. and outif whilst in LN it takes X hops(middlemen routers) to move msat from a DEX ln to your LN channel. than thats a 10 multiple of the lower ln payment fee. because each middleman wants to get paid for participating in the msat movementsalso when exiting LN to get back to bitcoin. if broadcasting check the close session fee's allotted to the partnership arrangement of the channelbefore setting up your LN node. check how its set up and if you can get hold of the LN seed, as it may save you in later date..if that seed can be used in your hardware wallet to show as balance(doubt it in many LN software wallets)but for this instance. also check if the close session allows you to pick your destination (normal segwit) or if its a address in the LN seed which might need a double tx just to get out of the channel then out of the LN seed to a bitcoin wallet addressin many cases the destination of a channel exit is usually not capable of choosing your hardware wallet address as the destinationremember LN is not bitcoinit uses msat and a pegging system between the LN payments vs the close session states.where by if you are receiving inbound msat value from a channel partner. its them that make decisions on fees and destinations which you have some degree of agreement to. but usually dependant on what LN wallet determine how much sway you have or if just slave to channel partnerLN is a completely different payment system to bitcoin. so take your time learning the differences",

And doing it yourself will still need the funds to keep those channels open, and the costs to open and close them. Another question is how often do you really need to swap funds? Can you just 'batch them out' so to speak. Or do you need to convert them as they come in?-Dave",
