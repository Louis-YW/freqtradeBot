  "content": "Bitcoin's global adoption is increasing, and Mercado Bitcoin is preparing to launch operations in Mexico. Mercado Bitcoin, a popular Brazilian cryptocurrency exchange platform, is following the current expansion trend in the crypto sector. Mercado Bitcoin is expanding its operations in Mexico.While the popular Bitcoin cryptocurrency has grown in popularity in various countries around the world, recent additions include the Central African Republic, which has made Bitcoin legal tender, Ukraine's use of Bitcoin as support funds, and several other countries that use crypto technologies but under strict regulations.Furthermore, many platforms similar to Crypto.com, which offers Bitcoin exchange to different countries, and Zetrix blockchain, which uses cross-chain technology to provide smart contracts, scalability, and security services, as well as popular platforms like Binance, have facilitated these expansions. According to Cointelegraph, Mercado Bitcoin is not looking for a Mexican-based crypto exchange to operate in the country, but is instead waiting for approvals to begin operations in Mexico. Increasing competition with other cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.",

You make it out like these platforms are doing Bitcoin a favour, when on the contrary, they exist cause of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The are also centralized, which is the opposite of that Bitcoin is, so they act as channels for governments to gain control over an unregulated system, while risking user privacy, funds and using inflated transaction prices to motivate users to store their funds with them.",

      "body": "The Bitcoin market in Mexico has been growing fast in the past years. And that's because one of the biggest incomes for the country are the remittances. The first half of 2022 Mexico gets $22.4B and from that money $1B was sent with Bitcoin in the platform called Bitso.I will leave some references:https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/remesas/%7BF96B9D6A-37F9-5764-AEFF-4D2A16054468%7D.pdfhttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/16/bitso-proceso-1000-millones-en-remesas-cripto-entre-ee-uu-y-mexico-en-el-primer-semestre-de-2022/",

We need to sit down, think and know the differences and what's at stake.",

Mercado Bitcoin is expanding its operations in Mexico.Mercado Bitcoin is an old Brazilian exchange. It is a good one, and the second one in volume (just behind Binance).It is indeed expanding its operations to Mexico: https://www.criptofacil.com/mercado-bitcoin-anuncia-expansao-para-o-mexico-neste-2022/I can also add that they already made a Spanish websitehttps://www.criptofacil.com/mercado-bitcoin-anuncia-expansao-para-o-mexico-neste-2022/About Mercado Bitcoin. Is it a good exchange? Yes, but not an amazing..It will be very hard for them to get into Mexico markets, specially if some big exchange shows up as well (Coinbase, Binance).Coinbase and binance are much better.",
