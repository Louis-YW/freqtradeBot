  "content": "It's really been a journey worth celebration.I've been so happy lately about the forum and my progress so far. It's been roughly a month I joined the forum and the growth has been an amazing one with the help of the forum members and the local board. After been introduced to the forum and consistent writing, I've really understood the fact that learning truly never ends.I never thought It would be any way this less difficult for me because I'm not the writing type I know it doesn't seem easy but one thing is sure, that nothing good comes easy as my journey has been so much amazing to me. A friend, introduced me to this forum and has proven his love to me beyond all doubts even without direct assistance on the forum but constantly reminding me why I joined and always show me a screenshot of the ranking system and what it take to attain a certain rank and the also the possibilities of earning while interacting with people and without him knowing, I've placed him in class of my destiny helpers, because I have stayed away from so much troubles and unnecessary expenses and debts as I'm always indoors trying to meet up my goals.I know my current level doesn't seem worths all this celebration to many, but to me it means alot to, as I'm not really a good writer, but I have been constantly reminded of the reward ahead and the only way to get it and that one of the best ways to stop bothering people is to write, which I try as much as possible to do even at midnights.God bless you my friend and if you get to see this post,please just know that, you own a special space in my heart forever.i want to announce my promotion toJR.MEMBER RANK as I also await my MEMBER RANKsoon.Please celebrate with me.Below is the link to my profile and to see my mehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3504269",

It's a bit early to talk about your journey so far, it's not a rule not to but there are distractions and complacency it may bring in.You have moved up in rank that's good but see this as it's actually possible for you to rise and then set more targets and standards for your self, lay out plans to meet the goals, you see you do have a lot on your hand to feel relaxed.

You will only write more if you don't understand what is happening here, but if you read and have good knowledge of cryptocurrency and what is happening here, you will not need to write much and you will not need to stress yourself. Don't stay indoors because of the forum, you can go out and try your hands in other things and visit the forum at your leisure. This is a discussion forum, not a university.",

Learning n the crypto world, for several people who are really new to this may be quite difficult because there are some new terms and information, So did I that time. But, this surely can be done and understood by everyone who is seriously trying and learning. Proof, many members are here from different backgrounds, both technology-related and not. Anyway, congratulations on your rank up, this is not the end of your journey and I am sure that you want the higher onesagain. This can be also one of the reminders for all here, especially forme to keep up the work and keep learning without any laziness (although sometimes, I feel little bit tired and lazy), but as long as we can still manage it, this seems to be normal",
