  "content": "Sometimes i just fell like quitting or i feel i am doing the wrong thing even if at some point my investment on bitcoin works well as i only practise on stratey dcaing scince i got into Bitcoin lately. I have seen most topics on the forum about Bitcoin and the Bitcoin forum. Such like fear of investing in bitcoin, some investment strategies being a mental challenge and to mention a few. If you read through those topic you will see different views and opinion from members of the forum and most times you just feel if your doing the right thing all this while or it your just going in on luck. I dont want to say am confused because i have read and learnt in the past few months much of Bitcoin and Bitcointalk forum and i have shared some resources to help other members from where i learnt from. Also I have come accross some profile been inactive for some time while some totally stopped contributing to the forum. Dont know thier reasons or challenges but i know there is a reason for all that. I dont want a day to come where i would stop contributing positively to the forum.Regardless i still have a few questions and things i want to know, something that a book, video or other learning resources cannot help me instead i can only get that from members of the forum. I’d like to know what motivates you to invest in a speculative asset like Bitcoin?What is the driving force that encourages your continuity in the Bitcointalk forum?who do you listen to in the forum and study to keep your conviction solid?What do you think are the reasons why some person stopped contributing to the forum positively or are they carried away by the rank they have?",

Their interest to Bitcoin is surely a great confirmation that my investment is really worth investing since pother huge companies and country is investing too. As shrimp holder, this giant investors that speculating on Bitcoin motivates me to hold more aside from the blockchain technology which is my original reason why I invested on Bitcoin that’s why I invest to Bitcoin before this giant investors.As for the Bitcointalk forum.

Long term investment in bitcoin works, there is no debate on the forum about that, unless you read trolls like proudhon. And it is not a matter of luck, it is a matter of recognising what bitcoin is, what it brings to the world and understanding that this is intrinsically linked to its rising price. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMI’d like to know what motivates you to invest in a speculative asset like Bitcoin?That it is not really speculative if you invest for the long term, and that it is much more than a tool to make money (fiat). Bitcoin gives you options and freedom.

Now coming back to your queries. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMI’d like to know what motivates you to invest in a speculative asset like Bitcoin?I want to make money, I have money that I can use to make extra money, but I do not have enough money to invest in other kinds of investments like real estate, etc. But I came to know about BTC and the features it has, so I was motivated to put my assets in it. Just to clear things out, I am a student and started to make money from crypto, and now I am earning from sig campaigns in BTC. And I an saving these amounts and only using what I have to. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMWhat is the driving force that encourages your continuity in the Bitcointalk forum?First, I was here for bounties, then I started to contribute to discussions on the local community then slowly slowly, started to make posts out of the local community, and started to get motivated when people started to merit me, people not from the local board but from overall board supported and motivated me, ohh how can I forget to mention, they educated me better than my school teachers. I like the interaction here, and the replies I got from others, I like the attention (which I actually don't have hehe). But still, I don't know, I kind of feel, I am missing something until I don't visit the forum, If you will see, I don't have any posts from yesterday (instead one maybe), I was busy in marriage where I have to travel 5 hour for just going there and 5 hour to come home. And I stayed there for only 1 hour. I was frustrated, but during the travel, I still opened BTT and read what was happening if there was some good or bad news, I did not engage due to privacy. Well, I think I am going off-topic. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMwho do you listen to in the forum and study to keep your conviction solid?Everything that is related to BTC and hacking. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMWhat do you think are the reasons why some person stopped contributing to the forum positively or are they carried away by the rank they have?Everyone have there reasons.

Yes, this is the point of the aspect statement. You said that I learn things from BitcoinTalk members that are not found in videos, books, or other learning resources, etc. I can't say with certainty about you what that thing is in your mind. But according to my theory and idea, as far as I know if I am not wrong, that thing is experience, which members of the BitcoinTalk forum can give you. Emphasize thinking a little and trying to understand that videos, books, or other learning resources, etc., only teach you basic knowledge about what Bitcoin is and how and when to invest. But experience is something that is presented to you in the form of a practically positive feedback result by making good use of all the knowledge or education that you need. Using this knowledge, should you decide to enter Bitcoin at this time or exit at this time, etc.?So the purpose of saying this is that reading books, watching videos, and other learning resources provides education for you, which only gives you knowledge, whereas experience gives you the result that has been practically confirmed. There are many members on BitconTalk who can teach you this experience for free.",

I picked interest in Bitcoin because it is community-oriented and there's full access to participate in the open economy. To invest in assets in my country, I have to do shit ton of KYC and other things. When I first got into bitcoin and crypto, 95% of exchanges at the time didn't enforce KYC so it was super easy to join the bandwagon. Quote from: Agbamoni on October 01, 2023, 01:31:40 PMWhat is the driving force that encourages your continuity in the Bitcointalk forum? The forum contains a wealth of information. I found the forum through a Google search. I read the topic and replies. That's when I decided to stick around. I thought - If I know this just from a Google search, how much more will I learn if I stick around?

Finding out about Bitcointalk Forum trigger and boost my confidence knowing that I'm in the midst of like minded people who share similar ideas. I personally have some high rank members whom I look up to despite that they're not aware of it but I do not have a particular member who I listen to for now. I listen to ideas in the forum no matter where it is coming from be it high rank or lower rank as long as the idea is useful. It's wrong to assume and make judgment as to why some people stopped contributing in the forum. It my be due to personal reasons or some challenges. Just like in this thread by lauda.

If I had any merit i would have merited, you.The aspect which you said the forum is like a school of knowledge cut deep into my heart. I could remember when I started, I was not good at making good discussions in the forum due to this I was attacked by most person, but I understood something that those words were thrown at me for me to learn and contribute to the forum positively. Sometimes it's best to learn the hard way.Also, I don't agree when you said knowledge is limited. Buddy knowledge is open for anyone at any time to learn.

Anyways, if you invest in Bitcoin it doesn't mean that you will always have to be active on the forum in order to gain profit. As other forum members have also given this advice to other forum members as I also did, it's better to have more than one main source of income and never make Bitcoin investment as your main source of income.
