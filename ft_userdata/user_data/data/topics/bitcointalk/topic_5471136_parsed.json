I came to know about Hal Finney when the day of first Bitcoinist was celebrated, a topic was also created -->Today marks 9 years since the death of Bitcoin first pioneer Hal Finney, I learned a lot about Hal Finney and also read his last post made on BTT. -->https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0 (by Hal), He was facing a lot of issues and in that post, he already mentioned that he talked with Satoshi over the email so many times and he said, he thought Satoshi was some Japanese guy.This also indicates that Hal was not the Satoshi but only a cryptographic expert who was overwhelmed with BTC cryptography. A fan of BTC.",

Looking for the key to Satoshi's Bitcoin stash that he never even had. Even though Hal Finney was only the first debugger and contributor to the Bitcoin code and was the recipient of the first Bitcoin transaction in January 2009 he received 10 bitcoins from the creator of Bitcoin.This article created by Jameson Lopp further proves that Finney is not satoshi or not the creator of Bitcoin, this will be future-proof when someone associates him again with the creator of Bitcoin.Although Hal Finney was legally declared dead on August 28, 2014, at 8:50 pm at the age of 58, Finney's body became the 128th Alcor Patient. His body since being declared dead has been cryonically frozen, Hal Finney is now undergoing cooling to -196 degrees Celsius for long-term storage where he is being cared for until the day that repair and resurrection can take place.Perhaps in the future when technology develops rapidly, there will be a resurrection for Hal Finney and explain that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of bitcoin. \"He’s always been optimistic about the future,\" says Hal Finney's wife, Fran. \"Every new advance, he embraced it, every new technology. Hal relished life, and he made the most of everything.\" Source: https://www.wired.com/2014/08/hal-finney/https://www.alcor.org/2014/12/hal-finney-becomes-alcors-128th-patient/https://coingeek.com/faketoshi-series-hal-finney-the-men-who-are-not-satoshi-part-3/",

Because he had started working on the project 2 years before the release.You don't have to guess \"2005 and 2007\", or anything like that. If you try to grep the source code of 0.01 version, you will find some places, where \"2007\" is explicitly revealed, and even the more precise date is present. For example, if you check \"sha.h\", you will find 24th September 2007:Code:// This file is public domain// SHA routines extracted as a standalone file from:// Crypto++: a C++ Class Library of Cryptographic Schemes// Version 5.5.2 (9/24/2007)// http://www.cryptopp.com#ifndef CRYPTOPP_SHA_H#define CRYPTOPP_SHA_H#include <stdlib.h>This is the earliest date I found, but maybe after more digging you could find something at the beginning of September 2007. But I doubt there are any earlier timestamps anywhere. Also, from the code structure itself, you can easily deduce, that importing hash functions like SHA-1, was done by Satoshi in 2007, and then he stopped upgrading libraries. His strategy was quite simple: you need a library? So, get the latest version, install it here and now, and then forget about upgrading, if everything works correctly.Another thing you should also do, is to go through the whitepaper, scroll down to the \"References\" paragraph, and grab all of those documents one-by-one. Then, you will note, that \"hashcash\" is the sixth position, but it is also \"the third from the bottom\". If you use reversed order, then you note that in many lists, Satoshi actually used reversed order. For example, he listed \"Visual C++\" first, and then added \"MinGW\" at the first position. The same with other references. Which is quite interesting, because it means, he didn't start from some \"Abstract\" or \"Introduction\", but the first paragraph was probably called \"Calculations\", and he wrote a lot of code, to confirm everything he read in 8th reference about \"probability theory and its applications\", then created a system based only on public keys alone, without any hashing, using \"Protocols for public key cryptosystems\", and then jumped into \"Hashcash\", and downloaded SHA-1 library as a dependency on 24th September 2007, and didn't upgrade it since then (also because later SHA-1 was replaced by SHA-256).QuoteKnowing the type of RNG used in that period is also goodThere are some topics on bitcointalk, where you can get more details: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=113496Quoteanother thing, he used a single core CPU, that's why he later added multiproccessor support for miningYes, but he added those things to his own miners first, and then publicly released them. Which means, he didn't release it from the first day, when he heard about such possibilities. There are many proofs to support that fact. First: he mined 40-bit Genesis Block, and initially planned 40-bit difficulty for mainnet, and 20-bit difficulty for testnet (see November 2008 source code for more details). Second: if you have any multi-threaded program, then it is harder to do that correctly. It is far easier to run N instances of console application, and let your Operating System do the thing, than implement it in C++ in 2009 (maybe also in assembly). Third: he was against GPU arms race, and tried to postpone it for as long as possible, to encourage more people, by offering them the possibility to mine on their CPUs.QuoteQuotehe said, he thought Satoshi was some Japanese guyHe definitely was.Maybe I should be more clear here: I don't think Satoshi is Hal. But I think Satoshi is from Japan. Because I heard some people saying \"he is obviously not some Japanese guy\". And then I found more than enough proofs, that his whole Operating System had Japanese language enabled. Also, if you want to deduce, that he used Windows XP, and not for example Windows 98, then you can read, what he thought about using some older version of the Bitcoin client, and also read all things, when he mentioned about Windows Vista as \"Vista hasn't been tested yet\". That word \"yet\" means, he would also do that, if possible.",
