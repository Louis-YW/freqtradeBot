Is your business an International Business that requires paying international tariff? If yes, you need bitcoin to overcome some of the charges and it will be best if your client in the other part of the country is also acquainted to bitcoin and how it is being used.On the contrary, if your business is a local business that does not have an international or global presence. You don't really need to bother yourself with Bitcoin because the transaction fee and how to handle volatility could be a problem to you.",

This is why some might only accept it when it is appreciating.I totally agree with you here. I believe Bitcoin as a means of payment will excel in many other aspects from easy cross-border payments and being a fast transaction means etc however, I too believe that with its volatility nature, how many businesses will want to accept it when they know the price could easily drop especially in a bear market like this? I think this might be the only downside to it except the business owner is willing to hodl till the price grows again and I don't know how that business can continue to get financed.",

It does not matter from which currency government charge their income tax, from fiat or from cryptocurrency, thus it makes no major difference in what currency you accept payments. Also it depends on the business. If it is connected with goods, then there is no difference, like I've said above. But if you give some kind of service, than you might try to hide something from government. It will be difficult to prove that service was given and payment was charged, if both, service taker and giver agreed to have this deal in shade.",

But using Bitcoin to buy cheap basic commodities or services might not be too beneficial.No one is perfect here, mate. Sometimes we will encounter some errors when transferring money by the bank, but most will be fixed quickly.I once took 3 days to complete a bitcoin transaction when I was trying to use low transaction fees to save money. And one point as you said, using bitcoin to pay for coffee or a loaf of bread is really inconvenient from the time to confirm the transaction and the transaction fee, while it is more convenient to use fiat or a bank. But using bitcoin for international payments is much more convenient than banking. Both have their pros and cons, and if used appropriately for the situation, it will bring out the best of them.",

This happen always on bitcoin and its really bad for newbie business owner to experience this point because they could lose a lot of money for this unfortunate events.",
