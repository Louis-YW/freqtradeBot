To me you are worrying too much, they are not going to be able to unlock your phone having it as you have it with fingerprint lock. I don't know what you're asking about, but you could also make yourself a paper wallet and transfer the Bitcoin there. The bad thing is that I think in both cases, to do it with 100% guarantee that no one has spied on you online is going to take a lot of work. If you have a small amount in your mobile, let's say less than $1k, I wouldn't even worry about it.",

Phone wallets are not the best option for storage either.",

Buy another phone to store your bitcoins if you cannot afford a hardware wallet yet. If you cannot buy another phone but have an old phone, you can use it as an alternative to a hardware wallet for the time you can get a hardware wallet. The second phone should be used strictly for storing your bitcoins and you should also limit the the usage of that phone on the internet to reduce security risk.How to use an old smartphone as Cold Storage.QuoteSTEP 1(a) Remove the SIM card if your phone has one. You don’t want any cellular communications, only WiFi.(b)Perform a factory reset. This is typically found under Settings/Backup & Reset. This procedure wipes all personal data from the device and returns it to a factory state. Obviously back up anything you need before hand.(c)After resetting the device and connecting to your WiFi (make sure your WiFi is password protected), you will have to log in to a Google account during the setup process. Do not use an existing account. Instead, create a new account with a fake name. Save the details of the account for later. This new account is to be used for absolutely nothing but tasks related to interacting with this device. Also during setup, don’t back up your phone to Google’s servers, don’t select to stay up to date, and don’t add any billing information. When it asks you to secure your phone, choose PIN and make sure it’s at least 6 digits long; I use 10. Remember, this isn’t about convenience, it’s about security. When prompted, choose to not show notifications when the device is locked. Lastly, don’t enable any of the offered services like backups, location, bug reporting, etc.Once the phone is done setting up your profile, turn off data communications. On most Android phones, swipe down twice from the top of your screen to bring down your quick menu. Click on the icon for your data or cellular connection and then disable mobile data.(d)Go into Settings/Apps, swipe over to All, and uninstall or disable every app that isn’t explicitly needed for using the device for offline storage. If in doubt, leave enabled all of the apps with the green android avatar. Also leave enabled Google Play, Google Play Services, and Google Keyboard. Don’t worry, if you accidentally disable something you need, it can always be re-enabled; just make sure you’ve tested everything before you start moving the bulk of your coins to the device. It’s also a good idea to reboot your phone before moving on to the next step.(e)Go to Settings/Security. Set it to automatically lock after sleep. Enable the “Power button instantly locks” option, disable “make passwords visible”, and disallow installation of unknown sources(f) Finally, encrypt your phone. There should be an option on the Security page. It will warn you that encryption will take a long time but since there’s hardly anything installed or stored on the phone at this time, it will only take a few minutes. If the option to encrypt isn’t available, don’t use this device. If you can’t encrypt your device, your security is highly compromised and isn’t worth the risk and you’ll be better off using something else.After that step;Quote(a) Install a VPN client. A VPN (virtual private network) encrypts and routes all data coming and going to and from your device through a proxy server masking your IP address. If your VPN allows for it, set it up so that if the VPN loses connection, it will kill your network connection and prevent any unencrypted data from leaving your phone.(b) Install a password manager like Last pass or any other one with good rating and review.(c)Install wallets. There are a number of wallets available on the Android platform, all with different features. Do NOT use a hosted wallet app such as Coinbase. Using a hosted wallet completely defeats the purpose of using your device for offline storage. When choosing your wallet, always try to choose wallets that offer a 12 word recovery phrase. After all this, it is still recommended that you turn off the phone, and remove the battery to keep safely when not needed.(the guide is for android device)https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@anarcrypt/how-to-set-up-a-smartphone-for-cold-storage",

It should be safer than using mobile phone wallet anyway (if you are careful what you install on your PC).  By the way, hardware wallets are not as expensive as you might think and it will increase safety of your bitcoin immensely so you should really cosnider sorting that out asap if you can.Quote from: Poker Player on April 03, 2023, 03:54:52 AMIf you don't have money to buy a hardware wallet I guess you must not have much money invested in Bitcoin, right? I might be wrong about this case and guy might really struggle financially at the moment, but I think that in many cases people who say that they can't afford hardware wallet actually have issues with priorities, thinking that unless they have huge amount of money in crypto they don't really need hardware wallet and that is just a waste of money, or that chances of them getting hacked are very low. I thought the same before I lost almost everything ~5 years ago, and first thing I did after that was buying hardware wallet even though at the time I had maybe $100-$200 crypto left.",

For security, hehe! it's not recommended if you can't afford a hardware wallet then surely you may don't have enough money invested in crypto, and the question about hacking, no one hacker is going to take this much effort to hack your wallet to steal this small amount of coins.

Don't worry about that, if you have fingerprint lock in your phone, it's very hard to unlock it, and who knows that you own crypto if you are new at that job, and no one is going to unlock all workers phones to steal. if your amount is small then you can use digital wallet like electrum or trust wallet, and keep backups of your seed phrases ,private key, like writing on a paper and for more : 1       2and if you are trading and all your crypto are on exchange, then exchange also comes with security to protect fund from third person, security like 2FA, Allow withdrawals only to addresses you trust, check your whitelist regularly, transfer on a digital wallet, and if you have another phone at your home, then you can install a digital wallet on that phone, and transfer all crypto on that phone if your home is secure like your family members are always on that house.",

Storing your Bitcoin on an operating system (OS) installed on a USB flash drive can be a good option for those who can't afford a hardware wallet. One popular OS for this purpose is Tails , which is designed to provide privacy and anonymity online.To install Tails on a USB flash drive, you can follow the installation tutorial on the Tails website. It's important to note that using an OS on a USB drive is not foolproof, and there is still a risk of losing your Bitcoin if the USB drive is lost, stolen, or damaged. It's always important to keep backups of your Bitcoin and to use secure methods for storage and transfer.",
