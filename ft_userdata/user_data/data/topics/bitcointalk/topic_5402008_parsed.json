  "content": "Almost one month after successfully launching our Token, we are happy to announce that our Swap platform is almost finished. In this post we are going to explain how will it work and which features it brings.What is DEX?From the early days of Bitcoin, exchanges have played a vital role in matching cryptocurrency buyers with sellers. Without these forums attracting a global user base, we’d have much poorer liquidity and no way to agree on the correct price of assets.Traditionally, centralized players have dominated this field. However, with the rapidly-evolving stack of technologies available, a growing number of tools for decentralized trades have emerged.A decentralized application is a smart contract-based software application that stores data on the blockchain. Because DApps do not force you to expose your identity, you will be able to maintain a certain amount of privacy. The graphical user interface (GUI) of decentralized applications is optional, although any developer can construct his own GUI and communicate with the application’s smart contract.The world of DeFi is still being charted, with explorers navigating AMMs across multiple blockchain economies, bothersome slippage rates on trades, ongoing price discrepancies, and scalability concerns. Traders demand a more straightforward experience, or better said, a map of the DeFi realm. Jupyter Swap is on a journey to reshape the market-wide DEX trading experience.Jupyter Swaphttps://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PsLdkJIZrbMPlW4oioCDmg.jpegJupyter Swap interfaceJupyterswap is the decentralized exchange of the Jupyter token. It provides an open and decentralized liquidity protocol for assets on BinanceSmartChain(BSC) network. Jupyter Swap is Open-Source.It works as an AMM ( Automated Market Maker ) with liquidity pools.The trading fees will be 0.3%, these 0.3% will be added to the Liquidity Pools,0.27% is going to the liquidity provider, and 0.03% will go to the Project as a protocol fee.All our liquidity Pools will have an ERC-20 Token vs. BNB,internally the pools do work with WrappedBNB Token,but as a user, you won’t notice this because the WBNB will automatically be Exchanged to BNB,and BNB will automatically be converted to WBNB.All our pools are ERC-20 tokens vs. BNB,but thanks to intelligent routing and pool hopping you will be able to trade all tokens to other tokens on JupyterSwap.Anyone can open their own trading pools, or add liquidity to an existing pool, the only limitation is there can only ever be 1 pool of any given token.Liquidity providers will get LP-Tokens, the LP-Tokens are ERC-20 compatible, and will function as proof of your ownership.The AMM model works on the simple Formula,X = token A BalanceY = token B balanceK = pool constantX * Y = KThe Price calculation is:P = tokenA price in tokenBX = token A BalanceY = token B balanceY / X = PX = 100Y = 10001000/100 = 0.1In reality there is also a price impact depending on your position size:Lets say you have 10 tokenB and want to buy tokenA:Q = position sizeR = receiving amount in tokenAX = token A BalanceY = token B balance(( X — Q ) / Y ) * Q = RQ = 10X = 100Y = 1000(( 100–10 ) / 1000 ) * 10 = 0.9On top of that, we have developed our own unique Chart, which will be available for use to everyone.",
