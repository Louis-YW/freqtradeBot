QuoteIf the idea works and people like the idea I will create a front end for it and a nice dashboard to show the rounds in progress and round statusand mining status when a round begins.Nice idea. I think that a lot of people would really like something like this. Yes, I am afraid that means I own ETH, as I am playing a lot with smart contracts at the moment but still a Bitcoin lover at heart. Also I think there is a lot of people who would rather burn alts for a chance to get some more Bitcoin so In reality were turning one possibly into the other!Any Bitcoin lover should love the prospect of another coin funding hashrate right? Over the years I have seen people interested in mining in the groups but most are BTC buy in and as a lot of people would rather hodl onto the BTC than spend it then offering it this way is a good idea.As for security risks I took every step I could to ensure the code has no functions that are not required and I ensured that any critical functions like completeRound are executable only by the ownerOnly.I also took steps to ensure the contract could not hold more than a set balance per round to add some extra later of security.It will only accept deposits in the correct amount and will check if the balance is at the round threshold. I also put my money where my mouth is and took slot 1 for round 1 by depositing my 0.1 ETH first. And yes just like the groups a layer of trust is required in myself the op to distribute the funds once a block is found.This is something I am thinking hard on as I would love to come up with a way to also have this done automated and open to ideas or collaboration to come up with such a system.This is still a early concept idea with much room for improvement but I feel building a community around the idea we could come up with something really unique for people wishing to rent hash power in groups and know its all trusted behind a smart contract.  The whole idea is to build a framework with a smart contract that can handle the rounds and funds and work on a system for distributing the payment to the users once a block is found.Also with it being a smart contract and people can be assured that if a round is not filled they will be refunded traditional groups there is no refund function if they don't fill and your at the whim of the OP once again.Like I said this is a early concept idea with some really big plans in the background take this V1 as the test bed if it works and people like it then we move forward with the framework and website and dapp while working on some kind of automated payout system.Hope this clears up my though process with the project.Best regardsMagic!",

Once the round is full funds are send from the contract to Nicehash.Hashrate is rented at the market rate at the time.None of the solo runs \"guarantee\" hitting a block.  so your \"you need 5% of contracts\" is not correct.None of the other solo groups on the forum rent 5% of the contracts on Nicehash for there runs either.I think you are miss-interpreting the idea and how this all works.",

This was done to add some transparency to the process and allow people to know they can refund if the round is not full.2. It would allow me to create a dapp where many people can group up and use a smart contract to manage hash rate rentals.  I believe this has some future use case that have yet to be explored.  3. We already have some groups doing this and it's fun for the community 4. We support the Bitcoin hashrate and miners along the way. Hope this clears up some of your concerns.RegardsMagic",

I feel we would want to run for 24 hours and try squeeze as much hash power as possible in that time and keep it in line with the other groups.Again being a community project the length of time and total hash rate could be something governance could play a part in. Most of the groups rent from 20-50ph for 24 hours normally I don't see why we could not reach these levels.Thanks for your question!",

That's not muchof an incentive when it's easy to do that on an exchange and buy the rental using the exchanged BTC.Just the same as any other rental group in reality at the moment only with deposits and rounds handled in a smart contract, but long term the idea is to build a dapp front end that anyone can join a round of rentals.Picture a site where users can deposit some ETH or USDT or USDC or any token for that matter into a pool with others to rent hashpower for the chance to hit the block and get a payday.At the moment this is the start ground work for it the basics if you like the \"mechanics\" of the rounds deposits and payout addresses and block data being stored on-chain and via IPFS.When you pay your deposit you input your BTC address which liked to a mapping of your deposit :Here was my deposit into the pool as user 1 for round 1.Code:amount :100000000000000000btcPayoutAddress :bc1qtesc50ye5euqtr67sdqke8xdwef6klasc5vx59I think the Nicehash idea will work I have tested this myself before getting to this stage and everything worked as expected (all be it I never hit a block)From here If there are people interested in the idea of this and maybe this could gain some traction and develop further as I feel there is a market for this as a service.Everything from monitoring the address for balance change and block details can all be displayed along with each run's attempts this is something I may add in a later version again as a IPFD hash included in the contract with the following info.Round DetailsCode:Total Hashrate:Mining Start Timestamp:Mining End Timestamp:Total ETH Spent: Order Data: BlockFound: True / False Payout Address:I wanted to find a way to combine something I have done for many years on CKsolo pool renting miners and mining with the group structure I have done with many in the past with a smart contract and a front end allowing rounds to be conducted whenever a pool becomes full.I understand your concerns but I just wanted to try something different and use the skills I learned along the way.Best regardsMagic!",

See here for how address is added at the time of joining the pool : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466955.msg62857113#msg62857113further more I would take extra steps to validate each user manually to ensure the address is correct before sending as a \"sanity\" check.Going forward I would like to create some program that can monitor the core wallet for incoming transactions then split the coins down to the users as soon as the block maturity period is over.  This could be all done automated and data pulled for payouts directly from the contract. Hope this clears up some of your concerns. Regards.Magic",

So the target is 20 PH for 24 hours for 1 ETH - or if we can secure some more then all the better. Full orders executed will be posted also for transparency.@ 20PH / 24hr Chance per block: 1 in 20,323Chance per day: 1 in 141Time estimate: 141 daysIt's long odds.  But I have seen small miners hit on the solo pool many times suppose you got to be in it to win it right? For later rounds if everyone is happy with how its working we could set other amounts if we wanted to rent more hashpower in a round.I hope this covers some of your questions.Best regards.Magic.",
