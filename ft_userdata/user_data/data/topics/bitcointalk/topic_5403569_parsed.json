We could have had the same story of Luna in our hand if not decisions to stop whales from dumping. Good one from solana team. They just lucky and some retailers are after the possible long position on the news. But the btc movement isnt good actually so they are still at risk. What I dont like is they can such do a counter on a decentralized force that whales brought in. If he wants to liquidated with a decentralized platform, it should be on his right to do it right?",

I think the people behind the project knows what gonna happen to them if they don't take any actions as the whales are going to manipulate the price and yeah, maybe pull the price to it's knees that it will go and crash and another sad story for crypto enthusiast.Not to rub it in though, just shows how strong bitcoin's decentralization though as it can't be manipulated by anyone. But for sure their actions might not sit well with the very foundation that is crypto.",

We could have had the same story of Luna in our hand if not decisions to stop whales from dumping. Good one from solana team. I always look at Solana as a good project if not great.  Developers have wisdom in implementing things and that is what lacking in Luna, Luna does not intend to stop whales instead they encourage them to dump when they increase the daily emission of Luna Token way back then.

Both were actually different case and you shall take a look at what the main concerns that have been making luna dumped until zero value. Both were not the same and it's impossible to compare both. I wholely agree that Luna developer's previous action was like scamming people of their money through exponentially increasing the daily emission of Luna token and worst the hardfork making LUna Classic worthless.",

Solana has been following the road maps and its one of the leading projects of 2021. I believe manipulators using solana blockchain network were behind what could have been disastrous for us.

If that would be the case then this would be extremely unfair and also a very bad message for everyone that is interested into crypto.It is a decentralized protocol. If the rules change during the game, then this is a centralized protocol. The big whale posted a deposit and took the stablecoins or other coins. It may not be profitable for him to take these coins, because he can buy more solan coins if the price drops. This is the problem with decentralized protocols. You deposit expensive collateral coins when the price is high and the risks are borne by vault holders.",

I don't say Solana will not reclaim $100 or $200 in next bull market but I think it will be wiser and better if you sell it in a peak of this recovery.
