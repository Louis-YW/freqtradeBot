There is always a luck component that you can't control but if you want to improve your economic situation you better get off your ass to make it happen.",

Self-control alone is more difficult than one might think.This only happen in civilised countries where the people have a say. There are countries where the citizens have to cope with dictators for as long as their tenure continues. Self discipline comes by default when the urge to change ones financial status sets in. This prompt self motivation and relianceQuoteAnd investing is not an easy decision. Some people think that investment can only be done with an established economic level. Besides, successful people from poor environment backgrounds are just a rare story.No good decision comes easy. Success is a combination of patience, discipline and self deprivation. Environment is the least factor that should limit ones success especially in this era where there are lots of opportunities online. With the right skill poverty can be dealt with",

You need to trade for a few years and see if its for you. Its not for most people.However there are those that do succeed in crypto and trading and have a very good living.

      "body": "This kind of dilemma is highly observed in the Asians rather than Western Hemisphere. The cultural differences are huge and that can impact financial stability vastly. For example, westerners learn to split from their parents or joint families at very young age and they start to earn their own money via part time jobs, internships and starting own business at very very young age etc. However, this can not be achieved in the Asians. The whole joint family concept and “No-independent” decision making criteria makes it harder for youngsters to choose their own career path and financial freedom. The secrete to financial breakthrough is to work hard and smart based on your situation. For above two categories one would get it sooner and other would get it later based on the situations.",

If being rich means, being contented with what you have and the status of living for you and your family, then that's perfectly fine. Most people is just to greedy that they think being rich requires a lot of money, possession, and luxuries. However, not blaming the corrupt leaders is incorrect.

Our lives are very much effected by our environment and family fortune from an early age. Anyone has the potential at birth to become anything they want, but from that moment on we can be shaped by what we are able to access. People with money can get a better education, people without money may never have access or knowledge about a lot of things that could give them better odds in life. Corruption can also severely stunt your opportunities as richer families get placed that might have gone to more intelligent or resourceful children. It can also drain money away from families all throughout life and adds an extra tax burden that gives no benefit to the central government which could share those resources more wisely.",
