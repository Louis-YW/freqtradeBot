So while saying that Bitcoin is resisting the fall is correct, it sounds weird to people who used to understand resistance as \"opposition to growth\".The $20k support is holding well for now, it's clear that there are groups who are interested in defending this important psychological level, but only time will tell if they will fully succeed or not. I wouldn't bet that this is the bottom of the bear market yet.",

The $20,000 level is a very significant level especially since a few days ago that this is acting as strong support but it is already broken in just short period of time.I just observe that when the market is dumping, it dumps too hard but when it pumps, I am not satisfied with the pump.",

At least the price might still be able to stay at $20k or less because if all the bitcoins were to be released at once, it would make the price drop drastically because a lot of people would sell some of their bitcoins to take a little profit. But hopefully, the price will not drop drastically and the news of the release of bitcoin Mt.Gox will not affect the movement of bitcoin in the market. Previously I had seen the price of $19k (if I was not mistaken last night) so I thought the price might go down to that level again. So just be prepared for all the possibilities in the market.",

Peoole should not just compared bitcoin with fiat now, have them on wallet that will not estimate the price in fiat for you, or disable the fiat value. It is going to be profitable after a year or two years.",

I couldn't tell whether I'd like that to happen but if the volume of BTC goes all the way to the roof in maintaining the $20K level, I guess a flash dip to $17k will likely happen so hold your stablecoin just to be prepared.",

I thought it would stay there but I am wrong because today it was back up again at 20k. Dunno what's with this price on why btc likes to hang out here. Next week is going to be the start of the so called ber months.I was expecting something positive within those periods so I disagree about your negative speculations right there. People are done already with the bottom thing so you better move on now.
