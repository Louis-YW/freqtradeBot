They want to become an influencer to get more money passively and more easily from referral programs, affiliate earnings and trading fee commissions.They can be paid to write articles, make videos, host livestreams that are ordered by altcoin project teams. With such money incentivize behind, you can not expect neutral reviews from influencers (scammers).Bitcoin videos on Youtube....and a suggestion for our possible BCT channel.A true influencer I admire a lot is Andreas Antonopoulos with his technical guides, books and free videos on his Youtube channel.",

One of the major problem people have is that they just want to delve into crypto because they consider it to be lucrative industry but its not the best way to go.Secondly, you can't be a KOL in everything about crypto, you need to carve a nitch for yourself, more reaon why the fundamental is elemental to your crypto journey. From the fundamental, you'll know what catches your interest and what you're passionate about, becuase in the days of the beers only the passion will sustain you.",

You don't really need a mentor but you can definitely check out other influencers that are doing good already in the space, analyze how they do their thumbnails, their video transitions and how to keep the attention span of their audiences because that's where the money is, that motivation and such comes automatically when your format finally works.",

      "body": "I think nobody gets your question judging by the comments I've seen so far. I believe you're asking if there's something like a platform or special program that recruits people who want to become KOLs or Influencers in the industry. There's a thing called Bitget Builders, I've seen some of their posts on Twitter asking for interested persons to join in, and here's a link for that. https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/12560603796735. This could be a great start for you and it is a lot easier than the second option I'm going to recommend.Secondly, you can opt to grow solo by yourself, like creating meaningful and educative content on social media platforms and when you attain some level of fame, you'll find big companies reaching out to you with endorsement deals and partnership offers. Both are going to be profitable in the long run if you're indeed good at what you do. But I do hope you're knowledgeable in this field in order to excel.",

I think a person needs to try creating content that will reach a significant audience on any social media platform, and the content doesn't even need to be crypto-related. The crypto stuff can come in later, gradually, if reaching an audience while making content centred on cryptos proves to be challenging. Then, once a person succeeds in that, sponsors can reach out and vice versa. It just doesn't make much sense for companies to invest in someone who isn't significant already when there are people who've already achieved something and thus already have a promising audience.",

That's the hardest part of being an influencer because when you start to rely your motivation into money, you'll really have hard time of dedicating yourself.You are already in the right community and this can be your foundation into building another community that's going to be after your name. It's not going to be an easy path but you have to do some test and strategies that will be part of your growth.",

So they receive money, and promote a coin that they are not even sure of, leading to many of their followers loosing money to these dubious projects. Also, in wanting to become a crypto influencer, also understand that you will be under the watchful eyes of the SEC and can be prosecuted for endorsing and promoting fake investment opportunities in cryptocurrency. To be an influencer with a difference, you have to be more dedicated to securing and preserving the trust your followers will have in you, and not abuse that trust to manipulate them for financial gains.",

I think the key to being an influencer is providing content on a particular niche, and organically build a following. Once you have a niche carved out, and you know what you are doing, you just have to keep putting our content consistently, people who are interested will find you and refer other people to your page or channel. As for promotions, you can partner with other influencers in the space to gather more followers/subscribers. Cross promotion is the best way to grow a new account. When you have become established in the space, you can then be called an “influencer”.",
