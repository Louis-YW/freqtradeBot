To me it is a new technology and should be taught nothing more about it. Now to the other side of bitcoin which is investing or even trading I think this should definitely be secular, it is not proper exposing children to risky investments, if you feel there investment should be in bitcoin you has the guiding can actually purchase and hold it for them till it gets to time where they can make decisions for themselves. As for trading we should never expose children to it, they can learn it’s analysis like the TA but they shouldn’t trade most especially futures, it only exposes them to gambling",

It's can not be denied but the world is still far to a time when you can use bitcoin as mean of exchange for everything in your life. There are things you will have to purchase, pay with fiat currency in either cash or bank transfer. So there will be time you need to exchange your bitcoin to fiat currency and do those payments.QuoteTo me it is a new technology and should be taught nothing more about it.

The advantage of doing so is that, they will get well informed about it. If they learn if from somewhere else first, they risk getting misinformed about it.Some misinformation like:Bitcoin Is a ScamBitcoin Is an Environmental DisasterBitcoin Is a BubbleBitcoin Is Used Mainly for Illegal ActivitiesBitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value Kids aged 8 and above should be taught about bitcoin. In their curriculum, it should include things like the history, crypto exchanges, wallets, security, regulation. Until they start making money for themselves and understand how risky the market is, they shouldn't be involved in doing investing in it unless their parents or guardian chooses to.",

This is subjective because we have different preferences on life choice. I preferred not being exposed on Bitcoin at young age because I don’t want to focus my goal on pure investment while I still want to enjoy my youth I will leave the investment part on my mid age which is the time when I have work to get regular salary to sustain investment.I believe exposure to Bitcoin during it early years is definitely have an advantage rather than you being on young age to discover Bitcoin because the current Bitcoin price will not give you enough room for profit if you don’t a good source of money for investment.Even if I have a kid, I will just let them be a kid and give them the freedom to learn Bitcoin when they become curious about it not by forcing them to learn.",

He can be taught about bitcoin but just only the basics and that is all. Also it is not compulsory that you must have mobet to invest in bitcoin before you can learn or have the basics knowledge of bitcoin.Some adults are in this forum that have learnt more about bitcoin here, but don't have any bitcoin investment due to lack of discretionary income. A young guy that have the basic knowledge of bitcoin can buy the idea and will be happy he knows about bitcoin so that when he starts working, he can start investing in bitcoin. The thing there is that you should not force anyone to learn bitcoin either old or young.Kids can get the awareness of bitcoin  through cartoons, but it does not mean that they will invest. Did you started making money before you were taught business study in school. Every knowledge gained now can be used in future to achieve a better living.",

That's the age where they will take decisions which may determine their future. If they take good decisions then they will have good times in their future but if they take wrong decisions then they may face tough times in future.Learning and knowing about Bitcoin is a good thing and it's even more better if those young ones get information about it and invest in it. If they invest in Bitcoin properly in their young age and hold that investment for long term then they might end up with a good future which should be free from financial tensions.",

Personally some teachers will not even have proper information about Bitcoin and investment in it, but by being a member of the forum and having long knowledge about bitcoins, you are in a better position to educate your children slowly and not forcefully.Do not stop your child from being a kid and playing when you're supposed to just because you want to teach them about Bitcoin and investment. Teach them about Bitcoin and investment in a very comfortable manner and take your time so they have a good understanding.",

Do you feel that all young guys should be informed and educated about bitcoin ?  I encourage the teaching of Bitcoin in high schools and colleges because it is current innovation that should be in science, technology and business syllabus. But let me assume that the young people you mean are those who have their own source of revenue. Such people should be introduced to Bitcoin and see if they can have interest.But they should not be coerced to invest in the sector to avoid regrets and blame games. Those who have interest could end up becoming bitcoiners and benefitting the sector. If they can invest at a young age, many of them might make a big profit when they have become adults. Some of them might even end up contributing positively to the industry. But they shouldn't be introduced to the sector as a place to make a profit alone this is because it also has risks. Some of the important lessons they should learn are how to keep their funds safe and the risks associated with the industry.",

Do you mean children between the age bracket of 5yrs to 14yrs? Or do you mean teens between the age bracket of 15yrs to 18yrs? Because if you mean teens between the age bracket of 15yrs to 18yrs, then i see nothing wrong if they are been thought about this trending technology called Bitcoin, because the earlier our teens are been expose to this new tech, the more they get interested in it when they grow up. Hence, Bitcoin as a digital currency shouldn't be limited to only people of certain grade or age level, because the earlier we introduce them to this new tech, the more we tend to prevent them from falling victim to Bitcoin related scams, simply because they have already known how the system works.",

Do you feel that all young guys should be informed and educated about bitcoin ?  Bitcoin is a currency. All you have to do is teach them about saving and bitcoin. By the time a young kid becomes an adult Bitcoin will no longer be some high growth investment, it'll just be the best way to save money. If you have excess money save it in Bitcoin. Simply as that. Someone who is a little kid now is gonna see Bitcoin very differently as an adult than we see it today. We're only obsessed with it as a high growth high volatility investment today because we are here in the early days when it is going through those growing pains that lead to immense growth and extreme volatility. When a yound kid today is old enough to be saving money - so say like the 2040s - nobody is going to be FOMOing into Bitcoin or panic selling anymore. People will just be saving money with bitcoin instead of fiat or including it as a piece of a financial portfolio. So it's not a quesion of \"will they be responsible enough?\". My parents taught me to save excess money in the bank as a kid, the future of money is just gonna be parents teaching their kids to save in bitcoin. Bitcoin is inherently low-risk, a generation from now when a young kid of today is grown up nobody is going to view bitcoin as risky because the market will have greatly matured to treat bitcoin for what it is.",

Kids should be kids and if I were a parent the moment I notice that my kid doesn't seem interested in the subject of bitcoin, I'll change it. They shouldn't be forced learn about something they aren't interested or yet interested in. If they are rather interested in sports, then, we'll do sports.",

People change their views on anything anytime so I am having a hard time to think a college student will be DCA’ing to btc for the next 10 years. Most people don’t have that kind of patience.
