  "content": "Hi everyone!We're building tools to track news from Twitter, Discord, Substack, etc., based on your interests. We scrape a lot of posts, like 20k tweets per day from 6k profiles, so we use AI filtration and manual filtration to find valuable posts and send them to you.There are posts from official project accounts, and there are also posts from independent individuals. This way, you can receive more important messages about hacks and exploits, and get them faster.So now we have a web version and a Telegram bot. The bot looks much simpler; however, it has more advanced filtration in comparison with the web version.We value all forms of feedback. If you know what can be done better please tell us. Thank you for your attention.",

Thank you for your attention.maybe you made it with php source with VScode as editor. because it's better to make it in the form of a website and then it can be transmitted to telegram bots. just suggest",

OP, it's not a bad idea (I think there have already been similar attempts), but here I also ask, why is registration necessary? You can customize the content for each visitor using cookies. The advantage of such services should be reducing the need for registration on various platforms and opening accounts on many networks.",

The site did not ask me to customize the content using cookies, and I did not find a way to customize anything.The search feature is still very random but overall, it works, I hope with continued development the results will be better as the backbone of such sites is the quality of the search algorithm.The site works in the dark mode and it is clean. If the development continues, it will be a good option for some.",

You can make a guest option that is tied to the user's IP with limited access for example. If you're afraid of abuse then you can add a filter or something similar. It is hard to gain new users for tracker apps afaik. I've seen at least two projects with the same idea that failed recently, mostly due to a lack of features and low appeal for users. Giving them a trial might be able to solve it to some extent.",

Sometimes they block regardless of what the user requests them, so it is possible that OP doesn't intend to block anyone although the chance is low since he can easily view it from his hosting control panel afaik. Kind of weird that using a VPN allows them to bypass the filter though, since most hosting would block VPN IPs most of the time.",

If there was no option of \"following\", everyone would be getting random unwanted tweets. Same case applies on the OP website.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on August 02, 2023, 05:16:48 PMWe show interest more than @OP since he did not answer any of our questions.Well, he was last active on 31 July so he did not see our messges / replies.

If you could concentrate on the project make it nice and pay less attention to money in this early stage, it will be nice.",
