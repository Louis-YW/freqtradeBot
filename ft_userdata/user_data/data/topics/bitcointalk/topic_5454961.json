      "body": "There is always a fear that takes hold of everyone once they hear of a new innovation or means of making some money offline. Fortunately, bitcoin wasn't always about making money and isn't really about making money as it is money itself but, the dynamics to its nature as both currency and asset has resulted in most seeing it for an investment option than currency.It's not difficult to relate to OP's fears with the number of scams that occurs everyday on the Web and with just as much using cryptocurrency for a payment media. This shouldn't shy you away from the currency rather, you should try to understand and play safe about your investment when you do invest.Don't let little fears scare you from getting in early instead, use the energy to learn how to protect your investment.Welcome to the olace where you can learn.",

You were introduced to Bitcoin in late 2021 and from then to now is less than 2 years, you were also not interested in bitcoin at the time so it took you a couple of months to try it out. Give yourself a target of a month or two to get to understand the basics of security and wallet, and then maybe another month to study the market, DCA strategy and best places to buy. At the end of this experiment you would be a better investor and be able to buy and safely store your bitcoins.Do not rush the process, pick a time-frame that is comfortable for you.- Jay -",

Do no think that you missed the opportunity because it's always a good time to learn about bitcoin.Yes, you should look for a good entry point to start investing in bitcoin but you can always start learning about it whenever you want.You are at the right place because this forum will give you enough knowledge to get started with bitcoin and get the basics cleared.After that, it just depends on you how deep you want to go. You are lucky because bitcoin is almost half the price when compared to it's ATH price.So the buying opportunity is good right now and you can save some capital to buy more later instead of going all in.But yeah, before buying bitcoin get all the basics cleared about, wallets, transactions, address, private keys etc...",

It was dangling around this amount before it kicked to 30k to 60k. What is expected of you is to get ready with the possible knowledge you can and invest on bitcoin what you can afford to lose. As nobody can predict if the market will pump further or fall again. Stay close to the person that introduced you to bitcoin they may have other things to teach you in the market.

You are interested in learning about Bitcoin since it fits in with your friends' lifestyles. This is a terrific idea, but I must caution you that your primary focus should not be on the possibility of making quick cash in the cryptocurrency sector. Before you buy in Bitcoin, make sure you are knowledgeable.Quote from: Noddlesman on June 03, 2023, 12:04:13 PMI thank God that I search or found this forum, and also I appreciate my gee who advertise this forum to me.
