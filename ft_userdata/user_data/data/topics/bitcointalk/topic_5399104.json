  "content": "Are we witnessing the emergence of the biggest bitcoin antagonist in the cryptospace? I think Sam Bankman-Fried is one of the most intelligent founders in the cryptospace, however, I am starting to be more skeptical about his agenda. In the article, he mentioned that bitcoin may have a future as an asset, a commodity or a store of value. I am scratching my head on what he might be implying in his statement. Is he telling us that bitcoin will not forever be no.1 in market capitalization?Skeptical. I do not know if he is making an honest assessment on bitcoin or if this is the beginning of their new agenda to remove bitcoin from being no.1.Bitcoin has no future as a payments network because of its inefficiency and high environmental costs, according to one of crypto’s most influential chief executives.Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the digital asset exchange FTX, said the proof of work system of validating blockchain transactions, which underpins bitcoin, was not capable of scaling up to cope with the millions of transactions that would be needed to make the cryptocurrency an effective means of payment.“The bitcoin network is not a payments network and it is not a scaling network,” said Bankman-Fried.But despite his views on bitcoin, Bankman-Fried said he still believed the world’s biggest digital asset had a place in the crypto market.“I don’t think that means bitcoin has to go,” he said, adding that the token may still have a future as “an asset, a commodity and a store of value” akin to gold.Read in full https://www.ft.com/content/02cad9b8-e2eb-43d4-8c18-2e9d34b443fe",

There have been issues about it. As a matter of fact, even the supposed solution which is the Lightning Network is not even as welcomed as Bitcoin itself. There are definitely fans of Bitcoin who are not fans of this different protocol.However, saying that it doesn’t have a future as a payment network is a little bit too much. It will, of course, not replace fiat but it will certainly remain as a better alternative to fiat in certain respects.Finally, it is a misnomer to call Sam the biggest Bitcoin antagonist; he is pro-Bitcoin.",

Of all the people, he should understand that bitcoin can still be a good payment scheme if big retailers are going to used it.But what will be the best crypto payment network now? Doge? ETH? doubt that as well. We still need to give LN some time to developed and mature and then we will see how it goes.",

      "body": "Bitcoin should be attacked for its lack of dynamic scalability protocols. Whether it needs them or not in the immediate term, it doesn't actually have any way to adapt to a high throughput of transactions if that's necessary (and I don't think the community has goals on making that possible - I don't think many coins can adapt well to this yet though either and fully prevent spam attacks).Saying you can use the lightning network for enabling more transactions is starting to feel a bit like saying you can use litecoin and doge for them (you can, for sure use those, but you're going to have to do something different still - maybe open a channel). The lightning network has a gain in being backed by bitcoin's blockchain but it relies on trust, not naively but not elliquently either from what I understand of it.",

I only see it being used massively for payments if all fiat and shitcoins disappear, and that is not going to happen.",

Sam Bankman-Fried is well grounded in the crypto space and has a lot of experience. His concerns might be genuine but his predictions is too harsh and stereotyped. He should understand that Bitcoin operations can be upgraded or redesigned to overcome these challenges he mentioned. His concerned about high environmental costs is being tackled by Bitcoiners. It is important to not that energy usage is not equivalent to carbon emissions. The amount of energy consumed can be easily determined but it is more difficult to determine its carbon emissions. Hence, analysts always publish how much energy Bitcoin consumes but less has been said of how much carbon the operations emit. But generally, the Bitcoin market is pushing North American energy sources to get greener because Bitcoin mining in the U.S. is more than 50% powered by renewables.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/bitcoin-mining-environmental-impact-new-study.htmlBut I see his observations and predictions as a wakeup call for the Bitcoin community to study his reservations and make necessary amends.",

He has a point in at least part of that statement.While the environmental factor is by no means an inhibitor of Bitcoin's becoming a payment network - most mining farms are on renewable energy (especially hydroelectric) and that particular concern only exists in the minds of industrialists and environmental concerns - there is some truth to the scalability question.Of course, you cannot increase scalability by increasing the block size - people tried that 5 years ago, has never worked out.But there is a future in a L2 network (most likely LN) being the primary form of payment and, exactly *how* the mass-adoption of such a network is to be executed still remains an open question. At any rate, L1 will be reserved for batching these several transactions. This will cause tx fees to soar, which in turn will push people to L2 (the tx fees will be paid from the profits of the LN relays).Of course, the prevalence of LN cannot occur if there are two or more competing implementations of it. There must be only one dominant implementation, like bitcoind is for L1.",

I send during weekdays and the fee is low. The last time I remember the fee to increase was when whales were moving their coins to exchanges to sell recently, that was when bitcoin price fell below $30000 recently. After that, the meepool is not congested again. The mempool congestion did not even surpass 20 to 30 sat/vbyte and it was not for long time.I checked the mempool now and this is weekday, the fee is very low.https://mempool.space/1 sat/vbyte, $0.04 for transaction fee, that should be for 1 input and 2 outputs transaction.
