Surprised you even name BNB ahead of Bitcoin, where?

This kind of scenario is expected to happen because we already passed the bitcoin halvings a long time ago and we will go for a new one two years from now it will be another different story but of course, the only people that can really earn huge earnings are those who have guts to take the risk to buy now and keep it until the next bitcoin halvings.

Tell me what you think about it.When was the last time you saw the BTC was zero? Ahaam. can't remember? No worries. It happens. Let me tell you a recent story.A Few days ago, In Lebanon, A armed customer robs the bank to get his money.  Two seemingly armed and desperate Lebanese depositors held up banks on Wednesday to force access to their own money, which has been blocked during a national financial meltdown. One woman with a gun and some associates briefly held hostages at a branch of BLOM Bank in the capital Beirut, before leaving with more than $13,000 in cash from her account, a source from a depositors’ advocacy group said.Shortly afterwards, in the mountain city of Aley, an armed man entered a Bankmed branch and retrieved some of his trapped savings, before handing himself into authorities, the Depositors Outcry and a security source said. Lebanon’s banks have locked most depositors out of their savings since an economic crisis took hold three years ago, leaving much of the population unable to pay for basics.In a phenomenon illustrating the plight, Wednesday’s holdups came after a man last month held up another Beirut bank to withdraw funds to treat his sick father.BLOM Bank said a customer and accomplices arrived with a gun, threatened to set people on fire, and forced the branch manager and treasurer to bring money from a safe.‘Nothing more to lose’Before going into hiding, the woman, Sali Hafiz, told local news channel Al Jadeed TV the gun was a toy and that she needed the money for her sister’s cancer treatment.“I have nothing more to lose, I got to the end of the road,” she said, saying a visit to the bank manager two days previously had not provided an adequate solution.“I got to a point where I was going to sell my kidney so that my sister could receive treatment.”BLOM confirmed the customer had been in to seek her money for her sister’s treatment, saying she was offered total cooperation and requested to provide documentation.“All we have is this money in the bank. My daughter was forced to take this money – it’s her right, it’s in her account – to treat her sister,” her mother Hiam Hafiz told local TV.Authorities did not immediately comment on the incidents.Source: CNNDid you get what I was trying to tell you? I hope you are smart enough.",

We know a lot of people would love to see bitcoin getting to that point.

The currently scenario isn't good, but it isn't the worst of all times anyway. Bitcoin is definitely not going to zero compared to USD. The support level is strong at 19,000$ and even though it breaks, we are going to see support levels on every price ranges below 19,000$ until it reaches to an alarming level that could make us believe the price would be heading to zero.

And the most disappointing thing is the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market. Since you've been into cryptocurrency since the year 2017 I believe you should know before now that Bitcoin and the stock market always correlate at some point and this always happens during th bearish season which we are in now. In addition to that, don't hold Cardano but during the total bearish market, all coin is deemed to downtrend 50-95% of there ATH price so why is Cardano a scam when it has reached the max downtrend range?Quote from: Cryptokobi on September 28, 2022, 08:46:51 AMFriend of mine that works for one of the biggest hedge funds tells me the BTC is going to zero value against the USDI believe you should know that this is the same old story people always said during the bearish market just to manipulate the market or because they don't understand the 4 years cycle of the BTC market.",
