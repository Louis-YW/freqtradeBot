GameFi is nothing new to crypto, they all came when altcoins were walking under the shadow of DeFi and guess what, many of them are buried under 6 feet, they were short term investment vehicle that only lasted when they were hot, if you see any of them trending, that's probably because of there is one of them that is trending or perhaps people are pumping to make money, social media is one of the ways this projects are spread but just to comfirm them, coinmarketcap and coingecko is going to do justice to clear doubt about gamefi projects.Most of the new projects that are even focus on gamefi don't really invest in casino games and that makes me ask why the casinos we have in the Forum all see this trend but they never for once make a move about it, it's probably because they are making it in the business without any hype while they make real money without noise to convince anyone, the right people will come with good marketing.In papers, gamefi make a lot of sense, but in real sense, they may not work like that. Maybe this is just another phase of Real estate tokenizations we had back then during the time ICO, they are all buried and people hardly discuss about it, maybe this is another phase people might soon forget.",

      "body": "I agree with you @Huppercase. I also have noticed the coming and goings in the GameFi in the past few years, and not much seem to be sticking. I think gaming or gambling in the future have good chance of making big in the blockchain space. I would like to think that the infrastructure in this space is not quite there yet. Perhaps with the year or two, we will start seeing some promising projects with truly interesting prospects that will get this movement started.",

      "body": "This sector of the crypto market will suffer the same fate as GameFi. People come to such projects solely to make money, they are not interested in the fate and development of the project, they do not invest in these tokens and do not keep them in HOLD. If a HYIP happens, it will last for 2 years at most, after that all projects will suffer the same fate as GameFi projects, they will die due to lack of liquidity and mass migration of players from one project to another.",

It's just a name created to make newbies feel like they are going to miss out on the hype, so they will join due to FOMO only to lose money",
