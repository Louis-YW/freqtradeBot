  "content": "Many newbie might not have come across RBF or even if they have they might not know what it really mean or its contribution to making transaction that seem to delay get confirmed faster. I know this might have been discussed severally but pardon me. I am trying to see if I can come up with a much simpler definition that will help we the novices take advantage of the extra functionalities of most wallets to process unconfirmed transaction faster.RBF: This is an acronym for Replace By Fee and as the name implies it means paying higher fees to make an unconfirmed transaction competitive. In real sense everyone is after the benefit so a higher fee will attract more  attention because miners will receive higher fees upon selecting the transaction.It can also be said to be a process of replacing one version of an unconfirmed transaction with another version but this time paying a higher fee. RBF was first introduced in BIP125 and Bitcoin core 0.12.0 saw its first implementation. By implementation I mean usage..There are variations in the RBF rules due to the different software nodes available but the most popular and widely used is BIP125 opt-in RBF as implemented in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. This very version of RBF gives the opportunity for transaction creators to decide if they are willing to allow their transaction get replaced with a version that pays a higher-fee.Just imagine creating a transaction and it stays unconfirmed for long because there are other other transactions that are willing to pay higher fees. It might make that transaction stay even longer than expected, except the transaction time does not really matter.But what if the time the creator have is short, another broadcast will be done. This new transaction is just the same as the previous one the only difference will be the the inclusion of a higher fees. This will make the transaction more competitive for block space because miners will receive  more for selecting that transaction.Wallets : The following wallets allows easy use of RBFElectrumBlockstream Green",

It is purely voluntary, unlike RBF where most of the nodes and miners will see the RBF flag and act accordingly. Thus, it is a method that is a hit or a miss, if a miner happens to adopt CPFP, then you'll get your transaction included and if they don't, then you have to wait a lot longer. Secondly, the amount of fees that should be set is quite ambiguous, unlike RBF where you have the liberty of creating another transaction with a higher fee (and thereby superseding the first transaction), the miners can potentially require a higher fee for your CPFP transaction, after considering the total increase in the size.Lastly, it is non-reversible as well. There is no way of removing your child transaction, even if the network fees were to dip and your first transaction happens to be confirmed without the need for CPFP. As such, I would consider CPFP as a last resort, if you don't have opt-in RBF for some reason or you cannot change your first transaction due to merchant limitations.",

Those inputs are being spent in a second transaction which conflicts with the first, and it is therefore a double spend.

When one of my transaction from TW to Binance was taking so long and i have to wait for like more than 1 hour.I asked one of my friend about it and he said you could only wait now. My transaction was not getting any confirmation, then i started to read about it and find out that if my transaction will not get confirmations then it might reflect back and my assets will be free to use. But i also read that the pending state of Transaction could take a lot of time, like from days to year maybe. This information was shared in the support section of Trust wallet. and i was like what! is this really a thing like transaction stuck for longer period of time and i do not know that TW didn't have RBF option so all i could do is to wait only.The point is RBF is the best feature but it is also not good for those who do not wanted to pay higher fee but they have to because their transaction are keep getting delayed and to complete their transaction they have to choose higher fee.",

I create a transaction sending UTXO A to a third party to pay for some goods or services. I later want to bump the fee on this transaction, but I don't want the third party to receive any less. So my wallet can create a new transaction which includes UTXO B alongside UTXO A, pays a higher fee, and then sends the rest to a change address.Now let's say I also have a completely separate wallet which contains UTXO C on Address C. I could also manually create a transaction which includes UTXO A and UTXO C, sends the same amount of coins to the third party, and pays a higher fee. All I need to do then is sign it separately with the first wallet and then with the second wallet, and then broadcast it.The network, and the RBF mechanism, have no concept of which addresses are in the same wallet and which are in different wallets. You can combine any UTXOs from any wallets in the same transaction.",
