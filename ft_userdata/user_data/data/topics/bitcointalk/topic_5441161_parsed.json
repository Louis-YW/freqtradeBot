Opening an account at a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Kraken (or, until recently, FTX) is the easiest and most common way to get into crypto. And it’s safe to bet most people are playing the speculation game, trading crypto on an exchange instead of transacting directly with another person as bitcoin was intended.",

Another black lives matter article?  When I started to read it I was saying \"another bullshit from socialists!\"See the arguments used: - 2 events that happened 100 and 200 years ago! Come on...- People unbanked are mostly black people in The US. This is not true and they give the proof themselves.Notice it depends on the actual income and not on the race. If you're poor, you have more chances to be unbanked, no matter what your race is.Percentage on unbanked people by income and race:QuoteFor example, Know Your Customer laws can keep someone with a certain last name from being able to register for an account, she saidThat a direct lie. Do you think black guys like snoop dog or puff daddy are unbanked? No of course and again that's because they have enough income. I take the extreme but that's to show my point.Here is wy people are unbanked thereWhy are people unbanked? According to the FDIC Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, people are unbanked because they can't meet minimum balance requirements, lack of trust in banks, have privacy concerns or don't want to pay high banking fees.And who was quoted in the article? Lamar Wilson, founder of crypto-focused network Black Bitcoin Billionairelol? I'm going to make the network White Bitcoin Billlionaire, only for white people. I'm sure I will be called racist there And debunking a myth:The first slavers were the blacks and the Arabs, 200 years before the whites. That's the whites who stopped slavery",

And so it is for all communities, no matter the color, religion and whatever stupid and outdated classifications they might use. Ah, and it helps everybody, no matter they have a bank account or not.And bitcoin offers that same opportunity also for those from outside USA, which seems also somewhat... overlooked.Quote from: LeGaulois on February 28, 2023, 01:42:41 PMThe first slavers were the blacks and the Arabs, 200 years before the whites. That's the whites who stopped slaveryIndeed, slavery was there for long. Wars between villages, castles, cities, whatever, sooner or later led to slaves.It doesn't have to be done by bringing people with ships across the ocean to still be slavery.",

Or are you just blindly perpetuating the \"much systemic racism everywhere\" lie?If I had to guess, banks would love black customers, as I imagine, on average, they're more likely to spend beyond their means, go into debt and pay interest and fees.Quote from: NotATether on February 28, 2023, 08:08:34 AMThey probably already do recognize that, but everyone wants to talk about racism nowadays... Yup, because it pays them. What are you gaining from being \"color-blind\"?Quote from: LeGaulois on February 28, 2023, 01:42:41 PM- People unbanked are mostly black people in The US.

If you're poor, you have more chances to be unbanked, no matter what your race is.Yes, the income is the most important factor, but looking at the \"all income\" stats, it shows disproportion by race as well. The question is why? Do they not have access to banking services? I doubt it.",

You wrote nothing wrong and yet you instantly felt like you need to go into defensive mode and explain yourself to not be accused of racism. Even despite being on an anonymous forum. That's power.",
