      "body": "Stable coins will be de-pegged if assets they use to back their stable coins have troubles.Troubles can be from their bad algorithm like Terra algorithm for their algorithmic stable coin UST.Troubles can be from their shady finance management for their treasury to back their stable coins but unfortunately their shady treasury management is detected and leaked like FTX case that cause their token FTT went to the hell. That token is not a stable coin but it's good to use as an example.Troubles can be from banks like bank bankruptcies",

      "body": "I did not imagine that this would happen in a day, but unfortunately it did.The only drawback of Dai is its heavy reliance on USDC, which affected its stability, Lets hope they have enough Liquidity to cover the state of panic that may occur, especially if the disengagement continues for more than one day.As for the cause of USDC de-pegged, it is central, and it seems that exposure to SVB was great.",
