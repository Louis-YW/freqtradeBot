You can recover your wallet with the private keys.Now, the first thing you have to do before you finish creating your wallet is to get papers and backup your seed phrase in two or three different locations. If you think your seed phrase is not safe, you can use passphrase to extend the seed phrase and have the backup in separate locations as well.Quote from: FiveG on July 12, 2023, 08:09:22 AMDo you think another person have access to it?It depends, but I think no because you will likely password your phone and the person that have saw your phone and stole it will only care about selling or using the phone after he formatted it already.",

So imagine you bought at 3$ you will have 200 btc then. Although I wouldn’t say it was careless but that was till a huge amount spent by you when bitcoin was still in the early days. And for you to turn your eyes off it was just something I can’t believe. Base on the current price you will have $6million which is big but it is what is now. QuoteDo you think another person have access to it?That depends on how you created your wallet then, because I am not sure there was something like seed phrase then. The only thing I read was available was paper wallet which comprises private key and address so the best thing is where to find the address. If that your friend has access to it probably you shared the key with him but if not then nobody will have access to it",

Ops need to come up with a more clear statement unless he is just dealing with and living in an imaginary world,  and even at that,  the reality is that he will have to know that only the private keys to the wallet prove ownership of the funds in it.",

Your friend that introduced you to bitcoin did not give you all the information you need to keep your bitcoin safe. And you were also ignorant because you would have carried out your research before investing such a high amount. As others have indicated, you have to back up your seed phrase immediately after you create a wallet.

Op from what you said and the currency sign you used in the story/post, you are a core Nigerian and since you are a Nigeria and which I also grow up from there your story is fabricated because as of then, people who new cryptocurrency which is bitcoin were numbered that is they were few. Bitcoin was 3 years old in the ecosystem, so as of then it was only the name was heard very minimal in the country, though one to 3 persons had used it. And People fully participate on cryptocurrency in Nigeria from the year 2013, in 2015 to 2019 Seminars of cryptocurrencies were everywhere in the country. So for you saying, you gave your friend #100k as of then for cryptocurrency investment is a lie. Okay to clear our doubts, if you invest N100k in 2011 I believed in this year you are among the lucky ones in Nigeria. Can you prove me wrong? If you are not lieing.",

Is anyone able to access your wallet? if you keep everything on your smartphone it is certain that someone can access it if he knows about Bitcoin and again in that year Bitcoin was not as popular as it is today where you can find a lot of information so people will know how valuable the coin is, and I feel you are just telling lies.",

Many cases are like this with the pretext that is not much different. But can it come back again? Since you don't have the phrase seed there is no way to access it. There's nothing you need to do today except to be a reflection so that in the future you always think that what is currently worthless can change everything in the future. Depends on the type itself. Because it's about Bitcoin that there's only one complete control, and when that control is lost it's all regret. Indirectly Bitcoin has taught you to always be careful, and respect the slightest ownership.",
