Another alternative site that is good for journaling and you don't have to pay for the subscription fee. I have been using these for years now and lot of traders used this site.Here is the link: www.notion.soJournaling is not only for beginners and non-profitable traders, even profitable traders can do journal because not all of their trades will materialized, aside from that, the market will not always follow what you've backtested. That's why for me journaling is necessary to determine your mistakes and what you have to change in the next trade.",

And please don't mind if I misinterpret the whole thing.Well, it might be possible that you have shared the link as a reference for our better understandability. Well coming back to the main query does it help us in crypto trading? I don't think the platform that you have mentioned would help you to journal in crypto trading but many other tools can be used to journal the crypto trades.And yes, it would be of great value, just like it is valued for forex trading, it will be valued for crypto trading too. You must know that trading based on analysis either forex or crypto, no doubt both have differences but no doubt they have similarities also.",

The value we need is here, between ourselves and hold good chances of winning. There's definitely no how to hold solid information other than getting it from the scratch surfaces of the market. Crypto trading is for everyone as long as we're able to understand and execute our plans for the system. You're totally on your own because we classified as newbies are yet to obtain such crucial important information, we're just in the system to ensure we're able to grab golden opportunities and earn steady flow of the system.",

Even me, I think it was, because it allows us to see our performance and we will be aware if what areas needs improvement. BTW, have you tried doing it before, for you to say that it's not beneficial? Maybe you did something wrong, though you can always try again. But before that, you can also look how others did it successfully.You can get an idea from them. All of us wants a great return on their trades but it's just that it won't easily happen. The risk is also big. Maybe when we master things, the risk will also lessen, but I'm sure we will find a way to elevate it again, in hopes of earning more profits. That's us people, we can't easily have a contentment.",

The trading journal will also be useful to support trade management to be more well organized and the strategies applied are in accordance with the journal that has been created.It's not too difficult to keep a journal, in fact I can also create it in Microsoft Excel and record some trades made every time an order is completed.",

I also like the gamefication of the emotion meters, sticking to strategy etc. They also did add some of the popular cryptos back.Anyways, ill be off until after New Years.

But I don't think all traders are like that; some of them are like that.So next time, don't be fooled by those types of forex on social media; you won't get any luck there; maybe they will be the luckiest for you because of the lack of knowledge in this type of trading.",
