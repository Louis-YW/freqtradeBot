Dubbed Trojan.Clipper.231, this trojan app substitutes crypto wallet addresses in the clipboard with addresses provided by attackers. As of this moment, malicious actors have managed to steal cryptocurrency in an amount equivalent to about $19,000 US.At the end of May 2023, a customer contacted Doctor Web with their suspicion that their Windows 10 computer was infected.

Good thing I was not hodling any sorts of crypto during those days, as I did not really care on how malicious would using those builds be.Now that Windows 10 is free to download officially from Microsoft assuming you don't really care that much in personalization stuffs. Otherwise I would just use Linux in that case already lol.Quote from: Peanutswar on June 16, 2023, 02:28:22 PMReason why the software developers create free software for everyone is not all about the freedom of having free software applications but the exchange of this is having possible malicious malware injected in the downloading of software, it could possible that there's possible suspected viruses can be detected if you are using a legitimate security defender.

Noting how cryptocurrencies user became more diverse, it is necessary to take extra precautions about the operating system or device that anyone uses to manage their own cryptocurrency.Also, Pirating software requires laborious work, time, and energy. Are we sure that they cracked the software specifically for ideological purposes, or for their own benefit just like in this kind of case? Seems it is unlikely if they are doing it freely and voluntarily.",

I was never even aware of how harmful and dangerous it was for one to get any form of software from roadside sellers because the risk was even higher than the money the person could have actually paid to get the original. Until I saw a few clipboard virus threads on this forum and the possible reasons for how those actually happened,And this form of crypto-stealing malware might also be inbuilt in some other popularly used window and app apps out there; one just needs to be careful about the kind of things they install on their PC, especially when those PCs are to be used for crypto-related transactions.This crypto-installed virus on the PC is popular these days because people are noticing it. Who knows what else other hackers might have installed on some pirated software out there and what data they might be stealing from our computers without our knowledge?",

As for Windows, the last time I was installing it I was seriously considering buying a license, but then I found a loophole for downloading Windows installation from Microsoft and activating it without cracking, and it works to this day without problem.

Certainly, I hadn't ruled out the likelihood of a copy not being 100% free of viruses and malware, but I'd never have thought that it could potentially come with malware aimed at stealing wallet details; I never thought that I could possibly lose my Bitcoin that way. Nowadays, it's almost inevitable to diminish these kinds of threats; you'll have to practically avoid anything suspicious, and sometimes it's not always possible. Eventually, you might be caught in a similar trap and end up losing your hard-earned coins.It's advisable for anyone who's using a pirated Windows edition to check if the downloaded torrent is any of these mentioned in the article and proceed with a full fresh install immediately.",

I do not think that here, on the forum, this will be news to anyone. It has always been, If you want something for free, you must donate something in return.Moreover, the Windows system itself is a \"sieve\" that passes viruses everywhere, and if you use a system to which other people's hands are attached, it is easier for you to simply send your funds to a hacker.It will sound trite, but the call not to trust Windows has been very relevant for several years, despite all the efforts of Microsoft.",
