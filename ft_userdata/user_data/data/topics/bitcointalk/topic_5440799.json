(due to raspberry prices, It seems cheaper to just buy a laptop and install Umbrel on it)4-Is it safe to use a third party software to connect my trezor or a ledger to my bitcoin node?5- I noticed that Ledger allows you to connect to your own node, is that a good option instead of using a third party software to connect it?Thank you in advanced!",

If you want to use it and have your own wallet, it is also possible. Quote from: jimmyk1 on February 22, 2023, 07:53:24 AM3-Does it matters if I keep my node running on a laptop vs raspberri pi? (due to raspberry prices, It seems cheaper to just buy a laptop and install Umbrel on it)Raspberry Pi is cheaper and also consume less electricity, unless you have an old laptop that you can use instead.If I want to run a node, I will prefer using Bitcoin Core.Running A Full Node, Bitcoin Corehttps://blog.trezor.io/connecting-your-wallet-to-a-full-node-edf56693b545Running a bitcoin full nodeHow to run your own Electrum server: Install GuideRaspiBoltRaspiBlitz - DIY Bitcoin & Lightning Node on a RaspberryPi",

(due to raspberry prices, It seems cheaper to just buy a laptop and install Umbrel on it)Running your node on RaspberryPi is cheaper and it spends much less electricity, but if you already have old laptop with Linux OS that will work perfectly.I don't remember how Umbrel works exactly, so you need to check documentation for setup instreuctions.Quote from: jimmyk1 on February 22, 2023, 07:53:24 AM4-Is it safe to use a third party software to connect my trezor or a ledger to my bitcoin node?It's safe if they are open source wallets like Electrum or Sparrow wallet, but I wouldn't connect anything suspicious.Quote from: jimmyk1 on February 22, 2023, 07:53:24 AM5- I noticed that Ledger allows you to connect to your own node, is that a good option instead of using a third party software to connect it?If you can better use other open source wallet with Ledger, because their ledger live app is one of the worst craps I ever saw.",

Each nodes increases the strength of the network but it is not a requirement or expected. I think it is better to understand the basics of btc before deploying a node. Keep your btc in your hardware wallet because that is the most secure way of storing btc. A hardware wallet is not a node and cannot run a node.

(due to raspberry prices, It seems cheaper to just buy a laptop and install Umbrel on it)It will only matter during the initial block sync because the data write speed might be limited on your raspberry pi depending on what you use for storage. When the initial block sync has completed you should not run into any performance issues because the node writes to the disk at a gradual speed when it has caught up.",

There are plenty of personal reasons you might want to run a node, from the security it brings by allowing you to independently verify the blockchain, to the privacy it brings by not having to connect your light wallet to a third party node or server. It is perfectly reasonable to run a node only during the day, or even just for a few hours at a time when you need it. You'll just have to wait for it to catch up with all the blocks it missed while it was offline.",

That's possible as of Core 22.0.",

The reason for running the node all the time is that if you don't then you will want to wait for it to sync before using the wallet, and that could take a while.",
