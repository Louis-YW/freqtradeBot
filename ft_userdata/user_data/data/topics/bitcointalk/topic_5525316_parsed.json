      "body": "You already listed one of the best strategies used in Bitcoin trading. Buying the dips and hodl, where you buy low and sell high. The only challenge in this method is that most times you might sell off too early and the market continues in buy direction. It's a general cryptocurrency strategy and is usually very profitable for long-term holders. Another best strategy used in Bitcoin trading is dollar cost averaging. This method, you set a particular amount of Bitcoin that you wish to accumulate for a long time. You don't need to wait for a dip to come before you acquire Bitcoin, you just continue to buy that same amount you have decided to buy, it might be monthly or weekly or any that suits you. This way, you won't be left behind on potential profits when the market decides to buy or sell as these movements are unpredictable and it won't much be your concern.",

If it were that simple, the market wouldn’t be called unpredictable.From what I’ve read in many posts here, investors often recommend the DCA method as the best way to accumulate Bitcoin. It’s a consistent strategy that could lead to possible future profits without relying on perfect timing.",

This you said is just trading except you really good at it I would advice against it. The strategy you trying to implement is one that breeds nocoiners.Like Hatchy said, You can employ DCA and focus on a longer term of accumulation. Trading mindset at such leads to losses because you may tend to sell when it dips than your dip Or buy expensive when it rise than your sell.",

How can one make sure he does not lose it.What if 4 years cycle is not here this time.What approach one should get here.ThanksBuying at every dip and selling on every pump is called Bitcoin trading. If your intention is to buy and sell Bitcoin within a short period, then you have to always monitor the market and take position. In trading, there is no guarantee that you will not lose since the price of Bitcoin is unpredictable. But if your intention is to buy and keep it for a long time before selling, that's hodling. It will be less risky and more profitable to keep buying Bitcoin in bits and keeping it till the next bull run. The four year circle will always be here since we will always have Bitcoin halving after four years until the total Bitcoin is mined.",

This is because you will not benefit from the compounding effect of bitcoin overtime. Another thing is that you will not be able to have a good amount of bitcoin in future when the price will be very expensive, because you are after buying and selling for small dollar profit in every circle. Don't be a low coiner in future and regret your actions. Bitcoin is the future game changer.",

About selling strategy or taking profit strategy, it relates to your approach like a long term investment or only short term speculation. With different approaches for entries, you will have different exit strategies.If you are going long term with Bitcoin, consider this strategy for your Bitcoin withdrawal.[ANN] JJG Sustainable Bitcoin Withdrawal Strategyhttps://bitcoindata.science/withdrawal-strategy",

I want to sell at every pump and buy on every dump. How can one make sure he does not lose it.theoretically and considering the ideal way most persons look at selling of one's bitcoin, the plan is always to buy low and sell high and practically if you can just buy low and comfortably sell high, that definitely is the best strategy one can adopt but when you consider that you are dealing with a volatile asset like bitcoin that can be really unpredictable, buying low and selling high isn't always as feasible as it looks.the strategy that works really well regardless of the rate of volatility of bitcoin is buying for the long term and leave it without rushing to sell when you are in slight profit. bitcoin rate of volatility is not always too fast and so it might take a very long time before a bitcoin investment of say an $100 can do a three times profit over the short term. you just have to position your mind in such a way that you are sure that you are not investing to take profit for the short term and that will help you stay patient enough to remain invested for the long term. doing long term investment will also demand that you make use of the DCA method since you would want to get enough bitcoin stack that will place you at a good profit when the market gets a bit favorable for you.there are a lot of proven strategy that works for different people based on how efficient you are able to implement it and how adaptive you can be based on the different market condition but at the end, you have to do what works for you and see that you are not losing in your investment.",

How can one make sure he does not lose it.Your account is from 2017 and you're asking about this now?! I find this somewhat strange, however, I will answer, although I'd expect you know all this:You need proper trading experience for this, you need to know how to properly set up stop loss, you need to know how big pumps and how big dumps to take into account for your steps.If this would be an easy thing with clear rules, nobody would lose in trading - no matter it's crypto, or stocks, or forex. But there are no clear rules.This being said you can learn about trading or you can choose the safe strategy: HODL. Or you can choose something in the middle: use only the 4 years cycle, DCA/buy in crypto winter and sell in bull run. But since you are questioning the 4 years cycle, I guess that this will not work, especially as your account has - in theory - witnessed 2 cycles already.",

But that will not easy because you need to have skills to analyze the price movements. But you can use DCA methods that you can apply for anytime so you can buy Bitcoin constantly until the time to stop is end.We don't know if 4 years cycle will be there or not in the future. We can only try to accumulate more and more Bitcoin using DCA method. But if you are still worry if 4 years not there anymore, you can use buy low and sell high as I said.

It's true, but if you don't target too high exit price, you will have good chance enough to take profit.Generally, DCA is a good strategy and it's more helpful for long term investors who are less affected by short term price changes, in either bull or bear market. DCA strategy can help long term investors to average their entry price, and it gets benefit from long term bullish trend of Bitcoin.https://charts.bitbo.io/yearly-candles/",

Joke aside, forget about this \"buy low sell high\" thing because in the vast majority of cases you will end up doing the opposite, resulting in you having less bitcoin than you initially had. This is exactly what I keep telling most people about buying low and selling high, for me there is never a perfect price for any of this, imagining someone who sold at $100k would have thought that’s the best price for last year but bitcoin still pumped above it. Or someone who didn’t but at $92k because they think the correction will take the price below $90k mark thereby missing a great opportunity to buy. Just have a realistic price target for buying and selling and make sure you hodl on for long because even this price target do take longer to trigger. For total newbies the safest option is DCA whenever you have funds, hodl for very long time, take profits when you see them and wish to take, avoid setting unrealistic price targets like bitcoin doing a 10x in one bull run",

Before you can start making profit from Bitcoin daily price movement, you actually need to have a good knowledge about trading, that's when you can understand how the market is moving. I believe the 4 years circle you are talking about is the halving period which usually give rise to the bull season, there's no way the circle will not repeat. We still have more halving to happen. So, if you are holding, you will still make profit.",
