  "content": "This is an experiment to see if hardware wallet manufacturers and their 3rd-party newsletter partners will leak customer’s email data. It will be a long-term experiment that began a few days ago. I want to see how safe my email information is with some of the most popular hardware wallet vendors. We all remember the data leaks of Ledger and Trezor. Still, there are also suspicions that popular brands could be sharing or selling data to their 3rd-party partners.To check that, I have done the following things:•   I have created brand-new email addresses for each hardware wallet manufacturer. •   Each email was used to subscribe to that brand’s newsletter (if there is one) and to contact the support team with a random question.•   I will keep checking the accounts in the following months to see if any spam or 3rd-party emails were received.Since the email accounts have not and will not be used for anything else, any spam, promotions, or offers I get can only result from the company’s misuse of my data. The goal is to see how safe it is to provide hardware wallet developers with sensitive information and how much of it (if any) will find its way to other places.The following hardware wallet brands are being tested:•   BitBox•   Blockstream Jade•   ColdCard•   Foundation•   KeepKey•   Keystone•   Ledger•   OneKey•   SafePal•   Satochip•   TrezorI will try to update this thread with the latest information after 1, 3, and 6 months of waiting. After that, the experiment ends. What do you think? Will I get any spam emails, and who is the likely culprit causing it? Many email providers delete messages classified as spam that end up in spam folders after 10 or 30 days, for example, so I will try to log in to the various places to check if there is anything new there.",

When something like that happens, no one will remember the incident as the time when <insert the manager's name here> leaked thousands of email addresses amongst other BitMex users. It will forever be remembered as the case when BitMex messed up and caused a severe data leak that affected most of their userbase.",

Interesting feedback. I hadn't thought about that nor do I know much about it. I used 7 different email providers. All of them are free (obviously), so I did spread it around randomly. That could somewhat affect the results, but like you said, if I get spam, I can always try with a different email provider. But If I don't get spam the second time, that can also be for different reasons. Maybe there was a leak and they fixed it in the meantime, or the second provider just has better anti-spam settings that prevented the spam from reaching me, right? When it comes to the length of the email addresses, without revealing too much, they are all 9 characters+ (not counting the @ and domain name). The shortest one is 9 characters.Quote from: DaveF on November 12, 2022, 06:47:22 PMI am really aggressive with my settings you get 5 chances to send to dave@------.com per IP in 1 hour, go over that you are banned for 30 days.

I like Tutanota as well. It might seem a bit confusing to newbies in the beginning since they encrypt the emails you send and you have to password-protect them. I haven't checked to see if that feature can be turned off in the settings. Anyways, if you are sending an email to someone via Tutanota, you also need a way to inform the other party about the decryption password, otherwise they won't be able to open and read the message. Let's just say that Tutanota may or may not be part of this experiment. I leave it to everyone's imagination.",

Based on my experience, Proton is one of them. Some reports claim that their filter is not the best though, so that's that.
