  "content": "i have heard several persons who say they are nervous about how the go about their private key, while this set of folks use single-key addresses to get their own self-custody to store family coin or personal coin in a form of UXTOs, they intend investing for their future generations and keep their coins out of centralizations . Most times the biggest fear that comes with this single signature solution is the inability to retrieve your funds if the  private key got misplaced or in situation of death when no one else know about your private key.With multi-sig wallets created a year after multi signature was introduced in bitcoin in 2012. A powerful tool such as multi-signature brought extra security for bitcoin investors with more than one signature which could be two or more signature attached to an address, which will require funds to be spent only if multiple signatures are provided a very good tool for long term investment and access to funds in cases where on dies because since more than one signature exist it will be more easy to relay detail of the other signature to a trusted family member.With multi-sig address comes different private-keys to help safe-guard funds so that even if one of the keys get stolen it will be difficult to withdraw or move the coin since it takes 2 of the 3 signatures in a 2 of 3multi sig address to move the coin and only one is available. Multi sig is also good for businesses as well as co-operations, unions and organizations to ensure security and good decision making where by a number of persons hold each a single key making mismanagement of funds even more difficult.Although with this comes some difficult and complex set-up especially if a third-party provider is needed but in general it is a cool and secure wallet because there is no legal custodian of funds deposited into a shared wallet with multiple keyholders.example of multi-sig wallet:Blue walletsparrowhow to set-up the wallets loading.........",

Or simply hit you with a wrench until you crack and reveal the location of your other back ups, or phone up your other family members and have them hand over their shares, or unlock the multiple devices/wallets you have to spend your multi-sig coins, etc.Multi-sig or no multi-sig, either you hand over your coins or you die. The only protection against physical attacks on your person is plausible deniability.By creating a multi-sig wallet and handing out shares, you are advertising the very existence of that wallet. If you are this concerned about physical attacks, then you need a hidden wallet that nobody knows about, probably created by utilizing a passphrase on top of an existing wallet's seed phrase.",

Marriage is not business. Or it should not be Multisig in business? Yes, it can be!

And if you fear someone harming you cause you own bitcoins, actually announcing you do, by giving out a signature while holding onto one, would expose you to that very risk.Keeping your wallet private in that case, is your best option.

In as much as i trust my family member i think securing both my future and theirs should also be consideredi know you might he hypothesising.. but if YOU right now have a family member that wants you dead. then simply kick them out the house and dont tell them anything about your bitcoin security. tell only the good people in your life. multisig does allow you to have 1 key put into a will family cant have access to until death. whilst also meaning the lawyer cant just randomly sneak a peak at your will and steal from you either because it requires all keys to come together at same time to work. it also presents itself with more complications of having to learn more about bitcoin to be able to join the keys together to spend it, compared to just telling them your 12 word seed where 6 are stored in will and 6 are told to family. thus another way of splitting the data to give preservation of data when both are not provided at same time(only provided at death)",
