  "content": "If you use Paypal and can receive payments and pay me in crypto, I have a deal for you.I have a writing deal with a client who can only pay with Paypal. In fact, I've missed many such deals in the past, but I want to start getting all the clients I can possibly get. Here's the deal: if your country supports PayPal, you'll partner with me to receive the payments.These are strictly clients who want to advertise on my website and those I write for. When you get paid, you pay me in BTC or USDT. Let's say I get 90% and you get 10%. Some of these will be quite regular, so it can add up. Payments typically range from $50 - $400.I'll need the payment made the same day that the client paid to consider you dependable, so we can have a long-term partnership.If this is something you can do, contact me on Telegram at @Cyberczar, stating your Bitcointalk username.",

Also in upwork after a certain amount the fees drop for 5% so you can use it better than fiver also you can create payoneer account and send your client invoices that he can pay through the card associated to the PayPal and fees as I remember are dirt low.",

I think the issues you raised of verification and taxation are secondary when it comes to the actual person behind the one proposing the so-called service in the first place.Quote from: Lucius on July 13, 2023, 02:18:34 PMMaybe we forgot something in this whole story, which is that OP gets BTC or some altcoin, and whoever receives payments to his PP must take into account that he can at any time be asked by PP to prove the legitimacy of the money and additional verification. There is also the question of paying taxes, because regardless of the fact that it is a US-based service, other countries can ask for (and get) data about their citizens who use this service.All that for 10% or maybe 15% doesn't seem attractive to me at all.",
