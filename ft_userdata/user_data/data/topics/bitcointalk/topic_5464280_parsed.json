American youth are getting too overweight to serve in the military and that's reducing the pool of qualified candidates. You might imagine what happens to a country once their armed forces become too fat to serve.",

A large army has a place for nearly anyone and probably you do not want the guys to be very smart in the first place - they might start noticing that they are risking their lives for a meagre pay, a distinct possibility of professional progress, and to the service of fat cats that drive the politics and the use of military forces from the comfort of their mansions by the beach.",

This might be attributed to more attention to social media, computer games, and other social activities by the youths. Most examinations like the SAT and ACT examinations allow the use of calculators because of the poor performance of students. The military is supposed to be made up of the best students with the ability to solve diverse mathematical problems without aid because they work in very uncomfortable conditions. They are expected to possess fast problem-solving skills which is why they need to be tested without a mathematical aid. If the shortage of military personnel persists we might be forced to remove any form of intellectual examination.",

I don't think there are studies supporting that theory and surely there already would be. I personally can't see them affecting to scores, in fact quite the opposite. People from my generation who played ended up coding and working in IT and some of them in field of mathematics and have PHDs. One person that i know wouldn't stop playing if it would be up to him, and he is genius when it comes to mathematics. He doesn't use social media though.",

Some worry that this move might be seen as lowering standards.The biggest requirement to be a part of the military like the army particularly in where I am from is high morale. They understand that some of the people who are natural aggressive and have high morale are not always very intelligent and have not been able to fit into anywhere in the society, so the army is the last place for them to at least make them useful and not criminals. They should have allowed the use of calculators long ago, too much of educational intelligence is not needed to be in the military, the person can do well if they can read and write, smart and has a good ability to understand. Those qualities are okay.",
