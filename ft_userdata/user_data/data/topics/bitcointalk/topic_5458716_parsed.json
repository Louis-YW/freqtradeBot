You will never be able to convert an SHA256d ASIC to a Scrypt ASIC. The chips are not the same.About your question on the firmware, why not using Bitmain's official firmware ? Otherwise, as you mentioned it, BraiinOS is plug and play. If you have an issue with BraiinOS, you can go on their official topic and ask for some help.QuoteOh what am i going to do with this unit now ! It depends. If you have cheap electricity, why not joining a pool and mine BTC ?If you have almost-free electricity, you can use it as a lottery ticket and solo mine BTC on ckpool / kano pool.If you aren't profitable, if your electricity is expensive, you should maybe turn it off.",
