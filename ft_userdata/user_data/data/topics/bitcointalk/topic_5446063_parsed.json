I want to say give winning bet suggestions but I think that won't count because it won't promote certainty and also that is not a problem in the first place. Most of the problems in this industry are; scam platforms, delay with deposits and withdrawal, lags, accessibility, and the likes. I won't include addiction and risk because that is something which would revolve around the player himself. Above mentioned problems, biggest one an AI project could solve is regarding credibility because it is something which could be stored as a data for a software.",

So as of now it can be used to assist but it shouldn't be given the authority of making any decisions so the human can cross check and make final decisions.",

Well, I did it on their platform and you can check the response of the AI below, these answers are really worth noting but for the meantime I wouldn't rely on AI for anything even on gambling, it's still on early stages.QuoteAI solutions for gambling.What problems could AI solve on gambling AI can potentially solve several problems related to gambling. Some examples include:1. Detecting and preventing fraud: AI can analyze large volumes of data to identify patterns and anomalies that indicate fraudulent activity, such as collusion or money laundering. By detecting these behaviors early, AI can help prevent fraudulent activity and protect the integrity of gambling operations.2. Identifying problem gamblers: AI can analyze player data to identify those who may be at risk of developing a gambling addiction. This can help operators intervene early and offer resources to prevent problem gambling from becoming more severe.3. Improving game fairness: AI can help ensure that games are fair by analyzing outcomes and detecting any biases or abnormalities in the results. This can help prevent cheating and improve overall trust in the gambling industry.4. Enhancing player experience: AI can be used to personalize the gambling experience for each player, by analyzing their preferences and behavior patterns to offer customized recommendations and bonuses.5. Optimizing game design: AI can help designers create more engaging and profitable games by analyzing player behavior and preferences, and suggesting changes to game mechanics or features based on that data.Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize the gambling industry by improving player safety, fairness, and experience, while also helping operators increase profitability and efficiency.",

I do believe that the integration of AI technology can further strengthen the security features of a gambling website. But there are still some instances where a manual checking with a representative is to be preferred. Relying completely on AI can have its certain drawbacks in which a normal operation of a person handling the business is still superior.Personally, I would vote that AI be integrated but not on all processes. The technology of AI is still yet to be perfected as of the moment and this can at least apply supplementary rather than mainly.",

Such data sets have to be available, of course, because AI technology can only provide answers to questions that were already covered somewhere. AI doesn't make things up. It just gives you the correct calculations based on the data it has.I am thinking of things like:1. Tell me the percentage and number of games that team A has conceded a goal with this exact defensive lineup?2. How often have this attacking pair scored one or more goals when they played together in the league this season?",

First thing about AI in casino industry is optimizing computational resources properly, this won't create new opportunities for players, but will improve stability of services. Back end developers actually need AI more than users. As for users, here, thats right, AI is useful in avoiding frauds and cheaters. Also AI would do much for marketing in casino: it can show correct development tactics, such as adding new leagues for players to gamble about, fix bet and withdrawal limits etc.",

As you can see even in the forum, accusations are always coming from the gamblers to the casinos, so if any problem will be fixed, it will be the side of the casinos and not the gamblers or the customers. If the casinos are well secured, fraudulent gamblers can't do anything to it. But the issue arises from the casinos end in which casinos refused to pay gamblers when win, and that is what 1Xbit and it Co's are doing. And I don't think artificial intelligence AI can fixed this issue because the issue is not a matter of hacking,  but a deliberate withheld of customers win funds by the casino company so I don't think AI can fix it. It is only an incorruptible court with good judgement can do that.",

Robots are man made  so therefore 100% correctness can never be guaranteed.

What AI can do best is two things. One is calculating odds and house edge if that's not clearly visible for the player. It can also predict the average outcome of the next 100 games in the given casino. This can be good for players, especially newbies and bad for casino owners as it puts all cards on the table, so to speak. The other thing is going through the internet to find all comments about the casino and its old exploits. If the casino was involved in scamming but made sure this doesn't come up in searches anymore, the AI can still find and validate it.",
