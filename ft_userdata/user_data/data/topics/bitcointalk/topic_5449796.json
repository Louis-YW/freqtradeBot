  "content": "In order to learn anything, we need the proper knowledge. In any situation, it is so important. And applying that knowledge in different situation and making wins and losses we gain experience. So in that process, can you only depend on one thing? It is important to gain knowledge to be able to get the best results in any situation. But can you be successful with only knowledge and not without having enough experience? Let me give you an example. So someone has browsed through the internet. He has gained a lot of knowledge on bitcoin. And there's this other person who have been on the platform for a long time. He has gained experience based on his own work. Now you want to learn the best. To whom do you go first? One with knowledge or one with experience? Me personally, I will choose the one with experience. Because knowledge can be gathered from many sources. But the true meaning of best learning method is found in the one with experience. Because he may know something that the internet won't know. It is the same as reading a book and memorizing it. But you can't be an expert unless you have tried in yourself. One more example that I want to say, which has happened to myself. I work the same thing others do. But when to teach that to a new guy, if they follow the basic learning knowledge. But when I teach them how to work, I showed them some shortcuts and way of doing things in a much faster and easier way. So in conclusion, if you are new and want to learn something about Bitcoin, ask the guy who has a lot of experience. Then it becomes knowledge to yourself. Then applying that knowledge and going through some trials and errors, you can gain the same experience. It is important to learn them both in my opinion. But you need to follow the path of what to do when. That way, I am sure success is guaranteed. Let me know your thoughts. Or share some of your own experience. _tjtonmoy",

That why when you go to any higher institution graduated with a good grade during seeking for employment you would be asked to show your work experience or if that company is that considerate they will train you to their satisfactions before finally allows you to work with them at point you are gaining experience.So, finally you can not work without experience and Knowledge despite any place you plan to source it from, the two must come together.",

Moreover, knowledge in the field of Bitcoin must be acquired, but in addition to acquiring knowledge in the field of Bitcoin trading, one must have a lot of experience in Bitcoin trading.",

      "body": "Just like what Upgrade00 said experience is lack the practical whereas knowledge is more or less theoretical. But both actually do work in line that it is quite hard to differentiate both. With experience one has almost entirely all the information regarding the particular thing but knowledge is limited to just what is stated in a book being read. If we look at the talk around how bitcoin increasing after every halving we could see that it is from past experience. Even books read are from experienced authors of that. Both goes in addy because the one who has experienced and seeks more knowledge about a thing gets to a higher level than one who sticks to just one of the two",

Some people learn more through experience but most of the time, textbook knowledge is less effective than with actual knowledge wherein an individual would be able to apply the things he learned; quite of a trial and error. Given that Bitcoin promotes no certainty and consistency, an investor should have both experience and knowledge. Would be more of a practical vs technical point of view. One good example I guess is with business in general; sure thing an  individual could read a lot of books but things work differently on the actual simply because there are many underlying factors affecting the outcome.",

If you want to learn, then learn from those who are knowledgeable, but when you are in practice then you can get guidance from those who are experienced. Both are important, of course true but the position of the two must be adjusted to what you want.",

Just take for example, how do you spot a project that is pump and dump?As you traverse the trading journey, you will gain tips and tricks that are not written on books.

From the experience I got, I also ended up having a lot of knowledge that would open my mind that both are indeed very important.

Experience, on the other hand, is equally important for me in learning bitcoin since those experiences teaches you various lessons that is useful too. Regardless if these experiences is positive or negative, we can have a good lesson with it that we can use the next time we deal with it. So, it is both important to have these both as I too agree that it is inseparable when you really want to learn objectively and learn through your experience which is a great combo to learn something.",

I believe that without knowledge you can't gain experience and without experience your knowledge can't be applied effectively. First, you should acquire sufficient knowledge and try to apply it to gain experience over time. I think without experience, achieving your goals may be really difficult and it would take a lot of times, since you need to back every time to the basis and try to learn from it. Obviously you need a strong foundation, which takes time to build, and then with experience, you'll learn a lot from both your mistakes and your successes.Quote from: tjtonmoy on April 22, 2023, 03:55:09 PMNow you want to learn the best. To whom do you go first? One with knowledge or one with experience? If you want to learn something, then it's best to go to someone with knowledge. However, if you want to apply and see things physically, then experience is the next step.For example, if you want to learn how to do crypto trading, you should first start by learning the basics of trading (there are many sources of information on the internet for this) so it's up to you how fast you would learn, after that you need to apply what you've learned to gain experience, especially learning from your mistakes and mastering the art of crypto trading.",
