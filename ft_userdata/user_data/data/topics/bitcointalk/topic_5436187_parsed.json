  "content": "QuoteCNN — The US hit the debt ceiling set by Congress on Thursday, forcing the Treasury Department to start taking extraordinary measures to keep the government paying its bills and escalating pressure on Capitol Hill to avoid a catastrophic default.The battle lines for the high-stakes fight have already been set. Hardline Republicans, who have enormous sway in the House because of the party’s slim majority, have demanded that lifting the borrowing cap be tied to spending reductions. The White House countered that it will not offer any concessions or negotiate on raising the debt ceiling. And with the solution to the debt ceiling drama squarely in lawmakers’ hands, fears are growing that the partisan brinksmanship could result in the nation defaulting on its debt for the first time ever – or coming dangerously close to doing so.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote a letter to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy Thursday, informing him that the nation’s outstanding debt is at its statutory limit of $31.4 trillion and that the agency will implement extraordinary measures so it doesn’t default on its debt, which would have enormous consequences on the US economy, global financial stability and many Americans. She said the measures would last through June 5.This buys Congress some time – but how long the extraordinary measures can last is subject to “considerable uncertainty,” she wrote, stressing that it’s a challenge to forecast how many financial obligations the federal government must pay and how much revenue it will take in months into the future.“I respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,” she wrote.The announcement follows the warning Yellen sent last week about the approaching debt limit and the temporary Band-aid of the extraordinary measures.But her missive has failed to spark bipartisan discussion so far. Instead, both Republicans and Democrats reaffirmed their rigid positions over the past week.National Economic Council Director Brian Deese on Thursday repeatedly called on Congress to meet the United States’ obligations by raising the debt limit, warning against “economic chaos” that could ensue should Congress fail to do so.“This is about economic stability versus economic chaos,” Deese told Kaitlan Collins on “CNN This Morning,” calling it Congress’ “basic, fundamental obligation.”He added, “Even just the specter that the United States might not honor its obligations does damage to the economy.”McCarthy must walk a fine line since any member can call for a motion to vacate the speaker’s chair, one of several concessions he made to gain the top post after 15 rounds of voting earlier this month.For now, he is leaning in on using the debt ceiling crisis to cut spending and balance the US budget. On Tuesday, McCarthy rejected Democratic calls for a clean debt ceiling increase without any conditions attached – something Congress has done time and again, including under then-President Donald Trump. The speaker told reporters on Capitol Hill that the Biden administration should begin to negotiate ahead of this summer, when the US could default.“Why wouldn’t we sit down and change this behavior so that we would put ourselves on a more fiscally strong position?” McCarthy said.President Joe Biden and McCarthy have not yet spoken Thursday about the debt limit, according to an official familiar with the dynamic.Hard-right GOP Rep. Andy Biggs went even further in a tweet on Tuesday, writing, “We cannot raise the debt ceiling. Democrats have carelessly spent our taxpayer money and devalued our currency. They’ve made their bed, so they must lie in it.”The White House on Wednesday blasted the Arizona Republican’s “stunning and unacceptable position” and once again rejected calls to reduce spending as part of a debt ceiling deal.While there were no meetings with congressional leadership to announce at this time, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the administration has been reaching out “to all members, from both sides of the aisle,” but, “there will not be any negotiations over the debt ceiling– we will not do that, it is their constitutional duty.”Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, sought to reassure Americans that an agreement eventually will be reached with the Biden administration. He stressed that the US must never default on its debt and never will.“No, I would not be concerned about a financial crisis,” he said at an event in Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday, noting that dealing with the borrowing cap is “always a rather contentious effort.”The debt ceiling, which is the maximum amount the federal government is able to borrow to finance obligations that lawmakers and presidents have already approved, was last raised in December 2021. Created more than a century ago, it has become a way for Congress to restrict the growth of borrowing – turning it into a political football in recent decades.Increasing the cap does not authorize new spending commitments.How Treasury will temporarily avoid a defaultTreasury will start using two extraordinary measures to allow it to temporarily continue financing the federal government’s operations, Yellen wrote on Thursday. They are mainly behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers.As part of the debt issuance suspension period, the agency will begin to sell existing investments and suspending reinvestments of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund. Also, it will suspend the reinvestment of a government securities fund of the Federal Employees Retirement System Thrift Savings Plan.These funds are invested in special-issue Treasury securities, which count against the debt limit. Treasury’s actions would reduce the amount of outstanding debt subject to the limit and temporarily allow it to continue paying the government’s bills on time and in full.No federal retirees or employees will be affected, and the funds will be made whole once the impasse ends, Yellen wrote.https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/19/politics/debt-ceiling-deadline-treasury/index.html....I feel like this should be making headlines as front page news. It will be awkward if the worst case scenario hits. With many complaining they didn't see the warning signs. And had no clue the united states being in danger of defaulting was an actual thing.I have seen many articles published like the above over the years. Being bad news they typically do not receive many views. Those who see the article typically deem it \"negative\" and \"depressing\" and work as hard as they can to forget they saw it. So that they can sleep easier at night, without having to worry as much about what tomorrow might bring.News like this is usually never shared on social media platforms or in regular conversations. Which makes it easy to live under a rock and remain clueless on what is happening in the world.All of these trends usually converge in something resembling a perfect storm to make it impossible for issues we face as a society to ever be prevented. While circumstances appear to have improved post 2020 pandemic, in terms of people being more proactive in keeping track of news cycles and current events which hold a large sway over their quality of life. I suspect most would still prefer to not know things like this are current issues. Believing they're better off not knowing. Rather than have warnings in advance which would allow them to take steps to more easily cope with these types of concerns.Its a strange thing and a strange world we live in.",

We went through the same thing a year ago in December 2021.  Raising the ceiling is always the first option, they can continue to do so until they can't. But then Yellen already has prepared behind-the-scenes accounting maneuvers, a temporary solution to avoid default or at least prolong the inevitable giving people time to prepare what's coming. If one will still pretends this news doesn't exist, its really going to end worse for you.Quote from: https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/19/politics/debt-ceiling-deadline-treasury/index.htmlAs part of the debt issuance suspension period, the agency will begin to sell existing investments and suspending reinvestments of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund.

The WH and Republicans in congress say they will make no concessions, but of course, they will eventually cave in as they always do. Republicans want the debt ceiling rise to be tied to spending reductions which is entirely reasonable. WH would rather continue their spending spree and make no efforts towards reducing spending.",

Going back to H.W. Bush Republicans have not focused on fiscal conservatism at all but if the economy is growing at a reasonable rate, then there's the prospect of creating debt and bank on future growth to pay it off. Bill Clinton was able to accomplish this, perhaps the last democrat to balance the budget, where he turned a budget surplus in the last few years of his presidency.The modern democratic party is on a spending spree with reliance on the central banks to do their dirty work for them. Fed hiking the interest rates after the post COVID spending spree in addition to the trillion dollar spending packages that were passed while democrats had congressional control.It makes perfect sense why the liberals would offer no concessions -- at least as U.S. politics is concerned, they've been ensconced in the social welfare state for quiet some time. And there are no consequences as long as you can keep printing money.",
