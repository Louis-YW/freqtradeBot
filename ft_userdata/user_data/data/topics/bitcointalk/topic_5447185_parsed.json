Has anyone here used PayPal to receive payments for their P2P offerings?Are there people who try and charge you back?How can you tell a Friends & Family payment from a Goods & Services one?Risk rate? Have you had your account closed?",

      "body": "Paypal is bit risky always. Because most people (Asia) open refund cases after deal was done. So if your using Paypal for Goods selling always remember to use good shipping service that provide you real tracking updates. If so you can avoid these refund cases. Also no one is dealing P2P in friends and family business. It's good option to be scam in minutes. Also whatever your doing remember Paypal will temporary suspend your account and ask docs. It's common thing in Paypal. So my advice is if you are looking to do bigger amount just consider crypto(USDT,BUSD,BTC). Because it's the safest way to protect your money. Because wallet will not ask tracking details or docs to release release your money. Until your keys are safe your money is always safe.",

Considering what you are trying to achieve I would probably still go with crypto.  I have recently opened an account using https://fxbox.io/ and invested a lot of money so far. Looks good and service itself is promising. You can buy all coins and even NFTs if I am not mistaken.",
