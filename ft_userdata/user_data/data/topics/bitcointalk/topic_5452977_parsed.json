  "content": "Hello everyoneMy friend and I have been actively trading futures for over a year, and we've had some good results. We believe we can help others navigate the crypto market with our expertise. However, we understand that trust is crucial, especially with so many scams out there.That's why we're hosting a special event from the 29th of May to the 4th of June, where we'll be sharing our signals for free! You can check them out, compare them with the market, and see the value we bring. We believe this showcase will help build trust in our abilities to assist you.Additionally, we're committed to creating a community dedicated to responsible crypto investing. We value integrity, respect, and supporting one another's success. If you're interested, here's the link to our Discord server: https://discord.gg/VF48njT5bHFeel free to reach out if you have any questions. We're here to help you succeed!Note: I am still in the process of setting up the discord server(channels, coding the bots, and writing rules and all ), so the server might look a little empty for nowÂ  ðŸ˜…",

      "body": "It's true that earning trust in the community is hard to make and that's why with this strategy of yours will get you people that are into signals and whenever see that it's for free, they'll come to you naturally. While many of us here do understand that we'll get nothing from those signals as they're mere predictions and analysis of another trader or insights that they've just read somewhere as per their source.But it's no doubt that making a community and growing it up with this setup could work for you.

By what you mentioned above itâ€™s clear that your front end and back end isnâ€™t ready to launch. That itself is path towards failure. Unfortunately we have hundreds of such channels telling their story and asking to join. In many instances when groups grow bigger they turn themselves into a pump and dump channel. It becomes place to work for owner where they tell everyone to buy X coin and everyone end up making the owner rich since they buy it before the pump. Thatâ€™s just one case scenario of making such channels. Better create it first, make sure everything works and looks fine in the end product. Once done maybe launch it with proper ANN.",

      "body": "I don't know about your signals and their accuracy but the thing is confirmed that crypto trading in the form of futures is the riskiest thing one can ever delve into without proper knowledge about trading, and giving trading signals that are of futures can turn into a disaster for the user if it doesn't work for them.There isn't a way to have a perfect signal in the world of crypto because news can impact the market far more than any other thing. If out of nowhere a news comes after you give the signal and the user purchased the coins according to the signal then they might be at risk of loosing a lot form the signal.If you really think that you're a good trader and you're providing good signals then you should share your signals here for free and also share your trading results so that people might be cautious before delving into your signals. Just share some of your previous trades with the signals and let the users know about your skills and if they find you reliable then you might get some users in your server.",

Ok, let me be completely blunt about this!You've earned money from your \"info\", you made profits and now you're willing to invest hours of time-consuming work, pay for resources and stuff, deal with others, customers, take payments all that.....for the love of the community? Yeah right!If you're still going to charge others for your \"info\" why not use that for yourself and make profit far easier and with fewer headaches?Quote from: kompozme on May 17, 2023, 04:10:06 AMStill, earning trust and building a community is going to be quite complexÂ  It is pretty simple, you just have to prove that your \"signals\" are not just pump and dumps schemes like the rest of the 100% services out there, where the actual users are just used to unload useless tokens on him. Just like the users above said, you want to earn trust and post a few of your signals here, but obviously before the pump or dump happens, and not 10k volume coins either, cause otherwise you will be just one of the rest and we already have way too many.",

I see no reason why you'd try to give signal services. Sharing educational materials as mentioned above is better. You can monetize the content as long as it is useful and unique compared to other educational resources out there. You can also build a bot like what Etherdrop did if you want better profit. I think that would be more appreciated compared to paid signal groups.Quote from: kompozme on May 17, 2023, 04:10:06 AMStill, earning trust and building a community is going to be quite complex ðŸ˜…, we are still thinking about how to do it the right way and be fair about it To be honest I'd avoid sharing signals altogether. Even if you can build some trust by sharing signals, it is very easy to get broken. One or two 'bad' signals can give affect your image. Having \"our signals are not always accurate\" won't help either since it doesn't make you more unique than dozens of signal groups out there.",

With small trading volume, sharing it will make some impacts on that coin price when more people amongst your signal receivers will buy and sell it.If you buy it previously before sharing the signal, you can enjoy new capital flow from signal receivers and you can have higher price to take profit. However, it will result in bigger selling pressure later.I guess signal providers usually buy ahead of signal receivers and it's no free lunch for receivers. The later they receive signals and enter market, the bigger risk from higher entry price for them.",

While I don't want to accuse OP to dump his bags on his channel members, it is hard to trust their free 'signals' are actually going to benefit others that much. I've seen many groups that start with free signals and even provide proof of some success from other users, but then people found out it was fake.

I do agree with this as a suggestion for other users who're interested in OP service though. It's better to not join any signal service since most of them (if not all) are unreliable.",
