Xenophyte is fully developed under theC# programming language. Xenophyte tools are not limitedto Windows systems, they can be ported to other systems such as Linux, Android and others byexternal and valid technologies such as Xamarin and Mono.Several points provide access to the network of the centralized Blockchain. Xenophyte aims to provethat mining can be protected in real time against ASIC's without going through a Soft/Hard Forkand without the need to submit any significant updates to users or to important network points ofthe cryptocurrency, such as Seed Nodes and Remote Nodes to keep them compatible with thenetwork.1. The purpose is also to propose the possibility to send transactions and received them in a fast wayby being only linked to the natural activity of the users on the sending of the transactions and notwith the mining operation. Also that it is possible to link each amount contained in a total walletbalance to an identification number of the mining block to ensure that the amount does exist and isnot duplicated.2. One of the main functions is also to give the total user balance linked to a bulk mining amount listwithout the need to synchronize all data of the Blockchain, while putting in provision the history tothe users, while encrypting the transactions carried out so that it is only read by the users concernedwith a specific transaction.3. As mentioned before, Xenophyte is a centralized cryptocurrency, so it is possible that maintenance isperformed and can thus temporarily block access to the Blockchain.To guarantee the security of the data, several backup systems have been set up, namely an internalcopying of the encrypted data over a regular interval, and a mirror system making it possible tocopy the data of the Blockchain in realtime set up on several servers.These maintenances are also intended to improve the Blockchain, and it can that if necessary aSoft/Hard Fork is set up for this purpose. Moving the Blockchain to more powerful servers canalso happen if necessary.This ANN can be updated anytime.Official website: https://xenophyte.com/Official github repositories: https://github.com/Xenophyte-coinOfficial Discord: https://discord.gg/mvc7v9FDyJOfficial Telegram: https://t.me/XENOPHYTECOINOfficial Twitter: https://twitter.com/XenophyteCoinAndroid Wallet: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xenophyte.android.walletSeguraChain: decentralized technology in development: https://github.com/SeguraChain/SeguraChain/News: https://xenophyte.com/news",

It is impossible to purchase half of the coin or spam small transactions resulting in congestion because each unit of currency stands out as a whole token. This feature is very unique and has thus far been unseen.",
