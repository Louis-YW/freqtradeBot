Â You can create collateralized lending with Bitcoin, but Bitcoin doesn't help with unsecured lending (which is what the credit system is designed to support).",

Bitcoin was not created to replicate the banking system, rather to attack it. You have credit systems available with fiat and also shitcoins.

It shouldn't feature imitation of decentralization, immutability, resemble Bitcoin etc. From what it sounds like, you are looking for free fintech software/code...like a banking app, except with its own native currency rather than money. No, there would not be any free, open source or secure fintech code. Usually this code is proprietary and private, and any open source code is just for example sake, or a starting point. It's not generally just ready to go out of the box.You would be better of trying to build what you are trying to do with web3 and a token, it would probably be easier and less costly, plus there would be a lot more open source code for you to use via smart contracts and from existing open source projects.",
