  "content": "If you're wondering, the Oasis Network, has a layer that kinda acts like rollups, allowing separate computing environment. They're seeking to add Move to their ParaTimes it seems. Move if you're out of the loop was the smart contract system built on Rust that Meta's abandoned Diem was gonna use. https://medium.com/oasis-protocol-project/oasis-seeks-builders-to-develop-a-move-paratime-909d307431e9TL;DR medium describes the utility of Move and how it uses linear logic to create a flexible and secure environment, and how the modular design of Oasis Network can easily implement it in its ParaTime layer should there be enough interest.",
