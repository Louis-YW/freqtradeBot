  "content": "Hello everyone, my question is quite simple. I have been slowly buying bitcoin for a few years (small amounts) and now I have enough to buy some ASICs. I always wanted to buy one but I'm pretty stingy and I don't like to spend money. But lately and researching the price of electricity in my country and the price of an antminer I decided to buy one. I found an antminer s9j on amazon for 260USD (shipping included) and an Antminer S19j for 2000USD. The truth is that both would end up paying off in approximately 1 year, so I don't really know which one to buy. What do you think would be best for someone new?I also found a used s15 on amazon but I don't know if I trust it much since it has 2.5 stars and finally the having is next year they think it will make it difficult for someone who does not have a mining farm \"in good condition\" (asic number and constant inconme of this)Thank you so much",

In addition to the electricity cost, power consumption, and noise mentioned above, you also need to pay attention to whether there are technicians nearby who can provide miner repair services. If you canâ€™t repair it yourself, and there is no local repair center, sending the machine to other regions for repair may be risky and expensive in case of failure.",
