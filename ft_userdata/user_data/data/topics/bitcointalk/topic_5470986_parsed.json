  "content": "Skill before or after university education will depend on some factors. The type of skill you want to learn (Online or Offline) and the level of financial support for your higher school education. It also depends on your region or country. In some countries students receive financial support from the government while in some countries, no government support. There's also a high level of unemployment even after university in some countries. In this case, your skill will save you because you can work independently.If you don't have reliable financial support but want to attend university, then learning the skill before university might be good for you so that you can support yourself financially when you finally gain admission into the university. But if it is an online skill, you can still learn while in university.I will use myself as a case study. I learned Diesel Injection Pump And Injection Nozzle maintenance (Offline Skill) before entering university for my higher education. Currently I'm already in my 3rd year in the university courtesy of the money I make from my acquired skill. Learning a skill is a good decision regardless.I work independently and still work for my boss (Trainer), especially during the holidays. My next skill will be in WEB3. You too can do it.",

Take you for instance, if you are from a low-income country where the government does not take care of its citizens, in terms of supporting students by giving them loans or providing free education, there is a need to acquire a skill before gaining admission, to work and study to earn with your skill in case you are training yourself, and if you are trained by your parents the money that they would give you is never gonna be enough to take care of yourself in school. Secondly, based on an increasing number of unemployed graduates and the unavailability of jobs in most countries, it makes perfect sense to grab a skill while you study and never wait to graduate, or else you too could find it difficult to get a job.",

Just select or define or where you are categorized there since for sure one of that options is applicable to you.Maybe for now select those option that can make you feel better since either any of it still good since you are open for your career growth so make sure that you can able to handle and make sure that you can finish then get a good degree so that you can make yourself more improve person.I know its hard sometimes to carry out the workload especially that you are working but if you are eager to get what you wanted for sure there's always a way with that.",

On-site jobs are probably one of the best experiences one should have, especially if they are a newbie; they'll learn a lot from them. T I just realized this recently when I got my first on-site job. Working closely with colleagues allows the individual to get new ideas from them, which, in turn, improves themselves and their career.For a career-driven student, this approach is seen as nice, although differing opinions may exist. It also makes the study a bit easier as they can apply what they learned from their work to their subjects, and vice versa, of course.If one cannot work while studying, then efforts should be made to upskill themselves, there are many opportunities available online, go into them!",

Yess, this is totally the right approach. To the newbies and university students, if you think you will learn new skills and look for a job after graduation, you will suffer greatly. What the OP did, everyone should do. The education process takes a long time to finish. So you shouldn't just rely on your degree. Instead, you should acquire new knowledge and skill sets. So when you finish your graduation, you can start working from the first day. I would advise you not to start working full time while you are still studying, but being a part timer is okay. It may be different depending on your country and financial condition",
