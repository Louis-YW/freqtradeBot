Decentralization does not involve holding multiple assets (mostly shitcoins) in a correlated market. A smart way to diversify is to pick the best of different industries and niches and buy in, this way you have assets which can have varying degrees of success across different times.I advice Bitcoin holders to experiment in other sectors, but I never advice them on altcoins or tokens to buy.",

Welcome to our forum.Yes, people definitely need to keep their money in their own wallets. \"Just because you can store your coins in a crypto exchange doesn't mean you should.\" It is easy to become comfortable with leaving all your coins on an exchange for trading purposes, but I beg you not to. And there are a number of reasons why you shouldn't. First and foremost, if the site gets hacked, you'll lose all your money. Second, if regulators decide to crack down on these exchanges for any reason (or for no reason at all), they could be shut down and you'd lose access to your money. And finally, if the exchange itself goes bankrupt or decides to shut down without any warning whatsoever, you'll be stuck with absolutely nothing.",

Lots of altcoins will definitely die during this current bear market, which people that invested in them will regret why they invested in altcoins, am sure some of them will lose interest in Cryptocurrency just because of the money they lose, but they don't know if you are planning to make a safe investments, then just invest in bitcoin, investing in altcoins is just like you are gambling which the chances is 50/50, either you win or you lose, but if you invest in bitcoin their is 100% assurance that you are going to win, just be prepared to hold for long term.Also if you are also holding your bitcoin, make sure you don't leave it on exchange, just buy on exchange and move to your non custodial wallet.

If you are a trader you don't have a choice but to leave some amount on exchange since it will cost you a lot of money if you keep depositing an amount if you want to trade on daily basis.But to avoid getting stressed with it and get worried about possible hackings or exchange scamming just make sure you left a small amount and also always practice to withdraw what you earn for the day so that you can make sure what ever happen to the exchange you already got your profits out there.",

However, this will also depend on each person's personality and emotional control. Sometimes, someone hopes too high and is not ready to take risks. One of them is when the market suddenly crashes because of certain FUD, and finally he is stressed because their Bitcoin portfolio has dropped dramatically. They think they have lost their money and panic because they hope to get rich quickly. Even though they won't lose their money as long as they still hold the Bitcoin and leave it until the price rises, especially in the bullish era.

It may also help to spread this very simple yet very important strategy to your fellow newbies in your local crypto community. If I may go a little further, though. It may actually not be enough that you HODL your Bitcoin out of centralized exchanges. Take it out from any custodial services, from any wallet where you don't solely control your private keys. Take it out from closed-source wallets as well. If possible, HODL them in a cold wallet. That's the safest option!",
