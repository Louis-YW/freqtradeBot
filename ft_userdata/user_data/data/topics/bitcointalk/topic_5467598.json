How Bitcoin can provide a Subscription Auto Renewal solution? If auto-renewal can be possible with Bitcoin, then I see no difference with it from our traditional centralized banking system, but I think such feature can only be possible with centralized exchange/wallet whereby they own the private key to your funds, and not on a non-custodial wallet whereby only you and you alone own & knows the private key to your funds. Because the ability of a transaction not to be executed without a user's instant authorization is one of the beauty about Bitcoin. But moreover, let's hear what others has to say regarding this.",

How Bitcoin can provide Subscription Auto Renewal solution? I don't know the auto renewal you are referring to in this regard because if you're using the bank, it's not anyone's function to make use of your debit card, you engage doing everything you do by yourself, it's all happened through your authorization and initiation, while im using bitcoin, these protocols are not controlled by anyone, they were made available on the blockchain and cannot be altered by anyone, if you're making a transaction, spending or receiving a coin all work by the blockchain technology consensus, any other contrary opinions are rejected by the system, isn't it more better that you enjoy decentralization and privacy with bitcoin than using fiat, nothing like auto renewal with bitcoin, you don't have to pay for a service, wallet or the blockchain technology, everything works in consensus to the protocols, remember this is digital currency we are talking about.",

Therefore, for such option the wallet needs to share the data with a service and for the time being I don't see any way to bypass it.",

It doesn't make automatic payments possible, though. But you can configure it in a way where the coins become spendable only after the blockchain reaches a certain block height. That block height can be the approximate date when you need to make your new payment in similar fashion as it's used to predict at what time the next halving is for example.",

The protocol doesn't need to do things that can be done in another way. The protocol has locktimes, you can for instance create several transactions that will only become valid in the future. Or a wallet can be coded to do exactly this, it could have a separate balance that isn't locked with a password that can be used to schedule sending funds. Even better if that's LN enabled.Quote from: albert0bsd on September 21, 2023, 03:53:02 PMLong answer, this only can be done on the client side. This is with custom scripts and cronjobsThis could easily be implemented in a wallet, say in Electrum. The fact that it hasn't been done yet makes me think there's no demand for it: anyone who wants to schedule payments (and those are mainly businesses) has another system to process payments from their wallets.QuoteTime-locked transactions can work, but the user needs to reserve some Utxo for that. If the Utxo is spent before the date, the time-locked transactions become useless.Spending the funds before the locktime can be seen as a way to cancel your subscription.Quotethe Time-locked transactions is a policy for the mempool, but not for the miners I read before that if the  time-locked transactions is sent to a miner they can mined that regardless of the time-locked restriction.When using Locktime, the transaction is not valid before it reaches a certain block (or date).

As far as I know, the former is spending the coin but the latter making them unspendable. Also, lock-time transactions did not solve the issue as already addressed in some of the above posts. It is technically unfeasible within the Bitcoin protocol to create and adjust for this kind of use case. Hence there isn't any wallet implementation that is technically utilized for an automatic payment.Though it could be solved by a wallet that automatically makes a set of the configured transactions, but, there is no wallet that implements such a feature.",

Only Bitcoin can control the amount that Bitcoin buys. so auto renewal solution probably won't happen. However, a custodial wallet can be setup for this solution. I was some confusion about this and that's why I ask it here. The Auto Renewal system is very popular today and will continue to be popular in the future.
