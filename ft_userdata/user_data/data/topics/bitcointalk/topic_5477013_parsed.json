Because of the rapid growth of solana lately alot of solana based projects are developing. There are many mainnet projects also where users can interact and get rewards.People are overhyping the gains that they're seeing with solana. While it's a good project for those who holds it and sees that the community is supporting it.I am not one of you guys but if you are seeing that your gains are vast, don't forget to start taking those profits because you will never know when it's going to start dropping.As much as I can see, we're not yet there and this can be a long season for you guys so enjoy.",
