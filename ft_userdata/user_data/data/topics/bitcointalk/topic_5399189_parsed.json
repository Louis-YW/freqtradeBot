  "content": "Many people do not realize to save on the cost of agricultural production, The example is like fertilizer, actually fertilizer can be saved, lo....., I've tried it and as a result the fertilizer I use can save up to 70-90%. Although it sounds very unlikely, the results of my observations in the field reality like that. What is your opinion.? Notes: I use additional fertilizers such as homemade organic fertilizers, it also helps with chemical fertilizers,",

      "body": "in my country at this time the price of fertilizer soared and so expensive. I don't even mind how expensive it is, but the big problem is that chemical fertilizers are now very rare.I am interested in the post you made, which is about saving fertilizer. and you mentioned using additional organic fertilizer.here I want to ask what organic materials are used or how to make this organic fertilizer?",

The first time I was on YouTube about fertilizer issues, and eventually I met an expert in agriculture, and I learned until I created a very profitable fertilizer. Even though the pests couldn't be controlled, at least I didn't lose a lot because of the expensive production. It's not a matter of materials or materials that are very difficult for me to use, but in terms of application, experience, and commitment, so creating a fertilizer that can save 70-90% takes a long time and very extreme testing, So I can't go into detail, it takes very consistent personal experience, and consistency is the key. Try to learn online related to the manufacture of organic fertilizers that I discussed..... Thank youüôèüôèüôè May be usefulcan you mention what materials you use to make organic fertilizer which is relatively cheaper?although indeed I have seen many videos about this on youtube. but I want to know directly from you that you seem to have proved it yourself.",

      "body": "Fertilizer cost savings may indeed be done if we make our own fertilizer from organic materials. such as the use of organic waste around the home environment, even from household food scraps, can be used as fertilizer, such as being processed and fermented using EM4. I've read about articles about how easy it is to make organic fertilizer by utilizing organic waste. If this is successful, I believe that the cost savings for agriculture, especially in the application of fertilizers, will be maximized. but I'm not sure it can reach 90%. except for the use of fully homemade organic fertilizers.",

If we make it ourselves and apply it ourselves it can save up to 90%. It depends on how we think and act, whether we want to be independent or dependent.",
