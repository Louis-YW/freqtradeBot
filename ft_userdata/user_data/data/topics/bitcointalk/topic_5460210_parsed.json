  "content": "Ok, good day fellas, someone brought up an idea for storing his Electrum recovery seed to my notice and I feel it's not entirely still safe and I will like to share here for some feedbacks before I tell him my final answer about the idea.If you get your recovery seed from any wallet, either those with 12 seed words or 24, and you decide to write down 10 out of 12 or 20 out of 24 and keep the other two words separately somewhere else, how stupid or cool is this? He claimed he will keep the two words in a safe location different from the other words and also store the two words off head.Give your answers please, stupid? Cool? Not great? No need?",

You can read about passphrase and it gives your coin additional security.But know that if you forget the passphrase, you will lose your coins. Backup the seed phrase and passphrase in different locations. You can have like two or three backup of each. You can do the backup on paper or steel or stainless steel sheets.",

Should he decide to take the last two or the first two out, then when the other words are found then the probability of getting the remaining two will be easier. Should he decide to take words from within those seeds then there is a probability also that he would miss up those words when trying to put them together. And should he leave a clue then an hacker could also use that clue. The idea of also storing seeds off head has been advised against before because of probably future health challenges like brain damage",

He will have to use service to brute force it and if brute force does not work, he loses his bitcoin. Spliting it does not make it more secured but worse. What will happen if one of two words are from checksum?Why is Seed Splitting a Bad Idea?How to back up a seed phrase?",

But you don't need to keep it in a safe place, because if it's only 2 or 4 words, I think it's easy to memorize.But that's not good advice because we don't know in the long run, because if you miss or forget even one word phrase, then the coin is gone.and writing it down on water and heat resistant paper and storing it safely and against whatever it is is a very good option, like a small safe or a glass bottle that only you know about and has hidden somewhere.",

But are you sure you won't forget those 2 separate words? Maybe you can also save 12 of the 24 words in a different place. I think whatever you do will be good for you as long as no one finds out about your plans.So it's better if you do what you plan to do without sharing it here, so what you keep secret will be completely safe. But for stronger security, maybe you can consider using a multisign wallet. You can store keys in separate places and can share keys (10 of 12 words/ 20 of 24 words). Especially if you plan to hold bitcoins for a long time, multisign is the best. It can be a family asset and you can give keys to each family member to make it more secure",

Those 10, or 20 written-down phrases on a piece of paper will be kept safe out of the reach of others, and even if there is any chance that someone will come into contact with those phrases, they won't be able to access the wallet because of the other missing words. I can remember a guy back then whose wallet had a private key, and among the 64 characters, the guy had four of them removed from different places, not just at the end or beginning of the wallet. This makes everything very complicated; he removed those words and stored them in his memory, and the rest of the key is stored in his email, where he can access it wherever he is. This makes the wallet security strong to me, because in such situations, even if one is given those four missing characters without knowing where they properly belong, you won't be able to access that particular wallet.",

Long story short, I ended up losing it myself. Counter-intuitive processes are smart but not always the best idea. Also, it's not completely ruled out. If he feels it's the best way to safeguard his assets, then it's all good. I read about Brainwallets in ethereum book by the same author who wrote the bitcoin book and it's not a recommended approach when it comes to creating wallet and safeguarding the key/mnemonic phrase.",

Worse thing is I also forgot where did I put my emergency recovery if it's on my note, my messages or etc. In short, I think it's not a great idea to separate something important especially if those words are needed together. Well we all have different capabilities to remember something or in storing so it's depends on the person with his/her prefer method to do since it their assets at stake. As long as you think you are secured with the thought you're having. Just have an alternative recovery in case.",

The best thing to do is whenever you want to hide it in multiple places by dividing the total words, you need to appoint a schedule where you will gonna review everything or place them in different places in order to secure it. Some people don't really need to do this because they memorized their seeds but others need to do it because they don't have strong memories to remember.",

He claimed he will keep the two words in a safe location different from the other words and also store the two words off head.Give your answers please, stupid? Cool? Not great? No need? I don't that that there is any need for doing something like that because it's always preferable to store your whole seed words in a single text file and save that file on multiple storage devices, and then disconnect all those storages devices from internet. With that simple step our seed phrase and our private key gets the top level of security because no one else can access those other than we ourselves.I must say that his idea isn't great at all because why take a lot of burden if you can follow the easy path which has already been tested and is currently the most secure and trusted method to keep ones private keys or seeds words without any worries. I think it's always safe to go with the tested method which I have already explained because that method can't be hacked with current GPU's or any other hacking methods.The most problematic thing that can happen with such idea is brute-force attacks because if someone knows 10 words out of 12 words or 20 words out of 24 words then that person can easily brute-force that wallet and gain access to it. Brute-forcing of 2 words isn't hard these days thanks to powerful GPU's, and even 4 words isn't that much trouble causing for someone who has cluster of those powerful GPU's.",

I don't like the idea of splitting your seed phrase and hiding 10 words in one place and the other 2 words in another place. Instead, you could find a safe place and hide your full seed phrase there. To be honest, using these tricks could make it even riskier and it's unnecessary to do so.I suggest simply writing it down on a piece of paper and hiding it in a place that no one has access to. Probably you could just make 2 copy of the papers and do the same by hiding in in a safe place imho.",
