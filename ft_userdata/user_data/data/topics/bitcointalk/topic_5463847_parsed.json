It is risky to have a miss of profit. Even if Bitcoin goes down more, it is likely to recover later. But I would not sell in case Bitcoin goes up right away soon.",

If you invest at current prices, and bitcoin goes back to peak prices, you will double your money. I think this is very much possible in next six months. If you want better returns than this, search for good alt coins which are still corrected by good price. Regarding the new launched coins, I will suggest to avoid them in next bull run because there will be so many of them. To filter out coins from them, you will be spending a lot of time and energy. I do not recommend this unless you are doing this full time.",

Market cycles are those that when we bring in different emotional states, most of us come to this market for some short term opportunity, but clearly lack of experience is the main reason causes of failure, and usually as I observe people who have experienced it many times they know how to avoid mistakes in the process.",

Last bull run, Shiba INU was trending because it went so high everyone was buying and selling and getting profits, and I did that as well a few times, but when I bought for the last time, it dropped significantly and could never recover again. I held my tokens for a good amount of time but eventually sold them at a loss because I saw no hope for them to go up anymore so I just sold them.If it wasn't for that single wrong investment, I would have earned a lot of profit after the bull run because I have seen the market going up and down on a lot of occasions after that, and when Bitcoin was at $16k, I could get a lot of profit if I could buy at that range but I didn't have capital.",

We just cannot help it; there'll be times that we would be foolish and would choose to embrace the risk which I am now avoiding as an investor. I learned that it is not about the amount you have engaged and to be earned but rather the opporty to be more exposed with this blockchain. Also, it is not too late to invest. All you have to do is to wait for things to again start its increase. There's an appoaching Bitcoin halving which could uplift the market prices. If you came from the past, then I'd choose to continue wiyh my scheme as a rider. Investing at this point would be a hood idea but never push your luck that much.",

If it's about the losses, those are like paper losses that have projected to my portfolio but I want to take them as much as I can in the next bull run.

Increases whether for altcoins or Bitcoin itself wont really be a guarantee on a particular point on which it is really that hard to guess whether it would really be pumpingand having that kind of increase for this cycle or not. This is why investors or traders would be definitely be having that different condition in terms of their bags or portfolio when it comes to gains and losses.It would really vary on each individual since not all would really be that on the same condition when it comes to their port decision making.",
