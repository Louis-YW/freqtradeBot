  "content": "Disclaimer: I run an online casino which caters to crypto deposits and withdrawals, including, but not limited to BitCoin. If this post is not allowed, please remove it.I have been involved in online casinos for a few years and recently opened an online casino where we accept crypto. However I have no idea what crypto players are looking for, so I would like to learn more as I genuinely want to offer a high quality entertainment experience. I understand that most people have no interest in gambling, so please skip this post if so, but if it is of interest to you, I would love to know 'What makes a great crypto casino?'The brand I launched is called Casino LEET https://www.casino1337.com/ and I would love to offer a truly elite gaming experience.We chose to focus on the following.... are these a good angle or not?- Deposit / withdraw directly using BitCoin (and other crypto)- Easy sign up with Google, Telegram, or Twitter- High quality customer support to help you get exactly what you need (concerned I invested too much in this!)- Set deposit, loss, wager, and session limits, and also to apply a cooling-off or self-exclusion period for player safety- Over 10k games with a wide selection of categories (think NetFlix style)- VIP level up system based around BitCoin ownership where the ultimate goal is to become a humpback- Regular promotions, tournaments, and rewards available multiple times a week - A selection of Crash games (with its own category to find them easier)- Live updates on recent winners and big winners visible on-siteThe early player reviews have been positive which is rare for casino, but we still have a lot to learn and we think feedback is the key here to make a better experience as we are still very small. Look forward to hearing from you. If you want to check out the casino we launched, you can do so from the link above and all of the games are playable in 'fun-mode' so you don't need to deposit anything to play them.",

The procedure for doing that is already explained in that first comment as well. It's however important too to get yourself familiar with the forum and it's rules too so as to know the right board for your post next time.You can take a look at welcome message and rules and guidelines for you to know certain things here.

It's fun as long as you are enjoying the entertainment it provides. It's not only fun if you are not winning, just kidding aside! LOL  For me, a great crypto casino should consider the following:Players should have a wide variety of games to choose from, including slots, table games, live dealer games, and provably fair games. Quality should always come before quantity. Ensure that the games are from reputable providers, offer fair odds, and operate in a transparent manner.Players should be able to deposit and withdraw their funds quickly and securely.Players should be able to take advantage of generous bonuses and promotions.Players should be able to get help from customer support quickly and easily if they need it.Based on your choices, it seems you are focusing on the right things. Good luck with Casino LEET, and I hope it becomes a great platform for crypto players! I wish you all the best.PS. Unfortunately, I also belong to a restricted country. How sad!",

Your targets on what you could improve is quite a long list too but it's better done because those are the basics of a crypto gambling site. About the high-quality customer support that you think you invested too much in, don't worry you will reap the rewards of that later on. Why? Because most gambling sites lack that feature. They are undermanned when it comes to answering queries of their customers so it's good that you are ready for it. The \"self-exclusion or cooling-off\" thing, should be optional in my opinion but a pop-up warning could be a good idea if they are gambling heavily. Let the gamblers have a choice on when to stop or set a limit amount after the warning so they will try to slow down.I really wish I could check out your site but good luck though and I hope you could find a way to cut some of those country restrictions.",

First, ensure you come clean and clear the air on the issue of KYC from the beginning. Some casinos have this habit of asking for KYC when customers have huge winning even when they never did that during registration.  This does not show transparency and integrity.  In addition, a great casino should be free from internal manipulations. There have been few reports of this happening.Finally, you have to make resources available to do proper marketing of your product. This forum should be one of the best platform for such marketing on the form of signature campaign and reviews.",

There is a way to visit your casino through VPN but I dont think people will use VPN just to check your casino first. I'm not sure why you have so many restricted countries, is it due to the license you use or your own decision to have that long list of restricted countries?
