      "body": "Yeah it's really easier to said than done, because when the stable coin lose it's peg, the chance the coin will turn become dead coin is high because no one trust it anymore. How it's possible the price of a stable coin isn't stick with $1? it just kill the definition of stable coin since the developer unable to make the coin price back to $1. Now TerraUSD is still around $0.02 per each token, do you willing take a risk to buy it?",

      "body": "I saw someone having that idea with stablecoin but it does need a huge amount of capital in doing it. What he was saying was that sometimes USDT drops at least $0.998. It's a very tiny difference but you can make some money if you also have a huge amount of capital for it.Â  Small profit but safer to do especially if you are unwilling to lose in BTCUSDT. Not entirely a get-rich-quick plan but I'm sure he is not just the only one who saw it.",

Anyway, the example I have given is already happened many times, and recently on BUSd Binance USDT/BUSD pair.Reasons for such incidents Bugs Low pair Liquidity",

      "body": "Trust is the key for any business that's happening online. The same goes for cryptocurrency. It is called stable coin because it is meant to be equal to 1 stablecoin = 1 USD. So if it falls, how does that make it a stable asset? If it can't keep its value, how are people going to trust it? We have seen many incidents like this in the past. No wonder some alts doesn't make it through the starting point. The ability to provide what is promised is the main reason for many successful projects. I hate stablecoins and alts, so my opinion maybe different. But it is what it is.",

      "body": "If a stablecoin loses its peg by over 20% then most likely something is wrong like with the Luna stablecoin and you are better off not buying it at all.If you get lucky you can maybe buy tether at a 2-5% discount once every 2 years when there is some FUD but honestly there are better ways of making that 2-5% profit rather than waiting 2 years for a trade.",
