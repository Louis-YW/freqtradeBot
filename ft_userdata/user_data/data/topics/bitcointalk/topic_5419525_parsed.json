If a project does badly in its presale and ico, it's probably going to keep doing that.ICOs are also a very risky investments and not really something you should be attempting to do without some even small research into the coins competition (if it's already something done by another coin - which by this point is quite likely).Using resources like dex data (even collected by sites like coinmarketcap) are a good place to start to track more accurate price moves as their data can't be manipulated if it's on chain (there's more sites than cmc out there for checking price too - some just need a token address).",

So advice to myself and new investors is to stay away from them and get more cryptocurrency knowledge firstYou read my mind. The Internet is a big garbage dump, and to trust every piece of news that comes in means becoming like an uneducated eccentric, ready to believe every barking dog. In our time, any news must be double-checked several times, and still, if there is doubt, allow yourself to doubt. Even large public sites sometimes write such unverified heresy that you involuntarily begin to think that the world is ruled by sheer lies and money.To paraphrase an old proverb, one can say, \"Check a hundred times, and then believe.\"",

I don't doubt these could be news at a crypto news portal, because I've already seen this kind of advertisement before. Usually these portals try to discredit bitcoin while endorsing a random altcoin as something miraculous which is leading investors to hundred or thousand percentage profit. The reason behind this practice is profit for the website and article writer, without any doubts, but I'm not sure exactly how the profit is made. That is, if they are directly paid by the project for shilling or if they profit through ads solely.",

Most of those paid contents aren't moderated and you will notice that they are never at the \"news\" section.

I also stopped to listen to those crypto influencers a long time ago because i have not found a single one yet that is just giving his neutral point of view on projects. Those influencers are all just shilling those projects in which they could buy in during the seed or private sale. Then they shill this project to their followers to pump their own bag and then they dump on their own followers. It's a very shady tactic but very common.",
