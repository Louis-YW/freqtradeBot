  "content": "Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency was not just created for investment purpose, it was actually created as a means of payment and to be honest, the adoption process isn't as fast as expected, but one thing that am very curious about and I have been thinking on how to go about it as a business man while accepting it as a means of payment is it volatility, though it might be advantageous for holders, but am not that certain for a business men.In a situation whereby you accept it as a means of payment while selling off your goods, then when  you are out of stock, so you decide to restock your shop, so by then price of Bitcoin has dip so much that you can't buy all the goods needed in your shop, due to the fact that your money has depreciate in value because of the dip, what is the way forward in such a situation if your emergency funds can't cover up for the shortage?",

Some stores rely on processors to transfer cryptocurrencies to the bank account once they are accepted, while others consider Bitcoin as an investment and since Bitcoin transactions may not exceed 10% of the total transactions, they are good as a medium or long-term investment. Some sell Bitcoin on a weekly or daily basis as the price of Bitcoin may not differ much on a daily basis.",

If the business have no money left and all of them are in volatility assets, the business has a bad money management.If a business has money management problem, the owner should recruit financial planner.",

      "body": "Maybe for ordinary Bitcoin users this feels quite difficult and can be stressful if the price of Bitcoin is falling because there is no profit from selling using Bitcoin as a means of payment, plus not preparing an emergency fund that can cover if this happens and it will definitely happen because the price of Bitcoin is not easy to predict and only fools will do this because it risks causing frustration if they don't think and make a very mature strategy and plan for the future to anticipate if this happens. If not, I think the store will not be able to buy back the item to sell, and will not convert it to fiat to be able to buy it because it will be a loss.Only people who have a lot of money or are indeed very rich can do it and also love Bitcoin who can do it, and do it with very mature planning, have a good strategy and also have a large emergency fund if this happens. And besides that, the person took the initiative because of his love for Bitcoin, aiming for everyone to know that Bitcoin can be used as a means of payment, and know and also have a strong belief that if that happens in the end the price of Bitcoin will rise again which will provide extraordinary benefits in the end.",

Doing something that is prohibited will not be profitable even though we know that bitcoin has provided many benefits and you need to review this first before deciding to accept or pay for something using bitcoin. If you are just a small investor then using bitcoin as a means of payment will not be profitable because of volatility.The simple logic is like this, when you run out of bitcoin stock to pay and the value of buying bitcoin at that time is high then when the price drops and you have to pay for purchases using bitcoin you will most likely lose. My understanding is that it would not be profitable for small investors to condone bitcoin as a means of transaction but it is much better for investment.",

Also, to my understanding most places that take Bitcoin use some form of payment processor to automate everything.So, whether some businesses or individuals choose to invest in Bitcoin and hold it for a longer period is unrelated to whether they accept Bitcoin as a payment method for services and products.",

The sole purpose he created it for was to be a peer to peer currency but we turned it into an investment from day one and maintain it to this day. We have turned bitcoin into a volatile asset class, which is good for investment purposes but has inadvertently made it difficult to use as a means of payment. That's why I don't really welcome or like the idea of ​​using bitcoin as a means of payment for businesses. Because if we don't have a specific plan and strategy, rushing to adopt bitcoin as a payment method will cause a lot of difficulties for our business. People in the position of customers or buyers may support this idea but if they are in the position of business owners, they will realize that there are many challenges they face with the volatility caused by bitcoin. Some people came up with the idea: as soon as we receive bitcoins, we will immediately exchange them for fiat. That way we can avoid the volatility of bitcoin, but if we do that then what is the point of using bitcoin as a means of payment?",

It's a brand new currency compared to gold and fiat but has a market cap that's higher than 1 trillion dollars.There are two options for you if you are in e-commerce:1) Integrate Coinbase Commerce on your website - When someone pays with Bitcoin on your website, then Coinbase will automatically convert crypto into USD and you won't have to worry about volatility.2) Integrate BTCPayServer on your website - When someone pays with Bitcoin, you'll have total access to your wallet and you manually send coins from your wallet to an exchange, convert and then withdraw fiat.If I were you, since the volume of Bitcoin transactions is low in every store, I would HODL coins that I'd receive via my website. HODL means long-term holding, for example 3-4 years.",

It will process their bitcoin transactions in seconds, then convert them to fiat. This is because the price of bitcoin can fluctuate even more than cc's processing fees.
