Don't see my comment as an attack because I am wearing a stake signature. First, no one here will believe your claims that the stake actually took your deposited balance and there after lock your account unless you provide every valid evidence to support the claim. Secondly, the Stake is a well-known casino that has a long history of paying players huge amounts for winning with delay and their representatives here and on the site are very active so if you are serious about your case you need to reach them through their representative here or the support and make sure to keep evidence on every step of the way.",

Customer service tell me to contact complaints and legal but they just dont reply.Stake can not just disable your account. Likely you want to withdraw after winning and they look more into your account to know if you follow the terms of service or not. Some gamblers do face this problem because it is easy to deposit on gambling sites but to withdraw is strict. Stake would have told you the exact reason why your account was blocked, can you tell us why?",

This is an incomplete thread, you need to add more evidence to this thread to draw their attention to your complaint. You should continue to contact them through the support team.

We can not force anyone to follow our advice. We can only suggest, and the rest is up to them. I saw he wrote some detailed information in another thread. But he did not bother to edit OP and add what he wrote there. There is no way we can verify whether he is telling the truth. It seems he deposited a lot of money, so he wants to fight against Stake by appointing a lawyer. Let's say his case is true. But there is no way we can verify it without any proof. Quote from: Kingrojie on May 17, 2023, 12:31:14 PMAlso everyone, please watch the first minute of this video of Eddie streaming:    https://youtu.be/0l6liFJNW8USomeone asks: ''Are you Aussie'?Eddie Replies: ''I'm Australian, From Melbourne\"Now this is why he is playing stake, which cannot be accessed from Australia He is the owner, and you are a customer. He can be from anywhere. If his license doesn't forbid ownership from Aussies, there is no problem. He is Australian, From Melbourne doesn't mean he lives in Australia. It's not impossible that he may live somewhere else right now. Let's say he lives in Melbourne, Still, he is the owner of the platform, and he has special access to play on his platform for promotion purposes. He doesn't have to play on his platform to make money. He does it for promotional purposes. When you signed up to their platform, You agreed to their TOS. Now don't say just because Eddie played in his casino, I will do the same. He is not playing with real money. But, you do. He can create his balance out of thin air and you cannot. So, Don't compare him with yourself.",

Any related issues that would have led to the user account being disabled is coming from his end and this could be either when he violated the rules on their website, failed to give total compliance on their KYC procedures, try to cheat on their platform or have been found violating one or two rules while using their platform, stake.com is one of the most recognized gambling platform on this noble forum and had been know for good and standard reputation over years, many members of the forum makenuse of this platform because they are fare and reliable enough to gain their trust.",

But chats, and live streams and so on have gone through the courts in several countries over the last few years and it still came back to what T&C you agreed to.Obviously, this will depend on where you are in the world, but so far as far as I have seen, there has been nothing that went to court and came out any other way.Now, there have been cases where the T&C were found to be bad / wrong / unenforceable. But that is a different story.-Dave",
