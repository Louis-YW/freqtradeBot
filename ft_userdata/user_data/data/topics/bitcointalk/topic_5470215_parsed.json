  "content": "Maybe there are ways we can successfully avoid phishing emails and links 100%, if there are, I do not know any, but we can verify if the link sent to us is genuine or not. We all know that THE SITE MUST USE HTTPS. Emphasis on the \"S\"This should be common knowledge. A site that uses HTTP doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam site, but it most definitely means a site like that is more likely to be compromised. You might as well just hand over your data to a cybercriminal if you input your data into these kinds of sites. Tools to use Use Link Checker Tools.A link checker tool helps verify if the link is safe or not.   Google transparency report is a popular link checker. It's easy and fast. Just copy the URL you want to verify the search. This image clearly shows that there is no unsafe content found on the URL I used \"Bitcointalk\". A relatively more advanced link checker tool is  URLVOID. This shows what different tools have to say about that website.URLVoid tels the date of registration and the IP address and also on how many tools has that site been detected as unsafe. This image shows that this website has been detected by one tool as a malicious link. The higher the detection counts, the higher it's unsafe.Verify the ownership and how old the site is.Tools like  WHOIS searchhelp you know when the site was registered. A lot of scam sites are relatively new and they may not appear as malicious on URL checker. Backline Analysis tools.This is a URL that can take you to a website from another website. A fake or scam website won't feature on many other websites while the reverse is the case for an authentic site.  Ahrefs site checker is a tool that can be used to check a website's backline profile. No way a scam website has this many backlines and linking websites. If you want to read more you can go HEREIf you somehow click on a malicious URL, either by mistake or knowingly, don't panic. In the process of trying to copy the URL to verify you may mistakenly click it, these are a few tips from  keeper security Quote*Do not enter any data*Don't click on anything on the site*Disconnect from the Internet*Do a full scan of your device using a trusted and authentic antivirus software *Keep an eye on your account for any irregularities. Bonus Tip: Don't use one or two passwords for multiple accounts. If you do that, once cybercriminals get hold of one password, they have access to all or multiple of your accounts.If possible, every account should have its password.",

If we doesn't click on any site nor delete then still possibility of any malware attack? Yes, you will still be vulnerable to attacks, because you just clicked on a phishing link, let's say a link you received from a scammer pretending to be your bank, and asked you to change your password from that link, and once you change your password your account will no longer be under your control. In this case you are vulnerable when you entered data, i mean changed the password.But when hackers, are at advance level, they simply have to load some javascripts on your browser, and once they got in, they can install there respective malware easily. But this attack could be avoided easily if you are using a good and up to date browser. Because usage of out kf date and not reputed browsers then you are a sitting duck.And my suggestion for antivirus, is don't use them, simple use the built-in windows defender tool, and never try to use patched windows, or run any scripts to activate your windows. Best way to keep you digital finance on linux operator.

Just a friendly advice, you don't have to share this information here, because evesdropping  is a technique of keeping record of user (internet user) and hacker analyze the activity of a user to get to know more about it. Just to get information which you just already gave here. Quote from: Alpha Marine on October 13, 2023, 02:54:20 PM We all know that THE SITE MUST USE HTTPS. Emphasis on the \"S\"This should be common knowledge. A site that uses HTTP doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam site, but it most definitely means a site like that is more likely to be compromised. What if the scammer uses hyperlink function, like link shorteners, where the upper text is something and the below link is something else. I mean we can generate links comprised of https but inside they really are not https integrated. Although, I liked your point of backlinks, but besides that, I will not trust on third party websites telling me about a phishing link. I have my own ways, but to be very honest I dont even click on links which my interviewer sends me.",

One can actually have a designated device for them that you don’t bring online always. The device that’s usually online should use watch only wallet. You said well, because on digital world, scammers are finding new ways to scam you like the recent one, about Hong Kong Binance scam, in which they people received phishing mails and got hacked and lost there funds. And one of the member here on BTT, pointed out that, many buyers and sellers on P2P trades, have set some rules of giving them the phone number otherwise they will not trade with you, and once you receive the funds they will send you phishing emails on that and pretend to be from Binance.We should definitely avoid to click on links, all I do is simple think twice before clicking on any. Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 13, 2023, 03:54:23 PM The best way to avoid all this links is to be extra cautious because some of these sites also checking out links could also pose some threats too Exactly, best way is to avoid clicking on them, and if you have no other option but to click on it then use a device which is not in your personal use, and which have no connections to your crypto wallets either they are custodial or non custodial.",

Buddy as long as you don't bypass your own security by installing the software from third-party sources and cracked versions of the security firewalls provided by the Windows itself. No need for additional layers, avoid clicking suspicious links and you're safe.I've encountered similar issues back in time but after I realized my own few mishandlings, after that never I realized to have antivirus software. Hmm yes, buddy if you follow never click on unwanted sites, and don't install any third-party sourced software you can go safe without any antivirus software.",

For wallet download, you can verify its PGP signature. The most useful technique I used was virtual machines, also known as VMs. We all know that airgapped devices are the most secure because they are totally offline. But we can't always sit offline and do nothing. We have to connect ourselves to the Internet. So what to do? I have multiple devices and external hard drives. All my important files are there. Whenever I'm unsure of a link or app, I first test it on my VM. So my main device doesn't get infected. Even if my main device gets infected, that's not even an issue. As all my data was previously backed up on my secondery device and harddrives. I personally don't prefer any antivirus software as they seemed somehow unreliable to me.I don't know if it's enough.

Obviously we don't understand each other) If you connect to a phishing site that you switched to due to the change of DNS servers by scammers, then you will connect your wallet, since the domain does not cause you distrust.
