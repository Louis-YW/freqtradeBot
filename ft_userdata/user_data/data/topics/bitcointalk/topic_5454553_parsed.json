  "content": "Well the other day i was talking with a friend and he is one of that guys who follow so much the news about crypto and also he is in a ton of telegram groups, in one moment he said to me one very interesting thing.He said to me, one guy in one group of telegram claim to open another person wallet charging his seed and changing only the last word by mistake, so i think like always pure luck, and shit can happen for the owner of that wallet. But after that we keep talking and he said this guy after that start to try to do more tries and obviusly he was unncesufull but...... A few days has passed and this same guy claim again to reach another wallet, so yes its more a luck thing but the main problem its another.The days has passed and i keep thinking on my head and also my friend, i know we have a ton of possibilities, but we already know all the words who are used to make the 12 prhase seed, so we can know the possibilities of combination who are pretty high, but what if every person in the world have one or more wallets?.The chances of open another wallet can be increasing really fast.Now we are 8.000 millions of person in the world imagine every person having 2/3 wallets and in a few years more we can have a lot more of population and that population increase very fast.IF im not making bad my maths the  actual number of combination with 12 words its:11005261717918037175659349191168A HUGE number i know, and we are far to that number but i think we need to be MORE far like with the 24 words.41731122174410236047796743722730466018640279171473593600Because in that way we are making the chance of being lucky/unlucky very very low.And i repeat most of you guys here im sure you have more tha 5 wallets. And im only taking into account the \"persons\" wallet, we have to add the ton of wallets from enterprises, companies, exchange, etc, etc.What do you think about my claiming? I know its pretty paranoid, and the chances of lost your funds are very/extremetly low, but that chances are increasing and we think we are far far from the total number of combinations but i think that its not so true, with a little bit of luck an trying a lot of times you can start to open some wallets.",

Taking your own randomly generated seed phrase and changing the last word will never result in you stumbling across another active wallet.Quote from: Wrathofcoins on May 30, 2023, 07:12:37 PMNow we are 8.000 millions of person in the world imagine every person having 2/3 wallets and in a few years more we can have a lot more of population and that population increase very fast.This is an utterly irrelevant number when compared to the number of valid seed phrases.Let's say we have 8 billion people in the world. Instead of 2 or 3 wallets, let's say that every one of those 8 billion people is generating a thousand new wallets every second. Let's also say that each one of those 8 billion people continues to generate a thousand new wallets a second every second for a million years.8 billion * 1,000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 1,000,000 = 2.5*1026Number of valid 12 word seed phrases = 3.4 * 1038So in my scenario, after a million years we will have generated approximately 0.00000000007% of all possible seed phrases.There will never be a seed phrase collision.",

It may be unlikely that you win the lottery, but it's very likely that someone wins it. Depending on the rules of the lottery it could even be a given that someone's going to win.With random Bitcoin addresses, it's not only unlikely that you recreate an existing one, it's unlikely that anyone does it. It's so unlikely, it's safe to say it's not going to happen. I literally bet my money on this.QuoteSo you can never rule out that possibility 100%Some people would argue that 99.9999999999999999999999999999% is certain enough.

If you are in a large room, there are a VERY large number of arrangements of those oxygen molecules that are possible within that room.  Any single arrangement at a moment in time is just as likely as any other arrangement.  There are a VERY large number of arrangements that provide enough molecules in front of your face that you can breathe. There are a much smaller number of arrangements that result in all of the oxygen molecules gathering together in the corner of the room and you suffocating to death.If you calculate the exact probability, then there is a non-zero probability at any moment that you will find yourself standing in a perfectly normal room with a perfectly normal amount of oxygen molecules, but still suffocate to death because those molecules just so happen to randomly be all gathered together in the corner.Even though the mathematically calculated value is not exactly 0, it is SO SMALL that no reasonable person would say that it is \"possible\" for them to suffocate to death in a normal room with normal amounts of oxygen present due to this scenario.We humans have a difficult time wrapping our heads around REALLY BIG (or really small) numbers. The probability of stumbling into someone else's randomly generated address or wallet (assuming that it was truly random) is MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller than the probability of winning the lottery. I don't think it's as small as the oxygen molecule example that I gave (though I've never tried to estimate it, so I suppose I could be mistaken about that), but it definitely is plenty small enough to also be considered \"not possible\" by any reasonable person.",

Is there an active wallet? Or is it just a wallet that somebody created and then abandoned years ago. Maybe I'm a unique case camera but I probably have created used and then abandoned 50 plus wallets generated from 12 word seeds over the years. I have several hot wallets that I don't keep a lot of funds in, but I do like to have immediate available funds on several devices at a time that are all totally unrelated to each other. And when I'm done after what could be weeks or months, I archive out the seed and create a new one. I don't think I'm alone in doing this. So yes you could find day's wallet #37. You get to see all my transactions from 2020.

Because I'm a nerd who loves this kind of stuff - some very rough calculations would put a small 5m*5m*3m room at 75,000 liters, 21% O2 gives 15,750 liters, with the molar gas volume of 22.4 liters at STP giving 703.125 moles of oxygen, times Avogadro's constant giving 4.234*1026 molecules of oxygen. If you give each molecule a 12.5% chance of being gathered in a specific corner of the room (given that there are 8 corners), then your chance of them all being gathered in same corner is going to be 0.125^(4.234*1026). My software won't calculate that number. I get as far as about 10-1,000,000,000 and then it gives up and says zero. Heh.So yeah, a bit on the extreme side, but the principle is the same as I outlined above. Even if everyone in the world did literally nothing but constantly generate new wallets for millions of years, we still wouldn't get a collision. It is safe to assume the chance of a random collision is zero, just as it is safe to assume the chance of randomly suffocating is zero.It's probably worth pointing out that if you think a 12 word seed phrase is insecure, then swapping to 24 words doesn't change anything. Bitcoin private keys \"only\" provide 128 bits of security at most, regardless of the number of bits in the seed phrase used to generate them.

Considering the people making it and their security choices I'll let others figure out what they missed in the 1st generation of their security chip. Because, you can be open source and auditable all you want. But, without specialized tools and knowledge you can't really know whats in the silicon.

Do you mean finding the ephemeral key used in signing? Finding an ephemeral key would only allow an attacker to calculate a single one of the private keys in the multi-sig, not all of them (assuming of course you do not reuse your k value across all your keys, which no good wallet software would do anyway).You can still brute force multi-sig addresses in far less time than brute forcing all the individual private keys by simply finding any script which hashes to the same output as the multi-sig script. So for a P2SH output, where the script hash is RIPEMD160(SHA256(script)), then you have a script hash which is 160 bits, which is obviously far less than trying to brute force 256 bits.Unless you are meaning finding an individual private key which can be used as I've explained above in order to create a script with a hash which matches that of your multi-sig?
