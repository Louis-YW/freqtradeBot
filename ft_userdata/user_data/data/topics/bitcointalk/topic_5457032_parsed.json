      "body": "I am assuming you are from the management. It looks like a mini casino to me. I hope the games are probable fair, otherwise there are always this chance of manipulating the results and people will be less interested to play in your casino. Anyway, that's should be the concern for the casino side. It's obvious that you are new to the forum and still learning the environment. But the decision to expose your product to the community is a right choice. There are many projects who made their business successful starting from this community. However, to make things to work properly for you, you need a proper marketing strategy.1. This is an announcement topic for you. It's the hub for you to introduce and build a community for your product. As you are already suggested a copper membership will allow you to present the business properly to attract more attention. You will be able to post graphics and using the graphics you can create a nice ANN thread. 2. You need exposure for the product all over the forum (possibly in all topics that are discussed by the members). For that a signature campaign is the best start. There are other methods of advertising. Some of them are: Review campaign, launching special promo, sponsoring events etc. With a good strategy you can combined all of these to get the best ROI.Feel free to contact me anytime if you need such co-operation. Welcome to the forum.",

The way of presenting the site, with a newbie account and leaving only the link seems unprofessional. He could have at least given more details, because with the offer of casinos around here it is not appealing. Although maybe he is in time to rectify the situation, by buying a copper membership, editing the OP and hiring a trusted manager for signature campaign and other promos as suggested.",

You should try to to edit your post and make it more presentable because you wouldn't want a situation where someone click on yuorr thread and the first impression they get is that you're not serious in running your site and ou probably have a different motive as to the creation of your site. Purchase a copper membership, design a cool image for your ANN stating some features of your casino (you can hire graphics designers for that) and then post, it's as simple as ABC. I just cheked the Privacy Policy and Terms of Sevice and it seems like the site is not yet complete, since you're still using Lorem Ipsum to generate the contents of both of those pages. You should try to update them as those are the first thing that your customers will check if the policy of the site is okay for them or not in terms of KYC, deposit, withdrawal, and etceras...",
