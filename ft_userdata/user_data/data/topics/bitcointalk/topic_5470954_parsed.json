      "body": "I read the article and did not understand how accumulation prices were calculated. Is it a study of average past prices, including predicting the appropriate price to buy? If so, then it is more like a study of 200-day moving averages, but it is not a confirmation of the upward line, especially with a currency that has a low market capacity.Leveraging idle GPUs are not a revolutionary idea or they may push the price of the Render Token higher.Kaspa claims to be something revolutionary, namely simultaneous blocks, but I have often heard this word without finding a project that implemented it well.",
