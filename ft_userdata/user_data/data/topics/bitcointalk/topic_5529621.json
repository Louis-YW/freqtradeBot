  "content": "I was reading this post by Hal and I realized how he was basically talking about what I interpret as additional layers on top of Bitcoin. Was the Lighting Network being described here, or did he talk of something else?Quote from: Hal on December 30, 2010, 01:38:40 AMActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the \"high-powered money\" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.When he mentions \"issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins\". Would this look like in practice as a sidechain?For instance, Adam Back recently talked about the new CMSTR token, which is a tokenized version of the MSTR shares (MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy), as described here:QuoteInnovation in Trading CMSTR introduces a novel method for trading MicroStrategy stocks directly against BTC on Liquid, Bitcoin’s financial layer for digital asset issuance.The unique peer-to-peer tradability of CMSTR, combined with its 24/7/365 trading availability, also opens up new opportunities for out-of-hours price formation strategies for MicroStrategy stock.So in a way, holders of Bitcoin are being the bank, and CMSTR is the issued digital currency. Would this meet the criteria described by Hal?And speaking of banks, in this context, Strategy would be the world's biggest bank, since they are the public company with the biggest holdings of Bitcoin. Considering the unknown possibilities of this in the future, the stock may be undervalued the current mNAV premium of under 2x.I was also considering ETF's serving as banks. BlackRock is filling for in-kind transactions im not sure if this points to them wanting to be something more than a traded ticker for a BTC proxy. I would still claim that Strategy would be a better bank. And so those companies would compete with each other and an interest rate would emerge as described by Selgin. In this sense, I was wondering how does the software for all of this look like. I think Strategy should hire people such as Adam Back and others and try to work this angle to monetize their massive Bitcoin stacks. This may be on their plans and right now they are still focused on acquiring more Bitcoin with intelligent leverage through the convertible bonds, ATMs and other methods.I believe Strategy may play a big role in Bitcoin in the future that is not priced in. It's still seen as a Bitcoin proxy alternative to ETFs. I think Hal Finney described there what they are going for +1 decade ago, but how the sofware will operate is not clear to me, I would like to know if anyone has some ideas for this.",

The bank has some public key, which is displayed to the user. You deposit BTCs there, and they appear on your account, exactly as when you deposit physical cash into some ATM, and it is credited into your bank account.Quoteissuing their own digital cash currencyThis step is optional, and it happens only after some time. First, you have just deposits and withdrawals, and you have no token, owned by the exchange. However, as things are evolving, it is profitable to release a new token, and then you have for example things like BNB on Binance.QuoteSome would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed.If you have just some web page, with \"deposit\" and \"withdraw\" buttons, displaying you just some amounts, then you can have any kind of fractional reserve. But: when some exchange is getting more serious, then it is slowly moving into \"100% Bitcoin backed\", just to convince users, that it wouldn't collapse, as other exchanges in the past.QuoteWas the Lighting Network being described here, or did he talk of something else?QuoteWould this look like in practice as a sidechain?None of them. Because when you have LN or a sidechain, then you can explore many details, related to your coins. So, it no longer behaves like a typical bank. Because if you deposit some cash into some ATM, then can you really go into your bank account, and trace your banknotes, by seeing their serial numbers? Can you see, that your $100 bill went from bank A to bank B, then it was taken out of another ATM, and deposited back into bank C? Can you count all coins, and audit the supply?In case of LN and sidechains, you can see a lot of traces. In case of exchanges, you just see, that you have N coins, you can see some order book, and check the latest price. But: all of that is not backed by any proofs, exactly like in banks, so after you deposit 1 BTC, you no longer know, if that exchange still have your 1 BTC or not. You just trade, and things are getting \"real\", and you can get some \"details\", only when you click \"withdraw\" (while in sidechains and LN, you need to approve your actions with your signatures, and you can read a lot of traffic, related to the whole network).",

      "body": "I understand that he meant mainly IOUs and Bitcoin stablecoins (=stablecoins pegged to Bitcoin's value). But also sidechains could be described as such a \"bank\" -- they would be one of the \"100% bitcoin backed\" solutions, with a special technical mechanism responsible for the two way peg.Finney mentioned George Selgin and his idea of a free, competitive banking sector. If we think a bit about it, and take into account that BItcoiners have embraced and popularized the idea of \"not your keys, not your coins\", probably the competition in the Bitcoin banking sector could eventually make it almost mandatory for players in this sector to offer a way of self-custody of their own \"financial asset\", i.e. of their Bitcoin-pegged token. That would be sidechains and solutions like Ark. Just like the \"proof of reserves\" became popular some years ago after the major crypto exchange hacks.However, even with a \"Bitcoin Banking sector\" comprised mostly by \"sidechains\" and other L2 variants which allow self-custody, there is still a loophole for something very similar to fractional banking: premined sidechain utility tokens. Such tokens would indirectly dilute the system: although they wouldn't dilute the Bitcoin-pegged coin directly, they could be used to raise funds which otherwise would flow into Bitcoin and redirect a big part of them to the bank owners. This is basically what \"L2s\" like Stacks (or Arbitrum on Ethereum) are doing.",

To better understand it, you can try to run a full node for some CPU-mined altcoins. Their history takes just a few GB, but it requires more than a month of verification time. Why?

Generally it is anything that is \"pegged\" to bitcoin, from shittokens like Wrapped Bitcoin all the way to anything that claims to have been pegged to bitcoin with any rate (1:1 or 1:10 or anything) whether it is created as a sidechain or not.And I have to say it is a terrible idea specially the part about \"fractional reserve banking\". They may provide some utility and attract some costumers but they'll destroy Bitcoin market until it ceases to exist. Because if such a system is created and largely used and then it can print bitcoin out of thin air without cap, the supply will no longer be limited! That will hurt bitcoin reputation and the price, but eventually it will be categorized as a shitcoin and stops having anything to do with Bitcoin...The description is not like Lightning Network either. LN is not a separate \"chain\" with a separate token that is pegged to bitcoin. It is a second layer (not a sidechain) and a second layer is built on top of a first layer and depends on it. A pegged coin on the other hand, does NOT depend on what it is pegged to. For example if Bitcoin were to disappear today, technically WBTC can continue to exist because it does not rely on bitcoin network (it's a useless token on a token creation platform).Same with the banking system that is being described, since it wouldn't have anything to do with bitcoin and doesn't rely on it from a technical perspective, it can continue to exist and operate without Bitcoin!",
