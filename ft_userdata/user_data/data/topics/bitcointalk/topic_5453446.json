Thanks, sweet coin!  That's actually a good question and reminds me I recently got a few Lealana XMR without the \"digital paperwork\".  Is there any way to get it via the coin's serial number from smoothie directly?Highly doubtful as we know smoothie will not give out information on coins except to the original buyer. Just like all the buyer funded coins out there people can't get addresses for... Then again I don't think it's a huge deal myself on these coins because you can peel them without that information.",
