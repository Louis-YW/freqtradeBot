Second, before buying any coin, you must do your due diligence and take decision. Third, your target will determine if you will hold or take profits.No one is expected to give you financial advice here as the decision shoulf be based on your independent research, the consequences too should be yours to bear.",

Bitcoin is ested and also trusted for a long term holding.",

This cryptocurrency is also called a coin, but its basis is not organized by anything; it's only for the purpose of jokes or fun. It does not have a proper use case like other coins.QuoteAre meme coin worth buying in the long term?No, meme coins didn't have long-term worth because, firstly, people didn't like to invest in them, and secondly, they didn't have any purpose as to how they could be used in the long term. It is made up just for fun and entertainment. Besides that, meme coins have a high risk of investment, so anytime they can give you a loss,QuoteWhat is your reason for buying meme coin?The only reason for buying is the cheap price or something that gives you an unimaginable profit.Personal: I also used to invest in memes Coin when I seemed to be in profit mode.  But anyway,  it also gives you profit as well as loss.

TBH, I've seen many investors who are risking their money, they invest in these stupid meme coins only to lose money in the end. Investing into meme coins (or where I considered them as sh*tcoins) is like placing your bet on the team that is obviously losing against their opposing team. Yes, there's a chance still to win, but what are the chances? Same with investing in meme coins. Yes, you can gain profit, but what are the chances of you gaining profit? It's pretty obvious that most of these meme coins have no use case at all. It's already good that DOGE is being used for some reasons. Most of the meme coins for me are useless, and they aren't worth holding for the long term.Reason for me to buy meme coins? I have no reason to buy them because I believe that they aren't a good coin to hold mid to long term. The risk of investing in these type of coins are very high at least for me. The reward is high yes, but I can't risk money investing into something that I believe will give me headaches in the end.",

Yeah, I'd say this because during the hype of meme coins like Pepe, a lot of investors got the desire to invest but look, they're going after the pump and selling them. It is not worth buying but people have taken advantage of the situation. Perhaps, not a wrong move but if we used to buy them and hold ---that was a big mistake.

But we need to consider bigger picture wherein doge, pepe has pumped there are hundreds of meme coin project which fails and one few gets the limelight.
