But anyone who knows the words you are selecting from will have an easier time guessing the phrase. One problem with selecting from a subset of words is that the standard construction of the phrase involves a checksum. A wallet validating your phrase might say the phrase is invalid.The probability of a word being repeated in a 12-word (from 2048 words) phrase is 1 - 2048!/(2036!204812) = 3%Edit: I wrote that before reading your followup post. The is no possibility of success with a 24-word phrase because there are just too many possibilities. A 12-word phrase will take a very long time. There are tools that might help: btcrecover and FinderOuter",

Add in an unknown word and it becomes 2048 times more impossible. To be more precise, we may say that if unknown word is on the last position, could be treated as a checksum word (word which contains binary checksum), then the rest (23 words) produce 8 possibilities at the last position. So, it is possible to optimize algorithm that after checking 8th correct checksum, it is smart to update 23 first words and do not waste time on the last one.If you have unknown word in the middle, you may use similar evaluation, BUT it is not precise - because you modify checksum generator, you may say that statistically after 8 hits (for the given \"checksum word\" on the last position) you may skip work for that combination. Unfortunately, it could happen that more words modified in the middle produce the same checksum, so that approach is wrong (too optimistic). Maybe, maybe if you would set limit of hits to 9-10, it wild make more sense, but still - it is based on guessing.",

For HD wallets this entropy is processed by iteration of a key derivation function into a BIP39 seed of 512 bits length from which by rules of derivation path the private and public keys are derived.Your smaller selection of words will likely leed to a less random seed. It may still be safe but you can't be sure of that. I won't be happy not to know that my seed isn't safely random enough. And as indicated below, usually the mnemonic words are derived from the random seed, not the other way around.A repeated mnemonic word doesn't matter and can happen. This only means that a sequence of 11 bits is repeated in the seed at certain bit boundaries. While I don't think this happens often, I wouldn't worry too much about it. I'd be suspicious if a word is repeated three or more times because that means the seed is somewhat patterned (which technically can still happen with \"true\" randomness where every bit sequence in the seed is equally possible).Quote from: pooya87 on May 27, 2022, 03:52:43 AMConsidering that OP said they have the words, you should use factorial to compute all the combinations not a power.

That is 24*23*22*...*1=24! = 620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000This is not the way a mnemonic seed is made, except you're foolish enough to pick the words yourself from a foolishly chosen set of 24 words out of 2048 and you pick those 24 randomly one after the other from a diminishing set of words. This might not necessarily leed to a weak seed but there's a high chance that something in the process goes (horribly) wrong.The mnemonic seed words are a human readable representation of a random binary number. The random binary number comes first and is then translated into mnemonic words where every word out of 2048 represents 11 bits of that random binary number. A human is terrible to produce randomness by some arbitrary choice actions. Flipping a coin is OK, rolling dice is OK, if you want to produce 128 bits (12 words out of 2048) or 256 bits (24 words out of 2048) of random entropy.You can use a smaller word dictionary but then you'd have to use more words for the encoding into mnemonic seed words.",
