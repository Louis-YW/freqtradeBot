If this happens, chances are high that nations will be dragging who will hold more because no one wants to be left behind. Imagine what this will do to the price of a Bitcoin.

Anyways, this is just my imagination I think No, Bitcoin is somehow new to world leaders and also they might find it so risky due to its volatile nature plus this coin is commonly related to some illegal activities online which adds up the discouragement to adapt it legally.But for sure that once they already see that more countries are becoming successful with their adaption or adding it to their reserve then there's huge chance that the number of countries will make this happen will grow.So lets see on what US will do next year since for sure that their influence will gather a lot more attention also a deciding factor for some country to follow what they do.",

I do not like this idea of the government having a say on how the price of Bitcoin is going to be moving because I think when the US government begins to buy and other governments follows which is what is going to happen, they will begin to want to control the market and since they can not control the supply and demand directly, they will want to use news and policy to continue the market. The government getting involved very actively in Bitcoin is not going to be good for the market and that is why I wished the government let go and focus on other aspects to let the market grow genuinely without any input from them. The proposal is a good one but we should not only look at the advantage but also the disadvantages so we do not lose the independence that we have with investing in Bitcoin.",

If this happens, chances are high that nations will be dragging who will hold more because no one wants to be left behind. Imagine what this will do to the price of a Bitcoin. People have been thinking and asking questions, I am certain that Trump did not think this through before he pronounced it. He was desperate to win an election and indeed the people believed him and the market reacted in that direction. This may not be true when the real implementation starts and a single discouragement from Trump will have an adverse effect on the market. It has always been!But note that if the US can do this successfully, other nations will follow, however, I don't see how that will add to the USA or USD, if not subtracts. This means that Trump has \"shot his country in the leg.\"",

The proposal is a good one but we should not only look at the advantage but also the disadvantages so we do not lose the independence that we have with investing in Bitcoin.I want to tell you: we can only discuss and see how things go, we have no right or way to stop if the government wants to do that with bitcoin. So let's not discuss and worry about what we cannot change, instead, let's adapt to that change.I believe everyone knows the disadvantages that governments can cause to bitcoin but most understand that there is no way to stop governments from doing so. That is why you will not see anyone talking about the disadvantages but only focusing on the advantages it can bring. Similar to you, do you have any suggestions to stop the government from intervening and buying bitcoin? So let's look on the bright side and make the most of what we can to get the benefit.",
