I've heard of the same stories that they're not aware that the tangible money is prone to being eaten by termites or any other insects mainly if you've used a wooden piggy bank. Well, the good thing and difference of bitcoin is that it's intangible and you can keep it to a wallet that you hold the private keys which is the most important part.And as for the hardware wallet, it's a device that will also be dependent on how you'll keep it.",

From my story, I prefer investing because investing will give me a higher return even though it will take risk of loss to do so. Normally, I save little cash which is same as investing what I can afford to lose. Both helps to achieve a comfortable financial future.",

It's a great idea because you can get a great return on the increase in bitcoin prices over the next few years. You already have experience saving money and having a bad experience and should be able to share it with others so that they can follow your steps to save their money in bitcoins.Continue your efforts to save your money in bitcoin @OP before the price increases high, and you can find it difficult to start accumulating bitcoins. You still have time and can start whenever you want.",

Save wisely this new year, I'm starting my savings in piggybitcoin. Yea it is better to save in bitcoin due to some of its benefits but the one most important to me is its hedging ability against inflation.  Your mistake about saving fiat was in the piggy vest where it later got damaged or in other cases could be lost to theft or fire; in case an outbreak occurs. This disadvantages makes bitcoin a safer option. But not withstanding saving fiats is also very important even if it is little for daily keep ups or emergency funds and it’s like. Even though banks are frustrating sometime it still better to have them in it to avoid this problems. Cases like also redesigning of the notes were old notes need to be returned back to banks have actually discouraged the piggyvest saving method",

It may be small but eventually, I believe that its value will also increase, then bitcoin is proven and tested so I'm doing it honestly.Because I can't afford to buy 1 bitcoin myself, so it's just little by little and at least I'm saving something in my wallet using the Electrum wallet.",

Better to put your money into good use by solving problems with it or invest it on those/things that could use it to solve problems properly and profitably.If you put the money in so called piggybitcoin, also make sure it's with the right intention which is typically for the good of the Bitcoin Network and its members.(and societies at large). Don't build up riches/wealth or save money in this World for selfish reasons or for yourself. By the way, if you believe in GOD, you will benefit greatly by asking HIM to store up your good rewardsin Heaven in perfect security, which you can always access whenever you need to. Not a good idea to build up your rewards for yourself in this World.“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” — Matthew 6:19-21 KJV",
