  "content": "The acceptance of bitcoin as a means of payment in the well-known Philippine island of Boracay can't be stopped anymore,I just can't imagine that even in a simple store this will happen even when buying loads or prepaid cards, it's already started.This is the funny thing, even in a sari-sari store you can buy soda or soft drinks, whatever chips, bottled water and candy,and so on you can buy with bitcoin.Even in haircuts, bitcoin is accepted as payment, it's interesting to think that even the barber knows the process of paying bitcoin or accepting it in his small salon or barbershop.Final thoughts and Summary:Based on and in agreement with this article Bitcoin Island(Boracay) has shown that digital payment recognizes Bitcoin in the following:1. Hotel2. Bars3. Restaurants3. Variety Store4. Barbershop/Small Salon5. Telco (prepaid credits)6. Coffee shops7. Some tricycle drivers accept bitcoinThis is a good start on this island, because the one who will benefit from it is not only the foreign tourists but also the residents of this area who will gradually become aware of the benefits of bitcoin. I just hope that this style will spread more and more throughout the Philippines.Reference : https://bitpinas.com/op-ed/i-got-a-haircut-in-boracay-and-paid-with-bitcoin/?fbclid=IwAR219tLXBXPhmR2GNp3V7NpRY-lIwmkhjuwtydvdiyL0HwO5MSaCJTJyUwk",

However, the question arises whether tourists can pay with Bitcoin in any other way or exclusively using the app of the company behind this project?I hope that some other popular tourist destinations will follow this example, because they definitely have nothing to lose, and considering that the popularity of Bitcoin is growing year by year, I hope that there will be more and more people who will start using it as a currency. I will definitely put this island on my wish list when it comes to travelingüèù",

I am starting to think more and more things like this will push BTC acceptance faster then some other methods.People coming in for vacations and seeing that some smallish place can do it then why can't some larger ones. This would make more people look into BTC as a viable option for their business and so on. Don't know if it will really happen that way but it's a thought.Side note, is that you in the pictures?-Dave",

I know that there are very conflicting views when it comes to LN, but for those who want to pay quickly and cheaply with BTC, it is the only logical way.However, I would like to see classic on-chain payments supported, because if you sit down in a restaurant or cafe and pay the appropriate fee, the transaction will certainly be confirmed until you finish.",

It is interesting when tourists can pay for a little thing as a haircut with BTC, people would want to try it out, and many people will follow, in the end people will get to use BTC more often. Some people don't also like the idea of BTC being held only, so if this idea becomes a popular thing in many places, it helps for BTC to be spent duly as a currency.",

Well she said yes.This is the photo she took earlier.This photo was originally taken from my sister's iPhone.So it's a big signage along with the iconic Bitcoin logo. Due to her limited time, she didn't have a chance to go to the store and ask for the prices (especially the barber shop).

Those mobile currency apps in the countries can be easily replaced if projects like Pouch.ph give access it for root level people. It will obviously avoid the transaction confirmation delay.

Good job to the PH local crypto wallet called Pouch.ph for their effort in turning this into reality. I know they've made enough effort as they need to educate these merchants on how Bitcoin transaction works. Not everyone knew about it anyways.

Don't think that it doesn't exist in other countries, maybe you're just not aware of it because you didn't get that information. There are thousands of online stores that accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, and some have their own physical branches, and I think that the problem is not that there are no more physical stores, but that most people do not want to pay with Bitcoin for the reason that they consider it exclusively an investment.If you want changes in this matter, then I would advise you to contact some of the shops where you would be happy to pay with Bitcoin and to activate your local community to do the same. Nothing will change by itself, no matter how long you wait for it.",
