It is also worth knowing that most altcoins are gambling, you can lose money if you invest in them, but if you invest the amount of money that you can afford to lose in altcoins and you make money from them, it is better you convert them as fast as possible before they will lose value again. It is better to invest in bitcoin.You can earn with signature campaign on this forum, but that does not means that you are also earning in dollar. You earn in bitcoin. Maybe you are thinking that signature campaigners are earning in dollar because most campaigns are using dollar to estimate the pay rate. That is not true because other currencies like euro or pounds sterling can also be used but dollar is mostly known to people and the reason. The payment is in bitcoin, not dollar.",

This recently isn't up to $30 when converted and it's something one could make within one or two weeks if you earn in dollar. It's high time we should work for dollars rather than naira. Working for dollars can be done through the following:It is a very good way to earn in dollars in Nigeria since most of our goods we use here are imported from outside countries which they use dollar as a means of exchange. Even the so called market women who plant and grow their products here are also increasing the price of their goods because they had dollar has risen, so such will the money for their goods also rise which is now a normal here in Nigeria. When people complaint they immediately bring the rise in dollar into conversation. Even the layman that knows nothing about naira to dollar rating and conversion rate have also been using the depreciation of naira to dollar to sell goods in higher prices. Sometimes I donâ€™t want to blame them because they must have bought other things they might have used in growing their plants for an increased price that was already affected by the dollar rise. Even that being said, most of the prices are too much when you compare them to the high price of goods in relation to what the dollar cost now. It is not even the increase in price of petroleum that is leading to all this, it has been happening since before now. In conclusion, where I am getting at is that; earring in dollar will only make you live a balanced lifestyle between now and later, it will be as if your income is not increasing and neither is it reducing. When you earn in dollar and the price of naira to dollar depreciates, youâ€™ll get more naira during conversion. Now going to the market to buy goods, the price most have shoot up and youâ€™ll end up buying at a higher price than it was before. The worst of it all, is when naira appreciates against dollar, the prices of those goods will hardly fall back but rather they will remain like that. You can now see that, when we are still trying to find other means of having a better life by earning in other currencies, back home we are still being embezzled by our own people again.",

Bitcoin is specifically is a currency of its own that is decentralized rather its values is considered on USD ($) since the USD ($) is already a World reserved principal currency. Meanwhile the inventory technology of Bitcoin is served a means of exchange where you can exchange your coin of Bitcoin or any related cryptocurrencies to central authority (any currency) including naira.You basically earn in USD($) when only your payment source is specifically relied on USD($) and doesn't really matters the nature of your earning.",

There are really online jobs that pays in dollars but how to get link to those online jobs is also a challenge. People who knows about such jobs rather keep it to themselves rather than giving others information on how to go about it. I think we need more work to do in order to change this narrative that most Nigerians are fraudsters and our government have also aided in the high rate of fraudsters in the country because when fraudsters or scammers are caught instead of the government to bring them to book they rather take huge bribes from them and leave them to continue with their illegal businesses.",
