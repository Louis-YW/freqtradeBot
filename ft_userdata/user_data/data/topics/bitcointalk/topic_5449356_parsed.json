  "content": "WoC is a new masternode coin that aims to advance the integration of cryptospace into the real world.This is not about quick profits through absurdly high ROI or a use case for any small defined groups (which then never come into contact with the coin anyway)! It's not about speculative investments and then (maybe) buying back your own coins!The value of WoC will arise solely from the benefit, because circulation and low new distributions (between 30% to 50% ROI per year - possibly significantly less) will also create demand. Services are gradually being developed and provided which have a real benefit, an example would be shops for very different things (clothing, electrical items, food and drink...). We have many different ideas which we will only publish gradually. Before we announce a new service, it should first be tested. We don't want to make a long list of promises that we might not be able to keep in the end, be it for technical or other reasons.All of the services we provide will be NonCustodial, no need to hand over coins at any point (except to pay for something of course - but that should be obvious). In order to increase security, there are already considerations to secure the payment processes at blockchain level to make it significantly more difficult for fraudulent traders! An integration of other coins at a later date cannot be ruled out, in which case the security functions at the blockchain level will of course not be available.With WoC you build the bridge between the digital and the analogue world - Buy real, tangible things with your WoC !CoindetailsPremine: 500,000 PoW Blocks: 1 - 1000PoS Blocks: Starting from 1001Block Time: 60 SecondsTotal Supply: 11,000,000Collateral: 10,000 WoC Rewards Breakdown---| Block        | Block Reward   | MN Reward % | Staking Reward % | MN Reward | Staker Reward || ---------    | --------------    | -----------       | ----------------       | ---------      | ------------- || 1              | 100,000          | \\-                   | \\-                         | \\-               | \\-            || 6              | 0.05               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.04            | 0.01          || 50,001      | 0.10               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.08            | 0.02          || 100,001    | 0.02               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.16            | 0.04          || 150,001    | 0.04               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.32            | 0.08          || 300,001    | 0.06               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.48            | 0.12          || 450,001    | 0.08               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.64            | 0.16          || 600,001    | 1.00               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.80            | 0.20          || 900,001    | 1.50               | 80                  | 20                        | 1.20            | 0.30          || 1,200,001 | 2.00               | 80                  | 20                        | 1.60            | 0.40          || 1,800,001 | 3.00               | 80                  | 20                        | 2.40            | 0.60          || 2,400,001 | 2.50               | 80                  | 20                        | 2.00            | 0.50          || 3,000,001 | 2.10               | 80                  | 20                        | 1.68            | 0.42          || 3,600,001 | 1.30               | 80                  | 20                        | 1.04            | 0.26          || 4,200,001 | 0.70               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.56            | 0.14          || 4,800,001 | 0.40               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.32            | 0.08          || 5,400,001 | 0.25               | 80                  | 20                        | 0.20            | 0.05          |---Website: https://walletofcoin.com/Explorer: https://explorer.walletofcoin.com/GitHub: https://github.com/JeanLuc70/WocCoin",

It's always important to be cautious when downloading files from unknown sources, especially when there are red flags such as an inactive account that has recently been reset and a non-secure webpage.",
