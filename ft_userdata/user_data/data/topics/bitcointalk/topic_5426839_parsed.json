There's no requirement for being an investor to bitcoin and I think people from rural areas are more eager to own bitcoin because after they understand the concept of bitcoin, that might push them to start investing and accumulating it.Although, it's a valid point that most rural areas have slack in internet connection and not everyone there understands the new technologies that are emerging, there's just a need to spread awareness and have some education and awareness drive about bitcoin and it'll be a good progress to the citizens out there.",

People in rural area or aged people without Internet knowledge are often out of reach for bitcoin Investments, maybe In the future the use of USSD code for bitcoin transaction will help spread it information to these people. But right now we can say that its out of there reach.Another thing is what level of wealth do one needs to have to invest in bitcoin. At this point I think If one could spare at least $1 a day then the person will be able invest in bitcoin you don't really need to amase excess wealth to invest in it. The other thing is bitcoin isn't a daily profit thing to actually call an investment. The investment part is for long time holders. So when creating awareness for bitcoin potential investors should be thought that extra wealth is needed to be able to invest for long term",

Not sure where you are, but if you will have to check Africa, I think crypto is thriving there because of the things that you have told.There are no bank access, so what they do, invest on bitcoin, no cell phone? I doubt it, if the continent with poor infrastructure would have mobile phones so what stopping others in other part of the continent.I think this is just a classic example on how poor people behave though, just saying. You really have to make the best of what you have instead of complaining.",

You have wrong perception on Bitcoin investment. You don’t need to hold huge amount Bitcoin if you are not financially stable. Even a small piece of Bitcoin will be valuable in the future that will be helpful for people living on rural place to get out of poverty. Bitcoin in general doesn’t promise profit but it’s value is destined to grow in the future due to its cutting edge technology and supply scarcity. Poverty is already existing since the world begun and until it’s not yet solved since it’s part of the system. You can’t get out of it without doing out the norm such as find a job that gives huge salary, business or investment such as Bitcoin. You don’t need to become financially stable to invest in Bitcoin because you can always start with small amount and just increase base on your financial capabilities.",

This is one of the poorest countries in the world, where vast majority of people don't even have electricity. let alone Internet so what can Bitcoin really do for them? Very little, or nothing.  So instead focusing on getting their country in order first, they rather declared Bitcoin as legal tender, expecting it to help them rise from poverty or whatnot. Quote from: Beparanf on December 08, 2022, 11:16:45 AMYou don’t need to become financially stable to invest in Bitcoin because you can always start with small amount and just increase base on your financial capabilities. You don't have to be rich, but you still have to have some financial stability as you are supposed to buy bitcoin (if you gonna use it as an investment) with money that you can afford to lose. If you are having barely enough money to get by and no saving, I don't think that it is a smart thing to invest in bitcoin. Rather sort our your finance first and then start investing.",

The awareness in rural areas is actually very good, there is no limit to learning, and you must not be in urban or developed place before investing in bitcoin. Investing in bitcoin is a choice, everyone can do that regardless of your location if you actually knows everything about it, and you have basic knowledge about how the blockchain works then you are good to go. I can be in a rural are and have interest in Bitcoin then, I will just go out and look for network then place my investment.",

Creating awareness is good but instead of promoting the bitcoin usage first thing to tell them about the centralized monetary system and why we are stuck in the poverty or middle class even though we earn more than previous years, no matter how hard we work we can't able to reach financial stability.Bitcoin is a tool to overcome this centralized monetary system however it doesn't provide income unless you're earning bitcoin and able to hold it so creating awareness about saving and investing should be the priority than promoting bitcoin for such people.",

Bitcoin is like gold or other investments, it is just a profitable investment channel and, of course, comes with risks. Anyone can invest in bitcoin as long as they have the will to get better in the future then they can invest in it, do not wait until there is a stable economy to invest in bitcoin because then you will miss many opportunities.

Yes.. I agree with what you just said above, because to own Bitcoin one needs finance, and to be financially free, one needs a job or an on demanding skill, which Bitcoin doesn't offer any of such. But however, that's not enough reason not to speak about what you strongly believe in i.e \"Bitcoin\" in our various locality, because you don't know who may have heard of such and never knew the right mentor to meet, and you speaking out openly may be an opportunity they may have been waiting for. But in a community of poor people where there is no internet connection is indeed a wrong place to preach about Bitcoin, because of what use will it be since to practicalized Bitcoin learning, one needs an internet connection",

The Internet, if it exists in the villages, is not of interest to the villagers.But sometimes we see people who do not agree with their life in the countryside move to areas where there is advanced technology. What prevents them in this case from gaining knowledge about bitcoin? I think nothing. All you need is a desire and a job that pays enough to be able to set aside some funds for investments.

Just the way we need fiat currency is also the same way we need bitcion because it is a digital currency with a greater benefits when you hodl.
