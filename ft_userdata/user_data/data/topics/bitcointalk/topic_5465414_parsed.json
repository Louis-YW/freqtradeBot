  "content": "Hello,I'm domain seller but this time I couldn't make a single sale and I'm broke.I've $90 balance in NameCheap.com which are good to purchase domains and hosting.But I need a fast cash, So I will purchase a domain from you for $60 on NameCheap if you can send $23 to me in Bitcoins.After $6 commission, You will have $54 on NameCheap. But since the $24 ($23 bitcoin + $1 domain) is your investment, Your profit is $30.You can use Paxful if you only have PayPal to send bitcoins to me.Let's do it. Only for trusted members. We will do the transaction in two steps either.I'm grateful.[ FYI: There's an internet shutdown in my state, That's why I couldn't make a sale and wasted my money in the process to move to another state. https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/ethiopia-internet-shutdown-in-amhara-region-as-clashes-surge-kbpyllre ] [ I'm not begging anyhow, I'm just telling my story so you guys could be able to do the deal with full information. Thank you very much. ]",
