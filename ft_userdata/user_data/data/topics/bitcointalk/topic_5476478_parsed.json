  "content": "Hello, I've always had a question, so this question is aimed at those who are \"older\" in BTC, if you're not that old, feel free to give your opinion too!considering the value in fiat, money we earn and use dailylet's assume that you bought BTC at 10 dollars, obviously over time it has appreciated in value numerous times compared to fiat, how do you feel about this, not in terms of increasing your purchasing power and having improved your life with this etc, of course, but in terms of the fact that if I had bought it at 10 dollars, any amount above that I would feel like I was paying \"expensively\"... so what is it like to deal with this, for example, doing your DCA at a price of 30, 40 thousand dollars, knowing that it is still low, but compared to its initial price it is extremely \"expensive\"...Do you think it's expensive to take a fund of 15 thousand compared to what you paid in the past? how do you deal with this?I don't know if I was able to be clear in what I wanted to know, so if I have any doubts I can change my argument  edit: There must be a feeling of always buying at the top of the market, or am I wrong?",

      "body": "To fit into this part of the forum it would have be the marketplace effect globally on an appreciating asset used as currency.   The strange twist to this question is 100 years ago, not that long a while but its still just about in living memory of the very oldest people but anyhow this also applied to US dollars.  Dollars at one time gained in value not the constant loss we see now.  So its not just about Bitcoin, it could be about even the most common money of all in theory.  The only relic of that old dollar is the debt ceiling deal they have to keep renewing because nominal numbers have no ceiling any more, everything just keeps going up and debt is never repaid in dollar government terms anyhow.So what tends to happen with a good currency is people hold onto what they earnt or acquired and choose carefully when spending.  Its still quite possible to spend BTC and rebuy it at a cheaper price, even within the trend rising theres been a ton of times you could do this.   So I can remember BTC under 100 dollars, not as low as some though I did mine BTC when it was pennies but I failed to keep it sadly.   I'd say people do spend BTC because some things are essential and even possible some items have a greater utility then the asset which is rising.  I got a monitor using BTC as my old one was CRT, I would be blind by now if I hadnt got something better then 15\" size for viewing webpages.  I had plenty chance to buy back the BTC I spent, thats the main thing its not always rising constantly, average back in is fine imo dont be too stubborn about it.",

If I were into bitcoin, and had bought it at very cheap price in those early days, and if I sold it and used the profit for something worthy, I'll look back on the achievement from the profit and feel fulfilled. Nobody knows the future, so what if the early buyers had accumulated and bitcoin became worthless today, won't they have regrets of not selling when it appreciated then?",

Even if you think that 10+ years ago someone paid only $10 for 1 BTC, maybe even then they considered it an expensive investment considering that they could mine even 50 BTC per block with their personal computer.Of course, anyone who has invested at such low prices can regret from time to time that they didn't buy more, but I don't see the slightest logic in anyone seriously breaking their head about it, and at the same time not learning anything from it all. Even today, Bitcoin is actually very cheap considering the potential it has, but again I note not only because of the price compared to fiat, but also because of its characteristic that it cannot (at least not completely) be censored. I personally have no problem with what you are asking, I bought and spent BTC when it was only worth a few hundred $, and I do the same today.",

When someone purchased Bitcoin long time ago at a lower price, then they deserve the profit that they're getting for being one of the earliest folks that have trusted and believed Bitcoin when the whole world doubted it.While the happiness is there for the older ones that have bought it cheaply. And for those new buyers and investors that have seen the charts and history, they don't have to feel regret when it was cheaper before. Because you have to think of it that for every season, there is a reason. And it's not that late at all, like what you've said that it can still be cheaper this time when in the future it's going to be more expensive.That's the cycle that we're seeing for those new investors and all you need to do is to consider your status, whether you're going to keep on believing and holding. Or you're going to feel regret and dwell in the past instead of moving forward.",

In fact, my thoughts would be more directed towards selling it to get more profit if the price comparison was that big for the same item.

If I may get correctly DCA can play a vital role where we seems not to have any money at hand maybe you thought you budget isn't sufficient enough to cover your target and the amount you wanted to purchase and accumulate that is why most people do gets involved in DCA but having sufficiently enough and you with positive mindsets as Bitcoiner you knew certainly the price of bitcoin would surely increase buy a huge some of bitcoin is more better than having part your funds by doing DCA which I think lots of people do missed some golden opportunities at the point DCA'ing.That is why at the time purchase or investment you might feel that you wanna waste your resources without knowing the future of what you hold, even those that purchase 10k btc or above if those people knew it would be something great today they wouldn't have mind acquire bunch of it, so do not regret there are still time but if you must not regret again I suggest you should purchase enough this time around.",

There is a very big gap in terms of profit that should have been archived if they held those coins from when they bought at a very low price to when the price has now gotten to $40k, while some people are buying now that the price is high. There's a statement I came across—I can't actually remember where it was—but it said, \"Everyone bought Bitcoin at the price they deserved.\" There's no need to regret buying Bitcoin when the price is high because you cannot turn back the hands of time to make Bitcoin $10 before you can buy it. Your only choice is to be positive and keep accumulating Bitcoin for every low price you can buy it and hold for a very long time, and you will surely be making a profit.",

But frankly speaking, my own limited understanding of the market is the main reason, and up until now, even if I accepted to buy bitcoin at this price, it would always be a bargain. In investing, our ultimate goal is to aim for profit to be able to spend and develop for life. With the crypto market, I can only feel that it will grow over time and that there will also be ups and downs related to the macroeconomy. So don't just think that the starting position/or timing make you feel comfortable with the market.I'm still imagining that there are actually many of them who will still pay attention to investing. Of course, there will be only a few. At that age, life experience will make them knowledgeable enough to make appropriate decisions. Rather, we are just speculating about things about which the object we are talking does not exist at this issue.",

The most normal thing is that at the beginning when you didn't know it very well you bought a little, and then you sold some when the price went up, but if you have done well over the years you will have maintained a positive trend of accumulation despite buying at some times and selling at others. It's rare not to find a bitcoin user who hasn't made profits via bitcoin. The argument has to do with greed, earning too many profits. As you said, you bought at a smaller rate and sold during a time of a bit price increase. Somehow, we all have been through it, made a few bucks out of bitcoin, which we didn't labor to earn. Contrarily, all bitcoin holder has lost a few bucks in bitcoin according to the accumulated bitcoin. The regret arrives when we begin to see the bigger picture of bitcoin and the profit potentials of bitcoin, if we don't sell a single Sat. But, that doesn't matter as Lucius said; the technology is quite deeper than the shallow price trends attached to USD. Many hodlers don't sell regardless of the trend; bull or bear. A significant illustration of the power of bitcoin, as a currency, not an avenue for generating profits. So, purchasing a product we once owned at a higher price than what it used to be, doesn't occur only in bitcoin. When cars were first invented, it was cheaper than what it is today. However, we can argue this in the form of inflation, as the old price has almost a similar buying power to today's price. Associating such ideology to bitcoin we can easily attest to the changes of bitcoin price as an increase in trust. When the price was cheaper, in a few $100 investors didn't trust bitcoin, with their money, that's why they didn't accumulate up to 20BTC. While those who did, sold it, because of personal real-life situations. Which is normal, and not a problem. Remember 20 BTC then should be around $2000, still a significant amount of money 10 years ago. In my country, 2000$ then was about $600 in value via purchasing power. I'd comfortably say that $600 10 years ago is worth $2000 today. Due to a change in dollar value. Since the dollar is highly inflated the price of bitcoin to dollar per BTC will continue increasing. It doesn't remove the fact that 1BTC = 1BTC. The difference in inflation contrarily to bitcoin is that the value of the dollar decreases. The person who holds $600 10 years ago till date won't get any reward for hodling such an amount in fiat. But, $600 worth of bitcoin 10 years back is about 6 btc at a rate of $100 per coin, if I'm not mistaken. But the person is certainly rewarded with close to 200k USD. Hence, the price is huge enough to beat the inflation, giving back the investor a profit worth more than he invested. These statistics and calculations in price increase leave an average bitcoin investor or scholar to think they've missed on a golden opportunity. But, bitcoin opportunity doesn't come once, it's here looking at everyone interested in investing. It's still very cheap according to Lucius's response. The same year the price dropped below 20k dollars and now the reward is doubled and still increasing. In simple terms, bitcoin is a money that provides a huge interest but is highly volatile. It's better to save money in a bitcoin wallet than in banks. So, the profits associated with bitcoin, aren't the reason why users shouldn't trade their coins for fiat to settle bills. Sometimes we can run out of savings. Those who don't will be rewarded handsomely for saving money in Bitcoin.",
