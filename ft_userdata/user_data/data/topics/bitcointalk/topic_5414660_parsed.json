  "content": "T-mobile broadband Internet has been slow lately. There are questions on the Net asking why. I think it is recent solar flares that have knocked a whole bunch of Elon Musk's satellites out. T-mobile and others are hooked up to Musk's satellites. So, broadband isn't working so well.This probably happened about two weeks ago. Speed is coming back up, but it isn't full, yet.Search on \"solar flares\" - https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=recent+solar+flare&ia=web.
