I get a message:The server returned an error when sending a transaction. Try connecting to another server or updating electrum. The transaction was rejected because it was too large (in bytes). What should I do?",

He can just reduce the inputs by send the coins in many transactions to the exchange.",

I'm curious: how many inputs did you collect? Two years with daily deposits means more than 700 inputs, which indeed leads to a very large transaction (and thus a high transaction fee).For what it's worth: if you can avoid collecting small inputs, for instance by making it a weekly instead of a daily transaction, you save a lot on fees by avoiding many dust inputs. See Mempool empty! Use this opportunity to Consolidate your small inputs! for more information.",
