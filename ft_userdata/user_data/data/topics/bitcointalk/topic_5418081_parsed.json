      "body": "Ethereum is already not available for mining after they change there algorithm to PoS. You can only earn Ethereum through staking or become a validator. There is no answer to your question but if you are assuming that ETH will goes back to PoW in the future then the answer is yes because miners will keep coming on ETH since it's the second largest blockchain in crypto space next to Bitcoin. The future of this token is guaranteed success. Everyone is watching this coin so this tcoin will be profitable as always.",

But asking if it's profitable, I would like to say yes. It's still the 2nd top altcoin in the market and that's why it's highly profitable in the future.Don't forget about the upgrade that has been made to it has certainly improved a lot through the Ethereum London upgrade. And one of its features was a burning mechanism for each of the transactions that we make, a fee or portion of Ethereum from there is burned currently.",

To become a validator on Ethereum, users must invest 32 ETH.Read more here",

If, however, the centrality and centralization that is now gaining momentum in ETH grows strongly, it could prompt a migration of investors and users. The demand for the blockchain space will decline and ETH's leadership will diminish markedly. ETH's competitors are not napping. Something similar is now happening in the stablecoin sector, where censored USDT is slowly losing market share to USDC.",

Ethereum can't be mined, but the algorithm over which the network runs is quite effective than many other blockchain.And the reality is that even the market is very volatile and there could be other technologies that might replace Ethereum as what are others thinking about.The foundation that Ethereum has set to its entirety is hard to beat and that's why if it's relative to its profitability, we can say that it's still profitable even it has changed its consensus algo in a pos. The rich will be richer with that algo and that's why many have invested heavily on it.",

The only way to make profit is to create your investment or trading strategy, the profit that you can have will always be depend on how you execute your strategies. ETH is still a good coin, understand the changes and you can see how you can take advantage of the market situation right now.",

There are lots of things to be considered. Just imagine those who claimed they have cheap electricity bills or are closed to free are even struggling to get a profit***.",

I am not saying that it will be like x100 or something, sure there are very very rare alts that will do insanely well that people would be very much in love with and ETH won't do as good as that. But there is a very small risk with ETH if you ask me, and thats a very good thing. I believe that we shouldn't be really expecting it to do anything shocking, but it will go up, it will be about 10k which is good enough, not something that will make you wealthy and suddenly get you 10 houses or something, but its good compared to stock market at least.",

Even now, the price of ethereum has gone up a few percent from before, which means if you bought ethereum at yesterday's low, now is the time to sell some and keep the rest of the ethereum on hold.

The only way to earn Ethereum is through staking which doesn't require any electricity. I think Ethereum moving to the PoS was their best decision so far. Ethereum is more like the google of the cryptocurrency world. Majority of the projects utilized her service for whatever they intend offering so without Ethereum been compatible, many project will fail to exist and the so called better layer 1 blockchain aren't reliable as they're either too centralized or underdeveloped. As for the price of Ethereum, it'll keep rising with Bitcoin just as we're seeing in the current bounce of the market. Ethereum has lots of trust from both VC and normal investors so it should definitely do well long term.",
