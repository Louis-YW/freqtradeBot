  "content": "One of the real reasons why many NFT collectors fail to deliver their NFT’s on the market is that they usually just stay in virtual space. However, if we can integrate the NFT arts in the physical world, I believe this collection would be notable and people would recognize it more as more people would buy merchandise that they would use in their daily life, such as t-shirts. To further discuss how Artlink works, I will briefly describe it below.Artlink is here to bridge the gap between NFT, Web3 lovers and the Web2 world by unleashing the true potential of non-fungible tokens through their underlying licenses. We’re here to add real utility and value for collectors, everyday owners, projects and brands far above just borrowing and lending.So what is Artlink?Artlink is a staking platform that takes into account an NFTs license, then makes it available on projects built on top of it. That means a user can stake a single NFT without researching the license and instantly start receiving royalties (up to 85%) of all transactions involving their NFT.The first product built on Artlink is Merch Nation which we believe will become the home of NFT Merch. Merch Nation gives shoppers access to NFTs staked within Artlink on high quality products made by AS Colour and others including framed art (coming soon™).Following the launch of Merch Nation we’ll begin development of a stock platform which gives anyone the ability to pay to use the art within an NFT — think of it like the Shutterstock of NFTs.",
