We must give and allow time for Bitcoin to gain the traction and global acceptance it requires before certain projections can be achieved.",

However, those speculations you see people saying are what have occurred before while Bitcoin was still at more teenage age, and as such still likely to repeat it's in near future after halving. Hence, if you can have a look at the image below, you will noticed that 365 days later after 2012 halving, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed over 8,069%, and likewise how 365 days later after 2016 halving, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed 284%, and same as 365 days after 2020 halving, how the price of Bitcoin went 559%, of which after 365 days after next year's 2024 halving, we are likely not to expect anything less than 200% increase in the price of BitcoinImage credit: Coindeck",

Bitcoin is unstoppable, and I admit it's on the primary stage yet. Bitcoin doesn't have mass adaptation yet, like the stock market. Bitcoin would reach $1 million as well, but we need a lot of time to see it. The world is moving forward with digitization, so our next generation will move with that. A lot of new investors, including institutional investors, are starting to move into Bitcoin. So yeah, once Bitcoin matures, we will see a huge impact.",

Although sometimes their predictions are off the mark and the price is too high.More people predicting the price of bitcoin will create positive news for bitcoin and this will make it work organically and more people will do it interested in holding bitcoin.

We, as individuals, or, let me say, as bitcoinners, can moderate our own level of expectation towards what we want the price of bitcoin to be in the future, and this expectation is easily driven by recent happenings and speculation around the network. But to some point we can't moderate the minds of those who are coming new into the crypto world, and even most old bitcoiners also fall into the same category of always expecting much from the network, forgetting the fact that too much expectation of something is equally what leads to disappointment. Having too much hope that it will hit an exact price in a predicted period of time is really something craze for us to do. There is nothing bad in expecting an asset hold by someone to do well, but overdoing it usually has some negative effects when it doesn't happen as we expected it to.",

I understand the point and people shouldn't expect a lot so when it isn't reached, you don't get hurt with your feelings. That is a good concern.While the time passes by, you'll see more high price speculations especially when it starts to hit the 6 digits mark.

Yeah mate, no worries. I understand it and that's what they're also missing when they just look at the projection of the price of Bitcoin and then forget everything about it.

Bitcoin is still young, but many people wants it to be worth a million even before it turns 18 years old, when we can actually consider it a full adult.

For me, I accept my faith in whatever outcome I get and am not very bet on resting my hope on one thing. Let's assume that Bitcoin doesn't get to $100k this coming bull market. I don't see myself getting affected in any way unless the fact that I might not actually achieve the profit I was expecting means that if I don't get the profit, I could still sell off some holdings and wait for the bear market to buy more.",
