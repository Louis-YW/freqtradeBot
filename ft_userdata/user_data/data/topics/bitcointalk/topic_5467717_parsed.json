I'm not an expert but still, I think as far as it relates to the private key generation the total possible values are going to be 2^256 , it's an extremely large number as 1.157920892373162e+77, can I ask a question OP why you need all possible combinations of a private key.Also, I'm not sure about your context and can't reply efficiently but from what I understood I think you need something like, But be sure as these are just test kits they cant crack the high difficulty keys. Can you explain more to get efficient assistance why you need the key cracking?Keygen.sh: https://keygen.sh/GitHub repository: bitcoinjs-lib: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-libEven these cant help you with the generation of key... as the total number of combinations are too large..Any other member can help you more but that is all I can do with the information OP you've provided me.",
