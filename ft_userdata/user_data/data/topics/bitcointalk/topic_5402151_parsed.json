This is my choice for those centralized stable coins and for the decentralized option, it will be DAI.It's first time to hear DEI and I thought you mistyped it but after looking at the history of it, yeah, it's already depegged and dropped from the typical pricing of a stable coin which is $0.99 - $1.The reason for choosing those centralized stable coins is I think these companies that backs it are still strong IMO.",

All that can be trusted is the central administration that is behind that project. And even this is not a 100% reliable source when we remember what happened with the Bitfinex platform, which is the first developer of this type of currency when it was discovered that it was not backed by sufficient reserves of the dollar.",

If the binance exchange is charged and destroyed it will be a hundred times worse than the crash caused by Luna so don't expect this it's just FUD out of hundreds of other FUDs",

Binance is the number crypto exchange so I doubt that its BUSD will supper depegged way below 1USD since it has a lot of reserved funds to backed its value and maintain it pegged to 1USD. But still, we should spread our investment in different stablecoins so that our money is protected once any of them suffer terrible losses.
