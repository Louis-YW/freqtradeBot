Is anyone else effected by this? Miners are great and have made the 108 block backup into a 7 block backup in a week, keep going miners!",

In ethereum, it was fun when the block reward was 2 coins, and the commission was 50-200 coins, and this went on for weeks. These were golden times for miners.",

I suspect the initial excitement has died down and people trading Ordinals aren’t consuming as much block space as they were when it was new and exciting. That leaves more space for other transactions which allows the mempool to clear and the cost of transacting to go down.",

Not really sure bout the nitty-gritty but I guess it has something to do with congestion of transaction within the network as it's expected that more and more people will buy and sell during these crunch times (correct me if I'm wrong with this). Add to this the expected surge of activity within the network courtesy of Ordinals and their shenanigans (which I am not really against since it's about time bitcoin gets its own NFT), and expect a pretty nasty increase in fees in the next months or so.",

Because when it comes down, people that want join the blockchain will be happy to join it easily without the fear of spend high money again. And when it goes up, those how have saved enough will be happy to sell at that time so the price is good at all time. Like today being the 2nd of May, the Mempool is full and I have not seen such fee in any of my transactions before. The few is very high that I canceled the transaction.",

No, BTC does not need its own NFT... Folks already bitch about the local storage needed to run a full node and BTC was intended as a means for having an immutable open ledger for storing/transferring the chain of a currency, in this case BTC,from its creation to current ownership, if desired, also including a short bit of text that can be used as 'notes'. For pure efficiency it should remain so. It was never intended to be a ledger/storage method for any form of data such as contracts, images, etc. There are numerous side-chains (ran by companies...) that can be used for NFT crap and smart contracts etc but of course records documenting the chain of ownership can be stored on the BTC blockchain much like Ordinals do. Only difference is that Ordinals actually store their crappy 32kb 'artwork' on the main chain as well as just track its movement from wallet to wallet using actual - but very tiny, like BTC0.0001 btc - transactions holding the full 32k of possible data to go with it.Yay Taproot that allowed this mess...   The only good part is they usually pay very hefty fees for that 32vkb tx.That said today has seen mempool showing some insane fees - many are well over 1BTC of fees being rewarded",

Imagine what is going to happen in a bull run.Agree but unless you get the law involved you cannot do anything about people scamming newbs. Most of the energy going into it is like \"look I can waste my money and also spend way too much on fee per bytes even though no one is forcing me to by any means necessary\". Kind of like spending a fuck ton of money on food with gold on it so you can post it on instagram to like 200~ followers or something. That kind of shit is clogging up society in many ways not just Bitcoin but ultimately theres no magic trick behind it. Pretty much all these things they are paying for will become worthless just like all other NFTs even ones collected by Celebrity Douchebags https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-logan-paul-s-623k-2021-nft-now-worth-10-here-s .For the record yes Logan Paul is generally irrelevant even when he is mentioned in something and he certainly is not a blockchain wizard or educated in anything useful. However it goes to show that even a guy with a billion blind young rich followers cannot sell this absolute crap to anyone. It will die slowly or fast depending on how much money the buyers have and how many drug addictions the sellers have.",

They are using some custodial wallet participating in the coordinated spam attack on the Bitcoin base layer.2. They are people like Udi who enjoy wasting money on fees to brag about making others pay more for casual payments. They have also been enlisting Bots of the shiba and dogecoin pump n dump type that spam twitter everyday causing tons of newbs to get scammed as well.Only way to avoid this is to be VOCALLY AGAINST SCAMMERS LIKE UDI AND THE TAPROOT WIZARDS",
