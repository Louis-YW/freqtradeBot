You could avoid this scam if you used escrow from this list. You have trusted someone who is a newbie who has no reputation on the forum and whom you can't trace. We should believe someone who has rank/reputation or we can trace if there happens anything wrong.",

So you had to deal through an escrow service, there will be a reliable person in this dealing as a mediator between you and the seller, and he gets the account from the seller as a mortgage and makes sure that the account is free of any advanced security measures and changes the password and email and when you transfer the agreed amount to the seller, this trusted person sends the account information to you. It's okay, you have learned the lesson now, and I hope you do not trust anyone you do not know unless you take guarantees and procedures that prevent you from falling into fraud.",

OP, although we can no longer get what's taken from you unless that guy voluntarily returns it to you.Follow the tips that were given to you by SFR and also, when you're dealing with someone that doesn't have a reputation in the forum, just follow the advise of hiring an escrow. The fee won't be a lot for your safety and also the sellers safety. If you encounter someone again in the future that don't agree to take one and none of you willing to send first, then that's a red flag and both of you are thinking the same. That's why always end up in choosing an escrow.",
