There is hypothesis that he does not have the address on which he wanted to receive the loan and that address belongs to someone from whom he will buy the credit. Of course, this is an extreme hypothesis, but it is an existing possibility that cannot be denied.As for the account he claimed to own and wanted to sell, there is no way to prove his ownership of it. The account is still active, although the last post dates back to May 2022.",

If I post your address accidentally, will I be your alt aaccount?Lol, of course that’s not my logic all i meant is two of these involved accounts  somehow registered at the same year and i will continue investigating on this matter maybe i will find something more suspicious and certain to show the connection between all of them.He didn’t post that address by accident i mean come on that address is used one time only on Bitcointalk by @Debra M trying to get a loan where did he find that address? And then by @vkter who wanted me to send him USDT in exchange for that account.I understand there isn’t a strong evidence to prove the connection of these three accounts, but at least now they are in a suspicious situation where they can’t fool anyone",

And then by @vkter who wanted me to send him USDT in exchange for that account.You didn't get my point I think.By accident doesn't necessarily has to be by accident, it can be a targeted malicious intention to defame the actual owner too.Imagine, I have applied in a campaign with this address- TM8xDV3TTKhbeQGKAMmr39Uq7C41rLghfTDoes this make me your alt? Of course not. Whoever has posted the later, can be a mistakenly post, can be an attempt to defame someone etc. I was pointing that only.Spending time behind account trader would bring you almost nothing. They have a huge amount of accounts which they have farmed since long time or bought database from hack bitcointalk faced back in 2015 (isn't it?). So, this will harm them nothing almost because they have a lot of accounts + they use mostly the neg tagged one for conducting their business here.",

This is an indication that the two accounts may be connected, but more evidence is required to prove the connection.The most that can be done is to put a neutral feedback on the profile, mentioning the suspicion that it owns an account that sells forum accounts. But not a negative one. This is just my estimate and I may be wrong.",
