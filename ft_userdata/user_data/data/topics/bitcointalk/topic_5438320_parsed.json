Bitcoin is still 13 years old which is same like a child enter junior high school, I would say Bitcoin is really lost when the age of Bitcoin is exceed the average person lifespan, around 60-80 years old. It's just my assumption though, there's still a little chance those Bitcoin will be moved because we don't know what the next technology or the previous owner hide their seeds.",

Is it possible to say that Bitcoin in every wallets for the past 2years without moving are considered lost due to death or lost recovery keys? It's pretty hard to believe that anyone won't come back for their Bitcoin after 2years with no activities on the wallet. In part, it is. For bitcoin to remain a currency, it must be used as a currency that circulates among p2p people. In part, this is what happens, but the cryptocurrency also began to be used as an investment instrument. Therefore, some of them are in sleep mode and don't move at all. It is impossible to say for sure which of the immobile btc are currently dormant and which are lost. 2 years no transactions or 20 years - time is not a determining factor. About a year ago there was news that btc were moved, which were immobile since it were mined over 10 years ago and which didn't move anywhere. As you can see, this happens, but many might think that those same bitcoin are irretrievably lost.",

Is it possible to say that Bitcoin in every wallets for the past 2years without moving are considered lost due to death or lost recovery keys? It's pretty hard to believe that anyone won't come back for their Bitcoin after 2years with no activities on the wallet. First, a single individual can have dozens of bitcoin addresses on multiple wallets,  which he may use for different purposes, including daily expenses, paying bills, and long-term hodling. In other words, you can't determine whether a particular person is dead or alive just by looking at blockchain activity; for this, you need to know all his accounts and all his bitcoin addresses, which is impossible. Second, if a person doesn't spend his bitcoin, it usually means he has a job or other source of income that enables him to successfully fight the urge to spend the scarcest asset on planet Earth: he can even buy more bitcoin with money he earns on fiat job. Third, why do even care what people do with their own money? Their inactivity doesn't prevent you from using bitcoin as a means of exchange because there are many people who live off bitcoin and spend it on a daily basis. You surely will find with whom to transact, and this way you can promote the usage of bitcoin.",

Dude, I personally know at least a handful of guys who have been hodling for 5, 8 years and longer. I'm hodling since 2011 myself. I don't think that coins sitting in a wallet untouched for 2 years can be considered lost or abandoned. Of course, there are case of owners forgetting passwords, disk drive failing, owner dying or going missing but these make up a small part of all older wallets/addresses with balance.",

Not really, there have been dormant wallets that have even moved after more than 5 years. We can just ignore that thing as most of us are holding for so long.As long as we know how to keep our keys safe, we can leave it there for so many years being untouched and will just have to get back on it eventually if we're satisfied on the price and if we want to spend or sell it already.",

Whoever wants people think like that have malicious intentions. No matter for how long the money is not touched, if one has ideas to get that money away - under whatever reasons - that's plain theft.* There are people and institutions holding for at very least 5 years.* There are people using paper wallets, collectible items holding bitcoin and other things for many years. The coins are not moved, but they're most probably regularly checked.* I expect successful LN channels stay open for many years.And there are just few examples people have bitcoins not moved for many years. And 2 years? That's nothing. Even with 10 years time frame I would not be certain (!), since in 2011 there were already made Casascius coins.",

We cant say that a wallet that is dormant for two years has no owner. In Mar 2022, there is a wallet from Satoshi era that suddenly woke up as 489 BTC were moved from that wallet Transaction Details on Whale Alert. There is no confirmation whether that was Satoshi or someone else.  If someone can move his bitcoin after 11 years then 2 years is very small time limit. Bitcoin is mostly seen as an asset of investment so its very obvious that people will HODL bitcoin for a long time in coming days. Bitcoin from Satoshi-era wallet suddenly activates after 11 years.",

Not all stagnant or stored Bitcoin are considered lost; it will only be if the owner won't have any access into that particular wallet. Also, we are not required to use it continuously but rather only use it if you'll be needing to do so. But indeed there are instances wherein owners of Bitcoin reaoly forgot their crypto asset in their wallet. Remember that guy who accidentally thrown his flashdrive containing huge amount of Bitcoin and recently spending huge amount of money by trying to recover it? I believe there are other instances having the same point. If you are one of people who are curious of why they became negligent at a certain point, it is because this technology has not yet shown its potential before, unlike with the present werein we saw how huge its market price increase became.",
