  "content": "Hi All,It has been a rough time during this FTX saga, where I lost almost all my money.Anyway, I moving forward and decided to give up some of my precious belongings, which may interest BTC fans, elites or collectors.During my early days in crypto, was very passionate about Bitcoin, so i searched in all email websites for unique domain which has saoshe/bitcoin and everywhere it was all taken. Till i finally found oneProtonmail was used by very little people back then. Since I wanted privacy being in crypto, found 2 unique domains for it.Satoshe@protonmail.comSatoshe@pm.me (alias)This email, was so dear to my heart, as it reflected my passion towards BTC. But I lost most of money, Im willing to give it to BTC enthusiastic people who want something special and passionate about BTCIf you are interested, you can DM here in forums (dont email me). Im willing to give it up for 10 BTC. Sadly lost many multiples of this for ftx, but at least I can have a fresh restart and try to move on.If you are passionate about BTC and want something unique and help a friend at same time. You got it.First come, First serve !Thanks!",

      "body": "Damn 10 BTC for that email address? I don't think it's worth much to be honest, and don't ask me about how much it's worth because I'm not an expert.It was a misspelled name of Satoshi, so it won't be as premium as you have initially though. Sorry for your lost in FTX and for sure you are not the only one here. We have to start new again, but again, I doubt that someone will buy that email account from you with that huge amount, just saying.",

If this domain is yours, I think that's fine and you can also send messages at the request of potential buyers.",

I don't think it's worth much to be honest, and don't ask me about how much it's worth because I'm not an expert.It's worth nothing to me, because it has no connection to the real Satoshi, anyone from his team, or any part of Bitcoin history. The only value this email address has is some kind of sentimental value to the OP, and it's really weird that he's asking for even 10 BTC for that.I have a much more attractive e-mail address on that service, but it would never occur to me to sell it, let alone ask $180 000 for it",

      "body": "Excuse me, but is the reason that the email is worth 10 bitcoins is the name that resembles Satoshi's name? It is slightly different from Satoshi's name and there is no historical connection or rationale.I am sorry for your loss, but unfortunately, collecting money is not like this, in the sense that you can put a link for donations after proving that your story is correct, and you may get more money, after you are useful to society.",

      "body": "10 BTC for an email address that is just similar to the name \"satoshi\"! How much would you charge if it was Satoshi@protonmail.com? 100 BTC maybe?Not to try and bring you down, but going past $1,000 would be a miracle.It's overpriced, and it would take someone who is equally crazy to buy it at that price.",

I simply have to answer.10 BTC for something random like \"satoshE\" email address? what kind of fairy tales do these people live in?what does satoshe even mean in the bitcoin world?I am the owner of the preev.net domain and I can create the email address I want and as many as I want. according to this price list, how much would the email address \"satoshi@ preev.net\" be worth?Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on December 18, 2022, 11:52:34 PMNot to try and bring you down, but going past $1,000 would be a miracle.anything that gets over 1 satoshi for that email address is a miracle.",
