  "content": "What Are Crypto Exchanges?Crypto exchanges are digital market platforms that allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges can also facilitate the trading of other digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Cryptocurrency exchanges operate similarly to traditional stock exchanges, but a crucial difference is:– No physical presence: Cryptocurrency exchanges—unlike the New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange—are entirely digital markets.– Mostly not regulated by the SEC: Cryptocurrency exchanges, even major ones, are mostly not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, including requirements for registration, reporting, and customer data collection.WHAT IS FMCPAY?FMCPAY is one of the most trusted platforms for trading cryptocurrencies and digital securities in the world.
