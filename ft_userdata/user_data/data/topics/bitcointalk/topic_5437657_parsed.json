Our mission is to promote responsible coin ownership and give players true ownership and control over their virtual assets, while addressing social inequalities.In the traditional mobile gaming industry, players often do not have real ownership of their virtual assets. But with Chips, we are changing that by using blockchain technology to create a decentralized economy. Smart contracts empower players to fully own and trade their virtual assets, and make a tangible impact in the real world.Chips offers a unique gaming experience with optional in-game cryptocurrency $CHIP and NFTs representing one-of-a-kind in-game items and experiences. The game promotes positive behavior through rewards and penalties, encouraging players to make positive decisions.
