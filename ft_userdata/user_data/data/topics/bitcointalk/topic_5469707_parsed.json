  "content": "When I was in high school my biology teacher told us during our class that we shouldn't eat more than one egg a day. I have always believed this to be true, whenever I see someone eating more than one eggs, I always felt they are ignorant but the truth is I have been the one who has been ignorant that we can eat as many eggs as we want in a day. I relied in what my class room teacher taught me without carrying further research on my own. I recently found out that there are no rules governing how many eggs we can consume in a day. Has anyone had similar experience?",

      "body": "I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use a protein powder, but I'm sure it's a good idea to use a protein powder that's good for building muscle mass. it's school time, are you currently consuming more eggs when there's a scarce supply and less carbs? if you're prone to 6-8 grains if you're not bored it's probably okay as long as you don't have a recurring illness like allergies because your daily egg consumption limit exceeds the portion. I'm not too much but maybe every day, many protein sources do not have to be eggs unless my area produces abundant eggs of course I am no stranger if an emergency chooses to consume more eggs. I mean chicken eggs that are 1/4 of a fist or 27-30 grams/egg, do you mean that?",

      "body": "Also do my teacher told me that the ant inside beans is more portentous than the beans itself. I started woundering why dont people eat the ant in beans instead of beans itself.Another one is Bush burning, there is no need for Bush burning before plantng of seed, because the heat of the Fire will kill the organic components in the soil and the plants will not grow rapidly, that the cultivated grases should be placed under the soil to decay. But my question is how long do we wait for that that to happen before we plant seeds? Because farmers don't have that luxury of time to wait.Most of those teachings might be true, but those process is not recorgnised in africa.",

When I was young and my father was still around he told me I had to wait 1 hour after we ate if I wanted to go swimming. But now I have done research on this. And there is no reason for us to wait to go in water after we eat. I wish there is a way I could tell this to my father he is wrong all this time but he is out from my life now.",

Has anyone had similar experience?Am not sure where in the earth your teacher got that idea or belief? or maybe he is just relying to the family capacity in feeding their children that is why he thought you to eat one egg a day? though depend in what diet are you having to which will let you eat how many protein you can eat.but I think 3-5 eggs a day is enough to sustain what we need not unless we have other source of protein .Quote from: Natsuu on January 14, 2024, 12:49:41 PMIt's common to rely on what we learn in school, but it's great that you took the initiative to research and discover the truth about egg consumption.

This is also the reason why I am on hand in terms to my children education as I even askingthem what are the topic each day we come to dinning table. and so I can observe or learn what have theyare learning if all are true and correct to not elt them struggle when they starts to grow.",
