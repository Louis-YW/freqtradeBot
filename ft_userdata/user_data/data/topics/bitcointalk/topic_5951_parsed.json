  "content": "If that's even his name. Just read the bitcoin wiki on him and I'm amazed. Nobody knows him.Long time passed since he last posted in here. Why? \"Busy\"? I don't think so. He was active when bitcoin needed support but since the slashdot...Also, it seems has knowledge in many areas, especially economy. He doesn't act like the average human. Not taking advantage out of his creation, leaving without telling anything. Is he even a single person or a group?How can someone create something so great and not stepping out to get the credit?",
