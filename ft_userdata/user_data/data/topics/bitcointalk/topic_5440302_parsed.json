If you deduct the TDS of someone, then you will have to deposit that Tax with the government and then file a return with the Income tax department denoting that for which PAN have you deducted the tax for. For this case there is a separate form which they told they will come out with for deposit of the TDS but last I checked there was no new schema for upload of this Return.",

May be it is still under development. Now that they have announced that there will be a separate section for crypto may be the schema will be uploaded soon.I have hardly made 3-4 transactions on WazirX this year for which they have deducted TDS. I don't think I will be putting it up on the ITR as they were of small amounts.",

Yes sure! I would encourage everyone to be truthful about declaring your taxes because no one would want regulatory hassles in their life. So it's best to declare the crypto transactions correctly. QuoteI guess we don't really need to fill it up until we exchange the coins for INR and withdraw to our bank account.How would the government know if I hold any coins ?That's my understanding as well. Unless and until we convert the cryptos to INR, we can't really consider it as an income. So I will follow the same unless my CA tells me otherwise.",

Well moving to a different country which is cypto friendly is the reason why many Indians have left India.I guess Dubai is also crypto friendly as I just read few days ago someone moving to Dubai because of India's high crypto taxation.",

Some of my friends do live in Dubai. It is a crypto friendly country but the problem is standard of living. The cost of rent and other essential commodities are way too high. INR 1 Lakh every month won't be enough for you.",
