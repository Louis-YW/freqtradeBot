  "content": "According to the CEO of Coinbase, the SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission) urged them to halt all cryptocurrency trading except bitcoin before suing them. This was only recently exposed, but they sued Coinbase few months ago for failing to register as a broker. Coinbase CEO; Brian Armstrong said;Quote“They came back to us, and they said… we believe every asset other than Bitcoin is a security. And, we said, well how are you coming to that conclusion, because that’s not our interpretation of the law. And they said, we’re not going to explain it to you, you need to delist every asset other than Bitcoin.”Why will bitcoin be labelled unsafe and other cryptocurrencies termed as security assets? In reality, we know that bitcoin is the security cryptocurrency, whilst others are not. This simply shows how hard the government is working to make the use of bitcoin difficult for users in that country. Delisting all other cryptocurrencies except bitcoin would also have meant the end of cryptocurrency in the United States if other crypto sectors followed suit. Source: https://watcher.guru",

This simply shows how hard the government is working to make the use of bitcoin difficult for users in that country. Its actually the opposite and in this case SEC (or more exactly Gary Gensler) is on the side of Bitcoin by claiming that it's not a security (btw being/not being security has nothing to do with being safe/unsafe), unlike all other altcoins. Problem is that SEC doesn't have a very clear criteria how is something determined to be a security or not.",

In reality, we know that bitcoin is the security cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is safe and has a secure blockchain, but I think the volatile nature is what people do refer to when saying it is not safe. But if you can hold, you will later enjoy bitcoin as a store of value.Quote from: Adams0001 on July 31, 2023, 05:39:04 AMhttps://watcher.guruThis did not take us to any news in particular.Quote from: Adams0001 on July 31, 2023, 05:39:04 AMDelisting all other cryptocurrencies except bitcoin would also have meant the end of cryptocurrency in the United States if other crypto sectors followed suit.I think this would be too hash, but almost all cryptocurrencies are securities, including ether. There are few that are now like litecoin and few others.

Also any coin that is using proof of stake are securities. SEC needs to come up with a clear definition.",

I think SEC do not have a clear definition about which cryptocurrencies are securities or not, that is true. But according to recent news, SEC is declaring all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin as securities. This is 2018 news:https://cassels.com/insights/sec-declares-bitcoin-and-ether-as-non-securities/#:~:text=On%20Thursday%2C%20June%2014%2C%202018,Ether%20or%20Bitcoin%20as%20securities.QuoteOn Thursday, June 14, 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)  Director of Corporate Finance, William Hinman (Hinman), announced that the commission would not be treating Ether or Bitcoin as securities.From around 2020 but which I may not be exactly accurate about, SEC has been going tough on ether too. Or probably when it goes from proof of work to proof of stake. Last year or early of this year, SEC sees ether too as securities which I have seen on the news many times. But Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sees ether as a commodity.https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-calls-eth-a-commodity-in-binance-suit-highlighting-the-complexity-of-classificationQuoteCFTC calls ETH a commodity in Binance suit, highlighting the complexity of classification. The suit claims Binance used Ether as a commodity in its financial products, experts explained, which says little about the basic nature of the coin.But this is what I know about the SEC:SEC lawsuits: 68 cryptocurrencies are now seen as securities by the SEChttps://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-labels-61-cryptocurrencies-securities-after-binance-suitQuoteSEC Chair Gary Gensler, however, has claimed that “everything other than Bitcoin” is a security that falls under the agency’s remit. Crypto data site CoinMarketCap lists around 25,500 cryptocurrencies in existence.And truly, ether is a security.",

The paper analyzes the relevant caselaw and concludes there is scant legal basis to treat fungible cryptoassets as securities, and it sets out analytical approach that is far more satisfying. The paper separates capital raising transactions by blockchain project sponsors or other insiders in which a cryptoasset may be sold—which are typically securities transactions—from the treatment of the cryptoasset, which is not a security. This analytical framework addresses the now apparent challenges created by the SEC staff’s approach and appropriately focuses the SEC’s regulatory jurisdiction on capital raising transactions.",

      "body": "The definition of securities is slowly expanding as several investment instruments emerge. I personally still hold to the traditional notion that securities are a reflection of a company's performance, hence the SEC's approach to proving it might be on the right track if they accuse non-PoW coins of being securities because those tend to be centralized.",

Crypto companies before are using utility token disguised to get money from investors without facing legal charges for having unregulated public token sales.",

      "body": "Your source should be the link to the specific article you took information from, not the home page of the site. It seems you got it a bit wrong, especially as to your understanding of security. The order of the SEC is actually in favor of Bitcoin. It didn't label Bitcoin as unsafe. It doesn't consider it as a security as well. The SEC considers Bitcoin as a commodity. Security in this sense doesn't refer to \"the state of being free from danger or threat\" or risk, as you probably misconstrued.[1] It is meant as an \"investment contract.\"[1] So, not classifying Bitcoin as a security doesn't mean it lacks security and Bitcoin supporters are not secured in having it. This order is against the rest of the cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. However, taking into consideration the court decision on the SEC vs. Ripple, it seems Coinbase has now a more solid reason not to delist altcoins. The court ruling, after all, doesn't consider coins sold on exchanges as investment contract or security.
