On a scale of 1–30, there is no way I can come out in my street, busy area, mall, or mall and ask people within the age range of 20 years and upward that out of that 30 up to 5 of them won't have an idea of what bitcoin is, even if they don't hold any; they will definitely have little basis knowledge of what it is.  From the way airdrop is making crypto-wide spread The internet is an open space where such information can be gotten for free, especially bitcoin value, unless those who I ask are not exposed to the internet and don't make use of smart phones.",

I do can explain what Bitcoin is even though not in technical, but I don't really know the present value of Bitcoin price because I didn't check the price. Sometime I think Bitcoin is still $60K or $65K, but actually it touch $52K. Do I care if Bitcoin price went down to $52K? nope because I'M HODLING.It's not really correct to think old people will not know Bitcoin, I believe in this forum there are many users who're 30-50 years old.",

For example: Recently, there was a conversation in the city chat of the Telegram channel; some cryptocurrency information was discussed. So from the discussion of people, I understand that they mix everything, both bitcoin and altcoin. There are a few literate people who sparkle with thoughts about the usefulness of investing in Bitcoin, but most of them are those who just tap or tap on the screen, completely not understanding what they will do next. Based on this, we can conclude that people (most) do not go into detail about crypto. In my country, this is very rare. And I have no desire to run and prove that investments will help them and take responsibility for their education. The Internet is huge; everyone looks for what they like. The choice is up to the people.",

It's quite a mainstream name But that's it The number of people that really know about it are very very low. The highest they usually know is that Bitcoin is expensive.

In my street, almost 80% of youths that are above 18 years knows about Bitcoin. They might not know key details about investing in Bitcoin or understand how Bitcoin volatility works or the potentials that lies in investing in Bitcoin but they know that you can own Bitcoin and use it as a medium of receiving payment.I don't need to do that kind of survey before being convinced that I'm not too late to continue buying Bitcoin. Those kind of thing is mostly for people that don't believe in how precious bitcoin his but just want to buy it for the sake of what they've hard about it potential. I know one or two things about the current state of Bitcoin and I'm not just holding my Bitcoin just because I'm expectant of Bitcoin price to hit too high anytime soon. I'm holding Bitcoin for security reasons, because it's the best digital form of storing value and because regardless of the effect of inflation that's currently a serious issue globally, Bitcoin is still an edge against inflation.",

The fact that not many people know about bitcoin is also seen as a huge opportunity and we are no different from pioneers in this revolution. But this also tells us that there are still many challenges ahead and it will take much longer before bitcoin can be mass adopted. Also, as some have said, are the people you ask telling the truth?

Obviously,  we do not have exact figures on the proportion of the population participating in this market . It is difficult to know the exact percentage of people investing in bitcoin in each country because as we all know, investing in bitcoin can be done anonymously and without declaration . Instead , I think we should rely on other factors to know about bitcoin's popularity like market capitalization .  In my opinion, bitcoin's market cap of just over $1 trillion is too small, which means we are still very early and there is still room for growth in the future.https://cointelegraph.com/news/american-adult-crypto-use-dropped-2023-fed-survey",
