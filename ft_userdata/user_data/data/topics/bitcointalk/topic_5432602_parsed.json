  "content": "A memecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is primarily used for online memes and as a form of online tipping or reward. They are typically not intended to serve as a serious investment or store of value, but rather as a way to facilitate fun and creativity within online communities.One of the main utilities of a memecoin is its ability to facilitate the spread of memes and provide a way for users to show their appreciation for content creators. By allowing users to tip each other with small amounts of memecoins, it can help to encourage the creation and sharing of new and interesting memes.Another utility of memecoins is that they can serve as a way for online communities to self-govern and regulate their own content. For example, a community may decide to use memecoins as a way to vote on which memes should be promoted or featured. This can help to ensure that the content being shared is of high quality and resonates with the community.Overall, while memecoins may not have the same utility as more traditional cryptocurrencies, they can still serve an important role in facilitating creativity and community building online.",

And i've never encoutered new meme token being a thing used to top people.What i've seen during somewhere in the top of the ico frenzy cycle, token names being used as an adverisement for a website or other kind of token. I don't think that was very effective as that was a sure thing no make me NOT to even google about it and avoid the name in all cost.",

This might work for someone who is new to crypto and they will think you have given them a huge amount when they saw those huge number of doge coins on their account. Meanwhile, coins that works from influences is never a good investment.This is risky and the only one that is guaranteed to make money on here are the influencers. Are those guys happy when they make Elon more richer? Maybe these guys wants to make Elon the most richest person in the world because I think he is currently on the second spot and Jeff Bezos is at the first place.",

As far as I know, investors are into memecoins because they expect financial returns.Quote from: casper_crypto on January 01, 2023, 11:30:26 AMOne of the main utilities of a memecoin is its ability to facilitate the spread of memes and provide a way for users to show their appreciation for content creators.

And I don't think they need to be replaced by memecoins.Quote from: casper_crypto on January 01, 2023, 11:30:26 AMAnother utility of memecoins is that they can serve as a way for online communities to self-govern and regulate their own content.

This can help to ensure that the content being shared is of high quality and resonates with the community.Memecoins are copies of each other. There is no creativity or high quality content on this community at all. It's a speculative niche of pump and dump schemes. Sorry, but nothing of this make much sense in a practical way...Quote from: casper_crypto on January 01, 2023, 11:30:26 AMOverall, while memecoins may not have the same utility as more traditional cryptocurrencies, they can still serve an important role in facilitating creativity and community building online.Memecoins are shitcoins like most altcoins in this market. They are of no use. And that is why all of them are dying, with DOGE's exception, since it's a classical cryptocurrency which must last for a long time yet.",

Never really saw a platform where people send Doge as a tip for a meme. Doge has considerable value if indeed people send tips to users who create memes, many users will really be creating lots of memes.What I saw in some meme telegram channels was that they were just posting memes in the chat and just users laughing at them. I don't see anyone sends Shib nor Doge. But like any other coins out there, these memecoins has a place for coisn to bet on casinos.",
