      "body": "1. Bitcoin will not just pause or hold. It will experience a jump. July's usually a favorable month for it's price.2. The reason is just simple; they are weak hands and often they are the ones that usually panic sell once they see a small dip in price. Bitcoin holding/investment/ accumaltion is not for the weak minded or those who need instant gain, that's why it's necessary to understand what you are getting into when putting money into Bitcoin.",

When bitcoin is getting to that price, there are massive selling. At least the price should get to $60000 and stay above $59999 for more than a day. This will increase bulls confidence to start buying more at the price. But bitcoin may not surpass that price much because there would likely be resistance at some price like $65000 and above.Quote from: pakhitheboss on July 11, 2024, 12:48:19 PM[2] If not then what do you think is the reason a weak hand/newbie is in the panic mode?The bad news like Germany sending coins to exchanges and also Mt Gox giving back to people their lost coins make people to become bears.",

I waited for a reconciliation where he must have learnt his lessions and do the right thing to end that time to time regretting but yet no such update. If he hasn't embraced bitcoin til date maybe he'd criticize himself again after the expecting bull run surging to a new ATH or if he finally did we should be expecting him to come with a testimony to had taken part at the lucrative bitcoin opportunity after he has missed out a lot just like most of us here did.Quote from: pakhitheboss on July 11, 2024, 12:48:19 PM I have two questions below and I am awaiting for your replies [1] In the present condition of the Bitcoin market do you think as a Bitcoin user/holder/accumulator, do you think that the current  price will hold or go down more?[2] If not then what do you think is the reason a weak hand/newbie is in the panic mode? We're always uncertained with our predictions in the bitcoin market but as for me, the fluctuations will keep going appreciating above the current price and so also, it'd depreciate below.This variable and invariable fluctuations will keep on while gradually the price will increase until the bull run is come where we'd have the market uptrending as an entry of the bull run for a new ATH.Whether weak or beginner investors, they panics at any given market condition out of fomo and their inability to control their emotions on how the bitcoin market really works.",

By that I want to say that your question needs to be clearer such as down with what percent, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% or 30%. You need to point it out in the question, to help other people answering your question better.With the Bitcoin price chart, some next prices for its fall are possibly about $51k and worse $42k. $51k is not too far from its latest correction but from today price it will be around 12% correction, big enough. To $42k, it will be about 28% correction. Honestly I really don't think if Bitcoin continues to fall, it will stop at $51k but will be easily crashed to $43k to $41k.Is it bad in long run?I keep up my belief that the bull run will be restarted after correction and from $41k to $43k, we will see some Short squeezes to help Bitcoin rising more and making a new all time high, in doubt of traders.Quote[2] If not then what do you think is the reason a weak hand/newbie is in the panic mode?A crash like 20% or 30% will make newbies panic easily.",

      "body": "I don't blame those who don't trust Bitcoin. After the dot com bubble many people believe that whatever comes after is still going to end up the same way, this made many people don't want to believe, and for the fact that Bitcoin sounds like something that can replace Fiat even makes it less confusing. The past is the past, and right now is right now, if anyone from 2011 is still here now I expect them to have find their reasons and answers why Bitcoin is not another dot com bubble and why it is important to own some fracture part of 1 BTC at least. Hell yea its 2024 and Trump is accepting donations via BTC, never happened before I believe, nothing is this more confusing since the dot com days.",

Remembering when we consolidated at $60k(+) but now we are below that, further more any price seems achievable whether below or above Newbies/ people who panics to sell are those who are yet to understand quite enough about Bitcoin than they should have already known. Having known about Bitcoin volatility would be enough evidence as to why they should keep holding instead of selling just too early.",

Bitcoin haven’t shown any promising move towards a more bullish direction or formation. It’s been in a ranging market and a ranging market is one you shouldn’t have any high expectations on as it could either break towards the bulls or bears. One thing I think tough, it would be very difficult for price to dump below $50k.Quote[2] If not then what do you think is the reason a weak hand/newbie is in the panic mode?Weak hands for sure,Coupled with the fact that, Bitcoin is reported to have sold more volume over the course of last week than it has ever done. The German government is reported to have decided to sell a large amount of its holdings and by some means, this contributes to the market condition we have today, where we find price dumping.",
