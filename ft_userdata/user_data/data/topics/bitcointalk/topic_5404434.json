However, capitulating on what might be the bottom of the bear market is clearly one of the biggest mistakes in holding bitcoin as an investment. The other big mistake is buying more bitcoin on leverage while the whole market is deleveraging.TORONTO, ONTARIO, June 28, 2022. ‐ Cypherpunk Holdings Inc. (CSE: HODL, OTC: CYFRF) (“Cypherpunk” or, the “Company“), a sector leader for blockchain, metaverse, privacy and cryptography focused investments, would like to announce updates on Cryptocurrency Holdings and Company’s Strategy. Moe Adham, CIO of Cypherpunk Holdings commented: “Crypto markets remain in a deep risk off environment. There remains risk of further significant drawdowns in asset prices across the crypto sector. In the interest of all shareholders, the company transitioned its treasury to cash. This transition prepares our business to take advantage of investment opportunities we believe will become available after a substantial recapitalization of certain projects.”The Company has sold 205.8209 ETH for proceeds CAD $293k and 214.7203 BTC for proceeds CAD $6,086,283.The Company’s treasury presently holds no BTC and no ETH.Read in full https://cypherpunkholdings.com/cypherpunk-holdings-corp-update-june2022/",

      "body": "I find it a quite peculiar move from a company calling itself \"a sector leader for blockchain [...] focused investments\".I mean that a company focused on such investments should know about the market cycles and that there's a good chance that they simply sold at - or close to - the minimal price for 2022.But maybe they know / expect something we don't. Or maybe something has change in their internal status and they change their object of activity?However, they are cypherpunks as much as I'm a cat. That's for sure.",

Because any crypto enthusiast know this is not the right time to sell and it is the time to accumulate more. But shareholders are usually rigid in some matters which sometimes work against the comoany financials. This event can be a possible reason why the market again came down to 19k level. The worst is not over yet.",

No, to top it off their stock ticker is called HODL hehehe. However, if their strategy is to sell today and buy what they sold back on a lower price, I reckon it mght be a good strategy it works. However, it is very hard to assume if there will be more dumps soon. It appears both retail and institutional investors have capitulated already after Luna, Celsius and 3 Arrows Capital liquidations.",

I fear the moment bigger players may take the same decision. I do hope though that those are smarter, not so much driven by hype and didn't expose themselves in all kinds of shitcoins.",

I am sure then that Cypherpunk is a big shame to their own name...and they entered the space of Bitcoin with both eyes blinded...maybe they entertain romanticized ideas not based on the realities on the ground. Anyway, what is happening right now is the same as what happened in the past...weak hands will be selling until there can be as saturation point...and there the market will be rebounding big time.",
