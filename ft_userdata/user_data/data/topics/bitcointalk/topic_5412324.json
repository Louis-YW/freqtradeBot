  "content": "Koi Miner is a mining machine brand under the US listed company AGM Group Holdings. The founder is a veteran player in the field of bitcoin mining. He has entered the mining field since 2013. In 2015, he has begun to develop and manufacture TSMC 16NM BTC chips and mining machines. The company is very low-key in the industry. It has been concentrating on the research and development of Samsung 10NM and Samsung 8NM chips and mining machines for the past four years. It will be officially launched as Koi Miner in 2021, becoming the first echelon of BTC Miner manufacturers in the industry.At present, the BTC Miner C16 series products that Koi Miner has produced on a large scale have reached 30W/T performance. Although there is a gap in energy efficiency ratio with BitMain’s S19 series and Whatsminer’s M50 series, they are technically at the same level because BitMain And Whatsminer uses TSMC and Samsung’s 5NM process respectively, while Koi Miner is currently SMIC’s N+1 chip process. It is believed that if Koi Miner can achieve the industry’s highest level of 20W/T on the 5NM process.https://www.hashuni.com/shop/btc-miner/",
