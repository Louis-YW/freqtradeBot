      "body": "Just sick of the way you guys promote these shit coins wherein once in a blue moon a project like Pepe gets succeeds wherein others even fail to make into a decent exchange and even if they reach they don't sustain as they dets dumped immediately and even if they somehow manages to reach some good CEX they gets removed like hundred have already been removed from Binance due to manipulation or shady practices. However, I have gone through the whitepaper of this project where there are lot of promises but there isn't a single explaination about how they they are going to do it as some of their promises like helping migrants and all requires partnership with various organisations and local councils.I would like to conclude by saying that we should not be part of any projects which are purely based on memes or NFT, as these can be part of the project by not the project itself as we need project which has real life use case.",

Aside from your obvious scam, any coin/token that 'promises' and have nothing to show in \"right now\" is futile and will not go anywhere.

      "body": "All the information surrounding what the OP mentioned shows that this is a true sh*tcoin and is just taking advantage of some hype about a certain project to fool those hoping for quick profits. I always think that participants let greed cloud the knowledge that we all recognize that there are many risks, when they only like to talk about possible profits (in reality, it never happens), the few that appear in this space create exaggerations that are not the basis for people to talk about opportunities.For stubborn people, it is true that scammers who want to prey on people's greedy psychology have difficult ways to spread in the direction of ''FLEX'', and their nature never has those things. , it's best to stay away from things like this and their counterparts in the crypto space.",

      "body": "I have seen lots of threads for this meme token already. Isn't that enough to discuss about it? I do understand that most of the members who will create more threads about a certain token because they are also invested in it but creating a new one doesn't mean it will boost the number of investors who will purchase it. It would be better if we could keep it clean in one thread and maybe help out by explaining what the feature of this token is and it's best utility there than piling up threads with the same name over and over again. Sure, it's a different title but it's all the same inside. Good luck boosting it, but I really doubt this is helping. It might actually be the vice versa results which means more members here will just ignore it. That's not how marketing works in this forum.",

What gives you the belief¬†that investors in this memecoin will receive a x5 profits? You should reconsider your opinion on this memecoin and accept the fact that it won't soar in value as Pepe did because it's a laughing coin. If you have any profits, I would advise you to take them out. You shouldn't hold out hope for x5 gains anytime soon as the price decline will be more severe. I'm starting to realize that today's price is different from yesterday's. A good number of investors have lost money as a result of purchasing when it was 0.028, and it is 0.025 as of now.",

Only on October 6, 2023, the domain for this meme coin was registered, and already on November 15 they are thinking of holding a pre-sale. If the team is so confident that the investor will receive x5, then they do not need to arrange a pre-sale, keep these coins and increase your deposit by 500%.",

Good for people who understand the risks involved and know when to dispose of the shit tokens so they can make some handsome profits. There is no question that most meme tokens and even those involving NFTs are here just to make as much money as they can and just let the project die along the road. We must always be careful and must remember that words and promises are so cheap.",
