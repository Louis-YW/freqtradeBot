While many also still choose the banking sector because they believe in it, either way, both parties have something in common, which is '\"believe.\" You will always choose to use and trust what you believe in.Quote from: FiveG on May 27, 2023, 09:42:21 PMWhich do you preferred your money to be save in as investment? Bitcoin or bank! What's your reason?To answer your question, first using the banking system for saving of money can not be seen or address as an investment, unless when you actually deposit those money under fixed deposit or which ever means of savings which the bank uses to give deposits a little reward. I choose Bitcoin rather than the bank because Bitcoin is an asset that gives me total control over it. I can spend it when I want and use it how I want. That's what total control is all about. Which the bank system doesn't give to their customers. Bitcoin's volatile nature makes me also choose it as an investment, since volatility is what makes it risky, but it's also what gives me a higher chance of earning a profit from it through price change.",

      "body": "The high demand of bitcoin doesn’t makes it risky Infact it will only help to minimize the volatility rate. Bitcoin is more preferable as an investment rather than having fiats in banks because with bitcoin you have total custody of your funds and this will help save the stress of having not to worry about bank closing down due to either bankruptcy or it’s likes. Bitcoin is a great investment asset because it hedges against inflation which makes it a great store of value. The decentralized nature of bitcoin which makes its price to been manipulated by a group of people or government is why it is my choice against fiat as an investment asset. Holding bitcoin as an investment also edges fiat because it has the potential to grow in price.",

Use the bank if you basically want to keep your fiat safe, but if it is attractive ROI you seek, thus you must be ready to take risks (and it isn't peculiar to just Bitcoin).Quote from: FiveG on May 27, 2023, 09:42:21 PMWhich do you preferred your money to be save in as investment?

It’s a business, not a charity, man!Banks are slowly transforming. They’ve got to do this because:1. CBDCs are on their way2. Crypto is becoming more and more adopted.Do you see a connection? CBDCs, crypto? They’re somewhat a similar subject, a digital currency. So if banks need to grow by adapting to the future and the future is Bitcoin, what are we even waiting for? Invest in a bank which has been doing banking for a hundred years or invest in something that’s changing the future as we speak?",

Which do you preferred your money to be save in as investment? Bitcoin or bank! What's your reason?Its a hard choice cause first of all. Bitcoin is somehow an investment on my opinion and leaving your money on the bank isnt comparable on bitcoin as investment. Bitcoin is highly volatile and the risk associated with it is very high and has cosiderable tisk apetite while in bank its not that much. Why? Cause how often a fiat currency price move far or low beyond its price? Onlt the value of it changes based on inflation. So if you are planning to invest and want more.

The higher the number of holders and trading increases the price reflects to the trend and vice versa. While compound interest has to do with how much you invested into the bank. Another person's investment can not affect your investment; you earn nothing from someone else's investment. In bitcoin we all gain profits if someone purchases bitcoin. The value of bitcoin increases and fiat buying power is drastically falling. I'll choose both bitcoin and bank, but won't go for banking investment; compound interest.",

What's your reason?People are made to believe that the bank is the most and the only reliable place to invest and keep our money, but the bank is really using our money for business and making more money with it, as they are just giving out little profit as a return on our investment.Bitcoin is a store of value; land is also a store; and money is also seen as a store of value, but I think that money is not a real store of value because a real store of value appreciates instead of deteriorating in value. If one decides to keep money in the bank for some years (as fix deposit), the value of the money might have gradually deteriorated before the person decides to use it; even the little interest that the investment has earned cannot buy a thing in the market because the value of the money has reduced.Bitcoin has a limited supply, and despite the price volatility, if one invests in Bitcoin and holds it for a long time, they will sure sell during the bull market and make a huge profit depending on the amount they invested. So bitcoin investment is what anyone could ever think of choosing rather than investing in the bank. But for the record, a good economist or a financial maximalist don't only relay on one investment source, they diversify their investment and also keep some fiat money in the bank, perhaps not as investment.Quote from: Coyster on May 27, 2023, 10:19:11 PMNeither Bitcoin nor the bank is an investment platform,Bank can be a financial institution were every financial activities takes place but still can serve the purpose for individuals to invest their money through fixed deposit (as it's being called in my country). Bitcoin can also serve the purpose of investing your money into it.",

As private firms doesn't provide with retirement, I prefer investing on a retirement scheme.It is true that just saving in terms of bitcoin is more than enough to have retirement fund and enjoy life.

Which do you preferred your money to be save in as investment? Bitcoin or bank! What's your reason?Bitcoin and traditional bank investment serve different purposes and have varying levels of risk and potential income. Bank investments, such as savings account and certificate of deposits are generally considered a low risk options that offer a guaranteed return on investment. This products are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) it means that if the bank closed the investment is protected up to a certain amount only. However the return of investments are typically low. Bitcoin is decentralized digital currency that operates outside of traditional banking system. Its value can be volatile which means that i has a higher level of risks, but it has much higher returns compare to traditional banks. I would choose both because i wanted to diversify my portfolio.",
