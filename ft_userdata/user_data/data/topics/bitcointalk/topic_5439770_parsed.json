  "content": "Comrades this matter is getting out of hand. I stumbled upon the above meme and I popped into laughter though but something came to my mind and I had a deep thought over it and I asked myself this question, what is it like in the rural areas where there are no banks and they need money for their trades and otherwise, what is it with these pos vendors that charges outrageously for transfer and withdrawal with their knowledge of the current situation of the economy and financial crisis  ravaging the country.  Do you know how many people that have lost their lives as a result of this cashless policy and these banks and pos acts. I was reading one of the dailies last week  where a man at kaduna lost his pregnant wife and baby as a result of money demanded from the hospital by the doctor before they could touch his wife but he could not access money to do that and he took his wife home inviting a mid wife to aid his wife in delivering their baby but it was not as he thought and his wife  passed on as a result of excess bleeding( https://www.google.com/amp/s/dailypost.ng/2023/02/01/kaduna-man-loses-pregnant-wife-to-scarcity-of-new-naira/%3famp=1).  How about others that are stranded and left with no option.This is the current situation of financial crisis in the country not cashless policy. May God help us.",

      "body": "Well I have came across a news today about our President meeting with the CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele on the talk about the new Naira and the deadline of The Old Naira notes. While Bola Ahmed Tinubu pleaded for an extension of 12 months which is 1 year to enable the gradual removal of the old Naira to reduce tension from her Citizen. Mainwhile, the CBN Governor Godwin E is yet to take a total decision on when to finally stop the old note from circulation, on the talk saying we could still use the old till 90 days interval and this doesn't mean it would be the deadline but think of other measure to tackle the scarcity and crisis of cashless policies.Abeg for those that are active in news this evening can add more stories or should correct me if I am wrong.",

      "body": "It must have been a difficult endeavor for some Nigerians living in the most rural areas of the country, as they may not have had any possible means to get the new bank note. But the good news is that they can again begin to spend the old bank notes until December 1, 2023.Quote from: www.vanguardngr.com/2023/03/breaking-old-naira-notes-remain-legal-tender-till-dec-31-supreme-court/amp/In the lead judgement that was delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court accused President Buhari of disobeying its interim order that halted the full implementation of the new monetary policy.It faulted President Muhammadu Buhari for introducing the demonization policy, without due consultation with the Council of States, the Federal Executive Council, the Civil Society and other relevant stakeholders.",

Let's not be surprise to see that it is this same old notes that banks will use to pay their customers by next week because I guess,we will be using more of the old notes than the new notes because it will be more in circulation than the new note. So many people still have this old notes in their possessions which they will start spending it. Nigeria politicians don use Nigerians head roll dice wey lead to the lost of lives and property, how them won come take bring back those dead people wey die on top this problem.",

What annoys me most is the untold hardship these politicians have caused Nigerians. So they want to tell us they were not knowledgeable enough to know the situation they want to put Nigerians into before bringing such policy. After causing Nigerians stress and hardship as a result of naira swap people under pressure to change their old naira with to new naira note with high fee charges for paying  and withdrawal. Making things very expensive and costly just within this short period. People were in a hurry at the dieing minute to swap their old note for a much higher fee either through buying of products time two it's price as a condition for accepting it or you use the new note which the masses have no option than going for it as that is their last resort making them to loose money and after all these stress they are talking of revisiting the policy as a result of court order. Men this bunch of leaders are very annoying. People lot their lives, People lost money, people were under pressure during these past period all because of meeting up with the naira swap deadline and after all that Mr. President could come out to make such speech. It is now finally clear the sole purpose for which the naira swap was introduced.",
