Another option is P2P somewhere local. However this can be dangerous so make sure you use caution. Don’t go to any sketchy places at night. And only do business if they have feedback.",

Since FIAT is involved, almost all legal exchanges/platforms will require you to perfom KYC if you wish to sell your USDT and withdraw in FIAT. You another option is to do a P2P trade without using a thirdparty (middleman) service. The risk is high. If you will be performing the P2P trade online, one will have to trust the other blindly. If you do P2P trade facetoface, then there is a chance of you getting yourself in serious danger. But I think there are still some platform where you can do p2p trades without KYC. And others that are suggesting using Bitcoin ATM, I doubt there are any ATMs that don't ask for KYC. It used to be KYC free before. But right now, they will make you register at least your phone number before you can buy or sell any coins.",

But I won't it, because I don't want people to know my identity when withdraw it into my local bank.Yes you can exchange your usdt to fiat using decentralized exchanges like bisq where KYC is not needed, they are decentralized and also opened sourced. They use a multi sig method of holding your coins till the buyer pays to your account and then you give the confirmation and they release it. They support many countries currency, you can try it out.The other way is to use this forum and look for your local board there are some reputable members that can sell or buy from you. Or if you don’t trust them you can ask someone reputable to be your escrow. QuoteI also seeing many people selling bank accounts on my local online shop, but of course, it's illegal, the seller might be taking it back to the account after I deposited the money.Do not even try it, aside the one that they can easily take back the account, you don’t know any irregularities that they must have performed in the past that could put that account into surveillance and once caught your funds will go and also place you at risk tooQuote from: albert0bsd on October 06, 2023, 04:22:40 AMSince bitcoin is still not mass adopted then KYC is your only choice.That is a pitty, but my recomendation is not convert btc to cash, my recomendation is actually the other way arount convert fiat to bitcoin and wait a little, search for services that actually acept bitcoin o start your own bussiness acepting bitcoin.They are other methods like using decentralized exchanges or using local P2P on the forum, in fact buying or selling bitcoin seems easier than any cryptocurrency due to its adoption. Yes no one will be happy to sell is precious bitcoin but emergencies can arise which cannot take control of and selling will be the last resort. So it happens, the best thing is to accumulate more when opportunities present them selves",

Very unlikely that you can get it to work without KYC. As others mentioned if you really do not want to KYC the options are limited to:1) You can try set up a cash trade in person with someone - this can be risky.2) Some Crypto credit card companies let you buy a prepaid card/loadable card that can be used to withdraw from an ATMOther than that, not really possible anymore. Good old days are gone unfortunately",

But this is not to promote the exchange so you should do so with caution. Link",

Performing tier 1 KYC on Binance does not take much of your personal information, it only requires you to verify your phone number, email address and will be able trade your cryptocurrencies through P2P with users from your country.",

For example, you can buy an Amazon gift card or any other shopping site that you are comfortable with. Then simply buy gold chains bars or coins from these sites that provide certified gold. You can then sell it locally to the goldsmith. I think this will add extra layer of security. No one will ever know you had Bitcoin with you. However there are challenges in this, first, the country where you live should have online gold selling if yes then everything is going to be easy. Secondly if not then you will need to choose another option like buying stuff that you need or would buy after getting the cash from amazon only. If not then there is pretty much nothing you can do about it. Otherwise that would be pretty much money laundering if you are trying more other ways.",

So it is practically impossible to withdraw (larger) amounts via such ATMs. Besides person-to-person (P2P) sales, you could otherwise try selling the coins here on the forum for FIAT, with an escrow interposed of course. But at least one of the participants will know your bank details - unless you can meet in person. But be careful: Depending on the amount, the bank may want to have a receipt where the money comes from. If you cannot prove this, you will not be able to deposit the money, and in the worst case (e.g. if the bank suspects money laundering) this can also lead to a block on your account.",

What they do most times is a pseudo KYC where you get to register with at least something personal like your mobile number (contact) or/and your email. Just these and you’re in. The trick used here for accounts with no proper KYC is the withdrawal limi and that plays out in the form of coin withdrawal to a wallet and not the typical p2p transactions carried out on the exchange.Where KYC becomes a necessity is when you want to increase your withdrawal limit. There, you have to go through KYC for an upgrade and that is optional.I know of Remitano to do that but, you must confirm if it’s functional in your jurisdiction before giving it a trier.",

It's mainly risky if you're selling fiat and using another name other than your account's name because when the buyer releases the funds, he's asked to tick a box confirming that he received the funds from X individual (where X is the name found in your passport) so if you were to submit funds from a bank account with a different name, the buyer could actually claim that he never received funds from you.It's a bit different when you're buying though, because sometimes the sellers would ask you to send them your name and IBAN directly in the chat so you could basically send anyone's.",

KYC is vital part on transacting fiat to track possible money laundering issue. Cryptocurrency like BTC, USDT and etc is not regulated in your country that’s why you can exchange it without any problem. Anything that fiat touch is the only problem with the government because it needs to be regulated.Decentralized P2P or forum P2P is your only choice if you want to cashout without KYC since your are removing centralized middleman on your transactions which is being use to regulate fiat by the government since it’s impossible to regulate cryptocurrency alone due to its decentralized nature.",
