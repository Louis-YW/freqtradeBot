There is no such things taken the fundamental analysis from PEPE use-case or feature.Because the coin movement is by \"HYPE\" the only thins these token growing are the momentum hype. If the hype are decrease then, like always the price are gonna to drop, drop and drop for each level price support.",

In the end, not everyone is as lucky as they come when the coin is pumping high.That is why meme coin should be taken as a gamble and not an asset, but a lot of people are making the mistake of taking meme coins as investment options and this is the reason for the high rate of dissatisfaction of most investors who don't know the risk associated with cryptocurrencies investment.,  most times some investors make the mistake of the duration and timing to either buy a coin or hold on to the coin. I don't see any reason why people should be taken as a serious investment choice,  it may be right for gamblers who may want to speculate the price of a coin and are constantly looking out for the right coin to jump on regardless of what its outcome may be, so for those people in such category,  people coin is a good opportunity to be on but then which investor will buy a dead coin because as far as I know, any coin that lost more than 50% of it market is already dead and can take only pump to increase its potentials.",

Because it has faced controversy due to its association with alt-right and white nationalist movements, which has led to some exchanges delisting the currency. One notable exchange that delisted Pepe Coin is Bittrex, which delisted Pepe Coin in 2018. So what now? Another hype?",
