I've heard about some people saying that very soon they are going to lead a massive protests against fiat for bitcoin adoption, this is aimed to fight against the government for bitcoin financial adoption and some are retereiting this same fact that they want to go on revolution, but why need for that?We should know that Bitcoin is not a contender of any currency or the government because engaging financial revolution was not the aim or reason why Satoshi created a decentralized network, bitcoin is meant to serve as an alternative means of making payments by the people who think using fiat is not fare enough for their privacy and trust, bitcoin is not waging war against the government or pursuing after revolution.We don't need to fight for bitcoin, it's self defensive because it provides the people with the satisfaction they needed in finances, time will make significance on preference made by the people over their financial economy, the more we move the better the chances for government to join in support for bitcoin adoption and not by revolution.",

Which country wants to lead a protest for their government not to allow fiat again as a legal tender but to accept ane be using bitcoin? People know how bitcoin is very volatile and they will not want to go for it. Although bitcoin is a store if hold in a long term but people are not looking to that direction.Bitcoin is allowed in many countries and people can buy bitcoin if they want. Like you have said already, it is just an alternative.",

Many of my friends aren't even interested in any investment, be it real estate or stocks, let alone bitcoin, a volatile asset. One more thing, not everyone considers bitcoin as an investment, there are still many people who prefer to use bitcoin as a means of payment and the volatility of bitcoin is a barrier for them. They feel uncomfortable with its volatility. Bitcoin adoption is on the rise but don't expect that everyone will like it and will invest in it.",

Bitcoin is revolutionary, but not in the way you think. Satoshi did not design Bitcoin to replace fiat. But he saw a world where decentralized networks empowered the public and upended the financial system. Bitcoin was a silent revolution against centralized authorities, whether you believe it or not. Should we march with pro-Bitcoin signs? Maybe not. But utilizing, supporting, and understanding Bitcoin's transformative power IS a revolution. Governments will have to accept decentralized money's strength when the legacy banking system collapses.",

It is through force or constitutional means. Do they intend to take up arms and overthrow the government and install a more Bitcoin-friendly government? Or they want to use democratic means like peaceful protest, legislative lobbying, and other constitutional means. Going through democratic means to promote Bitcoin awareness and adoption should be the path of every true Bitcoiner. But using other means that will involve violence or conflict to force the government to change its negative view toward Bitcoin is not necessary now. If the people know the importance of bitcoin, they will embrace it and when the government knows that Bitcoin can contribute positively to the economy of the nation, they will willingly adopt it.",

Therefore, the creation of revolutions or other riots is in the hands of those who want to somehow promote themselves, and they primarily pursue their own goals, which are very far from the goal of creating Bitcoin itself.",

What about the millions that don't like Bitcoin at all?The second thing, there is one huge difference between tweeting and doing stuff in real life!If it were by this forum SBF would have been assassinated 100 times, in reality, it got two booo while entering the court once.Third!There were supposed to be millions of users in India, yet when the last legislation passed and everyone got hit with a 30% tax on profits, how many did you see protest?Quote from: Fiatless on August 19, 2023, 01:19:08 PMMy question is how do this people intend to carryout this revolution?

What do you think should be the purpose of bitcoin? Should it revolutionized as an asset or a currency? Bitcoin can never be used without a third party service or high transaction fees for our day-to-day transactions. As an asset/investment seems more feasible but why create chaos if you are just getting bitcoin for personal and private reasons? Doing so will only attract unwanted attention and the government may impose additional laws against this idea.",

(since the 12th century AD). Bitcoin has been here for about 15 years+. I am not comparing or saying that Bitcoin is not capable. But for that to happen, sometimes it seems nearly impossible. But anything could happen. My point is, people are so used to using fiat currency that new things like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are just like a new big trend that will fade away. Those who do not know the true meaning of Bitcoin will say this for sure. We can not convince them or force them. That will be illegal LOL. Nature is full of good and bad things. It creates a balance. Just like yin and yang. There will always be people who are against Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not here to overthrow fiat money. It is here to co-exist with it.

What we need is an understanding government that can make the use of bitcoin easier for his own people.

Some people still don’t know the aim of bitcoin and make it look like a do or die affair if the government don’t legalize it. Every good thing takes time and bitcoin won’t be an exception. Let the adoption process continues gradually without any revolution, we’ll get there and achieve what we want without any fight with the government soon.",
