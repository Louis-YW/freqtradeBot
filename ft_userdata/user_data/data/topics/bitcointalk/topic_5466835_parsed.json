Before introducing you boss to accepting btc in his business, did you advice him to go and understand what btc is all about, and how transactions are being carried out? I guess not. If not he would have been able to tell the difference between btc and usdt as it's boldly written and have no resemblance. This is why it's advisable to tell people who you are introducing to Bitcoin all they have to know. So you don't end up in trouble. Some how, this story looks cooked up because I don't know if you can send the wrong coin to another wallet, I haven't tried that before.",

That day he messed up unknowingly with me.You yourself still need more knowledge on how bitcoin transactions work because why would anyone use your custodial wallet for that long if a transaction occurred? I think you should use a noncustodial wallet.It is always not good to me when someone who is supposed to learn in the forum tries to come up with some lies to fool people. When did you come to the forum that you were already acquainted with the knowledge of the bitcoin transaction that gave you confidence to tell your boss that he should start accepting bitcoin in his shop? And I wonder why you just come up with a lie like this to gain merit, which is not the right way for you to do that. Once you start lying on the forum, the forum members won’t value and what you are posting, and you won’t learn at all.",

I  am going to give you the benefit of doubt and ask you one question. If you didn't sell your coins to free up yourself, how did you manage to get bail?Contrary to the opinions and the story checks out, then it's your fault since you introduced someone to something they're not familiar with yet didn't give them the full details. You introduced someone to Bitcoin but first directed them to use an exchange and nothing about the technology/creating their own self-custodial wallet to manage it.If the story is actually cooked up then you should be ashamed of yourself.Some context:It's possible to send a different blockchain asset to another but it would be lost. Another point to note is that not all wallets/exchanges do address validation in the UI.",

Try spicing up your story very well next time and conducting some research on what could be happening before using those words and statements to kill yourself with your own hand. Because even a centralised exchange or a cheap platform can't even authorise a transaction with an address that's different from what it's supposed to be, I'm just wondering what you think of your readers.",
