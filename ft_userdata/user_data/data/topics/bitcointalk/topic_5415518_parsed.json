  "content": "By that, I mean the whole Terra Ecosystem: Luna Classic, Terra, Mirror Protocol, Anchor Protocol and even their stable coin UST !! ( Now renamed USTC ) So news of Do Kwon now getting arrested, his assets frozen etc, pretty much as bad as you can get.. yet the whole Terra Ecosystem is pumping !?WTF is this !! I think this is something so odd that may have never been seen in the history of trading ? I am aware that they are burning tokens but the supply is still ridiculously high... also Luna Classic is ranked 33 ? Ahead of many amazing projects with a clean record, huge volume and high revenue like AAVE !!There is something going on here, and I don't think Do Kwon is involved anymore as he's pretty much on his way to prison, so what do you guys think ? Binance is behind this ? Luna fans ?Worth noting we're not in a bull run, we're in fact very near the bottom of a brutal bear market ! This makes this story all the more unbelievable.",

DK arrest issue might still affect the whole Terra ecosystem but still this is not enough to compensate those who lose a lot of money. The issue will remain especially with the trauma so it will be hard for Terra to pump that much, better not to expect.",

Yes the news about the arrest of DK is very disturbing yet many still want to get involve because they want to have a profit in short term which I think is really possible. If you want to be more safe then don’t join the hype but if you still believe for the long term trend, then it’s your choice to buy or not.",

There should be a thing behind it but saying it was Binance is still a mystery to us considering that maybe more are involve or it's just the market that pushes it for them to get into the breakeven point or to cut their losses.",

There's very little natural trading action from that coin too, and I don't think that interests a lot of people from other markets. Terra will need a miracle if it needs to stay relevant on the scene, and I don't think that will happen given a lot of negativities surrounding the reputation of the said coin.",

What can we say other than greed and ignorance? Speculators which know what is going on do not care about Luna at all, and as long as they can make some cash they will trade the coin so they are motivated by greed alone, but there are also a lot of people which have lost everything and which want to believe the coin will recover, so they keep holding or even investing even more money in Luna hoping for the impossible, so it seems ignorance is the main motivator for those people.",

This makes this story all the more unbelievable. It's also worth noting how much the coin dropped from its ATH. Any pump is probably just a classic strategy for traders to scoop up anything that's literally on the floor and bounce after some gains. There are also some people that throw in a hundred or two in these types of projects expecting they could get like 1000x or more.",

Actually there's a lot of happenings right now with Terra and the whole project related to DK. It's a pump and dump project already which is too risky to jump in without having any analysis. DK with his arrest will put this project on total collapse, though with LUNC many are still optimistic since it is already a community owned and with a great support from Binance on their tax system. Well, to be more safe better to deal only with the money you can afford to lose.",

Someone big, or then pump and dump groups pushing it to the limit and trying to put their 'stable coin' on the map again.But obviously, all the Terra coins that you have mentioned wouldn't sustain its run. Again, sooner or later we will see a huge dump taking their profits in short term. And as others have mentioned already, if there is a pump then it might have subsided already.

You should think that no one would buy those coins now after what has happened with Terra a few months ago but still those projects have huge trading volumes. While i can still partly understand that fact for the new Terra, because it is just at a fracture of the old price and you could speculate that it maybe will at least reach 10% of its old ATH, i can not understand people that are buying Terra classic, because that project is pretty much abandoned.",
