  "content": "I just setup Armory on a new laptop and as I was importing my wallet by entering the root key, messed up entering a few of the letter sequences.When I went to submit this, it told me that key was recognized and asked me if the Wallet ID was mine.It was not so I went back and found my mistakes, got it right and got to my correct Wallet ID.I then entered a new passphrase and am good to go.But this got me thinking, what if I'd just continued with the Wallet ID that wasn't mine?Since the next step was to create a new Passphrase, could I have just done this and got access to whoever's wallet I mistakenly now have the root key for?",
