  "content": "Due to the fact that most forum users want to always be online they tend to use their smartphones to surf the forum more frequently. However most times pages on this forum are not very responsive or may not meet the expected properties of users like on their PC setups due to addons and extensions,others may have some difficulty using some addons like BPIP Extension, Bitcoin script and many others.most of these addons make surfing the forum easier for members.below are a couple of ways you can work around using extensions on some browsers with your Smart phone.BPIP Setup for for Mozilla Firefox The regular Mozilla Firefox for Android as of the time of making this post is not capable of adding customized addons including BPIP Extension.But not to worry there is a way to work around it and trust me you don't need to have a Mozilla account.Step 1Firstly due to the above factor you would have to use another version of Mozilla Firefox browser which is the  Firefox nightly You can get it from the Google play store at;  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenixOr from the official page at ; https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/channel/desktop/this is a developer version of Mozilla Firefox which is more  open sourced than the regular Firefox browser there by giving you less restrictions than in the regular version of which one of them is being able to customize your addons. Step 2Open the app and skip the sign in process  by clicking not now. And in the search bar paste the firefox addon store link belowhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/ and hit the search button.Step 3In the search box like in the image below fill in BPIP Extension and hit searchNote!! -->do not hit \"click here\" on the page as the addon is not available on Their android store.Step 4In the page like displayed below click the \"Add to Firefox\" button and click \"add\" in the message that displays.Step 5Next hit the menu button as shown in the image below, click \"add-ons\" and then click on \"add-ons manager\" click BPIP Extension and click settings.you can then customize the extension features to your preferred choice.ResultBelow are images of the result. notice the forum pages become more responsive after using this add-on, page tend to fit perfectly in your device's view point. important : Note that other extensions or add-ons can be added following same process as long as they are available on the Mozilla extension store.Using extensions on kiwi browserBelow is the link to a post by Crypto Library showing a step by step guide on setting up extensions on kiwi browser BPIP extention using method in Mobile BrowserNote that this thread will be constantly updated on using extensions on Smart phones with  popular browsers like Chrome,Tor and brave.",

Security wise and it is for sake of your money safety.If you have a smart phone just for Internet exploration and don't use it for money-related activities like I mention above, it's okay to play around with extensions.Thanks a lot for spotting this out tranthidung. However a great percentage of forum members don't store their main hodlings and assets on mobile wallets due to the fact that it is generally unsafe. Also,most of the forum extensions are open source so you can actually check for your safety before applying them.Quote from: jrrsparkles on November 30, 2023, 04:55:20 PMI see that you put a lot of effort into creating this thread which is indeed detailed and helpful but we already have a similar thread BPIP extension using method in Mobile Browser that explain the same context and the only difference is the browser used in it, so do we need one more?But it can be helpful for beginners so I expect it to be here in this section and would appreciate if you keep it updated.jrrsparkles your request had been in the thread even before your reply pls recheck.Secondly Mozilla Firefox is one of the most popular browsers world wide so it has a lot of users and obviously many are present on this forum. I will definitely update the thread once I am aware of any tweaks for other popular browsers like Chrome Tor and brave.",

Any feedback, security or level of difficulty on usage? Thanks for the share OP. Hey man, I also have been using mises for many months. So smooth and vast collection of crypto wallets and web3 apps. A crypto friendly browser indeed.BTW, I don't know if you have encountered any bugs in mises but I have. Sometimes I can't edit or copy-paste. Whenever I am trying to tap and hold to, copy some content, it would immediately take me to another tab. In short, the window would change, as in teleport me. The only way to fix this, is to close the browser entirely and reopening. Weird glitch...",

Mises is indeed buggy, although what you said doesn't happen to me, I have different set, their mises extension keeps popping up each time on app re-open even after removing it in setting, if I don't disable and try to connect to cosmos dapp, mises extension would pop-up instead of keplr. I have moved to mask browser these days, I like it's ui better. Drawback being it doesn't support Firefox extensions, for ff extensions I use Lemur (which has also become bit buggy lately but for Firefox extensions I still use it).",
