Basically, you're giving a different name to KYC and data collection. And what about the security risk of leak or breach into your database? Maybe I am not too familiar with the whole metaverse system, but wasn't the main idea of VR metaverse is an option to people to create any image they want? Wouldn't using their own image kinda defeat the purpose? and how can you be sure that the image they use for their avatar is rightfully theirs and not someone else's workout consent?",
