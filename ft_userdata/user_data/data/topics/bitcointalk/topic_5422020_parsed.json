They create a website and target members of various crypto related groups, send messages, and if some inexperienced crypto users fall into their trap, the scammers are successful. So they try to talk in a professional way but in reality they are also inexperienced.Quote from: SFR10 on November 20, 2022, 05:54:55 PMIt's been a while since I last saw this specific type of scam and the thing that separates it from the rest is the fact that somehow, all of the fake websites that are promoting this type of scam are using the same database for users [in other words, they're probably connected to one another]: Screenshot [there are a couple of duplicate pages (sorry )]All the websites have the same design, only the domain name changes. I came across similar websites a few years ago from Telegram scammers like this one. Nothing has changed from the previous website except the domain name.",

They targeted new gamblers who are not aware of this scheme, this is indeed very old I remember asking about this here in Bitcointalk some three or four years ago, it's really this old, I just knew that scheme will be back because it works for users who are not aware on how these things work and if the potential victim is greedy he will likely fall to this scheme.Schemes to scam people are always recycled if they made money in the past, they will always have victims in the future that are not aware of this, so it's better to share this scheme with friends who are new to online casinos.",

From creating the scam website, these scammers put a lot of effort into making the website accessible to crypto users. As new people are coming into the crypto market every day, their old tricks also look attractive to those new crypto users. As a result they keep sending random messages, they don't feel too shy even though they get abuse from old crypto users like us. Telegram is full of scammers now, you won't be wrong to think of yourself as a millionaire every day with the tempting offers you will get on Telegram. But until a crypto user sends money, the secret behind it is not understood.",
