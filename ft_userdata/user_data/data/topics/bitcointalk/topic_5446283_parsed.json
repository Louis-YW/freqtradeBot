I also was very tempted to buy in on it looking at what terra Luna had already done.Long story short terra Luna went into the deep blue sea and the team decided to revive it changing the coin in a way and airdropping it, all my friends got some but honestly what’s the point. I think you the first person to complain of not seeing theirs.",

I think the problem comes from you holding TerraLuna on the Binance Smart chain (BEP20 token) which is not the real Terra Luna. Terra Luna has its own blockchain. It's like holding wBTC (which is an ERC20 token and not the real Bitcoin) and when a snapshot is taken on the Bitcoin Blockchain, they won't recognize the wBTC you are holding.So the airdrop could have been for those only holding the real Terra luna",

Any project determined to be sketi inside the exchange range is instantly delisted from the Binance exchange by the moderators, and this is one of the most efficient ways I've observed growth in that particular section. Since last year's LUNAC airdrops were so trustworthy, I have no doubt that the cryptocurrency will soar during the bull season for altcoins. Usually, I'm not a fan of airdrops because I've witnessed instances where they were fake when a trader tried to exchange them for a reliable project.",
