  "content": "It would appear, based on the news this week, that major world governments like the US and others are cracking down on the notion of \"government-proof privacy\", and prosecuting companies and individuals who facilitate money transfer that cannot be potentially traced by a government. They are going after mixers and brokers who do not adequately engage in KYC.In short, it would seem that governments are trying eliminate the very thing that Bitcoin--and blockchain generally--was originally designed to accomplish.What does this mean for the long term prospects for cryptocurrencies? Will blockchain survive losing it's original purpose?My own answer is: \"yes\", in the short term, and \"maybe\" for the longer term.I have written before about different kinds of \"privacy\" that people might want, and most want privacy from other citizens, from companies, and from criminals: privacy from a targeted investigation from the government is a level that, in my estimation, a \"nice to have\" for most people, but not a dealbreaker.Hence in the short term, cryptos missing their original purpose is not something most consumers care about. Most holders of Bitcoin these days do so in a centralized way, e.g. with an app or a broker that keeps their account under their name, in a centralized database. As for the longer term, this brings up an important question: why use blockchain at all? Blockchain is slow and expensive to transact in on purpose because of proof-of-work and decentralization. No cryptocurrency will ever come even close to scaling to the billions of transactions each day by people worldwide. But a digital currency that is not blockchain-based can accomplish this and provide the same mechanism for speculation and value store that blockchain-based currencies provide. In my opinion, the long-term future of the actual blockchain architecture behind today's cryptocurrencies is... unclear.",

      "body": "It is fine to know that what happens in the blockchain is not only about privacy and neither is it about the mixers only. I believe that the potential of blockchain is yet to be harnessed fully. There is no doubt that the government will continue to fight against privacy but then there is a limit to what they can do. For instance they keep compelling the centralized exchanges to delist privacy coins, this does not mean that they will in any way infiltrate the decentralized exchanges to also delist privacy coins.There was when I was very much bothered about what is happening now. And as the time progresses my fears come to pass. Prepare your mind to see more regulations and shutdown of privacy enhancement systems in the cryptocurrency industry. But I am consoled by a singular phrase that says thus;  necessity is the mother of invention. The more and more the government fight against decentralization and privacy, the more private and decentralized individuals will find ways to continue scaling through.",

It's basically adding some code to a project that doesn't need it, and makes the project more expensive, slower, less secure, and more cumbersome to use. It would be like using an HTTPS/REST network layer to add two numbers together instead of just writing \"a += b;\". I mean, it's theoretically possible, but the only reason you'd do it would be to impress your boss that your project has some catchy buzzwords in it (and a good development manager would tell you to stop that and just get the project done ).",

I guess you can \"imagine\" absolutely anything, but the clear pattern since money laundering laws were first put on the books in the early 1970s is to go after criminals who cannot account for large amounts of money legally. The US at least, millions of Americans are paid every day for their work in untraceable physical cash, and there are no laws against it all of these years later. The only time the authorities get involved is when it is a lot of money where it's clear the money wasn't obtained legally.",

It's clear that kind of \"privacy\" (as opposed to privacy from criminals and marketers and other citizens) is going to be much harder to obtain, and will probably be reduced to very small networks and very obscure coins--which will necessarily be very risky since they will be such so small. This could effectively kill the entire ability of people to transact in a way that cannot be traced.But yet the only reason to use blockchain in the first place is to create these kinds of transactions.
