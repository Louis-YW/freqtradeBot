To talk the truth laugh wan kill me here for this very statement and post wey this nigga just drop so oh,ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.. Because na indeed reporting job this manchi just carry for mind to come do for this forum be that oh, with the hope of getting merits, ranking up, joining campaign and con dey chop money, abi?... No! No! No!.. No be so nah, because creating a single line statement literally add no value to the forum nor the person in question, and as such should be discourage.However, a better way to posting viral news is as follows1. Come up with a viral story2. Share your opinion about it, that could be of over 300 to 1000 words3. Ask the people what they feel about it (i.e To react to it)4. That's all...Note: Format for sharing viral stories",
