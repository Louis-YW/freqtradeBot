  "content": "X'thWorld Is Comming Back Online.As many of you already know we had to shut down our platform for some time while we fix important error to our script.All necessary fixes have been made currently, but just before we open up again we are making some UX UI and script improvements. Some of the script changes where not really possible to complete with a live web, so we used this opportunity to make those changes now and come back when we are done with it. Those changes have been mainly completed, we are just polishing it.We are hoping to activate site entry at 17th of May 00:00 UTC if no unexpected issues accrue.You can read about this more in our News -> https://www.xthworld.com/news.php.",
