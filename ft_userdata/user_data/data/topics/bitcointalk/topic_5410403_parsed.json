  "content": "What happened: hello people, good afternoon, I want to tell you about my horrible experience that was insoluble and painful for my daughter….  About a month ago, a partner paid me some design and development services for the binance platform, he sent me 6k in the crypto dai, through the BSC network, a network that freewallet accepted at the time and now I don't... my money is left in nowhere.  When I communicated with free wallet for several days, they shield themselves by copying and pasting, copying and pasting, but that is not the saddest thing... the saddest thing is that they left my daughter without her 15th birthday party, which will take place on August 29, currently I don't have my money for the party since they (FREEWALLET.org) refuse to release my money and return it to me, they just say that they don't have a time limit for releasing the money, they forbid me to give me the private keys and return my money, and also in releasing it, forgetting the great importance of my daughter's birthday, as if my daughter were trash... when I always trust them, now I can't have the party I don't come with the money I'm definitely going to leave a wallet in case someone wants donate and also my telegram in case a lawyer is willing to take the case because if the money is not released I will initiate legal action, the money raised with the donation will be for my daughter's 15th birthday... more until d  Say thanks to all… and don't use freewallet.org their support is rubbish and they keep your money…Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1177176Case ID:428938Reference Link: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7ba5593e338b4b1b02d9c37764ecef5379c9521da60ee719c316730c569fe0f3Amount Scammed:  6K (6.050 usd)Payment Method:DAI COINProof of Payment: https://imgbb.com/Bsswcy6https://imgbb.com/TYjtTm1PM/Chat Logs:  https://ibb.co/k9H80jFhttps://ibb.co/Yfy9990https://ibb.co/BN1yZ4Hhttps://ibb.co/D4JGXrshttps://ibb.co/hXxRbfhhttps://ibb.co/Bgz6RG5https://ibb.co/S738B4rhttps://ibb.co/6JMSBXmhttps://ibb.co/Qp746bphttps://ibb.co/h1rt0snhttps://ibb.co/VHwFctjAdditional Notes: birthday donations:Usdt address: 0x2635f7f32f5aba45e5f460e2c24f90bf856edb77",

That way, even with such a mistake, you would still be able to recover your funds by yourself.Wake up mate. Crypto is all about having control of your funds.",

It was supposed to be your money. The reason why you want your money doesn't matter. You can spend it on a birthday party, gamble it away, or buy a car with it. I said supposed to because if you had used an appropriate and non-custodial wallet, it would always remain your money. Now, it's Freewallet's. Quote from: Fkdamn on August 19, 2022, 01:58:32 PMthis shitty wallet doesn't accept bsc red, so it got stuck there...  I have no idea what \"BSC red\" is. You mentioned DAI in the OP. Depositing a non-supported token or using the wrong network is your mistake no matter what wallet you use. The only difference is that if you had used a wallet where you control the private keys, you could now take those keys and import them in a different wallet where that asset is supported. Since that wasn't the case, you are unfortunately stuck dealing with a scam service that doesn't want to bother to recover your crypto.",
