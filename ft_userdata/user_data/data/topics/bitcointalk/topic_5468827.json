  "content": "Hello fellow Bitcoiners. This is my first post here, I've been lurking for a while now and I've finally decided to create my account to engage here in the forum. I really like it here, you guys are awesome.   So, I've heard about the reused R value scenario and decided to check my past transactions to see if I could have been compromised at some point, and so I've noticed something rather peculiar. There was this one transaction from 2017, from a Legacy address I've used a couple of times, in which two input indexes had their respective R values sharing the first 7 characters. They were identical up to the 7th character, then afterwards it seemed to get random  [no patterns were found in the respective S and Z values]. Needless to say I immediately moved the funds out of that address, which was not much anyways. I'm not going to share specific details 'cause it could expose some of the addresses I'm still using to hodl my dust. I would like to know tho if this could be an indication of a biased nonce, and if this could have been exploited somehow to gain access to my funds, had some malicious entity spotted this in time to take any action. I think that's it for my first post. Stay awesome and stay safe!",

At first I was afraid this could mean a bias in the nonce, but based on the replies to this post I now think this is well withing reasonability.I'm not quite there yet with all the technical stuff, but I'm working on it.Again, thanks for your reply and for all the info provided.",

Your comment about \"you can't get anything for the elliptic curve multiplication\" makes it sound like you think it's about K-- the value that gets multiplied by G to produce R.  There isn't any special relationship between the lower vs upper bits of R.Secondly, for K it would absolutely absolutely not okay for the upper bits (or any bits of it) to be leaked/predictable/etc. as the lattice attacks on multiple signatures work just as well for the high bits of K being known.",
