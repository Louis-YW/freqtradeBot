  "content": "Since the old Pycryptotools repository at https://github.com/Toporin (and visible from PyPI) was deleted by the owner, I have downloaded the source code from PyPI and placed it back on Github: https://github.com/ZenulAbidin/pycryptotoolsInterestingly enough, that project itself was forked from Vitalik's now-discontinued pybitcointools.No changes made, just trying to prevent software from becoming vaporware. Though I'll probably have to give it a new name if I want to place it on PyPI.Enjoy.",
