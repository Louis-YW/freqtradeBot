They are old and if they are scammers then you could see scam accusations (though I have not checked either). I have no idea about the meter and I think they are charging extra for providing their service.",

I believe the problem is on the meter bridge rate because they might using an outdated rate.The AMPL price is at a stable price above 1 dollar which means rebase will give additional token to peg the price to 1 USD which in this case the OP should receive more. Nevertheless, swap should be 1:1 rate since it's instant while the rebase is once a day which will not affect the rate frequency unless the OP swap his token near the rebase period.",

How long is the bridging process happened and at what time? Losing 800 USD sounds like a lot if it is just because of rebase unless you're trading a lot of money.I've been following and participating in their community for a while, and I don't think they've ever scammed people. Most of the time people just don't understand how to use their token.",
