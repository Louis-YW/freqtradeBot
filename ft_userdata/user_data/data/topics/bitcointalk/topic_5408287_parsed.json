I'd appreciate it if someone could quote this post so this is all set in stone.Well, let's do a double quote for redundancy and prosperity.  Just wanted to say congrats on launching the new \"Sweepstake\" version of Stake.com in the US. I watched Eddie's Stream on Saturday and he visited the site.... and it looks better than the UK site.   Hope this is successful with all the US territories that are excluded from this. (The US always have to make things complicated)",

That really would be awesome, but not sure if it's on the site plans. But if you decide to do it, then it will be the crypto poker site #1 for sure.",
