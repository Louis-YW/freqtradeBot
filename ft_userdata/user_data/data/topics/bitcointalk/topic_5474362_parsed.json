There is no drag-and-drop Bitcoin mixer creator and these are not Wix sites.Maybe you can look at Jambler, they offer a ready-made script for cooperation with them.

Before answering your query, I will ask why you want to make your own mixer. If you are a developer, then you will not be asking this question in the first place, but let's say you want to get started or want to get an idea of how mixers work. That's why you are asking how to build them.Secondly, I will say making your own mixer is not an easy task. I am not talking about the coding or funds (yeah, you do need a lot of funds, like BTC if you are planning to make BTC mixers only and other alts if you are planning to make alt mixers).I am talking about legal cases and pressure from the authorities, and you should have a good knowledge of how to deal with bad usage of your product in action, which means you should have competitive knowledge and skills to deal with live problems. Overall, I will not provide any answers or links, as many other members have already done that. But I will suggest you play it safe.",

You may be able to create a basic bitcoin mixer by reading github codes and miscellaneous scripts but backend requires knowledge and experience. If your users use mixer to deposit them on exchanges, you have to beat blockchain analysis companies and return transactions to your users with aml score safety. It's not easy as it was in 2016, it's getting very hard these days, more experience and advanced techniques are required to bypass modern restrictions and analysis.Quote from: The Cryptovator on November 17, 2023, 09:15:43 PMIf you are a developer, you have to build a script where you will break the transaction history.

Unless you have a lot of funded bitcoins, a simple problem such as an increase in fees may lead you to stop.Quote from: shield132 on November 19, 2023, 07:10:46 PMWhy do you need to convert bitcoins in monero and then convert from monero to bitcoin?

There are many system used to check whether Bitcoin comes from illcit source and nobody know how exactly it works.I think that whole AML score propaganda is promoted by exchanges and blockchain analysis companies to make money out of thin air on platform and outside platform, I won't be amazed if there is a mixer that's actually owned by exchange or companies that run blockchain analysis. AML score is bullshit, it doesn't tell whether money is illegal or legal, it only tells how well you hide your identity but it's also paradox that it's not completely like that. Blockchain analysis companies often make mistake and their AML score calculation doesn't make sense because it can turn on false positive on completely clean transaction with clean history. It's a new way to market and make money for mixers but I can't blame them, they supply the demand.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 21, 2023, 10:09:42 AMIt's one of many ways to remove connection/link of your past Bitcoin activity. And while it's true the fees is high, few people use this method either by doing it manually or use mixer which claim to do that for you.What's the difference between sending 1 BTC to mixer and receiving 0.096 BTC from mixer compared to sending 1BTC to mixer, converting it in 226 Monero, then converting 226 monero and receiving 0.096 BTC. What's the difference? I send bitcoin and receive bitcoin. If it's an instant exchange or withing 24 hour timeframe, I think it doesn't make much sense.",
