      "body": "Good strategy. Many people underestimate the power of doing DCA, but if they understand that a small amount invested in Bitcoin every week or every month might make them some good profit in the future, and by good profit, I mean something reasonable and not peanuts. It's even more effective if you continue to do that regardless of the price of the coin because many people stop buying when they see the price has gone up. I know that you can get more value for the same amount if the price is lower, but that shouldn't stop you from accumulating more over time.For someone who hasn't started yet but plans to do so, the best time to start doing DCA is the end of the bull market and the beginning of the bear market. If you start buying at that point and buy all through the bear market and also through the recovery phase after that, you are going to have amazing profits by the time the next bull run approaches.That being said, something like that is only possible if you have a stable source of income and the capacity to have money allocated for this purpose. Using money intended for something else or borrowing to make investments is a bad idea.",

Just continue to DCA regardless of bitcoin current price. What’s important is that you have started investing already and will continue to do it for a long time. Remember, those who have succeeded and earn well from bitcoin are not those who are buying a lot, but those who have hold their bitcoin for long, indefinite years without getting tempted to sell.",

You are absolutely correct on what you said though people tends to call it investment because when they convert their fiat to bitcoin for longer period of time it turns to investment, at time of profits they wouldn't call it savings rather they would call it investment. It takes someone who has extra understanding of what you meant for them to understand it, generally had seen people regularly calling it investment but as you said it's a way secure someone assets to avoid losing the purchased power and that is best and smartest way we could involved ourselves to reduce deflation.",

And these are some of my investment in this year.Congratulations to have come this far in your bitcoin investment, I applaud your efforts in making your portfolio rich in bitcoin because that’s what is most important to own when you believe in this technology and the future of it. Having up to $600 worth of bitcoin in your portfolio is big even though it is nothing compared to the current price of one bitcoin today. I wish you a happy holding to enjoy the benefits of your investment later in the future as you hold patiently till then. Bitcoin technology really makes emphasis on privacy and security which is one of the major core factor to have made it stand out amongst other financial services. You should try as much as possible to make your portfolio private, you’ve just publicly disclosed your asset here even if you are anonymous here, it is not a good etiquette of a bitcoin investor and holder. Refrain from such in the future and I wish you all the best in this path.",

And these are some of my investment in this year.I will say that learning is the best key to success, because if a person doesn’t learn about what he/she doesn’t know, it will be very difficult to achieve what they want to become, and that’s why I said that learning is the best way of achieving success; but not all people comprehend that if they introduce themselves into something special instead of focusing and being serious about it by keeping learning about what they don’t know, they can’t. That’s why most fail easily.This proves that you have gone far in your investment because with the current amount of dollars you’ve invested so far in Bitcoin, even though you didn’t add anything now, I think with this you can gain a lot of profits in the future, which means if you are able to leave it for a long period of time.",

Try to invest as well as you can so you can have more Bitcoin, it is not compulsory to have one Bitcoin but if you get an opportunity to have one Bitcoin do not miss that opportunity. You can not earn without learning as you will first time have to learn and after you are done with that then you can proceed to earning and when you are earning, you will not get scammed as you would have already known about the potential scams that you will come across in the market because you were informed when you were learning and this is the reason learning is always more important for anything you want to do.",

This is where investing at the amount you can afford to lose should dig in. One is not required to start with a huge amount, but small amount can do well as long as you are consistent in DCAing with bitcoin. You are holding your bitcoin for long term, which means you shouldn't touch your investment if ever financial crisis suddenly comes in. Otherwise, that will lost its essence hodling bitcoin for future gains.",
