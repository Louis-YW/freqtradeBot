      "body": "Candle sticks aren't overrated. There are two types of traders based on analysis the fundamental and Technical traders. Although some combine both. But a technical trader can't do an analysis without candle stick, it is so important that it is indispensable. If you claim the YouTube videos you have watched or the other  online articles and videos you have seen on trading hardly talked about candle sticks then what could they be using. Candle sticks is a tool that help interpret past events (price action over time) it makes prediction of future price movement with regards to past events. This candle stick formation tells stories of prices. Just like the three black soldiers, the hanging man and lots of others each gives important signal to traders especially when they form at strategic point in the market",

All the trends, bands, wedges and so on are, after all, based on the candles too.The only thing is that TA itself is (in many/mosts cases) not good to be taken into account alone. There are many \"external\" factors to be taken into account when predicting what will the price do in the near future.For example, on Twitter, many tell that the price will go up \"any day now\", with nice drawings and so on, but they seem to have forgotten we're still in a historic crypto winter, hence also the price going further down is a valid option. Which has actually just happened.",

I like to look at candle formation before taking trades. Over time I've come to realize that every minute matters in the life of any candle one is looking at based on its timeframe. Don't rush to trigger trades no matter how bullish or bearish you think an ongoing candle shows its sign. Wait for the close of that candle. Even a minute is enough to cause a change in formation. Perhaps, this is where some traders get it wrong. As for those who don't rely on candles, they of course will have an avalanche of indicators to work with which other traders may not even be using. It's different strokes for different folks.",

I think there's quite a few problems with candlestick patterns that make them harder to trade - one of the main ones being what timeframe should you use? Rising soldiers on a 45m chart might be more likely to become rising soldiers on a 1h chart before the price moves in the other direction.Most traders with successful strategies will take on information from charts and will rely on a lot of different indicators (and sometimes new ones) and candlesticks might be able to form an extra confirmation on their trade (I don't think candlesticks are profitible to trade alone because they seem to be smaller moves).",

I mean, it's just part of the formula for you to be able to decide when to short/long or hold. Or perhaps, even better, you really don't need to memorize thousands of pattern you see on the internet, you just need to understand  the message behind a \"wick\". Is it a long wick at the bottom of the candle that could represent a reversal or is it just a short wick?As I was saying, it has to be used in conjunction with other indicators such as the relative strength/weakness of a coin vs BTC, their volume, or maybe moving averages to increase the probability of your directional bias.",

Candle stick is very important for traders.

Because candle sticks are perfect in the information they are revealing, it is not supposed to be completely used for making analyses, it is just the basic step ahead.That is the reason traders should use low or no leverage, trade with the amount of money they can afford to lose, set stop loss and take profit, or being able to still lose little after unfavorable highly volatile market in a way their trading asset would not be liquidated so easily.",

Candle stick is just a guide so maybe don't look at it as a money machine for you since even if you can see how the possible movement it will go base on the candle chart you see still there are chance that sudden price reversal will happen so be careful always on your trades and think always taking your profits and find another good position since this cycle is best to do on daily basis.",

It is somewhat telling us what is already happening in the market and that is only its purpose. But if we think that this could help us to predict what will happens next, yes it was, however, this couldn't give assurance that our analysis will be right.

Overall it would really give you the idea on whats the market is been doing or the status even lots been saying that it isnt really that precise but at least you do really have the idea on what you are doing.Unlike when you are just making out trades without any basis or analysis which it would really be turning out to be pure gambling. Make use of these tools rather than on having pure guess or makingorders without doing anything because it would really be that regretful if you do behave on this way.Its not overrated but rather a useful tool which you could really make use at leastand have the chance on giving out those probabilities on making profits.",
