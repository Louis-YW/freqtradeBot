Then post a nice ANN instead of this simple text based contents.I am guessing, you have not study your competitors on the forum yet. Everyone wants visually attractive contents. If you have your own designer then ask them to design you an ann however if you don't then feel free to contact me, I can help you in ANN design and bitcointalk marketing.PS: It's not only me but there are many professionals we have in bitcointalk who can help you in any service you need.

Please check the Terms of use and AML pages.Perhaps you just recently made a modification because on that day I read through the terms and didn't see any mention of KYC or any link to the AML policy. But it's all fine, no big deal.",
