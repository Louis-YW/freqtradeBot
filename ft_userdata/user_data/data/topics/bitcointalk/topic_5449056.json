Once they can tax us, they have their control.I believe that BTC only holds value when people can avoid having to convert it to currency (banks involved), because all over Europe and all over the USA governments will want their cut (taxes) and they want total control over what we own. The tax in my country would be so huge that it would discourage anyone from getting involved with BTC.",

Once they can tax us, they have their control.Taxation and confiscation of wealth are two different things, your funds can obviously be confiscated in any centralized exchange, either through the directive of your government, or by the decision of the exchange. As for taxation of Bitcoin, it would depend on the country you reside in, in the United States for example Bitcoin is taxable, but not in every country. Mind you also that taxation doesn't denote control.",

The clear difference between centralized and decentralized exchanges are that the centralized exchanges do require KYC that’s some few personal informations about you while the decentralized do not.

These seed phrases are so important that one’s it gets to another hand then your wallet might get compromised. The only thing shared is your receiving address and that is what should be paste on this exchanges in case you wish to transfer funds to your personal wallets not the seed phrase.QuoteMy bank will know that I'm in crypto when I transfer half of my savings account.

It's just the large amount of money being transfered that gives it awayYeah it a bit risky to transfer straight from your fiat account to your exchange if the country is yet to support the adoption of crypto. The easiest way is buying/selling through the P2P method. Even with P2P using centralized exchanges doesn’t guarantee much anonymity because of the KYC requirements",

The amount of BTC will be sent to my ledger nano x immediately after it is available on the exchange. It will be kept on the ledger device and I am not intending to trade any time soon.If the government comes after me, I can tell them I lost my ledger device or I can report it as stolen. They can never know.If it gets to that point, I can give my ledger device to my wife (she is from South America) and have her transfer the BTC to her own savings account.Which immediately leads me to my next question.I expect my government (EU) to attack BTC, and Binance will not allow this kind of transaction to my wife (non EU). If there is 1 BTC on the ledger and I keep it there, can I ever transfer that BTC to a friend's account (non EU) without either Binance or the government knowing where that BTC came from? QuoteHalf of the funds in your savings account is a whole lot of money, hope it is an amount you can afford to lose. It was intended as a 20% deposit to buy real estate. But my parents own multiple properties which I will inherit anyway. Also the mortgage intrest rates have gone up dramatically and with such high inflation I do not think it is a wise move to take on a mortgage now. I'd rather just inherit the properties, keep working like I always do and invest my earnings in crypto + precious metals as a hedge against the inflation. QuoteBTW on Binance you register with KYC and once you send funds into their platform every transaction you make there can be linked to your identity.

But given the complete anonymity in Bisq I get a feeling that I can not call for help when something goes wrong with a purchase.I also don't have friends who are involved in BTC and I don't intend on sharing sensitive information with more tech savvy family members etc. The multisignature wallet you mentioned sounds complicated. You say we both sign with our keys. I assume this is the seed phrase. I have always sworn to never enter that phrase online as it exposes me to hackers. This has already happened to me once with a regular visa card.And upon completion of the transaction, I assume that the BTC I bought ends up in my Bisq account. I assume that this is my BTC address but it is not linked to my identity. I hope I can transfer it from here to my ledger device instantly. This is all new to me and it seems like I have to try this with 20 bucks a few times so I can get comfortable with it. What I find questionable about the whole BTC discussion is that at some point I will have to convert my BTC to currency anyway, for it to have value. So no matter if I bought it on Bisq, or on Binance. If BTC ever gets to 1 million euros and I wish to use it for buying real estate, I will have to convert it to cash and then the banks + government will impose their control. It just feels like I am going to get involved in a witch hunt and I already know that my bank will treat me like a criminal because I invest in BTC. It does not stop me though.Even if BTC only has a 2x potential for the future, that still is a much better option than leaving my savings in a bank where they lose 10% of its purchasing power. every year. The bank clerk offered me a 2% rate on a savings account. I literally laughed at her",

But you see the difference in buying and selling so basically, the allowance or gap you see isn't the fee but just actual market prices.2. Yes, that's why they're asking our details.

      "body": "Binance is only one of the biggest centralised exchanges in the crypto world; there are actually many other exchanges where bitcoin is traded. With this situation, it is common that the price on one exchange and other exchanges might have a slight difference. However, it will gradually become the same since people can do arbitrary trading, where they can buy at a lower price and sell at a higher price, and at some point the price will be the same. About Binance regulation, well, Binance is centralised, so there is a probability that governments would ask this kind of thing of them and hold them responsible. But I think Binance will be careful about its obligation to open our personal data to any government that asks because their business depends on customers favour; however, when it's unavoidable, Binance might do it since probably there's nothing they can do to refuse. This is the weakness of centralization after all: they're doxxed, and they can be cornered when the government wants.",

MiCA law will be discussed in Europe this week. I am curious to see if politicians will succeed in demanding a tax on BTC earnings or holdings.Your bank didn't react too much if only a few. And, this really confuses me, how your bank knows you just bought btc?, are your bank open pair with btc?. So I don't really care too much about banks, because bank and btc is very much different, both can not put it together at the same time. This is be point your politicians make decisions, I don't know if another currency like USD has tax in your country, that possible bitcoin too, but if not and your politican demanding a tax on BTC, that possible bitcoin is asset like a gold or silver.",

That in itself can let the bank know that you have interacted with the said centralized exchange.But yea, it may seem to be overreacting for you and for most people, but OP just seems to want to be totally sure that he got all his bases covered — which is totally fine.",

But given the complete anonymity in Bisq I get a feeling that I can not call for help when something goes wrong with a purchase.They do have a responsive customer support system which mediates between trades, and arbitrators which can help settle any disputes resulting from it. Many zero privacy exchanges do have a very poor customer support system, so it's not a direct correlation.Quote from: WeThePe0ple on April 16, 2023, 08:59:12 PMThis is all new to me and it seems like I have to try this with 20 bucks a few times so I can get comfortable with it. This is what I do when trading on a new platform or when returning to one after a while of not using it. Risk very little amount to familiarize yourself with the process.On having to convert back to fiat inorder to use your Bitcoin, that is true for most of the case. There are instances where purchases were made directly in Bitcoin for other assets, but these were peculiar situations.",
