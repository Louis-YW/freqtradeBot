Just ask the question, and people will answer you. First, before you think about benefiting from Bitcoin, I will advise you to learn how what you want to benefit from works first so that you don't get more confused than you already are right now. So I will like you to browse through the forum, use the search option, and search for familiar questions like the history of bitcoin, how it works, it's nature, and you will have a lot of material to study about it. Another thing is that don't conceive in your mind that you can make fast money from bitcoin, as that might end up misleading you and you getting disappointed by the result. It's a means of investment, but the profit doesn't come real quick. Only those who are patient enough to hold for long enjoy the reward, so whatever you do, don't add get rich quick as one thing you want to enjoy from it.",

Bitcoin is decentralized digital currency, that has value's. There are two major factors in bitcoin you can easily benefit from. You can start by learning how to trade cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular. You can as well,  get a good amount of bitcoin and get hold of it for a while, till the price you got it for goes up and that makes your investment increase in value.",
