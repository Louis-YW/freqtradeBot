  "content": "Hello, Bitcointalk! Excited to show off something that we have been working on.DeCommerce - Allows people to transact business without middlemen. No Middleman, no Bank, no Big Tech, no Government.Peer-to-peer web• Distributed web (Hosted on IPFS)• 100% Availability guarantee• Can't be shutdown• Can't be hacked• No DDoS attacksPeer-to-peer payments• Payments straight to your wallet• No middleman, No bank needed• 100% Autonomous ecommerce• No permissions needed• Digital dollar & euro laterBlockchain technology• Operational costs are dirt cheap• Censorship resistant ecommerce• Resilient access to data• No server needed• NFT domainsLink ↗https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/QmQ2bzmZWRy1Cwm3s8xPyuCwiR7xucUMneSjZdQQKRGQuX/Website ↗https://www.ivyca.com/decommerce/About DeCommerceDeCommerce is a software (like WooCommerce, PrestaShop etc.) allows you to run fully autonomous ecommerce store. It leverages the blockchain technologies to let users connect, transact, and own all their interactions without relying on a centralized infrastructure in multiple areas:• Hosted on IPFS• Crypto payments• NFT DomainsDeCommerce has no backend like standard CMS systems. The settings are made in the configuration file. Here you can set for example your bitcoin address to receive payments, menu links etc. You can add products by editing the JSON file.After everything is set, you can upload your website on the IPFS network, and it will work always and forever. To upload your website on the IPFS network you can use a pinning service like https://www.pinata.cloud/, or you can run your own IPFS node like IPFS Desktop.You don't need maintain a server, or database and things around due to it's maintenance-free nature.The main difference with other CMS is that, when you need to make a change, you have to upload the website once again (due to it's static character), and you get a new CID because you now have different content. This process takes less than 5 minutes. After the upload you have to redirect your NFT domain to this new CID, or you can use IPNS, or DNSLink. With it, you can create a single, stable address that points to the CID for the latest version of your website.Advantages• Can't be shutdown (written in Blockchain)• Can't be hacked (works similar to a static website)• No DDoS attacks (works similar to BitTorrent)• 100% Availability guarantee (duplicates around the World)• No server needed (just upload files on the IPFS)• No database needed (everything runs inside the browser)• No permissions, no third party included (Only you and your customers)• 100% Autonomous ecommerce (Once set, it runs always and forever)• Crypto payments (No bank needed)• Privacy coin (Monero) to maintain privacy and anonymity in tranzactions• Stable coin (Tether) to maintain stable prices pegged to USDOperating costs• FREE, if you can set and run your own IPFS node like IPFS Desktop• Typically, it will cost up to $1/month for IPFS Pinning service like Pinata*Censorship resistant ecommerceCensorship resistance is essential in many nations where governments enforce rigid laws and restrictions. As long as these restrictions control what businesses can sell or for what individuals can spend their funds, true freedom is unattainable. Therefore, censorship resistance is ideal for anyone who can't freely do business or perform transactions without government or third-party influence.Hosted on IPFS (Distributed web)The IPFS is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS allows users to host and receive data in a manner similar to BitTorrent. As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Any user in the network can serve a file by its content address, and other peers in the network can find and request that content from any node who has it using a distributed hash table.Crypto paymentsPayments for goods, services straight to your walletYou can accept payments from your customers in less than 5 minutes - no middleman included:• Open a cryptocurrency wallet address• Enter the wallet address in the decomerce's config fileYou can accept following crypto currenciecs• Bitcoin (BTC)• Monero (XMR)• Ethereum (ETH)• Tether (USDT)NFT domainsSelf-custody is one of the most important features of an NFT Domain. This is what makes your domain decentralized - This is what gives you complete control over your domain! A self-custody solution is possible because your domain is an asset on the blockchain and stored like a cryptocurrency in your wallet. This custody method gives your NFT Domain “superpowers” that traditional domains do not have.",

      "body": "HelloIt is very interesting indeed. Is it already available for anyone to create their own website using decommerce? what would be the steps to follow?I think your major challenge here is to get merchants to actually build their website in here (+customers). I think it would be easier to start and grow to create a marketplace (Amazon for Crypto) with the same idea you have (Crypto payments, censorship resistant,..)Customers > people that want to spend in crypto rather that Off Ramping to FIAT. Sellers > a solution to start having available products from day 0 would be to bridge to Amazon (or Aliexpress...)so you can add products in your site that are available in amazon and at the moment that the customer buy them it automatically buys on amazon and sends the order. with some time, you'd be able to onboard real sellers. if you think it is interesting and want to develop, happy to help",
