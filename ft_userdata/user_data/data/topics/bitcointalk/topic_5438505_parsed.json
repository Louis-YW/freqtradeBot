I'm curious who can get hold of the last one. I grabbed one of these shortly after the auction ended as I missed the end... I was happy that the one I was eyeing was still available.Â  I received it a couple days ago and I can understand how HB has 50+ hours into each piece.Â  The pictures honestly do this piece ZERO justice.Â  I could not be happier to add this into my collection.Â  A well made hand crafted collectible.Â  Thank you HB!!",
