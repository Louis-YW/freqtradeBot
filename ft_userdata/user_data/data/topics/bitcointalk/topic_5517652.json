I am not sure what the difference between the 2 is and does it work the same way ? Thanks",

Or does the node have to be always running Turning off the PC without shutting down the PC may result of block corruption there's a way to shutdown the node safely by using this command belowCode:bitcoin-cli stopAfter that you can now turn off the PC.When you start your PC, the node will automatically start, but you must allow it to sync to download the most recent block before you can make any transactions. Otherwise, the transaction will not be processed.",

Or does the node have to be always running Your have to close your node first, then turn off your computer. If you abruptly turn off your computer or something like electricity loss or your computer automatically shut down because of run out of battery, your node will have technical errors when you turn it on again.You can try, whenever you are turning off your node, you will see a notification like \"Do not shut down the computer until this window disappears\"This notification means the same information that I explains to you.",

      "body": "A few days ago I completed Node. But I did not know that through a code we can block corruption. I've had block corruption several times because I don't know this code. But sometimes if the bitcoin node is shut down before shutting down the pc and , waiting until the node disappears does not cause block corruption. So I think if you somehow shut down your node before the power goes down, your block corruption won't happen.",

I am not sure what the difference between the 2 is and does it work the same way ? Thanks There are two ways to run a node. You either download the client yourself by going on bitcoincore.org, and running the daemon (bitcoind), or you download a software that does this job for you, like Umbrel. You connect it to the Internet, the OS starts, and it begins downloading and verifying the blockchain. If you don't know anything from software, then perhaps going with the easy route (Umbrel), would be wiser. You can also install various plugins later easier, like lightning wallets etc. There's an Umbrel store.",

What does that mean?I guess OP means Start9.It's a node suite like Umbrel and MyNode.I 've tried Start9 in the past. It also includes a feature to run a Monero node.

Unfortunately (in my opinion) these suites include too many tools that are not bitcoin related. Obviously, they are open-source and support self-custody in everything, but I prefer a machine dedicated to Bitcoin software and tools.",

      "body": "Running the Bitcoin core software on an old Linux PC ( I'm using Bodhi at the moment ) is pretty simple, you just need to make sure that you have a large enough disk ( I would suggest 2TB ). You don't need to run core all the time. Once every 3 or 4 days is fine, and then just to sync the blockchain. Of course if you are sending or receiving coins, then you need to run it. The software seems to be pretty robust, and usually recovers if you have an unexpected shut down. Of course, you shouldn't rely on this, and close core and wait for the \"don't turn off message\" to clear before shutting down the computer.",
