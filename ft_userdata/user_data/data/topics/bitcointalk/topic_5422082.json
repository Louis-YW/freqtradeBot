I have earned over $30 before in free spins, I have earned $4 before, there are even ones that I earned northing. But free spin should not be what we should so consider like the luck of life.",

The last time I earned something free from gambling websites was when BTC has very low value and many faucets still run, that's couple of years back. If I got this right you are asking if anything good can be won from the free spins.Most providers like Play n Go and others is exactly at these free spins that they incorporated the game play mechanics to make you win considerable amounts even with the lowest bet,mostly they use different multipliers to make your bet 0.10 dollars look 10 dollars during these free spins with x100 multiplier.The only problem is though that you have to play a lot of times and to get a lot of times these free spins in order to come out with any big reasonable win.This only happens rarely but when it does happen it brings you considerable profit depending on the amount of bet that you are playing.",

      "body": "You could win thru free spins but never expect big profit and aldo, would be hard to make a 'living' out of your slightest chance to win. Also, in some casinos, you have to deposit first in order to withdraw your winnings. There are also instances wherein the reward  in free spins are different from the huge rewards in the actual game. Ofcourse, the house won't allow players who haven't paid a single cent to win huge amount. Those free spins will just be promotions in order to attract players in a certain gambling platform. I'd be more glad of huge bonuses in special ocassions than free spins because that would be more enjoyed by players who invested in a platform.",

I've been getting free WoF spins from freebitco.in and a few times I got 5000 rw/tickets and btc till now. I'd say freespins on freebitco.in works. It may not work on the other casinos but freebitco.in is legit. I am actually making money from those spins and taking money from the casino. I have no idea how they are sustaining this because this must be one of the most generous casino ever existed and still in business after like 6 or 7+ years.",

Still depends on luck though, even in land based casinos, free spins will not equate into good rewards.So yes, you can still win with free spins, but your luck will still have the last say.I can't remember when was the last time I earn something free, oh wait, yeah, got a free spin or free bet when my account got upgraded on another gambling site. So it's either I take the free and make it cash or go and bet that as free.",

Stay around here in the forum for a while and you might see some gamblers posting about their wins with free spins. Just curious, is this thread just for free spins?

The last time I earned something free from gambling websites was when BTC has very low value and many faucets still run, that's couple of years back. It's possible but I have not done it yet. All my free spins before were unlucky and I don't want to stay on that kind of hobby where you are just waiting to be given freebies, I'd rather deposit and play the game and try my luck. The difference is you are more careful when it's your money that is on the line. It changes the way you view gambling so eventually profits will come. As long as you can keep that kind of discipline then you might get lucky one day but I've never heard a story of a gambler having good rewards whose initial capital is from faucets and free spins.",

The last time I earned something free from gambling websites was when BTC has very low value and many faucets still run, that's couple of years back. I made it in Fortunejack long time ago, they gave players free spins regularly and I won it once or twice I cant remember it correctly. It is possible to win from free spins but it needs a big luck because the hardest thing is to complete the wagering requirement of the free spins. However free spins that completely free is now rare to find, most casinos are now giving it to active players only because many people tried to abuse it. Means that you cant stick with free spins only on online casinos if you are not even playing with your own money and become active players.",

The purpose of Free spins are to encourage you to play and introduce you to the games, it is very possible to win something reasonable with them that will encourage you the want to come back to play again. Free spins are the same as playing with some money it is just that the casino awards them to you as bonuses, and although some people may not value them because they were gotten freely, It doesn't make them in any way useless or worthless.",

Blackjack.fun is the only casino that offers this kind free spin before that give you an actual reward without any risk involved because you can earn free spin just by voting or chatting but right now they already add wagering requirements rules before you can get the rewards on free spin. The feature that you are looking for is very rare and you can only see free spins like this on  new casino promotion for attracting new user purposes.Instead of free spin. Just participate on Sportsbet and Bitcasino prediction contest on game and rounds board for a risk free bets. It's more worth it than free spins.",

I don't know how much is \"some good reward\" for you, but YES, you can still win with free spins.That's from playing a slot machine called Dig Dig Digger from BGaming, it's also called Diggy's Narnia, Diggy's Hole bring lotion, or Diggy's Scatter by the BlackJack.Fun community. In that screenshot, Diggy gave me 1.35 mBTC just from free spins. It's not a jackpot of thousands of dollars, but I believe it's good enough considering that it's merely from free spins.",

Free spins are used to lure gamblers into gambling in their casinos, they also use this for promotions in other to satisfy their customers and some gamblers that don't have funds for gambling but have interest.As you know gambling is about luck so if you are lucky on that freespin and  win big nobody will deprive you from your funds even the casinos because they know it will make their customers not trust them and this will not bring good reputation of the casino. OP if you don't have anything to gamble with then you can continue with your free spin maybe someday you might win big",

Unless it's thousand free spins, I doubt if you can get a reward for that, most of these free are likely just for marketing purposes. I make myself out of free spins but most of it was just too low of a reward and you can't even withdraw it. We're on the same boat then.",

It will depend on how good your luck is when you play slots because slots are a gambling game that really depends on luck. But you can still get a nice prize from the casino's free spins, but you have to really have some big luck.Indeed there is no risk at all with the free spins because you are not using anything to bet. But usually, those free spins are given to you after you deposit a certain amount and you will also get a certain number of free spins. But for the result, it will depend on your luck.",
