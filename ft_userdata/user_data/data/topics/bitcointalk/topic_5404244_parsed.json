Tbh, your question is irrelevant, what i consider most relevant is why a user will be on such bounty TG groups, despite the fact that bounties are a shit show in recent years, you should really reconsider your participation in such groups and in bounties in general.Aren't you interested in Bitcoin knowledge? Mind you that if you are, you can enjoy yourself on the forum discussing about Bitcoin and other interesting whatnots with people that have unimaginable knowledge about Bitcoin, now imagine what that will do to your own knowledge?But you miss out, just cause you wanna keep posting bounty reports after reports !",

That way, you won't have to worry about how to get rid of red trust.It's not always so simple.  There are plenty of bad actors in DT and many of the DT members don't even interact with members of this forum outside of spamming on their threads for signature earnings so it's really about who agrees with whatever nonsense they are spouting here.  As someone who has been left negative trust by DT members attempting extortion or just bad actors acting out of jealousy with ridiculous claims, I can tell you that DT still has a long way to go before it's back to being respectable.  Right now, some of the most included members of DT are repeated liars and trust network manipulators who have chased much of the talent from these forums as a result of their quest for power.  It's gotten a little better recently with the departure of trolls like Lauda, Vod, TMAN, Last of the V8s, and a few others (owlcatz hopefully being next), but they still need to be cleansed from the DT network.  However, their supporters in the DT network are hell bent on keeping these trolls there as they put a lot of work into supporting their trolling to punish those that they have petty disagreements with via manipulation of the network.  It is nice to see things moving in the right direction though.  Most of the heavy lifting seems to have carried itself out.",

Most posts about merit sells and account sells that I encountered here all emanated from these telegram groups. Op mentioned that they always say how to remove negative tag but no tangible means was ever mentioned. It could therefore be a means to scam those who have tags by making them believe it can be removed by paying some amount of money.And one funny thing is that even if someone is scammed, the victim will not have the guts to bring the matter to the forum and it becomes a case of \"let the dead Bury the dead.\"",

On your own, it is absolutely impossible to get rid of Negative trust, only the person or those that gave you a Negative trust are the ones that are able to remove it if for some reason, they have a different opinion or decide to change their mind on how they trust you. The forums trust system is managed by the community, permit me to use the word \"Decentralized\" to further explain this, the forum trust system is completely decentralized, this means that Not you or the admins of this forum can utter or change a trust another user leaves on your account, be it a Negative trust or Positive or even Neutral trust, only the person that gave the trust has access to change it.",

Retaining a rule made a decade or so ago while it's obvious that current circumstances may have arm twisted such a rule is analogous to retaining a pathway in the rural areas used by passersby even when vehicular movements have become noticeable. The point I'm labouring to make here is that there should be a realignment to suit present reality on ground. Supposed the situation that led to the red tag has changed or resolved but the person who left it has exited the forum. What then happens? It brings up the issue Bestchange had while starting out its campaign here and the tag TMAN left on the user which I think has been resolved. Yet, TMAN hasn't been online for over two years now and Bestchange still bears that tag till date. In a situation like that, I think there should be something theymos, the admin or the forum should be able to do inorder to overwrite the red tag. The forum should adjust for better on that. After all, they say change is the only constant thing in life.",

      "body": "Actually, someone did also ask this question on \"How to get rid of negative trust?\". There is only one way on how to remove a negative trust on your account which is to ask the forum user who gave you the negative trust on your account. If you think that a certain forum user give you negative trust even though you are sure that you didn't deserve it then asking that forum user to remove the negative trust and explain why it should be removed. If the negative trust or red trust you see on your account is because you violated a forum rules which the punishment is giving your a account a negative feedback or you are a scammer. If you have more than 1 negative trust e.g, you have a total of 4 negative trust from 4 forum user then only those 4 user can remove the 4 negative trust they sent to your account.I have checked your profile and you don't have negative trust so you don't have to worry about negative trust unless you have other account that has negative trust or someone you know that has negative trust on their account.",

And you're the next now. Why was he giving a negative trust? Simply he's a cheater. I guess he copy my report without editing properly. You should have spent some time to check his previous reports too. He has series of accounts especially on Telegram.
