Two weeks ago one asic decide to shut off. After research The control board was dead so I replace it. But after replace it and setting the asic this one not working.Everything look ok but the network status stay in red on dashboard control panel. Some idear of the problems ? Other info, the firmware is not the same as my three other asics.

Something is strange because the three other asic with the same hub, same pool adress and same worker name are working fine… Yes, based on your current logs above. Can you try to check if that miner is set to DHCP/Static mode if it is set to Static switch it to DHCP to let the miner use a unique local IP sometimes if the miner is set to static IP and another the device uses the same IP the miner internet not work properly so switching it to DHCP can solve this problem. If it didn't work try to disconnect all devices and only run this miner. Also, would you mind telling us exactly what pool you are currently mining and what other ASIC miners you have?Because if you are mining in Nicehash with this unit it won't mine unlike other ASIC miner like Antminer units doesn't have any issue mining on Nincehash. Avalon units usually have problems connecting to the Nicehash pool.",

The asic who not working have a different firmware of the three other since I have change the control board Would you mind using a tool to check if your network and miners are set up properly?You can use the Canaan tool called the FMS app you can download it here https://canaan.io/service/447And diagnose the issue there if its a pool issue it is marked as red or if it's an IP issue it's the same marked as red same goes for other issues better use the manual on how to use the tool. Also, try to reset your unit to the factory default you can hold the reset button or IPreport button for 10 seconds then release it to restore it to factory default. If it still does not work try the aging process using the FMS tool to refresh this unit.If nothing else works there might be an issue on the mac address and maybe one of the units has the same mac address it could also lead to a connection problem.",

Maybe if it's possible this solution can work ! The firmware link for Canaan units already posted above https://download.canaan-creative.com/The only problem is that 1246 remove the firmware from their download page I don't know why but there are two firmware available on that page before. If Canaan recommends to replace the control board then that's the only option and I think once you buy it directly from them I'm sure they can also provide firmware for that unit. Just don't buy from 3rd party.",

I have also change the worker name with one of my friend and the problem still the same. The only difference between the four asic is the firmware. The asic who not working have a different firmware of the three other since I have change the control board This is pretty crummy i had to buy from 3rd party because they dont sell the boards or atleast not at the time. if this company isnt a scam i dont know what is. all this problem with firmware and miner ID garbage for what? to track for what? canaans tracking cost me 1000s of dollars and over a year of hashing. And their only course of action is yea send me $50+shipping ill send another control board to you................you made a TON of money off these at the time and you want to charge me for a hashbaord and contorl board that originally died under \"warranty\" (looooooooosley said)when you waste all your time trying to get expensive gear running again it really leaves a sour taste in your mouth. i cut my losses on this garabage",
