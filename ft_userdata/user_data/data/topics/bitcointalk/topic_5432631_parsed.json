We have recently seen a great increase in the adoption of Bitcoin in Africa in respective of many African countries that still refuse there citizens from using any means of cryptocurrency. Just like we have seen some countries that had implemented the use of Bitcoin for payment of services and goods, we should expect more because the reality of what cryptocurrency can effect in our lives is steadily being visible to people many the use keep increasing.",

It is basically always a small (usually not very digital looking) store in Africa. I really like that this is happening and I am wondering what are the experiences of users from Africa. One country in Africa (The Central African Republic) has made bitcoin a legal tender and many others accept bitcoin as means of payment. Out of the fifty-four countries of Africa, bitcoin is banned in just six countries ( Ethiopia, Tanzania, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, and Congo DRC).One of the major attractions to bitcoin in Africa is the constant devaluation and loss of value of local currencies. The high rate of the unbanked population is also driving the increase in bitcoin adoption.Another factor is the high transaction fees from commercial banks and their unreliable services.QuoteIs it really common to use bitcoin in the everyday payment?Using bitcoin as a form of payment is unpopular because most people that buy bitcoin usually use it as a hedge against inflation and for investment purposes. Many people are yet to enjoy the benefit of bitcoin as a currency. But with the increase of bitcoin awareness, many businesses have started accepting bitcoin.QuoteWhat types of wallets do people usually use to complete these transactions?Sadly most people still keep their funds in centralized exchanges. This is because these exchange firms engage in expensive and attractive advertisements. Some of them at unaware of the dangers of keeping their coins in these exchanges. But the current fall of these exchanges in recent times has improved and spread more awareness about the need to keep their funds in decentralized wallets.QuoteWhat are the advantages/disadvantages of bitcoin payments in Africa?Some of the advantages include cheap transaction fees, reliable transaction process, access to quality and unrestricted banking facilities, hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, profitable investment opportunities, and promotion of privacy.Some pitfall of bitcoin in Africa is that most Africans are not enlightened enough to understand the coin. Unstable power supply and internet connection have made bitcoin inaccessible to some people. Most Africans might not have enough money to buy bitcoin because of harsh economic conditions.",

The answer is simple, these people have been looking for a way for escape the corrupt government and poor banking system.

QuoteMore than 42 million Nigerian adults live in rural areas that lack basic banking services.

On the other hand, I do not rule out the use of a stable currency such as USDT due to the stability of its price linked to the price of the dollar.2- The Binance platform offers many good options for carrying out regular transactions, including the internal transfer system that enables transfers between members for free in real time and the BinancePay system in addition to the Trust wallet that gives many features. I think Binance is the most used.3- Crypto payments can help people bypass their miserable financial systems and achieve greater financial stability. However, this system has no benefits for the state because it uses a classical financial system that does not allow transactions that are not under the control of the state.",

If you are talking about the posts in forum, I think they are created to get merit for ranking up.  I do not know its relation to the current status of Bitcoin to Africa.  IMO, this isn't actually adoption but staged adoption in order to fish for merit.  I maybe wrong though and sorry if it offended anyone.Quote from: hZti on January 01, 2023, 04:51:08 PMIs it really common to use bitcoin in the everyday payment?It is uncomon in the current situation because there are not many physical establishment that accept Bitcoin payment.  It maybe common online due to 3rd party processor but I do not think it is common in the local marketplace.

Idunno, it just makes sense for the majority of the people to want to use USD instead of a volatile currency.Right. Why go the obvious shaky path when you can always travel the already-paved road anyway? But I guess it also has something to do with the earning opportunities that bitcoin and crypto presents to the African people. There's not much opportunity for Africans to earn money due to a lot of corrupt leaders and public officials that hinder the economic growth of their countries. With bitcoin, you can easily buy those or work for those and keep it, and hope for the best—at least that's the way I see it.

That's 0.025% adoption. And the real adoption is a tiny fraction of this number. Much, much less for sure. Most of these transactions don't even include payments too, as it's just traders and speculators, big exchanges, and other entities moving funds around trying to keep up with the market or just trying to get their money somewhere else.

The state of bitcoin right now isn't really great for micropayments unfortunately, and obviously Africans know this. Given how bitcoin boomed a lot in the past years, I think the line of thinking is to be able to get as much bitcoin as possible before it booms again and make a fortune for these merchants. It's as if they're banking heavily on the possibility of bitcoin going off again in terms of its price.",
