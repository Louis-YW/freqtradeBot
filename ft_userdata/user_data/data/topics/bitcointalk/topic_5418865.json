The first is the reward for the block mined, the second is transaction fee. Gradually, the transaction fee is replacing the block reward.Nobody knows what would happen after one century, that is over a hundred years. But if all bitcoin are mined, that would not negatively affect bitcoin in any way.",

Infact, within the next decade, over 99% of the total Bitcoin supply would have been mined already, leaving the final 1% to be spread out over a ~century. What this means is that the network would shape up how exactly it would function without any more coinbase rewards.On chain; it would function as designed, miners would earn only from transaction fees as a form of incentive.This could lead to a bulk of transactions occuring off chain, but that remains to be seen.",

After that happens, the block reward will start playing a secondary role in mining incentives, and gradually will become irrelevant.Miners will continue to mine after the last bitcoins are received as incentive because at that time they will be getting mostly paid in transaction fees.So, basically, everything will continue in a similar way.

What about 100 years earlier? I'll be either very rich by that time or very poor and depressed, hopefully raising my grandchildren.

After a century we'll have much demand for bitcoin than the present. This will keep the demand growing with time against the limited supply which can't be produced anymore. So, the transaction fee will make big contribution to the miners as they'll continue to be the key players in the market.",

So it would be another 110 years for technically all coins mined, but practically the fresh coins will become a tiny part of available supply in the market. We already saw how leavenings affect the price, I expect that to be the case for the next 10-15 years, but with each halvening the effect will be smaller and smaller, so the corresponding cycles will have smaller gap between the top and the bottom. Bitcoin will become less volatile.",

Because Bitcoin transactions that occur on the blockchain network will require a series of verifications. So, the role of the miner will later shift as the party verifying the transaction.",

Making transactions on BTC will still be cheaper because of LN despite all coins being mined.Mining will not stop even if all BTC is already mined, they still can mine transactions.I'm still up to believing the truth is stranger than what we imagine though which miners are going to be regulated with a license required.",

Theoretically, you can think about and speculate about this, but I believe that there are more important things at the moment, the solution of which is better to deal with. Therefore, I will say that you don't need to fill your head with unnecessary thoughts. When all bitcoin are mined, the world will have time to change more than once, and most likely, the attitude towards this event will also change several times.Based on market mechanisms, if all bitcoin are mined, then the supply of it will be severely limited. If interest in btc by that time continues and grows, then everyone will want to have bitcoin in their pocket (or part, or part of part), therefore, demand will increase and lead to a multiple increase in price. I can't say for sure whether this will be the case, but there is potential for multiple growth. Which will be appreciated by our descendants.",
