Is there no any news or warning message if they want to shut down their exchange? you should check your email.",

To be honest, you haven't posted anything useful. The link to the CEO of the company points to the ANN thread on Bitcointalk that was posted by a bounty manager. I am not sure if you think Wapinter and the CEO are the same person or why this link is here in the first place.I have never heard of this exchange, but if it died with your $2.000 in altcoins on it, then yeah, you lost that money. In the future, remember to not use exchanges as wallets. You now know why you shouldn't. There is nothing people here can do to help you recover your losses. But for this to be a proper scam accusation, it needs to contain proof. - There is no proof you discussed anything with anyone.- There is no proof you deposited $2.000 to the site.- There is no proof you had $2.000 worth of coins when the site stopped its operations.",

Yes I got paid for posting that thread and that's a common practice here. So many members get paid for posting a thread. I am not and was not related to decoun except that I managed their bounty campaign and all participants got paid for it. The exchange was operational since 2019 and now I come to know from op that it has disappeared. I or any bounty manager can not gurantee for the lifetime running if any project. Op should not have kept his funds on exchange. Many big exchanges have disappeared or hacked and members funds lost. Stop blaming others for own foolishness",
