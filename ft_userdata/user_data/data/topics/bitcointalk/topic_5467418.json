  "content": "I'm having a bit of spare time lately, and i'm thinking about filling it up by offering some scripting services... I'm not a very big expert, but i do have some experience (i have many more finished projects, but most of my scripts are not on my public repo, since they were written for my employer and they're part of his intellectual property)... Working on a no cure no pay basis...I can write in golang: these are older projects, my programming style did improve lately : demo project 1:my old website, demo project 2:a simple apache CLF logfile parser, demo project 3:a tool to run in your crontab or scheduled tasks to alert you when the optimal tx fee drops under a certain target fee python: demo project 1:a tool to check how far a certan tx is from a coinbase reward (written after a discussion with a mixer), demo project 2:my tool to check for unspent outputs on bitcoin forks (like bitcoin cash)php: demo project 1:a POC php function to deserialise segwit transactions, demo project 2:a VERY simple php testnet faucet, demo project 3:A site i coded in php/mysqlI'm also proficient in relational database design and my daytime job is being a unix system engineer....I'm looking for smaller automation projects that i can do for cheap in a couple of hours... Need someone to write a script to parse a webpage and shoot you a mail when a certain event arises? A go program to provide a simple API to your relational database? A script to automate a small repetitive task? A very simple and basic homepage without a nice layout? A small database design? Reply in this thread or shoot me a PM I prefer writing in golang, but if you really insist on python or php that would work aswell.I'm currently not looking for bigger projects... If something would take more than a couple of hour of work, i'll probably decline. Sad to say, but most crypto-related programming would require more time than i'm willing to spend right now.Payment only in \"real\" crypto, the one with a blockchain behind it and a decent market cap and exchange support (BTC, ETH, LTC,...), payment either upfront (with a guarantee of a refund if i cannot complete your project), using an escrow of your choice (you pay the fee) or after the project finishes (if you have a long and positive bitcointalk reputation).",
