One could argue that we have had more incidences of recession during the early modern and modern economic era than we had in the times without an efficient credit system. Could the dependency of businesses on credit and countries running practically on debt be a creation of the current financial system?Quote from: themossinator on March 31, 2023, 08:21:52 AMWouldn't this mean there would be a limited amount of credit available to lend out then?Yes, there would be. Bitcoin has a limited supply and cannot service the current credit system. But we are considering a situation where Bitcoin is a world currency and not an alternative. It can function as a reserve currency along with its other utilities, but not as the standard financial currency.- Jay -",

Is it the kind of credit that we take on to pay back in the future? If yes, then Bitcoin is not built for such. For credit creation to be successful, one needs to keep enough reserves for that purpose. That's to say, since we have 21,000,000 bitcoins in total supply, part of the 21,000,000 will be reserved separately, which will mainly be for lending only, and the others are to be publicly acquired and held just as they are right now. Bitcoin don't have such a feature, and I don't think that could be possible either in the near future. We can only use it as we see fit, and if we ever need credit for Bitcoin, it can be done on an individual contract basis, which will involve lending out one's holdings to another as credit, which will in turn be paid back with a certain agreed-upon percentage of profit.",

Imagine when 0.001 is worth about $10,000 or more; then you wouldn't need 1 bitcoin, whose price is still $28,000 today. Probably, Bitcoin would have more value and the price would be high, and private individuals who have enough Bitcoin would have the advantage of lending some fraction of their Bitcoin to different business individuals. If the price of bitcoin is so high, and with a supply that is limited and can also contribute to the high value, then people can still collect loans in which a little fraction means a huge amount that could settle the desired project it intend to be used for.",

      "body": "Yes the concept of credit and fractional banking has been a key idea to expand the world economy by allowing banks to lend money they don't actually have, while also making the global economy far riskier through massive debt accumulation and lack of reserves.With Bitcoin there can be no credit system like that because you can't have fractional banking on Bitcoin. I mean I suppose you COULD start this kind of system but it would quickly collapse as soon as the first economic crisis happened because nobody can just print more bitcoin to make up for what was lent out instead of held in reserve.The fractional reserve credit economy only works with currencies that are weak and can be printed at will.Bitcoin should be seen not as a replacement for fiat, but as a new option, an 'escape hatch' as some people call it. Fiat will continue to exist and the world's economic system will continue on as before using fractional banking and printing money and credit, but Bitcoin gives people a way to escape that system when needed. With Bitcoin you can actually save in currency rather than being forced to take on risk through investments. And with Bitcoin you can be sovereign over your savings without needing to hoard a large amount of physical cash which would be very risky.Bitcoin doesn't replace the national currencies and the banking industry, but it does give every person on the planet the ability to store value in hard money and transact openly with anyone in the world, while also giving people the option to have full sovereignty over their money rather than having to entrust one's money to banks. So Bitcoin doesn't replace anything, but it de-risks people's finances, gives them a financial escape hatch, provides financial sovereignty, and allows people to save/store/grow value with an actual usable currency.The fiat credit banking system and Bitcoin are two different things and both will continue to exist. Bitcoin is just the world's alternative to the current system, and they each have their own reasons to exist.",

According to the traditional economics for economic growth there has to be an inflationary setup where new credit and new money is continuously being created in the economy. Bitcoin hinders it by capping a limit on that which would mean money would eventually get dearer instead of getting cheaper and people would eventually keep on hoarding money itself than spending it leading to a deflationary spiral situation and collapse of economy. But honestly, practically this might be very difficult from what we have in theory so I would like to see the idea in practice for sure.",

Same thought here.  Bitcoin is created to remove the third party on the transaction scene and this credit system needs third parties that directly oppose the core intention of Bitcoin.  So I don't think that Credit creation can be implemented on a Bitcoin standard.  This kind of plan needs variation and that variation surely will fail in terms of Bitcoin standards.Quote from: Solosanz on March 31, 2023, 08:42:44 AMSince Bitcoin is decentralized, there's no way to retrieve the coins whenever the borrower didn't want to repay the loan.Precisely and I think the majority of lenders will not lend money to strangers.  That alone shows that this kind of method will badly fail.Quote from: bitmover on March 31, 2023, 04:44:55 PMHal Finney predicted a credit system and fractional banking using bitcoin, long ago.Quote from: Hal on December 30, 2010, 01:38:40 AMActually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins.

But if Bitcoin becomes generally adopted and is made legal tender in all of the country, its value cannot remain what it is now, so the higher the demand with limited supply, the higher the value.Quote$1,000 in 1940 has the same purchasing power as $21,488.57 today. Over the 83 years this is a change of $20,488.57.The average inflation rate of the dollar between 1940 and 2023 was 2.40% per year. The cumulative price increase of the dollar over this time was 2,048.86%.Back in the 1940s, the purchasing power of dollars was really high, but with steady inflation, the value of the purchasing power of $1000 is now $21,4800, which is just a mess for a bank note.If Bitcoin becomes a global currency, then what we should expect is deflation on Bitcoin, which can make credit creation more easier and would not affect the economic growth.https://tools.carboncollective.co/inflation/us/1940/1000/",
