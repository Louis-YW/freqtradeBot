Dubai[1] already doesn't allow Monero or Zcash. Upbit, Bithumb, and Huobi[2] (Korean exchanges) all delisted privacy coins a couple of years back. Binance did announce delisting due to EU regulations, but then went back on their decision shortly after[3] so if anything, I would say sooner or later, no CEX will have those privacy coins.[1] https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/08/dubai-prohibits-privacy-coins-under-new-crypto-rules/[2] https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upbit-bithumb-delist-numerous-coins-163305570.html?guccounter=1[3] https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-wrong-monero-zcash-privacy-coins",

Probably not the best choice to make if you want to use your privacy coins. Using a P2P should be a better option imo. Even I don't feel comfortable with my local exchange even though they don't show any sign of cracking down privacy coins just yet.",

It is very difficult, and therefore there is no company capable of providing a difficult tracking service, not to mention any that are expensive in an open blockchain like Bitcoin.2013 is a long way. Let's cite some reports from Chainalysis.2023:Quote from: https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/all-about-monero/Darknet market activityIn the past several years, many darknet markets have adopted Monero to reduce traceability. For instance, White House Market, one of the most active darknet markets before its closure, encouraged its users to shift from Bitcoin to Monero for transactions and eventually transitioned to only accepting Monero. Other darknet markets, such as AlphaBay and Archetyp, followed similar models. However, Bitcoin is still the most commonly used digital currency on darknet markets. 2020:Quote from: https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/darknet-markets-cryptocurrency-2019/Finally, we may see more darknet markets accept, or perhaps even mandate the usage of privacy coins like Monero. Monero uses an obfuscated public ledger to make it more difficult to see the senders, receivers, or amounts of cryptocurrency exchanged on transactions. As of now, Empire appears to be the only major darknet market accepting Monero, but that could change in 2020.So it is clear according to them darknet market activity is still closely tight with Bitcoin. Monero does offer a more robust and private way of transaction, the way they handle transactions is absolutely not on par with Bitcoin. However, the fact Bitcoin still leads the way in terms of market cap also answers why it is still being widely used.I would love to see if you have some research/report that suggests otherwise.",

For fear that it will lead to money laundering and enter the realm of the laws of each country.For monero, its anonymous nature can make it potentially more challenging for exchanges to verify the source of deposits so it is as anonymous as doing a mixer on bitcoin. I agree with you, for monero, the transactions cannot be tracked and tend to be the same as btc mixer earlier tends to be misused. So, while it offers significant advantages in terms of privacy, its connection to darknet markets may raise suspicions. I have also encountered that sometimes they (exchanges) do not open deposits for monero even though the transactions exist.",

I'll be 100 frank and tell you that more likely, if we keep in mind the psychology and behavior of people and their perceptions, not majority but still many people use monero and bitcoin mixers for illegal activities, everyone knows that when there is a knife, there is one who wants to cut bread and another one who wants to cut humans. But many people don't understand what's the real problem behind the scenes. Do you really think that any billionaire cares about your or your family's health and safety? No, all this bullshit exists because they are afraid of competition. Politicians don't come in politics to serve people, they don't want to be slaves, no, they come in politics to gain power and control everything. Elites use banks for money laundering and illegal activities because they control banks and there is no one to reveal them or judge them but here is the thing, they don't want others with the same privileges because they will become their competitors and then they start all this bullshit bitcoin and monero darknet propaganda.",
