  "content": "If you ever doubted why you should buy Bitcoin, here is a scary image for you:This is what a no-cap currency looks like. Printed non-stop and out of control. Things are getting worse with US economy even if it doesn't look like it on paper. US government that has long ran out of money to spend while continues having rising costs is now going nuts with the printers.  Every 100 days the US national debt is increased by over a trillion dollar! That is about $69 million every time we find a new Bitcoin Block (ie. 10 minutes on average) and \"print\" 6.25BTC which is worth only about $400k.I'll leave it to you to calculate the intrinsic value of Bitcoin when measured in US dollar.... it definitely is not $67k or even $100k!Here is something you could read: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/the-us-national-debt-is-rising-by-1-trillion-about-every-100-days.htmlP.S. This also highlights the importance of dedollarisation for the rest of the world, by the way.",

And to save yourself from Inflation, you simply by Bitcoin.Total Crypto Market Cap is $2.64 Trillion which is 264 days of Printing for US Govt.",

      "body": "I think the phrase “hedge against inflation” which is a strong attribute of bitcoin is seriously downplayed or say under rated. One thing have found is that on paper or public the dollar doesn’t looks like something that has problem but it’s devaluing seriously and this doesn’t only affects dollar alone, most of the world countries suffering economic crises are associated to the devaluation of the fiat currency. The bitcoin adoption rate of developing countries tells why it is just a matter of time before bitcoin is fully embraced as an alternative to fiat. Not a financial advice but regardless of the volatility I will definitely save up on bitcoin than hoard any fiat at the moment and this doesn’t even have to do with ROI. Quote from: Amphenomenon on March 05, 2024, 01:31:16 PMSoon it will be crystal clear that someday 1sat = $1 and even exceeds this I am ambitious about the growth or potential of bitcoin but a sat to a dollar (I mean current value though because dollar go devalue in future who knows) seems too ambitious and not something I am seeing in a near future. Because for this to happen it means we have a bitcoin at $100 million.",

You have to pay your debt\", and this is because the debt is not only in the government hands, the debt is in the civilians hands too... Each time a civilian gets a bank loan to buy a house or to buy a car, then this debt increases, and USA is the country with the biggest access to credit. Almost anyone can go to the bank and get a loan for anything.",

Fiat is not sustainable and it will finally have to face huge inflation spikes over the years until it's fully devalued. But, since this topic is mostly related to Bitcoin and US dollar so comparing other fiat won't be reliable. If US continues printing that much then surely in years US dollar will lose its value. But, Bitcoin's supply is limited and when US dollar and other fiat currencies continue losing value, Bitcoin will continue gaining value.It's a bold statement to say that 1 Satoshi will be $1 because for that Bitcoin will have to reach $100M per coin which's unlikely to happen in a decade or two. However, I'm pretty sure we will see 1 Satoshi at $0.01-$0.05 in two decades.",

BRICS group are planning to create a payment system using blockchain to reduce the dependence on dollar for international transactions. It was crystal clear since that BRICS has targeted to lower the dependence on dollar so as to reduce the power of the US but the problem has always been which currency should they make as a central currency. Any country currency picked will have given that country extra power. Let me not go off topic, can someone tell BRICS that bitcoin is here to solve there problems and they don’t need to create anything again.",

It's scary for the average US citizen though, they're definitely the one that's bearing the brunt of these problems, they're the ones that will feel the effects of inflation and at the same time will also be the one that would have to spend more money to buy stuff, it's really stupid of a lot of these people that they always do this kind of thing because they know that their circle and the big corporations that are funding their campaigns and war chests, I guess when the natural law is that you save yourself before everyone else, you're definitely going to see this kind of freakshow.

In one-way system they can know everything we have, but we can't know what actually the government have. In two-way system, both of each other know everything and this would give the citizen to have a control over the government instead of agreeing with every action and decision that made by the government.",

I agree that it's wonderful to have a limited supply and a regulated pace of creation of new coins that we have with Bitcoin than have a limitless fiat system. What's interesting, though, is that despite a lot of concerns, the US keeps getting away with all that printing. If you look at the USD annual inflation rate, it's one of the most stable fiat currencies and its inflation is usually below 5%. They're playing with fire, but they're playing well. So while Bitcoin is great for investment, the USD is an acceptable fiat currency and an acceptable reserve currency.",
