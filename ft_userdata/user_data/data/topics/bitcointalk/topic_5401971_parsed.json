But, according to the wired oct, 2020 report, only US gaming platforms consume around 34 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, so can you imagine how much electricity is representing the entire world for e-gaming purposes?Source: https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-playstation-cloud-gaming-environment-nightmareThey are continuously promoting Esports by arranging international tournaments and making a dumb young generation. So, they are not concerned about the environment at all, things are something different here.Looking at the data, we can see that Bitcoin accounts for only the smallest share of carbon footprint/environmental pollution and global warming. All the reasons they gave were to hide their fears, fear of dominance, out of control ... Fear of Bitcoin.Source pic: Messari and coinshares",

The use of safer and renewable energy sources should be encouraged. I totally agree with you in your assessment of this aspect of the matter. This leads me to think more about the energy that is used in many industries that are not needed, for example, the manufacture of firearms of all kinds, tanks and all combat mechanisms. Why is it not addressed in the same logic?",

At 0.08 % of global CO2 emissions, removing the entire mining network from global demand—and thereby depriving hundreds of millions of people of their only hope for a fair and accessible form of money—would not amount to anything more than a rounding error.If bitcoin is only contributing 0.08% of the global CO2 emissions, that is not significant. According to your graph, see to what large extent other industries are contributing to global warming. You still represented only carbon emissions but not only carbon is even contributing to global warmin, there are other gasses like methane, nitrous oxide in parean (laughing gas), fluorinated gases, sulphur hexafluoride etc that are responsible for global warming while methan is the most potent of them all, some of the gases may even be released to the atmosphere by some industrial activities.",

It is no longer an argument that Bitcoin mining consumes the lowest energy amongst many other economic sectors but these Governments will continue to push this false narrative about Bitcoin's carbon emission and its effect on the environment. Like you said, hope someday most major mining sites will be able to go green.",

Because banking industry is the only industry whose dominance is challenged by bitcoin. So they are trying to give the crypto market a different angle because they know they can't win in a face to face war. These are bloody politics happening here!

I do not know what \"electric planes\" could ever be invented and when that will be, but I am 100% sure that with how much airports are covering in landmass, I am 100% certain that if we ever get planes that uses energy via renewable ones, they could replace themselves alone.Each airport in the world would be filled to the bring with solar panels and what not, even maybe winds, or find ways to turn that jet engine blows which are hard into electricity. I literally have zero clue, I am making things up here, don't mind me, but when that happens, it is going to matter a lot. Look at how MASSIVE they are in that list.Ships and AC's come in second, ships are a must, but maybe they can be turned renewable easier, and AC could definitely be doing that easily, just put a solar panel on the roof and let it get electricity all paid for while using AC like crazy. It's never about \"using\" energy, it is using bad versions that matters the most. If you use coal then even just a bit matters, but if you use solar, then use it all the way up to the end of it, doesn't matter.",

With bitcoin, if mining were to be \"banned\",  users of bitcoin could move to PoS coins, or they could use the fiat system. Further, with the exception of the gaming industry, the electric consumption on a per-capita basis cannot easily be measured because said industry affects nearly the entire population. While I do agree that bitcoin does consume a lot of electricity, it also uses electricity purchased on the free market (to the extent that electric markets are free), and if electric prices become sufficiently high, miners will turn off their equipment.",

If you read enough researches, from different sources you will know this fact.If someone was interested in the facts, then everyone would have long ago stopped discussing something that is more than a trivial matter - because Bitcoin has not created problems that manifest as drastic changes in the environment. All of these problems have been created by human greed through decades of ruthless destruction of the entire planet - making people one of the dumbest inhabitants of this planet ever.Bitcoin is therefore a perfect target for attacks as it completely deviates from the established and imposed norms to which people have been subjected over the past hundred years, although this process takes much longer if you look at history. Although the world's bureaucrats do not acknowledge this directly, they see Bitcoin as a virus that must be fought by all means, and 2009 was the year in which their pandemic began.The agenda of excessive energy consumption and environmental pollution is a fabricated lie, but if you keep repeating it as they do, people will accept it as true - at least the silent majority who believes everything they see and hear in the mainstream media.",
