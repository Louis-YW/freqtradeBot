But I don't think their intention to make successful, is not the thing I see it. They probably use the name Doge as it was already popular but unfortunately, the name Doge has been marked negatively leading to nothing and fewer market interactions. If ever this project will surge, I was certain that is because of manipulation which is very common to useless projects.",

That project will be just going for its fame but not with what it is advertising with the people and future investors. It is the reason for those new projects, they should just find their own way of being known and avoid making their names have that attachment to any popular one.

Looking at the ecosystem they're building, they really want to push the meme trend back when a bunch of stuff is happening. It's a very funny quality there. And looking at the name, I can also understand the problem of taking advantage of the reputation of the big project Dogecoin to create an attraction, but honestly, it is like many other projects that I have known of before. If it does not create a strong fomo, it will soon be eliminated from the word like the person who exaggerated before.",

They will always pursue projects related to Doge just to take advantage of its fame. It will be a good strategy to start up a new project for them since there are still investors who trust Doge. However, those who are being too skeptical in choosing projects will get rid of it because there are still better investment opportunities that are worth the risk these days. Its a personal kind of type of choice since not all would really be that avoiding meme coins included into their ports which does mean that even though this turns out to be a joke or meme coin but stillthey are trying out to utilize the cheap value of it and hoping that there would be some significant value increase in the near future and it indeed happen when Musk did really make out some hype.Lots of discrimination and negative sentiment that had been thrown out.Back on topic about wrong name then its totally that different in overall if you do tend to look on the market on how many coins been using up the word \"Doge\" then you could really say that this kind of thread is not that necessary.",

I think the opposite, the name of a project is incredibly important because it is what allows other people to very quickly recognize the company and what it stands for, while naming your project like another famous project will give you some cheap publicity, over the long term this will play against you because whenever people hear about your project they will think about the other famous project and not your own, also we know that this is a tactic that is very commonly used by scammers, so with that action alone they have discouraged a great deal of people from ever investing with them",

I don't think they chooses the wrong name. The people behind knows that there is hype so they jump on the bandwagon, uses that name so that they can attract investors.
