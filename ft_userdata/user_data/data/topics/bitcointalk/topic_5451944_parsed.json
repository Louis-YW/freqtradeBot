  "content": "Hello EveryoneI used EXODUS for 3 years to exchange and send coins.On April 13, 2023, I decided to do 9 swaps to exchange $350,942 USDT for BTC, ETH and Monero.8 swaps out of 9 have not been executed, swap status is pending and please contact support.I passed that damn KYC.Providing a statement from a bank account that has already been closed, it cost me a lot of trouble to get the documents for 2021 on the account which has already been closed.For a week, they just keep quiet, saying that the case is under review!, All requirements have been met, they refer to the rules which they themselves have invented.If they do not return the funds I will publish the details.While looking for all this, I found this.http://www.broker-fraude.com/cripto-intercambio/#hunter-email:support@criptointercambio.com",

I have never used exodus and all of their services before, so I can't be sure, but if OP's case is just like the one I said above with N.exchange, the users were not let know which third party exodus is using.Quote from: bvg96634 on March 10, 2023, 01:18:19 AM[...]Before to make a swap Exodus tells you that operation is going to be performed by some 3d party but they do not let you accept some 3d party terms and they do not name directly exchange which will perform the operation:This is how it looks like: [image resized][...]OP, perhaps you want to try an approach suggested by Potato Chips on the other thread,Quote from: Potato Chips on March 10, 2023, 10:31:47 PMPost in r/ExodusWallet (https://www.reddit.com/r/ExodusWallet/). Someone went thru the same thing and was able to get a refund, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/ExodusWallet/comments/xjzl4u/update_of_the_story_about_the_swap_in_the_exodus/If you get ignored, consider posting in more places as well. Exodus seem to care about their rep and could help put pressure on n.exchange. For instance, there's r/bitcoin and twitter. [...]or try to get in touch with bvg96634, you both has a quite identical situation, just a different 3rd party. Maybe he can give you a suggestions on how he got out of the situation.",

Because such threads will definitely affect their reputation, from which they create distrust among their customers even if they solve the problem by asking different documents from their customers.",

If you are looking to receive fiat in to your bank then clearly exchanges have to enforce KYC therefore it is reasonable to send KYC to them for AML purposes.
