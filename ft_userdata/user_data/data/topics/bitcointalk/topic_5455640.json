  "content": "My PC has crashed and now I have reinstalled Bitcoin Core and tried with prune mode. I need help to figure out whether I'm on the right path or not.I have created a bitcoin.conf file with the below text inside-Code:prune=550and placed the file into the Bitcoin wallet folder. Is the text correct, am I running a prune wallet? Or do I have to add something else? How can I check whether I'm running prune mode or not? If I can remember correctly, I can check through the command console, what should I write there to check whether the prune mode is enabled or not?What's the main difference between a full node and a prune node? In full node, I have all the tx records since the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain while in prune, I will have a few last records as I set (550 MB in my case). How does that exactly matter?",

I meant the console tab in the wallet.For example, with dumpprivkey, I can get the private key of a certain address. There is a code to check if the wallet is prune or not. Anyway, it's not anymore necessary since I used GUI and its default setting as you said.QuoteIf you use the GUI, pruned mode is the default setting when you install Bitcoin Core.I didn't know that, neither did I check any steps when I installed the wallet  Quote(I never got the logic behind the location of configuration files)I don't know. I am used to doing this with some other wallets (altcoin) too. So, I'm following the same. The location of the configuration file doesn't matter at all?QuoteIf you ever want to import an old private key, a pruned node will require to download the blockchain again.Damn! Then I shouldn't go with prune mode, right? I didn't think about that lol.",

Is the text correct, am I running a prune wallet?You put the \"bitcoin.conf\" file in your selected bitcoin data directory in the GUI's welcome screen (first time launch),if you're using the default data directory or bitcoind, then put in: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory#Default_Location",
