Just buying a good JRPG game on Steam is more than enough to probably last a week, maybe two if needed. Other than that I also like playing Tennis and doing marathon running (but rarely nowadays) which is pretty situational but can take a good chunk of the week if I purposely schedule it as such. Honestly having a lot of stuff to do (even if having less money to support it) is a really great thing since you're able to experience a lot of stuff and not get stuck on one thing. I imagine it'd be rather hard to get stuck with gambling, regardless of how much I like it for a few weeks continuously really.",

Not really you can do aside from gambling but more on the level of enjoyment like you do in gambling, something that if you cannot gamble at least this something is what fulfills the same level of enjoyment in gambling if you think that all these things can give you the same level of enjoyment as you do in gambling then its good for you.I created this as I have a friend who thinks that gambling is so different from all the other things that he experiences that he cannot think of another platform or do something that will equal gambling I like to prove to him that other gamblers can have something that has the same level of enjoyment as they experience in gambling.",

For me the excitment and entertainment from gambling is very close to the entertainment I get from gaming with friends. For many years I have been gaming all sorts of games, and especially strategy team games where you can make detailed plans and execute them together are awesome. Unfortunately, it's hard to find the time these days to sit down an evening with my friends and play our favourite games. With gambling it's much easier, I can do it on my own and just play for half an hour in the evening when I have the spare time. Life changes so fast and all my friends have their own families now, that most of my gaming these days is single player and the entertainment from it is not really that great.",

It is gambling addiction that will make someone to like gambling as fun than any other things. Becuase aside work, there are many things that you can have fun with if you do them. Although gambling is part of it, but they are numerous. Example is going on swimming or fishing with a hook.",

I get the same level of enjoyment from playing slots via free play money. I love slots that have captivating graphics and visuals with many features that includes free spins, jackpot section and some other bonus sections.My another way of getting the same level of enjoyment is playing video games. Battlefield, Call Of Duty, FIFA and Assassin's Creed series are my favourite. Going to the pool, playing football, basketball and volleyball are my favourite activities too.",

I like to gamble only if I have some money that I don't need, my responsibility always come first, gambling money most times don't make it back to me due to losses, but some fun and entertainment cost you nothing, it's your choice to choose which one you want to go with at a given time.",

This is because I think that riding a bike is something physical and not game on a platform, except you're talking about a bike game.Having clarified  that, for me what I love doing best for relaxation that goes beyond enjoyment for gambling is SINGING, in fact when I'm doing chores, working, relaxing and having fun, I always sing along. It's my number one hubby, at a point I thought that I was going to be a musician, but eventually it didn't happen. Old habit dies hard, and I always find myself singing most times, it's crazy, and i love it.",

I know that to make a brain a relax, to take their mind off routine, people go to gym. People say that pumping iron gives them a real concentration and refreshes their mind. I think single visit or several visits wont have much of an effect, but visiting gym 3 times a week during months and years will have its effect. I havent tested that, but I prefer to go pool swimming on weekend. This routine helps to get rid of problems that were accumulated during week. Maybe this trick will work with gambling and addiction also.",

I think this is also what save others to be sane during the pandemic. So if we have some plates in the house or you have a mini-gym then instead of online gambling, just to and exercise at it releases dopamine, making you feel good just like the effects of gambling to some of us, specially if we have a good and big win. Or when we back to normal, just walk around the neighboring block, buy some watches that can measure how many steps you take (I usually target 10,000 per day), and the same effect as well, physically and mentally you go sweat and then comeback to home to do your daily routines.",

Another thing that I know can replace gambling if am to stop gambling for one week is for me to be with my friends. If I am with my friends, I don't even think about gambling because we crack jokes and discuss about the past. If I am with my friends, I can stop gambling for as long as possible.",

At times, however, we still desire to continue gambling with the hope of increasing our winnings. There are many other activities I can engage in that provide the same level of enjoyment or even more than what I experience in gambling. Since I always face the monitor, I can take and enroll in online courses about web development, programming, and coding to enhance and refine my computer skills. Online gaming is also an option; I can play with my laptop and smartphone to connect with others and have fun. I enjoy listening to music to relax and can create playlists of my favorite songs as well.",
