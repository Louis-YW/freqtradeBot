  "content": "Hi guys,As a lot of you may now, the Central banks are heavy into the development of the CBDC's. I truly believe that these coins are a tool of the global elite to control us. You can take a dive into what these coins really are meant for and its pretty scary. Its basically the opposite of what crypto currencies today are meant for; centralization and complete control. A lot of people see this as bullish for the Crypto currency market for obvious reasons, nevertheless I still believe the adoption of these CBDC's will be forced onto us. Just like the restrictions of the so called pandemic were forced onto us. This makes we wonder how these two polar opposites will co-exist, and what long-term effects it will have on the market. I would like to know your thoughts on this.",

      "body": "I don't know if we can take this as a bullish sign, those who says \"Yes\", don't know what CBCD is. It's just fiat per se, in digital form, but worst. Because the government can track you down when you used it. Of course they are going to force or become a mandatory for their people to be on CBCD, specially if you are going to transaction with government agencies. I don't think it will have an impact to crypto though, I guess we are still going to used coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum more if possible. And if government are going to force CBCD's then so be it, but it doesn't mean the death of crypto, we will have to take advantage of both of them.",

      "body": "CBDC is a definitely a tool which will provide an upper hand to the government in order to control our finances in a better way. You can't anymore evade taxes, your funds can be blocked anytime if government suspects anything wrong. You won't be able to hide anything to the government when it comes to finance. It's a monitoring and spying tool for the government. So once we move to CBDC regime, I expect cryptocurrency to go even higher as the demand will be increased for privacy. So in long term, we will see high demand in cryptocurrency market, especially for the privacy focused ones. That's my assessment of the situation.",

It's probably an offer to allow their customers to transfer funds locally or internationally without so much hassle unlike how digital fiats are processed. Some of the retail traders could choose that over using crypto then converting on exchanges for fiat. Will that affect market? I'm not sure.",

Just like the restrictions of the so called pandemic were forced onto us. This makes we wonder how these two polar opposites will co-exist, and what long-term effects it will have on the market. When you talk about people, it's generally not surprising that some people think that CBDC will have a positive effect on Bitcoin or altcoins, like they thought that FB coin would be the killer of Bitcoin, but they didn't realize how absurd that idea was. If we're going to be honest, then it doesn't even matter to most people whether they want to use a privatized-centralized stablecoin or a stablecoin backed by their government - although governments will undoubtedly have the advantage of imposing their product on practically everyone whether they want it or not.I have no doubt that the majority will accept everything that is imposed on them, just as we accepted all the crazy measures during the pandemic because we were not given a choice. The minority who think for themselves and don't take things for granted will still try to look for alternative ways, and Bitcoin is one of those ways. Although there is no doubt that the mechanisms of world governments can harm Bitcoin, the fact is that its use will always remain a matter of choice, even if it were to be banned.",

It depends on how extreme the cbdc is going to be. I also think cbdcs are coming, because otherwise fiat could likely collapse. This system is more fragile than ever, so they don’t really have an alternative to complete control, if they wanna keep it alive. This is just a worse form of money that won’t survive forever, as it can’t enable free trade and has the worst monetary properties you could think of, from an economic perspective.Flirting with tyranny has its own cost tho and central planning will never work in the long term(or it would’ve already, it’s just destructive and doesn’t benefit people), cbdcs won’t change anything about that. If they can’t provide an alternative system where people can prosper freely, this would just buy them time before they get replaced.Bitcoin will easily co-exist with any system that could be in place, you can’t really stop or forbid it, because it’s too decentralized. So people will always have an alternative where they can transact freely, in times of cbdcs this could draw more people to Bitcoin, no matter if it’s allowed or not. More and more people could realise the advantages of having a free, independent form of money, driving adoption up. When the time of cbdcs ends, Bitcoin could have so many people on it’s side, that it could be chosen as the new monetary system by people. This can be seen as a chance to prove itself and a really good solution to the underlying problem cbdcs tried to solve in the first place. In the end it’s a question of, can a broken system be kept alive forever with more control, or will an actual solution take over? To me the first option seems unrealistic, so it’s a matter of what comes after it.",

They may place all of their wealth and life savings into CBDC and other state mandated programs as their best option for avoiding inflation.Others who have lost faith in governments and central banks may store their wealth in gold and precious metals. They are more likely to seek alternatives to fiat and CBDC, which they no longer trust to retain their value in the event of hyperinflation.Depending on the performance and rollout of CBDC, public opinion could shift. The way people think about and view the world could change. To an extent we already see this happening with shifts in approval ratings and voter registrations.
