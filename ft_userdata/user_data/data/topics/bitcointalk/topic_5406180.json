  "content": "It dont look like that people will follow second time covid people the they say covid coming back but once people have felt again freedom they dont give away and goverments who pose laws like this likely not for their own people maybe the covid is real we dint know there is no proof and maybe its not real...also no proof.But people this not tolerate this is sure if the rulers want to rule they should hide their plans better they have all the money all the power...why they put all their good life in danger? with nonsense ....people can be slaves without bs and obey becouse even the dummest person has limits covid 19 is not the right way to start control over slaves People just dont accept second time covid we dont know if its real or not but people want freedom thats what sure There will be a lot stress and chaos streets might be not safe also economic bad times.  ...the chaos and riots can be massive World elite should think now the world is nice slaves are happy no resistance ....but they should not turn it to chaos Who will make all this world normal again? So covid 19 second coming not good it can bring too much chaos and most people specially in uk and ireland for sure will not accept any covid other places off course there is more dictatorship regime and a lot officials whos bribed to go against people of their own country but ireland and uk are tough places to rulers impose covid rules again",

What I have is a foundation without enough understanding of what that foundation really is. Even Jesus has a difficult time doing miracles when the people won't believe. And there is reason for this. But it is difficult to explain.I mean, how do we come to be like this. To be so focused on the unrealistic, the realms you don't see and then we fail to realise that the greatest religion we could have is humanity. - What you have said is the way it is. But you also answered your own question. Focus the unrealistic stuff into being real. That's faith/believing.It's our mandate to acknowledge God and then we take care of ourselves. Unfortunately, most persons believes God will take care of them and from what?I think we ought to live God out of this Covid-19 thing and protect ourselves. Vaccinate if you agree, use hand sanitizers, nose mask and avoid crowded areas. That's how God wants you to protect yourself and not expect the extraordinary from the sky. - It is impossible to leave God out of it. You might not acknowledge Him. But that doesn't leave Him out. Why not? Because your whole life is made up of the vibrations of His voice that caused everything to exist right from creation times. Rather, acknowledge Him, thereby bringing yourself into alignment with His vibes, which give you the power that He has (a little).No disease that that have ever afflicted man have gone out of the world that way. It always comes from a research in the lab or some accidental discoveries that where studied and developed on. Your own earth, live like it and when you go to whatever realm you feel exists, you live like you are in that realm too. - Where does all material and metaphysical come from? It all comes from the creation vibes of God speaking it into existence in the days of creation. All that scientists and researchers do when they find a cure, is to focus some of God's creation vibes from one area to another, even though they don't know it.There are several things that you need in your thinking so that you have the right attitude for believing/faith.- Know that God does it for you as you live humbly with His strength in you life.- You must have desire for that kind of faith/believing.- You must fill yourself on the Bible, the Word of God, the Vibes that God used to make the Universe, and that still are vibrating today.- You must forgive all people that you have a problem with... forgive them from your heart.And know one thing about this kind of faith. If you use it for doing wrong things, God will straighten you out, and it won't seem like fun while He is straightening you out... might even be quite painful at times.Consider ISIS or the Taliban. Where did they get the strength to do all the evil things that they did? They had faith that they could do them. And they received their painful rewards for using their faith in the wrong way. So, be as right as you can with God in all you do, realizing that God forgives almost every evil through His Son Jesus, Who took the pain for you for your wrongs when He died on the cross.I might even get to that kind of strong believing on this side of death. There is a little trick to it, one that I haven't quite grasped, yet.As for you, get a copy of the Bible in your native language, and read. Also, get Bible CDs or tapes and start listening to them, say, half hour or more each day. Go through the whole Bible over and over. Never stop. The Spirit of God comes to you through the hearing and reading of the Bible, and so does faith.",

If you really want to find it, you can watch his videos at https://thehighwire.com/. The thing that I am doing is showing this article.Masking theory debunked: New study shows face coverings did LITTLE to mitigate spread of COVIDQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-14-masks-did-little-to-mitigate-covid-spread.htmlA pre-print study concerning two adjacent North Dakota school districts found that there are no significant differences in COVID cases between those that mandate masks and those that don’t.Funded by the University of Southern California, the study noted that the randomized data about the effectiveness of mask mandates in children is still lacking. Researchers noted that while observational studies on school mask mandates showed conflicting results, randomized studies have failed to detect the impact of masking on participants under 50 years of age.They used a “unique natural experiment to study school-based mask mandates” by analyzing data from two Fargo, North Dakota school districts: Fargo Public Schools (FPS) and West Fargo Public Schools (WF). Both districts have very similar demographics, with WF having slightly higher percentages of minority and low-income families.Both districts had similar COVID-19 mitigation policies, testing options and staff vaccination rates, although FPS had stricter rules for quarantining close contacts of COVID-positive students.The only significant difference between the district’s approach to the virus was that at the beginning of the 2021-2022 school year, FPS required its students to be masked throughout the day, while WF did not. On January 17, FPS also made masks optional. This allowed researchers to compare the case rates when the districts had different policies and when they had the same. (Related: Yale professor scoffs at the idea that mask mandates are based on science.)Brighteon.TVThey found that from Aug. 26, 2021, to Jan. 17, 2022, the cumulative incidence in the mask-compulsory school district (12.9 percent) was almost identical to the cumulative incidence in the mask-optional district (13 percent).Post-Jan. 17, when both districts had mask-optional policies, case rates were also not significantly different – with FPS having a 5.3 percent rate and WF having 5.1 percent.The researchers stated that the K-12 school mask mandates were not associated with significantly lower COVID-19 student case rates, which is consistent with adult randomized data on community cloth masking, multiple observational studies of school mask mandates and a systematic review of medical or surgical cloth masking for influenza.They posited that studies of school-based mask mandates are particularly prone to bias as cases detected within the student population may be at least 20 times more likely to have been contracted outside of school than in. Other observational studies also reported a negative association between mask mandates and COVID cases, although there may have been important methodological limitations to the studies as well. (Related: Medical professionals, students decry mask mandates and other Covid measures in schools.)...",

But every person who got “vaccinated” now has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, also known as AIDS.Researchers in Qatar looked at data from the Qatari National digital-health information platform, which covers the country’s entire population. Nearly 90 percent of the country is expatriates from over 150 countries, so the data is expansive.They determined from this data that everyone in the country who tested “positive” for covid and later recovered still has the same amount of immunity to the disease. Not even one percent of their natural immunity waned.Conversely, everyone in the country who took the jabs like Tony Fauci and Rochelle Walensky told them to is now in a developing state of immune degradation. Over time, the “fully vaccinated,” as they call them, are losing their ability to fight off any kind of disease, including covid.The paper in its entirety is available for viewing and analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).“So natural immunity provides non waning 97.3% long term protection against severe, critical or fatal infection for at least 14 months and by extrapolation – indefinitely,” reported Exposé News, which analyzed the findings.“Whereas mRNA vaccine immunity wanes to 55.6% at some time after 7 months. Perhaps around 12 months?”There’s a reason why nobody in the industry wants to talk about vaccine effectiveness after six monthsThe new findings corroborate with earlier ones concerning the development of vaccine-induced AIDS, or VAIDS, in people who take the jabs.It appears that the more people get injected for the Chinese Virus, the worse off their immune systems become at fighting it off. Meanwhile, those who skipped the jabs are generally in good health with normal, fully functioning immunity....",

COVID is very deadly and many of us had lost our friends, family and love ones because of the pandemic that took over the world without notice. I am happy that everything had started coming to normal now and we all are living happily.",

Even if Anthony Fauci had been the front man for the media, it was Birx who was the main influence in the White House behind the nationwide lockdowns that did not stop or control the pathogen but have caused immense suffering and continue to roil and wreck the world. So it was significant that she would not and could not comply with her own dictates, even as her fellow citizens were being hunted down for the same infractions against \"public health.\" In the days before Thanksgiving 2020, she had warned Americans to \"assume you're infected\" and to restrict gatherings to \"your immediate household.\" Then she packed her bags and headed to Fenwick Island in Delaware where she met with four generations for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, as if she were free to make normal choices and live a normal life while everyone else had to shelter in place. The Associated Press was first out with the report on December 20, 2020. Birx acknowledged in a statement that she went to her Delaware property. She declined to be interviewed.She insisted the purpose of the roughly 50-hour visit was to deal with the winterization of the property before a potential sale — something she says she previously hadn't had time to do because of her busy schedule. 'I did not go to Delaware for the purpose of celebrating Thanksgiving,' Birx said in her statement, adding that her family shared a meal together while in Delaware. Birx said that everyone on her Delaware trip belongs to her 'immediate household,' even as she acknowledged they live in two different homes. She initially called the Potomac home a '3 generation household (formerly 4 generations).' White House officials later said it continues to be a four-generation household, a distinction that would include Birx as part of the home....",
