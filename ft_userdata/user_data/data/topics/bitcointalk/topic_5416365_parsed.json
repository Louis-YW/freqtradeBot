There will be no break out. I saw people were complaining so much on CMC. We have bunch of card games. We need only UE5 game and it's not a garbage game like that. We are in 2022. The games looks like a 2012 game. Are we going back to the 2012? We have a garbage card game called gods unchained. It seems like that shiba metaverse was just gimmick",

But my advice is if you believe the Shiba Inu will get another pump in the short term, you should start buying more now because the price hasn't started to climb yet and you still get a chance. But apart from that suggestion, you should analyze further and look for more information on the progress of the Shiba Inu project so that it can be your consideration in investing in Shiba Inu.",

We have dozens of card game in app store or play stores. The game looks horrible. I strongly believe any product being launched by shiba will not make any difference. This project has no revenue at all. The product is not so good as people said. Im not even thinking this token gonna be pumped again like what happened last year. Elon is reason why shiba got pumped so hard. It's not coming from the hype for the project by shiba",

We are in a bear market, not even the merger event that is considered the biggest milestone of ETH cannot help ETH against these aggressive bears, much less likely with shiba. If you are a fan of memes and shiba then just buy and hold waiting for better bitcoin movement or market rally, you can get profit instead of waiting for these small events.",

But developing a really cool game and that would spend some of their resources is not really their goal here. We will know later on if they can sustain their enthusiasm to build a worthwhile project and not just here because of the hype surrounding it. People should still be cautious touching this token.",

But even if he starts shilling it again at this time, I'm sure that it will have almost no effect at all and that is because the market we're dealing with is in bear. And no matter what good news and shilling is being done, it won't do because that will be pulled down by the market. If you guys are hopeful for shib to come out, the chance is little that it will be back again to break out. Because projects that has made itself on the high is unlikely to get up again after it has been there.",

Which is why there are so many people who wanted to go up with it and invested into just ETH.You could definitely find other altcoins that would go up even more, but there are also a lot of coins that didn't go up, or went down, which means that the ones who invested into ETH didn't know what else to invest, and wasn't sure and they wanted to make sure that they invested into something they could trust, that’s it. It’s a lower return, but lower risk investment and it makes sense for people like me who are not sure about other coins.",
