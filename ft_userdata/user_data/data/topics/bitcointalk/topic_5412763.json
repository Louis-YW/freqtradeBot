Sure?Invite your friends and receive 40% of all bitcoins deposited. The percentage is disbursed by you.So let's say, Satoshi uses my referral link and deposits 1 BTC, I get 0.40 BTC from you.  How do you get the money to pay me? A mystery. But surely not with the money you generate from the surveys companies and offerwalls.How satoshi will be able to use his 1 BTC fully? Well you will use the bitcoin of another innocent user that joined after Satoshi and the wheel continuesTOTAL DEPOSIT14.87747150 BTCTOTAL WITHDRAW6.36324570 BTCTypical statistics that HYIPs use to fool people by the wayWhat is \"445.240 Users\"?

      "body": "April fool is for next year dude, your wallet won’t be used by anyone to be clear it’s totally suspicious af and an obvious scam because nobody will give even 1% for a wallet on referral deposits and turn to be legit your only profits from the website  is some ads you set on your front page, you don’t even get 10$ for 1k views. Imagine someone invite a friend and make a deposit of 1 bitcoin how can you pay him that 0.4 bitcoin and what’s your profit from all that?",

The word you are looking for is probably \"nothing\", not \"any\". That would then fit with the second sentence about your accounts being free. But that's a ridiculous way to advertise your wallet either way. Why would someone use your wallet because it's free? Are you trying to say that Bitcoin Core, Electrum or the dozens of other popular wallets require a subscription fee of some sort?",
