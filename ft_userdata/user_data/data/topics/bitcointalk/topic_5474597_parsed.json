Refrain from sharing investment tips, they are not welcome here. There are many other posts for that.2. Do not share projects with high capitalization whose chances of making a 100x are practically zero.2. Try to be concise. Share a ticker and an explanation about the project if you want.4. Respect the first 3 rules and this will be a thread where other users can easily consult hundreds of projects and do their own research.",

Respect the first 3 rules and this will be a thread where other users can easily consult hundreds of projects and do their own research.If everyone will follow these rules, this could be an interesting thread to follow. Especially if people are posting some interesting new microcaps. I haven't looked microcaps for a while, but they can be profitable as hell even if they never cross the $1M MC. Buying the bottom and selling the fomo is hard and risky business, but i have invested to several projects that did 100x in the past. But majority of my microcap investments have busted of course but all it takes is few. And it's really hard work to monitor them all to find one decent one, which isn't a copy of another one.I don't have any at the moment, but i'll be posting if i find one, and definitely look trough the answers.",

I am afraid you can just post here and find it best.also please refrain yourself from believing about the x100 because from what i learned from this forum  most of the losersare coming from those expecting so much increase.",

I will advise you to continue hodling if you have already bought altcoins and, try to apply long hodling so  that you will achieve what other people are achieving from the community because, there is no way you will hodl for this bull run to come you will not achieve a good profits that will add value to your investment.What you are seeing now in the crypto market is a small thing compare what is coming soon for people to confirm that bull run has come to stay for long hodlers and short hodlers investors to earn well from their investment .",
