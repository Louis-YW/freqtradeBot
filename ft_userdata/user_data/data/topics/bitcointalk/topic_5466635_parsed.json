I don't know if I misunderstood you before as I thought you were requesting that amount to pay the rent. It doesn't matter much because you're not going to get the loan anyway but if so, if what you mean is that you can pay good interest, my argument from before doesn't apply. What would apply is to ask you why if you can pay good interest you don't save and self-finance instead of borrowing from strangers. Although I guess the most logical thing to do is to think that what you say is a lie and what you would do is to take the money and disappear, that's why no one will lend you here.",

I am sure you understand the reasons why any lender would find it difficult to give any newbie a loan.Quote from: Poker Player on September 17, 2023, 07:53:09 AMQuote from: Wintermaster on September 14, 2023, 04:20:42 PMI guess its no hope for me here as a new member.In general there is no hope for you as a new member but other than someone who needs £750 to pay rent and promises to pay back £900 by not explaining anything else the obvious question that arises is what money he intends to pay that £900 with in addition to next month's rent. Having to go into debt to pay current expenses indicates financial ruin and no one in their right mind is going to lend money to someone who is broke. You are right about financial ruin. Even with the best of intentions regarding repayment, it is clear to see if the loan was ever to be repaid the cycle of debt would have to continue and that is no way to live.I am sure there are cases where the cost of living has escalated to the point where people are suffering unimaginably but drowning more and more in debt is not sustainable in the long-term and cannot be the answer. The danger would be for people looking for short-term loans to repay other outstanding debts but then getting caught in that cycle of borrowing more to repay other debts.",

I do not intend to say anything here because I'm also a newbie like you, but is annoying me. Even though this loan has been given to you, in what way do you think you pay it back? And even said that you will pay better interest were everybody knows that you don't have any success in income. Mr. Wintermaster, you better close this chapter because it just feels like you are wasting your time here.",
