I believe he just traded it for that low amount to get rid of it or to make a transaction with it and see how it works. He probably will be on his deepest regret right from the time when the bitcoin price started to sparkle and shock all unbelievers. We all wished we were opportune to have the idea of bitcoin 10 years ago, but even if most of us had that opportunity, we would have probably sold out before the price pump. It was just a few people back then who actually believed in Bitcoin, a currency you can't physically see. It was hard to convince someone back in those days, but it's easier now because people have seen the proof.I don't blame those who have made such huge mistake in the past thou.",

      "body": "Back then people weren't really thinking of bitcoin of getting that big in value. To them bitcoin is merely another form of payment they can use primarily online. Just take that guy who bought a box of pizza using his bitcoins, the amount of which would've made him affluent many times over already. He doesn't regret, at least that's what he says, because you won't really suspect bitcoin of becoming a great store of value when its main directive is to act as a form of seamless long-distance payment channel. Sure, to look back at your 48 cents becoming millions now may make you regret a few life choices but then again, that doesn't mean it's the end of the world. You can always invest in bitcoin again and with the way things are holding up you can easily expect profits to come.",

It had quite different intentions. When Bitcoin's last bull reached $70K, ten years ago no one could have predicted it. After that, it fell back below 20K. But, a lot of folks are still waiting to dump more. As a result, everyone has distinct ideas. On the other hand, there is someone purchasing and someone else selling. I can state that the seller didn't think the price would increase at this rate. He was however not a stupid, otherwise he would not have purchased Bitcoin. Nobody knows if he had accumulated more after selling. Perhaps he was trading himself.",

He said that BTC was substantially overpriced at $0.05 so he does have the chance to sell at $0.05 each.I'm not sure either what he is doing with $0.48. It's easier to think there weren't many people in the market buying and selling during that time. Probably just testing around, I bet he got more than 10K BTC around that time and he just sold 160BTC, he must have considered it dust 13 years ago.",

Idea is; no one would expect the market price would be as high as with the present or previous ATH especially if we would be talking about years of progress. Same thing goes with investing at this point to a new project token. If it won't show progress, would you be still holding it for a decade or more?
