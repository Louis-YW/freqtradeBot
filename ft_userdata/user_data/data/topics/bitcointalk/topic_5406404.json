By installing a recent version of the wallet on a different device? Or do you get the same error message on all systems and all versions of the wallet?Like i said: i'm not a bitcoin.com wallet user (never have been either), but i can imagine that they started rejecting connections from legacy wallets for some reason, or maybe that your current device has a network issue... By installing a new version of the wallet on a different device (maybe even on a different network), at least you can rule this out.This is, offcourse, under the assumption the seed phrase from your (old) version is compatible with the new version of the wallet... It would be bad design on bitcoin.com's part if it wasn't...",

The version is v5.13-rc4.Bitcoin.com is a website related to an altcoin called Bitcoin Cash.Unlike Bitcoin.org, I think that Bitcoin.com actually has a company behind it and it has support. https://support.bitcoin.com/en/So my advice would be:1. Ask the support there make your wallet work again.2. Find out if you have bitcoin in your wallet or bitcoin cash or similar altcoin.2.1 if you have bitcoin, move your coins to a proper bitcoin wallet, maybe Electrum and make sure you save carefully your seed words, or, if it's a meaningful amount, consider buying a hardware wallet to be safe2.2 if you have altcoins consider converting into bitcoin and follow step 2.1",

The problem could still be network related and be on your device, or on your router... things like a local firewall for outgoing connections for example.If you try installing the new version of the wallet on a different device on a different network, at least you'll be sure... If the seed phrase of the old wallet is compatible with the new version of the wallet, and you do install the new version on a different device on a different network, if it still doesn't work the problem is probably on bitcoin.com's end.  I suppose they run a full node and bitcoin.com is an SPV wallet, so if their node has problems the spv wallet will not work. In this case their support should be able to help you out.If you install the newest version on a different device on a different network, and you restore from seed and it solves your problem it's probably because your current version is to old or there's a problem with your setup (be it your device or your network itself).",

The only option is to import your backup to another wallet as suggested above and it seems that their wallet is generating with BIP39 so you should get the same addresses after you imported it to Electrum. Take note it's not safe to use a wallet that is generated from another wallet so I suggest you instead of importing them to Electrum extract all private keys from https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ offline mode and sweep all private keys to your new wallet(Make a new wallet with Electrum).",
