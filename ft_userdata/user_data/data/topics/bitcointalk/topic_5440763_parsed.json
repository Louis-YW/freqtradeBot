Same is my opinion. Apart from Stake I've used sportsbet, which is good to use. These days we can't term this is best and that isn't, because different users have different expectations and go with different platforms. In my experience I've been used to Stake mostly for my casino games and the same makes me use it for sportsbook and I haven't encountered any issues using it.",

What I like in this sports book because they have an odds boost promotion where you can take advantage to make more money among other bookies. It's really worth to try because I've won for multiple times when bet on the odds boost promotion. Of course you need to know the sports and not blindly random put your money in that's betting option.",

Trust is my own factor of selection, and Bet365 gained it over a decade ago since I've been betting on their platform. And recently, Duelbits gained my trust as well and they are living up to my expectations.Bonuses have never been my thing, I learned to be using my own money to do all my betting due to the terms and conditions attached to bonuses and gambling offers.",

Go for sportsbooks that is reputed and pays to their gamblers. Else if you go for design and flexibility, and at last if the sportsbook refuses to pay, then nothing can be done. According to me , the best sportsbook currently available is Stake.com, I have been playing there since its launch, and honestly I didn’t face any troubles or issues from them till now. Moreover they haven’t also asked for KYC, and i did many big withdrawals from the site. So yes for me, currently Stake is the best sportsbook available in the gambling industry.",

Well, you'd sometimes see complaints towarda it but most of the time there are no proofs for their acusations. Also, problems are being discussed on their thread especially if it is proven legitimate and as far as I know, they are quickly reaponding to it with a solution. Also, it won't be reputable if there are issues often. So I think it would be okay sharing it to other gamblers out there. I am still playing at other gambling sites for other sort of gambling games.
