  "content": "QuoteFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has formally endorsed Mr Peter Obi of the Labour Party as his preferred candidate for the 2023 presidential election. TheNewsGuru.com (TNG) reports Obasanjo endorsed Peter Obi as his preferred candidate in his New Year message to Nigerians. The former president said: “None of the contestants is a saint but when one compares their character, antecedent, their understanding, knowledge, discipline, and vitality that they can bring to bear and the great efforts required to stay focused on the job, particularly looking at where the country is today and with the experience on the job that I personally had, Peter Obi as a mentee has an edge.“Others like all of us have what they can collectively contribute to the new dispensation to liberation, restoration and salvaging of Nigeria. One other important point to make about Peter is that he is a needle with thread attached to it from North and South and he may not get lost. “In other words, he has people who can pull his ears, if and when necessary. He has a young and able running mate with a clean track record of achievement both in public and private life”. TNG reports the New Year message personally signed by the ex-President was released by his spokesman, Kehinde Akinyemi.Source: https://thenewsguru.com/politics/breaking-obj-officially-endorses-peter-obi-for-president/I know say una go dun hear this news from the different social platforms wey we dey but I say make I bring am here make we reason one or two. Without any bias make una talk truth, you think say this message from OBJ na him genuine mind abi another political decision so him enemy Atiku no go get supports to fit win the election or to make sure the likes of Tinubu no enta that seat as him fit do things wey go make OBJ not relevant again for Nigeria. Also you feel say this decision from OBJ na another from to make himself relevant so Incase OBI win him fit carry shoulder up say na him put am there and try get benefits with godfather parole.  Within you think about this decision by OBJ entirely?.",

Before the signing, Al Nassr been get 850k followers on Instagram but after the signing, their followers come increase to 2.4M within 24 hrs and currently has 7.4M followers.
