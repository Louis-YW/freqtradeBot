  "content": "Many of us has been into Bitcoin investment and also in bitcointalk for years like eight to seven [8-7] years, but they can't  account what they have benefited from bitcointalk morally and financially, I know that many people will not like to mention their achievements in bitcoins investment and also what they acquired through bitcointalk because of security purposes, but I think is good for we let people who condemned bitcoin investment know what we have achieved since we are into Bitcoin investment Myself I have achieved different things since I joined bitcointalk, both through investment in bitcoin and also learning from Bitcointalk..the following is what I achieved from Bitcoin and also in bitcointalk,• I used bitcoins investment money, when bitcoins was seventeen thousands [17k] i inveted on it, and used the profit in the investment to complete my building structure in 2025• I used signature campaign funds to establish motor tyres shop, and today the business has grown large • I learnt risk management in trading through bitcointalk • I learnt how to make a proper research before venturing into investment through bitcointalk • I acquired different knowledge which I can't mention all through bitcointalk So I want use this medium to ask people who has invested on Bitcoin more than three [3] years and also people who has been in bitcointalk over four to seven [4-7] years what they have achieved from Bitcoin investment and bitcointalk community.Note The reason why I didn't add the images of my house and the images of my motor tyres shop, is because I don't want this thread to look as a merit phishing.",

And again some persons are still holding on to their Bitcoin but still can't speak for everyone though. Well congratulations to you mate, for your wonderful achievement but for someone like me who haven't stayed in the crypto space for up to that amount of years I think am good with still gathering the pieces together.",

I run a small business while staying active in crypto doing some investing, trading, and of course, participating in the forum. The only thing is, most of what I earn from my signature campaign doesn’t go into the business. Instead, I use it for gambling. But at least I have some extra funds to support that hobby.",

It's really important to not be knowledgeable in only a particular area and then be satisfied because with the way the world has revolved every skill and information you can lay your hands on would always come in handy and thanks to Bitcointalk, I can say that what I've learned is really paving a way for me.  I may not have built me a house, but at least I can say I'm self employed thanks to the little business signature campaign funds has helped me open and don't have to rely on government jobs alone before I can pay my bills or feed the family.",

With my income from signature campaign, I can now raise my family on my own and if God’s will, I can also establish my own business in the near future. Though I’m still not making it totally big here, but getting an income more than what my daily job offered me before, this is already a big accomplishment for me.",

Happy to be here and to say it has been worth it.  I agree with you on this because I don't see much difference between here and those online classes one takes to learn about these stuffs, the only major difference being that you'd get a certification. It's sad that some people come here mostly for the signature campaigns and not the knowledge because it's free here and what you'd know, depending on how much dedication you put into it can serve you further in life but I feel that since it's free, most people take it for granted.",
