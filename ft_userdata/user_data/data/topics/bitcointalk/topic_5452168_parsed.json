      "body": "OP you have been earlier advised to be specific in the files you can conveniently work on so as not cast any doubt with respect to your services. As i see not mentioning specific areas are signs of lapses though and your update or introduction is kind of empty rather. It would be in your own best interest to do as you have been advised so that members here willing to engage your services would not be much bothered about wanting to go through the stress of detailing or specially putting up things to do.Do you not have past work or portfolio to present so we could see your past records and performance because that would give you  a good edge and stand on this platform if you must scale through.",
