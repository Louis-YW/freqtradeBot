The problem with PNL tracking on most platforms is that they fail to separate funding payments from realized/unrealized PNL. This means you will not know what portion of your PNL is attributable to funding and which is simply from gain/loss of the underlying. By separating these metrics, you can focus on optimizing your funding rate earnings. For some delta neutral strategies, the PNL from underlying gain/loss is mostly irrelevant.",
