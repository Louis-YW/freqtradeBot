It will be wise you guys report to their licence off.",

You got scammed, and it will be hard to get it back if their business is to scam the gamblers, this is a lesson learned do your review first before trusting the site and also don't store too much money on any site, its not safe at all.",

It’s just odd that these guy usually have same which they deposit then win multiple times consecutively on SPORTSBOOK then casino freeze their account after they manage to withdraw some of their profit.I don’t know exactly what’s the real story behind this kind of issue but Arbitrage betting is already now common crypto sportsbook which is same problem on fiat sportsbook. I believe these arbitrage guys migrate already on crypto casino from fiat casino after being banned already on fiat casino. I joined many subreddit group about this arbitrage betting and most of them shares same story with OP. I believe they are being bust because bookmaker has records of all the players detail in different casino.I hope Bitcointalk will not become a tool for this arbitrage guys as reason to pressure casino to release their funds. Arbitrage bets is not allowed on any sportsbook.",

It's also quite sad and worrying for a gambler's side.Think about it, you will be bitten at the beginning that you won and you will be allowed to withdraw first and second then all of a sudden suddenly when they see that you have deposited a large amount suddenly you can't access your account because it is blocked without any opposition.",

Too late for this, OP should visit that review site first before making any huge deposit. This site is a scam, and better to avoid it at all cost. OP still managed to withdraw some funds and i don’t know if the scammed money is a new deposit or came from a profit. Anyway, regardless of its source its already gone, and it will be hard to recover because the site is not responding and they have no plan to resolve all the issues on their platform.",
