When it comes to SEO, results and testimonials are very important.",

When it comes to SEO, results and testimonials are very important.I have to partially defend the OP, that is, the SEO business in general. First, it is not to be expected that someone will publicly share information about their clients. This is not done for the protection of clients, so as not to affect their reputation. Such things can be considered inside information. There is no way to prove that someone did SEO for a certain company, website or whatever. Apart from taking their word for it or if the client himself officially announces it somewhere (but this happens very rarely).Even if you have all the reliable information that person xx did SEO for site YY, without prior knowledge (about SEO) and certain (paid) tools, you cannot determine the quality of the SEO work performed.Backlinks are what he needs to prove. Their quality and method of creation.However, what exposes the OP is his offer. He persistently offers backlinks, some of which he calls premium. Now I responsibly claim that it is not possible to get 10 \"high-quality\" backlinks for $50 (let's ignore the fact that his specific service comes with it). Or even 40 \"elite\" BL. for $300.Just imagine, for example, CMC+Coingecko+38 and other \"elite\" sites sharing $300 for backlinks to some new and unproven crypto site...  What the OP doesn't say is that bad backlinks cause penalties from Google, and it's very difficult to correct that later.",
