This is a classical reason why we shouldn't make posts while sleepy. It has dare consequences just like DUI.BTW, I don't think the reported post wasn't deleted because it was not delete-worthy but it could be that mods didn't see it on time. The forum lacks mods.",

There was no matter between Little Mouse and LUCKMCFLY, so there shouldn't be such thing as settle amicably. Little Mouse had said that he didn't create the topic because of Lucky, that he has been experiencing similar reluctance by moderators when he reports such kinds of posts for deletion. He therefore wants to know why moderators do not hastily delete such posts. I think it is not time to lock the thread, except a moderator answers Op.",

Little Mouse had said that he didn't create the topic because of Lucky, that he has been experiencing similar reluctance by moderators when he reports such kinds of posts for deletion.To the best I could offer, I believe I did outline a possible cause for that in my second paragraph. Well, if you're still insisting on mods coming to comment here before you deem it fit for the thread to be locked; let's see how that works out. The few mods we've here are already overworked and may not have the luxury of time patrolling to respond to threads except they're tagged.",

I already deleted it.Sometimes that happens and the good step is to edit or delete those posts. I really appreciate that you accepted your mistake and deleted the post. By the way, reporting of all posts isn't necessary because sometimes the issues can be solved via a PM. I have recently made a similar mistake in philipma1957 raffle by selecting a wrong spot which was already selected by someone else. Philipma1957 sent me a pm and I admitted that I unconsciously did that. The matter was solved within seconds because of a PM. I really appreciate philipma1957 for sending that PM. I believe that in future we should try to solve such issues by sending PM to the member who has done something mistakenly.",
