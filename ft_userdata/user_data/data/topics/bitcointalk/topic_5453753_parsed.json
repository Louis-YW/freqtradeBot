I am thinking of cashing out maybe 10% of what I have invested so far when we next see a significant pump so just wondering how that would affect me if it does at all or is it ok as it would be well under the £6000 allowance?",

Are you talking about the Annual Exempt Amount for incomes under the general Capital Gains Tax-free allowances? Or is there a specific regulation on virtual assets/cryptocurrencies in the UK? I know something about laws and cryptos but your jurisdiction is a bit far for me, so if you could share any link to the free allowance you are talking about maybe I can or we can help you better.",

      "body": "If I'm not mistaken, when it comes to UK tax-free allowances, it usually refers to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) allowances. The CGT applies to profits made from the sale or disposal of certain assets, including cryptocurrencies, on top of an annual allowance. Withdrawals in allowances generally do not attract CGT.If you decide to withdraw 10% of your investment, it is better to consult with your local tax officer before re-reading the contents of the article related to the withdrawal item you are aiming for because regulations can change over time and always comply with any amendments .I am personally optimistic that your investment decisions will give you the best results.",

Similar style like @jerry0 but I don't imply @JamesDaniel90 is alt of @jerry0.It evident enough that this is customary to OP and OP has got some fans already to display the inevitable on his or her trust page. Hopefully OP gets the message and turns a new live to that which has become of his or her approach towards the forum.Though, it would have been a thing of interest to me on how these subject is handled as per converting crypto assets to its fiat equivalent over there. I think YUriy1991 had a good say on the matter and as much as it makes sense to some extent, a little more detailing would be nice. Hopefully, the subject be useful to OP even as we beacon on OP to avoid making duplicate threads and bump existing onces instead.",
