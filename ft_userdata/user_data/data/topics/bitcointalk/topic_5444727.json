Ask me if you have any information.I'm glad for you, but there's really no need to spam and open several topics where you offer the same thing.here you opened a topic where you offer bounty management, you also do things that are against the rules of the forum, such as an unwanted bump within 24 hours.by spamming here, you won't get good publicity. also, it is necessary to wait for a rank upgrade or to buy a copper membership so that the pictures you upload are visible.",
