  "content": "Hacked amount $2.7. Although, Tether has frozen $1.4 millionI created this on our local board because we Nigerians know many people among us are using this exchange. And this will be a warning again that if it is not your key, it is not your coin. Avoid saving on centralized exchanges. Move your coins to a noncustodial wallet and have the full control yourself.Quote from: https://blockchair.com/news/remitano-exchange-allegedly-hacked-for-27m-14m-frozen-by-tether--abb8167a95Crypto exchange Remitano experienced large withdrawals under suspicious circumstances on Sept. 14, with some blockchain analysts concluding that it may have been hacked. A total of $2.7 million worth of crypto has been withdrawn through the suspicious transactions. Tether has frozen one address the attacker allegedly used, potentially saving $1.4 million worth of customers’ crypto.Is deposit and withdrawal still available on Remitano or it has been disabled?",

After the recent incident with Patricia I taught Nigeria would have learn to run out from storing their crypto on exchanges and try to hold it on their own personal wallet until when they want to exchange it then they can make use of any exchange that they care to use. If people are just making use of this exchanges just for the purpose of exchanges their crypto to fait, this exchange will have little holding volumes which will reduce hackers intention to hack them since their is literally nothing to few funds which could be hijacked from their. Let’s see what will happen after this, in one part this is one thing that most post people like about centralization, as tether have been able to take a quick action by frozen funds of the hackers on their wallets which will limit them of spending it, but everything always have its advantages as they can use such access in their own advantage over an innocent holders fund.",

The latest information I got on them was when they sent out notifications for customers to update or request for  for new BTC address before making a transaction henceforth. I would have to investigate further to know if this hack information is worse than could be managed or recovered from. In the meantime, can someone please advice on the next best exchange or custodial wallet to use, with easy features and better security protocol?",
