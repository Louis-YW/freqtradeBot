If you think about it, every transaction in a bitcoin block may represent millions and millions of transactions on layer two, so each bitcoin block may contain the economic activity of a big city or even a whole country. People who criticize bitcoin for being \"too slow\" don't seem to understand that decentralized settlement of transactions is more important than the number of transactions per second, this is why in the traditional financial system we have one FedWire and many-many PayPals. What is interesting is that FedWire is very slow, but it somehow can afford the settlement of billions of transactions made by payment networks. And who do you think is more important and has more power? Not who touches money first, but who decides last whom this money belongs to.",

Now, think of locking that metal to a magical box, and get paper notes, that are 1:1 pegged to it, and which you can transfer more easily, cheaply, and can be withdrawn any time for the metal. That could be a Bitcoin Layer 1, and Layer 2 analogy. On-chain transactions don't equate with all transactions that happen within the system.

Well, yes. Thank you.I seem to have tacitly assumed that on-chain transactions are absolutely safe, although theoretically it takes 6 blocks to confirm.I don't feel transactions via Lightning have the same security risks as traditional on-chain, so there's no direct comparison.Quote from: NotATether on October 28, 2022, 03:03:14 PMIf you're talking about funds security, that is not possible since LN works on a multisig and timelocks model, where you lose access to the funds if you go offline for a period of time, unlike in Layer 1.“One of the greatest problems with the Lightning Network, however, is offline transaction scams. If one participant in a payment channel chooses to close it while the other party is offline, the former can steal the funds.”Oh so, indeed.After the Lightning Network is established, the number of transactions before uploading to the chain for confirmation cannot be estimated.And staring at the maximum transaction throughput that Bitcoin can support doesn't seem to make much sense.I heard that Bitcoin is positioned as digital gold......PS: Forgive my English need to rely on Google translation, I was not very accurate when I checked the words.",

Every transaction is reversible, theoretically. If it was just confirmed, 1 block now, it requires less effort than one that's 100,000 blocks deep, but they're both reversible, with enough effort. The \"6 blocks\" is just a good tradeoff between time and security. Given that you own 40% of hashrate, you have 50.398% chances to reorg 6 blocks. To go even deeper, cryptography isn't \"absolutely secure\" either. Theoretically you can find all private keys with a balance. Practically, it's impossible.

The comparative with visa is tricky, because bitcoin has a transaction limit/time and vice can process a huge amount of transactions, even if the aren't instant as the bitcoin mempool visa can process millions of transactions each day.On this article we see how huge is the volume:QuoteVisaNet, the card network’s payment processing system, handles an average of 150 million transactions per day and the firm claims it is capable of processing more than 24,000 Visa transactions per second.Source: https://blog.unibulmerchantservices.com/processing-24000-visa-transactions-per-second-how-its-done/",

In order for this to be possible, there would need to be a fairly small number of \"banks\" that many users open channels with, and each 'bank' is connected to each other (or is also possibly connected to a 'central bank'). This is somewhat similar to how the banking system works today but without fractional reserves (the 'banks' and 'central bank(s)' would need to have a lot of capital, or else they would be unattractive for users to connect to their nodes.

I don't think the LN topology will ever look like what I described above. It is clear that LN is much faster than Visa transactions in terms of the merchant receiving their money. I understand that merchants' agreements with payment processors vary, but I speculate that in a best-case scenario, merchants receive money in a number of days, although there is the risk of chargebacks months after the date of the transaction. The question of which setup is superior is not a technical one. Each setup has its own pros and cons, and the costs associated with fraud are borne by different parties in each setup.",
