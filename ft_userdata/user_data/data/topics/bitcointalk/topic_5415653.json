Number are devastating. And yet people will continue to fud that bitcoin will be banned because of carbon footprint while its 56x better than its main competitor. Bitcoin is more eco-friendly than PC gaming - Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on September 10, 2022, 05:45:39 AMLet's ban bitcoin mining ... meanwhile new graphic cards made for gamers are about to hit the roof with power consumption GeForce RTX 4000 ‚ÄúLovelace‚Äú power draw might exceed 800 W. Just to run AAA game with 4k in 60 fps. Why not ban gaming? why not allow minesweeper and solitaire only as the most eco-friendly games?\"Based on our very rough estimates, we found that the worldwide electricity consumption of people playing video games is 46% higher than the total consumption of Bitcoin mining as of November 2019.\"https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-vs-gamingWhat about warm baths? We can all take cold baths. Its even healthier for us. I bet that warm baths worldwide consume more energy than bitcoin.I'm just kidding with all this, but I want to show only how much hypocrisy we live in that elites can ban/limit everything they want only because it does not fit their narrative. I don't understand why bitcoin is treated differently from others. Its only a customer of companies producing and selling electricity. It's their fault that energy they produce is dirty. Just like gamers are customers only, just like every single one of us is. No one check what percentage of your gaming PC energy consumption is made from renewables. No one force to buy and run 1 solar panel unit for every GTX 1060 or stronger GPU you have.",

Especially if bitcoin's inflation drops and the price stabilises. Computers consume power even if they're idle, if these are used in companies to handle the burden of lighting payments then they'll still consume about the same amount of energy and will be contributing to the network for free (same goes for normal computers that are lighting enabled).",

      "body": "Bitcoin is an electronic peer-to-peer payment system, and it's not correct to compare it with the whole banking and fiat money system. As the paper shows, a large portion of energy is spent on maintaining banknotes and coins, and it may seem that Bitcoin is winning here, but it's essentially like asking \"what's better - a car or a ship?\". The world needs both electronic and physical money, our civilization won't be able to function without physical money, and it's foolish to try to fully get rid of physical money, because it makes society vulnerable to disruptions of electronic payment methods, Internet, energy grid.Second, the paper shows how banks consume a lot of energy because they employ millions of people, but that's because banks provide services other than simply transferring money, like approving loans, helping people invest and so on - Bitcoin has none of it. Also the human in the loop has features that Bitcoin doesn't have - it can save you from scammers by asking for additional verification, it can help you undo theft or transactions done by mistake, it can recover access to your account if you lost your password and so on. It also comes with negative sides like unjust fund seizures or account freezes, but overall it makes banks very different from Bitcoin, so again it's not correct to say \"both systems transfer money, so we compare their total energy use\". If Bitcoin was offering EVERYTHING that banks offer, it would be possible to compare its energy use with full energy use of banks.",

They only focus on bitcoin's power consumption and compare it to the ATM power consumption, while bank doesn't operate on those alone. They'd have to add every single card terminal in every single store and every data center that connects these. They'd also have to add every computer in every bank branch, every piece of light and CCTV system, every server of online banking and so on.

Illiteracy is another major reason why physical money would still be around. Fiat is very easy to use for the uneducated. A high percentage of my country's population has never used ATMs and greater number lack internet banking skills. Bitcoin adoption would increase as more countries embrace mass education and technological development. For now, fiat would still be around.

Human intellect can not be compared to machines and robots and they still offer a wide range of services that bitcoin lacks. But I am predicting that bitcoin might start offering these services in the nearest future. But the fact that traditional banks consume more energy than bitcoin would always be underplayed by bitcoin haters, while they would always overblow bitcoin's energy consumption.
