As you celebrate today may Allah grant you all your heart desires and to a peaceful life to work with him. I have some Muslim friends down here in my country and on this day,they show love to everybody around them by giving gifts and drinks to them. I know that Christians has their own feast days but my question is this1. As a Christian, do you have any Muslim friend that you will be celebrating with him today2. Is it good as a Christian to partake in such feast that is not of Christian. Does this show love and unity,if one does that.",

As a Christian, do you have any Muslim friend that you will be celebrating with him todayThere are many religions, and religion should not be the criteria for friendship.  People with different religious beliefs can be friends so long as they accept themselves and respect each others religious beliefs. Quote from: Sim_card on June 28, 2023, 08:59:37 AM2. Is it good as a Christian to partake in such feast that is not of Christian. Does this show love and unity,if one does that.You can celebrate with people from other religion without being involved in the activities of their celebration if you do not want.Joining in the feast is not the only way to show love and unity.",

Religion shouldn't be the basis for keep someone as a friend cause even in our own religious circle we do have wicked faithfuls. I have no problem feasting with people of other religions in as much as am comfortable with what they're eating I do partake in, wether am comfortable with it or not it's not in my place to condemn. There are so many other ways of showing felicitations with people people of other religions in their celebrations moments oder than feasting together with them. Sending a good will message is one of such ways too.",

      "body": "Religion is the opium of the masses just like Karl Marx said. This means with religion, leaders can use it against the people to manipulate them against people in another religion. So let us not be deceived, no matter the religion we find ourselves God is the creator and we should do good to all because there is always a reward for actions we commit. If you are a leader, don't deceive your followers.Happy celebration.",

I have some Muslim friends down here in my country and on this day,they show love to everybody around them by giving gifts and drinks to them. Islam is a very interesting religion that deserves respect. I recently saw the video of Salwan Momika burning the Holy Koran and it was not a good sight. And this hate crime was done in front of a well-known mosque, that's bad. We should respect the belief of others and allow everyone to worship the way they want. I had some Muslim friends and their good character is commendable. They were reliable and had integrity. Islam would have been my best option if I have not been converted to my present religion. I wish all the Muslims, Happy Salah .QuoteI know that Christians has their own feast days but my question is this1. As a Christian, do you have any Muslim friend that you will be celebrating with him todayI don't have any of my Muslim friends around now. And I have moved to an area that has fewer Muslims and I have not had contact with them. So I just enjoyed the holiday with my family. Quote2. Is it good as a Christian to partake in such feast that is not of Christian. Does this show love and unity,if one does th?t.Why not? I am not part of those religious fanatics that believe that their religion is the best. They treat other people's religions as inferior, so they don't want to associate with other religions. This perception is wrong because no religion is perfect or the best. And we are human before we became religious. As much as it doesn't involve some barbaric rituals or inhuman or illegal activities I can partake of any religious festivals of any religion.",
