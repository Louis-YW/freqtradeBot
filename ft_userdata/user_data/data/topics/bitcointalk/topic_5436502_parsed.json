What distinguishes the Playerup site is that it enjoys high credibility and plays the role of mediator in transactions between the seller and the buyer so that no fraud occurs.Also, the G2G.com site is well-known and fully supports crypto, and transactions are carried out in a secure manner between buyers and sellers. Check out the link below to find all the questions you have in mind.[1] https://support.g2g.com/support/solutions",
