      "body": "Since you don't have any reputation here on the forum and you want to start up a lending service, which is for sure, there will be a lot of questions regarding you acting as an escrow for your collateral. For that, you can either use any of the known escrow services on the forum; they will have to hold the escrowed fund. Upon the completion of the loan, if the person who took the loan from you failed to pay back on time, then the escrow will have to hand over the holding to you, and the collateral will be sent back to the borrower. Whichever it is, maybe it won't affect your business, and in escrow, most of them don't do it for free, so if you want to consider any of the options, try not to forget to add a fee into your calculation.QuoteCan this way it works If i put funds on escrow here If i mess around or scam or something i'll lose my funds.Or Any other ways ? Thanks !If you hand over your fund to any escrow and you have a scam allegation that it was really you who scammed someone, if the fund on escrow can cover the scam, it will be used to pay back what you have stolen, and you will lose any reputation that you were even trying to build.",

On the other hand, the concern against newbies is getting scammed after the borrower sends collateral. I think you should involve an escrow to keep the borrower's collateral, not to guarantee some of your own money because you don't limit the number of borrowers you can handle. Though I doubt that there's anyone escrow willing to work with you.",

Thanks !Let me start by asking you to know the rules of the forum, then try get used to the threads that provides same service on lending board as you've been provided with the link to the board, check their requirements, go through their threads and see how applications were made and how the refundment as well is being collected, learn from those in operational and improve on your own style, set a requirements and be truthful in everything you will be doing, once people have that trust in you, then you're free to remain in doing that.Additional tips for you in setting requirements1. Dont give to newbie account2. Start from member rank upward3. Let your applicant be those already participating in campaign4. Don't give loan to a user having a negative feedback trust rating5. Set your limit, requirements, duration and interest rate",

And what ammount?Do you want to dqsh people money or there is something you are not telling us? As you can see, starting a loan business does not need any stress of writing too much. What you need to do is to create your own thread in the service board with all the services you can provide starting the minimum loan amount, rate, interest, ranks that are eligible for your loan and for how long. These do not need you to seek for people's opinions at all. Anybody that is interested in your service will write you and if you are okay with the deal, you can proceed without stress.",

Thanks !What kind of terms is this Quote from: Collateralbank on August 16, 2023, 07:32:52 PMGeneral terms for lending You get loan 50% from the total Market value of your asset and  with monthly 10% intrsest. Your asset Will be taken from you If your intrests exeeds the borrowed ammount then you must add more asset or pay off some of your debt.Loan ammount 100$  your Asset btc value 200$ so you pay 10$ monthly so your Asset Will be liqutated in 10 months not 10%x10=100$ You're only giving 50% of the value of the collateral, with a huge 10% interest monthly only desperate people will take this, tell us why would anyone trust you with the 50% value of their collateral?I used to take a loan from our local board but not so exorbitant interest like you offer.You are not setting up a loan business here you are attempting to scam people and victimize them with your terms.",

Thanks !You already have 2 negative tags relating to lending and collateral. That alone is a damage to your reputation even when you have not started. You should instead consider how to make the tags leave your profile before proceeding with your business. When a genuine person wants to start a lending business, the risk is always on the lender side and not the reverse. Seeing yourself that people may not trust you truly means that people will not trust you.You can start with non collateral loan to reputable members till you build your reputation and trust, you can then offer a collateral loan.",
