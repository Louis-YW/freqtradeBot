It's possible that someone does, but they don't want to share, but does it really matter whether we know who Satoshi is or the kind of colour person he is? Bitcoin is so decentralized that even if he decides to return today, he won't be able to do anything or claim to own it back, all he will be able to do is sell what he currently owns, which I doubt he will do for a profit when the price of bitcoin has reached $64k and never move a single sats, I doubt he will even do that in the next ten years.You should be concerned about the guys who are benefiting from Satoshi's hard work, CZ is currently the richest person in the crypto space yet you didn't worry about him being worth $17.4 billion according to forbe that can do whatever they want rather than imaginary bitcoin that you know nothing about.",

Satoshi just really played at his best to be the best example of what anonymity is so is the creation of bitcoin.Quote from: Lewan on October 11, 2022, 08:34:59 PMOtherwise, it is not possible for such a rich and important person to remain hidden.But he just did. With all the current holdings that he's got, calculating the net of it. He's totally rich but for all over the years, no one has gone out to move those coins that have been there for so long. And our conclusion is that he's gone forever and those bitcoins are also gone together with him.",

Satoshi is the creator of bitcoin and he can hold a lot of bitcoins but I guess he can't control bitcoins either, so his presence won't change the decentralized nature of bitcoin either.

Satoshi is the creator of bitcoin and he can hold a lot of bitcoins but I guess he can't control bitcoins either, so his presence won't change the decentralized nature of bitcoin either. I doubt that! There will be a temporary effect on the market which can be negative but that will be recovered faster that we expect. It all depends on the course of actions taken by the enforcement agencies once the identity of real Satoshi is revealed and confirmed. I am sure a lot of enforcement agencies are waiting for this information. So we will see what impact it brings on to the market. But decentralization has its own benefits.
