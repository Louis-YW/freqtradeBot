  "content": "1 Click to NinjaspaceWhile we browse this forum, for knowing the user details we often have to go to the ninjastic.space website. After going there and searching by typing or copy-pasting the user's name, we get those details. So it came to my head that repeatedly copying and pasting names is a lot of irony and waste of time so I thought to make an extension through which by selecting the name of the user with the mouse, his details can be found in one click one of my friend also helped to fix this. I think it will be also useful for you(specially for sig. camp. managers) as it has been for me. Details are mentioned below:You can download it if you want or you can easily create it by creating a .JS and a .JSON file on your PC  by copying and pasting below codes 1. Firstly, create a few files in a folder same as below 2. Then paste these codes to eventPage.js file.Code:var menuItem = {    \"id\": \"cryptolibrary\",    \"title\": \"1 click to ninjaspace(CL)\",    \"contexts\": [\"selection\"]}chrome.contextMenus.create(menuItem);function fixedEncodeURI(str) {    return encodeURI(str).replace(/%5B/g, '[').replace(/%5D/g, ']');}chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener(function(clickData){    if(clickData.menuItemId == \"cryptolibrary\" && clickData.selectionText){        var ninjaUrl = \"https://ninjastic.space/user/\" + fixedEncodeURI(clickData.selectionText);        var createData = {            \"url\": ninjaUrl,            \"type\": \"popup\",            \"top\": 5,            \"left\": 5,            \"width\": screen.availWidth/2,            \"height\": screen.availHeight/2        };        chrome.windows.create(createData, function(){});    }})3. And then paste these to mainfest.json file .Code:{     \"manifest_version\": 2,    \"name\": \"1 click to ninjaspace(Crypto Library)\",    \"version\": \"1.0\",    \"description\": \"serarch\",    \"icons\": {        \"128\": \"icon128.png\",        \"48\": \"icon48.png\",        \"16\": \"icon16.png\"    },    \"background\": {        \"scripts\": [\"eventPage.js\"],        \"persistent\": false    },    \"permissions\": [        \"tabs\",        \"contextMenus\"    ]}4. Or you find all the files in this -> one click to ninjaspace (Crypto Library).zip (extract it).5. And then go to your browser extensions. 6. Turn on the Developer mode. 7. Then click to the Load unpacked and select the folder what you have download .8. All done now come to BTT forum and select any user name of this forum and click the right button of mouse and you will see this option (1 click to ninjaspace ) and click it and ninjasticspace will across to you. Here is the result And A big credit goes to @TryNinja who is behind Ninjastic.space***Thanks to all excuse me if I did any mistake***For Bengali: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=631891.msg61771037#msg61771037",

Certainly, what you learned in this project will give you the necessary skills to carry out other, even more interesting projects.Once again, congratulations!",

Don't extensions, no matter how open they are, create privacy and security issues, especially for those who don't understand them? Of course, the OP put everything on the shelves, and everything is described in detail, but I doubt it.Very often, it is advised not to decorate your browser like a Christmas tree with extensions; a lot can happen, and you can later regret that you once saved your time by not wanting to do everything on your own.",

I do see your good initiative which was done with great efforts too.My idea (not request)Why did you make it only for Ninjastic.space?How about the same for BPIP and Loyce Club?I mean you can build two more extensions for BPIP and Loyce Club and people can use one of these three or all of them if they want. Sometimes people want to have double checking.Hope that it is not my bad idea",

BPIP Extension is a much more efficient way and it can save you a lot of time. I would highly recommend it.I tend to agree with BPIP extensions where users can save more time logging into tools like ninjastic.space, Loyce.club or BPIP itself. One click is enough to go straight into the tool and get the user information we want, and of course it doesn't make people have to copy and paste. 3 in 1 is much better, but I think we can appreciate the OP's initiative as well.",

Technically, even when you do understand the code, and verify it. You can't guarantee that the new code that you've used, despite being clean, won't be exploited by a potential attacker. It potentially increases the attack service of your browser. So, larger modifications, and therefore more complex tend to yield more problems. However, the decision solely relies on the user, and their threat model. Plenty of users have modified their browser, including myself.",
