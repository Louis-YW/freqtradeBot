We don't need to keep one single hope for this government but to dey do our own hussle. Is just like when you see Foetus Kayamu   wey dem put for aviation minister con begin tell you say corruption go go, go where na.No be the same Fagbemi wey be tinubu lead counsel for the election matter, him don carry am enter the head as attorney general so that him go fit finish the bribery of judges finish.

Yes na abi you no dey notice the injustice wey dey happen immediately any president take power, first him go retire most high military commanders so him own loyalist will get promoted. Everybody dey watch him own back that's why we no dey get all those coup wey dey happen for the other African countries dem as all man wey dey in the position to do that is already benefiting from the government. My own suggestions on how this country go fit move forward on this contract issue as I talk wey bi free and fair election first and if we no for achieve that one then make we use this strategy; If you want any contract, make government pay the money enter escrow and the escrow go be a private company maybe foreign and dem go come give you the contract. You go come use your own money do the work and when you finish am the government go review wetin you do with a taskforce set up of local and foreign experts to make sure the work tight. After them dun review everything, dem go come pay you all your deposit wey dem dun already put for the escrow as dis one go guarantee say government no go play you street as na those private escrow company integrity dey at stake here. When dem use this method, people no go dey joke with contract wey dem give dem because when you do inferior work, the company go hold the funds and dem no go give you until you redo everything and do am well.",

It's time to remove the bad eggs among the good ones and also there is need to create sensitization programs that will aid individuals in the dangers of involving in corrupt practices as it stagnates the general growth of any developing nation.It is very touching how we have moved from one corrupt leader to another over the years and these leaders have created lots of schemes and use those schemes as a medium to embezzle government funds. A lots of contacts have been awarded almost on yearly basis to construct roads, build schools, hospitals and health facilities, but is either the jobs are not executed or the are left uncompleted or dilapidated.It is very important for us to know that our actions and inactions will definitely affect our future generation one way or the other and the earlier with tackle this challenges now, the better for all of us.Corruption has become like a competition that when someone is tagged of being involved in a corrupt practice they will start to reference their predecessor, that their predecessor did same thing they're doing and no one brought them to book that why are they now judging them. With this mindset of involving in same corrupt practice that the previous government government did, you will see that it is really difficult to fight corruption.Another thing that weakens the effort to fight corruption is appointing close allies in some areas of government as you might not be able to probe them because they're your friends or your relatives and it will difficult for you to sack them or probe them.In the fight for a corruption free government, it is important not to let any stone unturned as the betterment of the nation should be of the utmost priority of any citizen of a country irrespective of people that are involved in corrupt practices, whether they're your brothers, your friends, your peer groups and so on, they should be probe for any form of corruption they are involved in.In conclusion, the growth of our country should be of concern to everyone of us and growth can never be achieved in a corrupt environment so it is the duty of you and I to work together in achieving a corruption free nation.",

Since I grew up, I have never seen a situation where an appointee steps beyond his boundaries but rather they play to the tone of their pay master so therefore appointees must do the biddings of their pay master if they want to remain in office otherwise dey would be disgraced out of office with set ups and betrayals which would definitely land them in jail.
