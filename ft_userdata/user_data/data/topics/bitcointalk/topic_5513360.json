Actually you can utilize many programs to maximize the strengths of each one. But you can also choose just one if you wish to do so. After choosing a program, next should be choosing a could provider. You can then create your blockchain ensuring you implement all the necessary features. Next is to make sure that you add APIs and endpoints to interact with the blockchain. All is left to do is testing it out and making sure it operates correctly. This is just a general roadmap as it is a lot more complicated to explain in just one post. I am sure there are numerous books and articles helping you to understand the process more thoroughly.",

      "body": "The deployment of blockchain on cloud computing varies in application, but it's a lot easier through cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud. You can use AWS Blockchain Templates or Azure's Blockchain Workbench-all preconfigured-and this will make things go way faster and less complicated. For coding, Python is perfect for any beginner because it is so simple, while you might also want to use Java in case you build more complicated systems using frameworks like Hyperledger or Ethereum.https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-blockchain-application-in-java-using-amazon-managed-blockchain/However, before plunging into the development, it is very important to select the infrastructure. One may opt for cloud platforms, which are highly scalable and inexpensive, but latency could be a bit higher than when using bare metal servers, which boast greater performance and security.https://www.databank.com/resources/blogs/implementing-blockchain-on-cloud-and-bare-metal/",
