  "content": "Biden campaign ramps up crypto industry outreach in surprising tone 'shift'This shift actually started recent weeks with SEC.'s stance on ETH Spot ETF applications from some companies. After many silent months, they contacted these companies and forced them to cooperate with SEC. for more consideration on those applications. Finally we can see SEC. approved ETH Spot ETFs and now we see something bigger.Biden team shifted their stance on crypto industry and it looks like a good news for this market. Can we trust that they will keep their promise if they become winners in the USA. President Election this year?I don't know, can not answer it now, I don't know about future but this shift shows that how disloyalty politicians are. Trump actually said different things about this crypto industry 5 years ago and only show his changes recent months that caused the Biden team have to react accordingly.https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192QuoteI am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.

The increasing price of Bitcoin is because its demand is increasing over time, and whoever becomes president of the United States in the upcoming term cannot stop the rise in bitcoin's price. I won't discuss politics here because we'll just try to say good things about the person we vote for and bad things about the other person. But what I see is that Mr. Trump was the first to speak out in favor of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, while the Biden administration is trying to imitate Mr. Trump after their crypto crackdown failed.

Because after Biden became president, look at what he did, especially regarding crypto market regulation. As a superpower whose dollar must be considered to remain strong compared to other currencies, of course now the assumption that they are treated as if they are friendly needs to be questioned. This is nothing more than a political issue so that the Bitcoin community in particular feels that they have been given a platform for expression but in reality it is not, regulations are being tightened and it is considered a threat to the Dollar. I am not a US person but based on our views who also actively follow US news, we do not see a positive side to Bitcoin and Crypto during the Biden administration. Maybe I am misinformed, so please tell me is the regulation regarding Bitcoin really positive there?",

I don't think USA can't go through another round of Trump without breaking, and even if the country didn't full on break, another four years of Trump would be very horrible in every way imaginable and leave another round of deep lasting scars on the nation.So it is very good to see Biden perhaps a little bit starting to change his tune on Bitcoin/Crypto. Because it means maybe some decent Crypto legislation will get passed this year, and of course it can help Biden grab a few extra votes. Sometimes political realities is the only thing that'll spur a politician to wake up and do the right thing, and this seems to be starting to be the case with Biden and Bitcoin/Crypto.",

President in past cycles?Naturally, when market cap is bigger, price will have less growth for each cycle so don't say in next 4 years, if Bitcoin has less than 500% increase, it is because of the next President even he can be either Biden or Trump.Please don't say the same next 8 years with another President who will surely not be Trump and Biden.",

I don't see anything good under Biden in power.What have they done?They made possible the biggest bull run we had, a new ATH and record cash inflows.The last BTC bull run started during Trump's presidency (2020). Many people comfortably \"forget\" this fact.  I won't even mention the even more impressive 2016-2017 bull run which also happened during Trump's presidency... you guys need to stop using silly arguments that don't even prove your pro-Biden point. It doesn't matter who was the president in 2021 (in an parallel universe it could have been Trump and it wouldn't have stopped the bull run).It's asinine to insinuate that a president (no matter who it may be) can influence a decentralized currency that much... unless BTC is centralized and we don't know it. Is that what you want to believe?I get it, woke folks/purple-haired Karens are triggered in case Trump gets elected again, but this isn't a fair criticism towards him.A fair criticism IMHO would be a potential financial meltdown in 2027 when China invades Taiwan. The US economy/stockmarket (Apple, Nvidia, AMD etc.) is highly dependant on TSMC (they're building new bleeding edge fabs in the West and Japan, but they won't be ready until 2027-2028). Imagine if Nvidia stock plunges by 99.99% in a single day due to disruption of supply chains.If Trump is the next president, he will get all the blame for starting WW3 and triggering hyperinflation in the entire world (which is going to ruin all fiat currencies -including USD- and bring CBDC as a \"New Deal\").But regardless of presidents (they're all WEF puppets), it's the Deep State that actually dictates if WW3 starts or not and you guys keep wasting energy about who is the best puppet/frontman in a faux democracy.",
