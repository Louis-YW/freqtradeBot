But why are you asking if it is already written in the article on Wikipedia? Adam Back's \"HashCash - a denial of service counter-measure\" is also based on the concept of Proof-of-Work and Satoshi Nakamoto mentioned this work in his Bitcoin whitepaper. I think the reason he didn't mention a research paper by Moni Naor and Cynthia Dwork is that he was looking for actual working implementations of interesting concepts, not abstract concepts themselves. You can always express and formalize your idea, but without implementation, it is not that interesting and cannot be used in other projects directly.",

They already anticipate spammer use specialized hardware and buy only needed computer parts (no monitor, small HDD, etc.) for sole purpose of solving PoW. Although the most interesting part it'll bring inconvenience to 1%-13% legitimate user.On a side note, i wonder how DAG-based cryptocurrency (such as IOTA and Nano) handle specialized spam attack since user need to verify 2 transaction rather than pay fee when creating a transaction.Both Nano [1] and IOTA [2] use PoW for spam protection. Or at least they used to, not sure what the current state is or how it accounts for improvements of hardware over time. Beyond that I guess having a central coordinator helps.[1] https://blog.nano.org/nano-pow-the-essentials-6bf8b021d49d[1] https://legacy.docs.iota.works/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-workEdit: I just reread your post and realized that you were already thinking about specialized PoW attacks, rather than how IOTA and Nano are preventing spam transactions in general. My educated guess is that the economic incentives simply aren't there yet.",
