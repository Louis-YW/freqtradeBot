Nothing but bruteforce which depends on how much he can remember and how strong was the password.Because wallet.dat passwords aren't saved in any online server nor in his local files, no one can recover it from a database.If you do not really mean \"wallet.dat file\" which is for Bitcoin Core or an altcoin fork of it, then the recovery options are based from the wallet.",

Assuming either the password is either short or your friend remember parts of the password, brute-force is possible within reasonable time. It comes down whether you choose to,1. Use your own computer. Least amount of trust is required, but you usually either need to be patient (if you have slow computer) or make big initial investment (if you're willing to buy high end GPU).2. Use cloud computing service such as vast.ai. Some trust is required, but usually is cheaper for short term usage.3. Ask for help reputable from service. Few member mention https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/, but i never try to use this service.",

You are correct in stopping your friend, as there are many scammers around.walletrecoveryservices don't look to be scammers, but I have never used them as well.Probably, the best and most secure way is to try to crack it down by yourselves. It might take some time and effort, but if you have a lot of bitcoin, that is probably worth the effort.",

My question is, is there a way to help recover his wallet? please share your thoughts.RegardsI guess you could try to bruteforce the password. Just start by installing the bruteforce software and then try to configure it by entering the data that you have (like approximate length, characters it contains etc). It should be pretty straightforward. If you'll face issues with configuration, just ask here and the community will guide you. Good luck with recovering your funds!",

Here's an calculation example with following detail,8 character length.The password use lower case (a-z) and number (0-9).1 (One) Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti. Speed data is taken from https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/2020-10-06_Multi-GPU_with_vastai/Example_Multi-GPU_with_vastai/#performance.Total unique character used = 26 (lower case)  + 10 (number) = 32 character.Total possible password combination = 32 character ^ 8 character length = 1099511627776 (about 1.09E12).Speed of RTX 2080 Ti = 6.4 kP/s or 6400 password per seconds.1 day in seconds = 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400 seconds.Brute force time (in days) = 1.09E12 / 6400 / 86400 = ~1971 days.",

They may be able to help him recover his funds.Unless I'm mistaken, OP friend uses Bitcoin Knots, which is a fork of Bitcoin Core. It is a decentralized wallet where you manage your own coins, I doubt any support will be able to help them recover his password other than suggesting some methods that have been mentioned above.
