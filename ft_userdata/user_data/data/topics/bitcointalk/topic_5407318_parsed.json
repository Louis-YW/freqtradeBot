What I do see as good is that the OP has bought a domain, but without adding a lot of detailed content and without positioning it in google I see it as difficult for it to have much impact.",

If you posted something like that about a different site, maybe one with a good track record, no one would believe you and you would be asked to follow the appropriate scam format and/or post proof to support your claims. Anyone who has been on Bitcointalk long enough knows about what this particular gambling provider can do. But they spend plenty of money on advertising, and I believe they are luring in many new players who have no idea what is going to happen to them in the future.",
