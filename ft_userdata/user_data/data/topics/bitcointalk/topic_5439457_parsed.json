      "body": "The person only has tether and not bitcoin could be one reason.Maybe they are worried about short-term volatility if they are the ones receiving the coins. Bitcoin was worth $23.000/coin two days ago, but now it's only worth $21.000/coin. That's how a volatile asset behaves. Anyone who received BTC at $23k a few days ago have a 8-9% worse purchasing power right now. At the same time, USDT and USD hasn't changed much.It is true that all centralized stablecoins can be frozen by their issuers no matter what address and wallet they are in. However, that doesn't happen to me and you. I have never heard a story of a guy getting his $200 USDT locked by Tether. It happened recently to addresses connected to the FTX scam exchange, and I am not going to shed one tear for them. I don't think normal holders need to worry about having their stablecoins frozen. Still, it's good to know that option exists.",

Possibly he is worried tha volatility of the bitcoin. Example his buying a property and if he bought it using it, possibly the value would decrease, and if you bought it using tether, its still the same with the curtent value, yes thats normal and it can be considered like normal. Thats what usually the observation of some wishes to use a fixed value in currency than volatile asset.",

Price stability, at least that's what Tether promises. You pay/receive $100 in USDT, that would stay $100 for all eternity.Unlike paying someone with $100 worth of BTC, if the price of BTC skyrockets, you'd regret letting go of that $100 worth of BTC that could've been now $200 worth. And if you're on the receiving end, if BTC price goes down, your $100 worth of BTC might tank to just $50 worth. Though none of this would matter if you're a Bitcoin maximalist.",

Why should your fund got frozen with making payments in bitcoin when you're not sending on a wrong adreess or double spending, the only reason i cannsee to having this kind of preference for tether instead of bitcoin is when what you have is tether and you wouldn't want to have a drop in your balance to affect the rate you're sending due to transaction charges, so most people only prefer one coin against the other because of their charges fee when sending or converting them.",

The beautiful people from Binance charge you $2.60 for the same action.  Binance and other centralized exchanges always do batch payments for their user withdrawals but they always charge same separated withdrawal fee on every user. By that I mean centralized exchanges earn a lot from processing withdrawals for their customers.Old story. Exchanges get profits from users' withdrawal fees.I see it unfair because I consider they already charge fees on tradings (taker, maker fees) and it does not makes sense to charge withdrawal fees because they need to secure their wallets (hot and cold), security, staffs, tools for those things. If they have a business, build an exchange, people join to use their service and pay fees for the service. Double charging many types of fee is unfair for customers.",

I don't disagree, but if you think like that, you will always find reasons why not to spend your bitcoins. The price is too low now, and I am sure it will be $30k soon. When it's $30k, it's still too low because it might go to $100k.

Whether you have tether or Bitcoin your assets can still be frozen especially when you save your coins on exchnages.Speaking about the volatility of bitcoin, that is why people love to transact in tether and other stable coins than btc.When btc slumps, it will still rise in the future, but as a business man, you may be on the negative lane when the money is needed by you and you will have any other choice than to sell at loss.",

The fees may be lower compared to banks, may be higher in the case of Ethereum which tends to have fee spikes. So you could say that USDT is a middleground between Bitcoin and banks.

It's only natural to send tether when that's what you only have. It is not possible to send Bitcoin when you don't have any Bitcoin at all. Bitcoin is indeed decentralized which means no person behind Bitcoin that is running and every person who runs a node will be a server if that's easy enough for you to understand. Let's say, I want to pay you tether but I don't have tether so I will pay using Bitcoin. The only thing that can frozen your Bitcoin funds is when you store it in a platform that is not decentralized like an exchange site.",

If you are not aware of that, Bitcoin mempool is no longer empty since Ordinals are congesting low mining fee transactions, and the mempool will certainly not be empty anymore unless Ordinals die unfortunately. https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,4d,weightLast time I sent USDTs on Tron blockchain it was 10 days ago with Trust Wallet, and I've paid 26.3TRX/$1.68 according to Trust Wallet. Currently from what I see on a Tron blockchain explorer it still costs 26 TRX on average to send USDT TRC20 while TRX costs $0.065 today. So it costs $1.7 on average at the current price to send them, it's certainly lower than the price you would need to pay to send a Bitcoin transaction on chain at the same speed today, that is to say a tx to be mined into the very next block.https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t",

Not having to worry about your bitcoin being frozen, a frozen account on a centralised exchanges as is tradition or customary to centralised systems while carrying out some sort of investigation is actually your whole coins be it bitcoin and what have you has been successfully frozen. Issuers are one thin and an advantage for bitcoin especially when having it deposited in a wallet.One of the main reason why I feel has been the reason why people prefer being paid in Tether stablecoins and some other altcoins of value out there is the issue of fee and the time it takes to process.
