  "content": "Yesterday, in several legs, the Bitcoin price dropped from around 18.500 down to 15.600 $, marking a new low for this bear market.I call this the most stupid dip in Bitcoin's history (or at least one of the most stupid ones, there may have been others), because the event that triggered it was actually positive.Basically the price dipped because Binance decided not to buy the struggling FTX exchange.From the point of view of the \"crypto industry\", this may have been a negative event. Also, from the point of view of the FTX users. But we, the Bitcoin community, in reality were lucky with that outcome.If Binance bought FTX, it would have become an enormous, almost monopoly-like, dominant exchange player. Binance would have become the new MtGox. And we all know what's wrong with that. They become single points of failure, and if they fail, then the ecosystem suffers much worse than a day the price tanked 15%.This is also a good day to remind all Bitcoin users: Never park your coins on exchanges. Use them to buy and sell, and then withdraw them to your own wallet. Not your keys, not your coins! Or, even better, use decentralized exchanges - taking the necessary precautions.",

I also imagine that a lot of exchanges are running at a deficit, because they're pumping money out of the company rather than keeping reserves in case of a sudden price change. Unfortunately, the people operating the businesses seem to want to line their own pockets rather than keep the company stable, and prepared for the worst. I'm not sure if it's because running an exchange attracts certain type of people or not. Anyway, the point being FTX wasn't doing too well obviously, and Binance thought it would be unrecoverable or at the very least too expensive to recover. If they want to expand, they could easily create several sister companies, and operate under a different name on the surface.",

One could even suspect that Binance has triggered the whole drama with that outcome in mind (they get most of the customers without having to pay a penny), although I read today that their accusations to FTX which triggered the \"bank run\" two days ago were probably true. So I'm not so sure there.Anyway I think the whole drama is likely to have a positive consequence which reduces the risk of similar events in the future, which you're mentioning yourself:Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on November 10, 2022, 10:42:52 AM I have reduced my liquidity on exchanges by half. Many will do the same. And I hope many do so. Exchanges should not be used to store coins. It is even good for exchanges if people use them less to \"park\" coins but to \"trade\", because a big amount of \"parked\" coins increases their security/storage costs (cold wallet management etc.) while not increasing their income (mostly from trading and deposit/withdrawal fees).Of course, some trading strategies need a certain amount of \"parked\" coins (arbitrage, daytrading ...) but are they really that important for the Bitcoin ecosystem? And high-speed transfers for arbitrage are also possible with Lightning now, although the number of exchanges supporting it is still limited.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on November 10, 2022, 10:42:52 AMIt will take years to recover trust. If binance would help FTX we, as industry, would recover much faster - unless FTX would drag the binance to the bottom with itTrust in whom? The \"crypto industry\"? This is for me the most relevant point. The crypto industry should only require minimal trust, as they're only a gateway between Bitcoin and the \"fiat world\" but not a necessary component of the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Bitcoin was made to minimize trust at all levels of the financial system. I think, as a consequence of all the hacks and bankruptcies, the exchanges must prepare for a scenario where people have less trust in them, and this is good.

It's still in speculation but as of the moment they likely are committed to the community as they gave an update regarding on what coins are in their balance sheet. The fact that FTX rise into the crypto space, it's really hard to imagine, but I guess they managed to have that trust-building mechanism from years they operated. The CEO was sponsoring huge stuffs but we may never know if it all comes from the users fund from the exchange. If this one failed in the course of the week, then I'd say a further capitulation wick is imminent.",

We know that bad news and negative things that happen in crypto can have a big impact on the decline in bitcoin and altcoin prices. So I think the big setback was when cz published on twitter where he was going to sell the Ftt assets he received from ftx for their partners and this is the main problem for investors because they are worried that this round of decline will be worse than the terra luna incident and this  came true yesterday where Btc plummeted to a new low of the year.",

To me crypto is a currency, but also a tradable asset. I can get freedom from that but also have to comply with government regulations.

Many are pissed off at crypto and they are just quitting and getting out. Its not good for adoption.That is true partially. Some will leave. But those who stay, and I think that will be the immense majority, will learn how to \"do crypto right\". As we older folks learned when MtGox collapsed. I had never much money there, but was lucky to withdraw my last few dozens of dollars just before withdraws were cancelled. Now I don't store larger sums anymore at any exchange.But I didn't refer so much to the first dip (22000 -> 18000) which occurred when rumours emerged that FTX was in problems. This dip was understandable and \"rational\", because it showed that at least some entities in the crypto industry sector didn't as well as they admitted (remember that FTX had a contract with a Formula 1 team, other sports teams etc., giving the impression that it was a big, established and trustworthy player).The \"stupid\" part for me was when the price recovered when Binance was about to buy FTX (which would have been very bad for the crypto sector, as I wrote above) and then dipped again to new lows when this acquisition was cancelled.By the way, it's interesting that the price didn't dip even deeper after insolvency was confirmed.
