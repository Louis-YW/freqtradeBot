My avatar is disabled in topics, posts but it still shows at top left corner.It's self-explanatory, it only works in topic threads since its the main purpose of the forum — to discuss. Don't visit user profiles then.Quote from: dzungmobile on July 28, 2023, 03:07:24 AMCould it be done with a SMF patch?As this were discussed too many times this suggestions were suggested so many times as well. Actually, this current SMF version cannot be upgraded to the latest one because this forum software is customized for the forum's needs, like trust feedback, merits, etc. But most of this suggestions (i guess) can be implemented on the forum software that is under development for many years now.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5461107.0",

But the question is when will this development end? Since my registration in the forum, I have been hearing about the new version of the forum, but so far nothing!!!Sorry that my question is off topic, but I am curious to know that because many of the problems that are raised in the Meta section can be solved quite easily in the new version, but unfortunately there is no news.",

I also have a similar habit of not ignoring any user because I don't really care about the ones who often do shit-posting or use bad words in conversations because in life if we have to face such people then why not on this forum? As far as I know that we often try to ignore the users whom we don't trust or who can cause some problems for us. I would rather not reply to the ones who do shit-posts rather than ignoring them because it's not necessary to ignore all those whom you don't like.Now back to the OP, I don't think that new patch would solve that issue, and it isn't a bad thing to view Avatar and personal text of the ignored users because the Avatar and personal text doesn't really matter a lot when you're not reading a reply done by the users that you added in your ignore list.",

The forum software we’re using (SMF) doesn’t have a code to check if a quote was made by a user you have blocked. Yes, you could say it’s a design flaw, since the SMF developers could have thought about that.I would love to try writing a script for that, but I’m traveling and don’t have a laptop with me… maybe when I eventually go back home.",

My concern is that if the quote in question is not done by the said user who is ignored but by another user who is not on the ignored list then the user can read the quote and forget about that of the ignored user, or instead if another code should be written to fix this then the user should see the quote and that of the ignored user becomes blocked or invisible. And I was thinking what if the quoter has an information a wider audience needs to see and since he is quoting a user who is on some other users ignore list the quote will not be displayed especially if someone else didn't quote the useful information.",
