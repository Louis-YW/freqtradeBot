For Example, Cryptotalk, Altcointalk, Bitcoingarden etc Forum. Out of the three you highlighted, I know of and have visited two, including other cryptocurrency related platforms, and I find Bitcointalk to be the most original - it was after all created by Satoshi, giving it a higher level of credibility.The forum is also more community oriented, and I find discussion here to be of a higher quality.Asking this question here would get you answers from bitcointalk users and would not create a proper analysis. There very well might be users on those platforms who prefer it for one reason or the other.",

      "body": "I recall taking a look at some other crypto forums some years ago, after somebody suggested a bunch of sites on a given list, only to find, as I expected, that they were rather behind in terms of activity and content:Quote from: DdmrDdmr on March 21, 2019, 10:24:59 AMI really canâ€™t be bothered with other Crypto Forums unless a pretty good reason crops up to ponder them over Bitcointalk. Even so, Iâ€™ve taken a quick glimpse at the list (so my first impressions may be wrong):Bitalk.orgÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -> Seems to be Russian only.Bitcoin.comÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -> Not too active (not bad UI).litecointalk.ioÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -> Not really interested in a Litecoin specific forum + rather inactive.cryptocurrencytalk.comÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â -> Rather innactive on substantial threads (like the video section).bitcoingarden.org/forum/Â  Â  Â  -> Very similar UI (SMF). Structure a bit weird, and 24K members only.bitcoinforum.comÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â -> Also very similar UI (SMF). Not very active, and just under 18K members only.allcryptotalk.comÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -> Not many boards not activity.cryptorum.com/forums/Â  Â  Â  Â  -> Very weak in terms of boards and content.talk.peercoin.netÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -> Specific to peercoinmastersofcrypto.com/forum/ -> I like the guides .. but nothing else (+ barely any activity).So, in summary, none of the above come even close to Bitcointalk neither in terms of content nor, very likely, prestige and history of its members.I havenâ€™t bothered to look at any alternatives since then besides Cryptotalk, due to the noise it made at the time of being launched, and only to confirm that the debate there was seemingly very unsubstantial and spammy as hell.I do browse another local forum or two rather sporadically to contrast local news related to regulations and such, but not much else. Bitcointalk should cover peopleâ€™s needs for information and interactivity on Bitcoin, andÂ  there doesnâ€™t seem to be a better alternative (although Reddit could be a complement to ponder).",

      "body": "I can't speak for other people why they choose this particular forum, but I can say what exactly I like here:1. Lively and active community.There will always be people who report on changes in the crypto world and beyond. Forum participants will immediately join the discussion of these topics, which allows you to get different points of view on the same situations. The more opinions we take into account, the more objectively we can get an idea of what happened.2. Knowledge base.Discussion of technical (and not only) questions allows readers to use this forum as a place where you can find a lot of answers. Information is constantly being accumulated and added to, which makes this information base in a sense evolving. 3. Historical component.All the same, Bitcoin and Crypto Era began with this forum and bitcointalk is of great importance in the development of thecrypto community and bitcoin. A lot of important events happened or began here and it's nice to realize belonging to this community, albeit on a modest scale.Â 4. Events and competitions.If the community is active, then various contests will not be rare, as you can see for yourself. Starting from the art conquesst and ending with the culinary contest, like pizza-day contest. There is a wide variety of them.5. Signature and bounty campaigns. It would be hypocritical not to mention it. It can be considered a nice bonus to be able to participate in this campaigns.In one form or another, some of the items on this list are in other forums, but I think they are far behind the bitcointalk. And if compared with the forums indicated by OP, then for the most part they turned out to be \"half-dead\" (almost inactive), in my opinion, when I looked at them.",
