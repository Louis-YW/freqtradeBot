Sometimes it just seems too easy, like the evil is what usually blindfolds them from doing what they could have done to keep the coin's anonymity, but there are still a few stolen funds in crypto that have to be traced back to the criminals.",

I do not saw the ponzi scheme as bitcoin ponzi scheme. I saw it as cryptocurrency ponzi scheme. The coins the scammer used is not talked about on the news. Crypto can become traceable from mistakes. See monero transaction traced by Finnish authorities: https://cointelegraph.com/news/finnish-authorities-traced-monero-vastaamo-hackMonero transaction can not be traced but likely the scammer made mistake and he was traced. If the money is not huge, the hacker and scammer do get away with it. If it is bitcoin, mixers can be used. But know that humans are prone to mistakes that can let their anonymity to be leaked.",

There's a possibility of moving the coins through a CEX and convert to a stable coin which is freezable. The government is fully against mixers and of the criminals go DEX, they could also lose what they stole. There are no much exit route for criminals.",

Some Thieves too are so dumb that they could still get caught. @OP, what you must know is that their are different kinds of Thieves. Some Thieves or Scammers are highly educated. Their educational proficiency makes them so smart that they can pull any stunt and steal huge amount of money from different victims. After they have done so, they can go undercover for some months or even years, and while they are undercover, they could be living their normal lifestyle until they are convinced that the case of their theft has yet been dropped by the investigation agency, due to no very good trace after years of investigation. Scammers will continue to thief because it has become a profession for them, probably because they feel that is the only way they can get huge amount of money without legally working to earn such money. They have lost their conscience and moral, so it doesn't really concern them, what ever consequences they face in their dirty job.",

Stealing millions in crypto is not a proof of skill because people so easily invest in anything that promises high returns.There will never be valid statistics about scammers, thieves who get away will not be published, even those that are not detected as theft are still many. As @franky1 said, each thief takes a small portion of property from many people. What is impossible to happen is that the victims will find it difficult to form an alliance and report it to the police. The chance of this happening is almost close to 0%. This kind of fraud often uses cryptocurrency and BTC cover as its attraction.There are also scammers that are not even detected by CCTV and the police, such as theft within the family area or smaller scope area. This will never be included in the calculation data and makes the accuracy of the data on escaped and caught thieves/scammer no longer valid.Theft of large amounts of BTC will usually look to mixers as the first path they take. And the police will of course not remain silent when these large funds start to move, whether to mixers or other services.",

Another reason that I can think of is that there's a public ledger and we know where the money goes there no matter how much you want to mix it with bitcoin mixers, the computer forensics have a way of knowing, they just take their sweet time doing it or it takes a long time. Third reason is that there's a company that's paying top dollar for the best computer forensics and investigators out there to recover those bitcoins so that top dollar people can't afford to mess things up because they know that the pay behind it is big and they've got a reputation that can't afford to be tainted by some computer whiz that's good at computers.",
