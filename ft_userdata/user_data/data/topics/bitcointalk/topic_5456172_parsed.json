However it's hard to tell. You have posted a bet slip and asking to find the website. It does not look to me the regular betting platform I gambled recently. Some of them are sportsbet.io, stake.com, MegaPari.comWhere did you find the image?Next time you can try Stake.com, Duelbits.com, sportsbet.io. As far as I am familiar with them, they offer almost possible all type of markets. MegaPari.com have some pre-setup for accumulators, you can try them too.",

Cause if he will tell this next bets he will get harder to stake ( lower limits , faster odds fall down and etc. ) I would look for sites that provide odds for this series of events (there are aggregators that allow you to see the variations of any odds/any market) and from there I would decide where to play.I don't think it's an exclusive odds/combo of this bookmaker, surely there will be other providers that allow this type of bets.In general there are always several bookmakers that allow the same bet (exotic markets/events are created most often by well known sites, so this is not the case...)",

Just going from memory.Well, same thing I was going to guess - FortuneJack, but same as you, I can't remember when last I played there, and I am not also sure the shot really from Fortunejack, and also more confusing is the fact that the shot looks like it was taken in a black and white colored device, I might be wrong though, or maybe my eyes deceiving me..I think rightly guessing which casino this is would be best done by those who are proactively gambling/betting on multiple casinos progressively, if there be any of such user on this board, he or she can attempt guessing.",

OP is simply asking about which bookie to choose, probably because they just saw a bet slip for an event they are interested in. Let's not speculate too much. However, I would advise OP to ask the poster of the bet slip directly; it would be easier for us here.",
