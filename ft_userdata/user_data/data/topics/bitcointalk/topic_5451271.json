I really dont know, if this is true because i just couldnt get enough information about this coin from google search engines.I also asked AI but it seemed that this coin is no where to be found. the writerMartin Reid claims that this coins shares same futures as bitcoin, representing a new era of cryptocurrency and COULD EVENTUALLY REPLACE BITCOIN AS A DOMINANT CRYPTOCURRENCY. i really dont know how they came up with this idea. please does anyone have an idea of what this is all about? i would be glad if someone helped me understand betterhere is a link to the article published on March 28 2023https://futureincrypto.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-marius-the-rise-of-cryptocurrency/",

      "body": "Without going into the article link, I can recall reading through this kind of information from either Telegram or one of my social media pages, where the promoter was talking about a coin that he thinks we do far better than Bitcoin because it was directly created to correct the unidentifiable errors of Bitcoin such as transaction speed (which any new project wants to boast about) based on the larger capacity to process some larger blocks than Bitcoin. But I don't think this was actually achieved. I mean, if not for this thread, I think it's been over 2 years now since the last hard of it, and I think it was some form of project that someone somewhere wanted to develop but didn't get enough attention as was expected. If not, they could have at least created a coin even if it's not listed or trading anywhere again. I just searched through most market price trackers, and it seems none has recorded the listing of the BITCOINMARIUS, It's advisable to pay less attention to some trends and information you read online because most of them can be misleading sometimes, which can lead someone to invest in unknown coins that might never be listed in any open market.",

      "body": "I read about that fork but I don't think that anyone have found that useful. Even in 2023 no body is investing in that thing and since 2017 the mention of the fork has been very limited. However, the idea of the developers wasn't bad in its first place, but these days things mainly depend on adoption and in that area there wasn't any good response given to that thing.I tried to find an exchange that might have listed that thing but unfortunately it isn't listed on any known exchanges till this day. I think it was just shot in the air rather than having its place in crypto ecosystem. I even tried coinmarketcap but unfortunately I haven't found it there as well. Even by conducting a defined and text quoted search on Google I haven't found anything related to that Bitcoin Marius thing.",

Sure, Martin Reid spouts off some grandiose claims about its shot at dethroning Bitcoin, but where's the beef? In fact, my mad sleuthing skills on CoinDesk and CoinTelegraph turned up zilch for this mysterious \"BitcoinMarius.\" Smells like a slick marketing ruse to lure in the big bucks, if you ask me.Plus, even if this coin ain't a total ghost, the odds of it toppling the mighty Bitcoin? Slim to none, my friend. Bitcoin's the OG, with a solid rep and a growth chart that puts a smile on any investor's face. There might be other shiny coins out there, but don't go diving in without doing your homework. Remember, folks, \"if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\" Stick with Bitcoin â€“ it's the cryptocurrency world's wingman you can count on.",

As there's no more discussion about this shitcoin, it can be said it's just a scam project. Similar like other Bitcoin fork use Bitcoin name in their own fake Bitcoin.If the coin created with a same purpose or future like Bitcoin, why you need to create another one?",

It really funny to say that it has same features like Bitcoin, and it has been existing since 2017 but know much people are talking about it and it already more than 5years in existence. I believe it is shitcoin and way to compare it with Bitcoin because I never think it may have features like Bitcoin.",

There simply is no reason to make this statement other than to scam people. When Bitcoin was created it was not introduced as something that can replace the banking system or VISA, PayPal, etc. It offered some features that didn't exist anywhere else and solved a real problem which is why it continues growing.Besides when a shitcoin is a copy of bitcoin and has its features, it can not compete with bitcoin or \"replace\" it LOL.",

I mean everyone can claim that there project is the next big thing or even that it will replace bitcoin as the leading project in the crypto space. Those are just words and everyone can write them down. If you give me 10 minutes of time i can also write an article about a new crypto project, that is better than any existing one out there.Also i have not found any exchange or something were Bitcoin Marius would be listed even though the article says it can be bought on exchanges. So i would guess this is just another Bitcoin fork that is either already dead again or never really became alive. Just stay away from it.",

This is probably enough to no longer trust what is written.It can be concluded that once upon a time a blogger dreamed of creating his own coin and still cannot stop blogging, presenting himself as a predictor of Bitcoin behavior.OP, if you're a fan of blogs, read straight on. https://bitcoinmarius.blogspot.com/",

I remember that in that year there were too many projects that said they were the best projects from Bitcoin, Ethereum, or others, but where were the majority of all these projects? rubbish bin. Everything they say is just bullshit. They sold people dreams and ideas just to profit from the crypto trend which at that time was increasing very significantly. So you don't need to waste your time to find out more about this project because it has definitely been abandoned by its developers for a long time",

However it was failed, after the next 6 years and still counting it looks like ETH wouldn't ever overtake BTC because ETH always follow BTC price and can't become an independent token.",

Additionally, there have been Bitcoin hard forks that were once in the top 10 on CoinMarketCap but have since dropped out of the top 200. The historical record suggests that this new idea may not have a promising future, and it may struggle to gain traction, let alone thrive. However, it's important to keep an open mind in this space, while also being mindful of managing risks appropriately",
