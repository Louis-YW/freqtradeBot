  "content": "Hal, or the Bitcoin icon as we all know him, made significant contributions to the Bitcoin community and is regarded as Satoshi by some Bitcoiners due to his involvement in Bitcoin development. He was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, fought it, and died in 2014. To honor one of the most valuable bitcoin assets, Fran Finney, the wife of Hal Finneey, launched a campaign called \"RUNNING BITCOIN,\" which was a half marathon event to raise funds for ALS research. ENDEDThat being said, I'm not sure how many Bitcointalk members participated in the event; I did (you can see me in the gallery), and since I didn't see any posts about it, I thought it would be best to bring it up and thank those who did.  Hal legacy will live for ever.RUNNING BITCOIN GALLERY1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 21. 22. If you participated drop your pics i will add to the gallery.",

Don't worry about my privacy. I'm sure no one can tell who I am in those pictures, and yes, you are correct, anyone can send me pictures via PM (covering their faces) and I will upload them here; it was a fun experience.",

So it's more like a courtroom, and obviously has nothing to do with Hal's reputation (which is untouchable at this point).I never thought of moving the greatest HAL FINNEY reputation to that courthall; I intended it to be on the Meta, but the admin said no, so he moved it here. The reputation board is now more of a query server where all the arguments over who deserves who or who cares about who take place.Quote from: dzungmobile on March 14, 2023, 07:29:09 AMExcuse me!I am a runner too and I saw a picture with a Garmin watch and  a screen with Bitcoin Runners text.

All for FinneyHal Finney was fortunate to have a good woman as a wife. Fran was an uncommon wife that stood for Hai until he died. She took care of him even when his health became very serious making him handicapped in some areas. She still believes that one day through scientific advancement he can come back to life that's why his body went through a state of cryonic freezing. Fran keeps on immobilizing her late husband with these events. I wish more of such fundraising events will be organized to promote research in other areas of health concern. Fran keeps reminding me that the world's standard of judging beauty is flawed. Good character and not physical appearance is true beauty.",

Aside from myself and a few of my colleagues, I don't believe any other active forum member participated in the challenge or donated; it's been almost 2 weeks since I requested pictures (face covered) of those who participated so I could add them to the op, but none have been received. Perhaps some chose to remain anonymous for personal reasons.",
