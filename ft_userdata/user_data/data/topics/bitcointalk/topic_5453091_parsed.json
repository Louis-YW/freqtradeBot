It won't happen soon and personally, there is no single solution like increase block size will solve it or reduce block time will solve it.Ethereum has shorter block time but fails to solve its expensive transaction fee.In the meantime, education would be helpful to teach people about transaction fee, mempool, how to look at mempool and broadcast their transaction with good fee rate. When they are more educated, they will less join fee race unnecessary.",

More people need to mine? Bigger blocks? Blocks generated more often?We need some kind of fully decentralized Side-chains or Multi-Chain auxiliary Network with token/coin that mimics Bitcoin price. The Network has to be compatible/interoperable with the Bitcoin System and built according to Bitcoin ideals... Building according to Bitcoin ideals would be like building in a rock, this should keep things as secure as the Bitcoin Network itself.  People could then move their heavy transactions to the Multi-chain Network, lock their bitcioins in multisig accounts or smart-contracts to access equivalent amount of tokens to do all kinds of possible transactions with one another. Once they are done,  their final Bitcoin balances (probably calculated by the smart-contracts that contain their locked bitcoins) are sent to their Bitcoin addresses",

It is already helping people to get their bitcoins transferred in relatively cheaper cost2. Kick out of Ordinals/BRC-20 tokens from the network completely. The second option may not be feasible for now. So it's a great time to adopt lightening network if you haven't done already.",

More people need to mine? Bigger blocks? Blocks generated more often?As far as I know Lightning Network is currently considered a potential solution to address high fees on the Bitcoin network. It allows for instant transactions between parties but it relies on trust in the participants involved. Users may choose to open their own Lightning channel but this requires funds and I don't think it's easy to set up. In other ways, one can wait for network congestion to subside or till the transactions become with lower fees. The decision depends on timing and urgency. Personally, I don't worry too much about it unless I'm in an urgent situation and need to send Bitcoin quickly in which case I may opt for higher fees due to limited alternatives.",

Sooner or later though, bitcoin holders are going to sell and make some profit, and if you are willing to pay high fees, then this spammer has won.So it's either miners not picking up their ordinals who are spamming the network or clogging it, or we might have to do a soft fork, or fix the bug that this so called BRC-20 are exploiting on taproot.",

Some of these forks has lead to the creation of bitcoin XT and bitcoin cash with the former no longer in use and the latter still overshadow by bitcoin. The reason for lack of consensus on the increase of block size is the fact that there wouldn’t be much decentralization in terms of mining. As the block size increases then there will be need for more specialized mining tools which we know is expensive. With mining equipment relatively expensive then it would be hard have single node owners but rather group nodes which will lead to centralization of the network. Right now the solution is the SEGWIT solution",
