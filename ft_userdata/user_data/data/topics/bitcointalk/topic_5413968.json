You have a steel balls on believing that Canelo will still win to GGG via decision. it was predictable both of great chin and never got ko. canelo is better and beat him a few years ago.  GGG is now 40 years old. I was certain 100% that he would beat him by decision. many of the boxing/mma matches are predictable like this one.",

I think op is still over joyous about his winning which is preferably good and I think it shouldn't have such an heading that make it looks like he has some problems with the casino. Some persons are thinking maybe op will come back to bring something like gambling strategy that will be used to lure gamblers because of this results. It will not be advisable if that happens so op need to be aware what everyone thinks about him because this is not the first time we are seeing this kind of attempt from new users here claiming of making consistent profits daily.",

To say that you beat the casino you must with the max pay out multiple times and the be able to withdrawal.To beat a casino you need to make the casino lose big, those $300 not even represent the 1% of the bankroll, so, your win didn't hurt them at all, but again, it was a nice win and for sure you are happy as hell for it. And the bet you win wasn't even with the casino games, so, you only got lucky on a sports match, but remember, luck comes and luck goes, let's hope your good streak stay for your next bets.",
