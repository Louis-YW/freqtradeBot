      "body": "Probably, financial illiteracy prevents friends and colleagues from investing in bitcoin. That is, people don't want to see / try alternative directions, because the traditional financial system seems familiar and reliable to them. Of course, we will agree with the first one, because nobody don’t want to go beyond the limits of comfort, while with regard to the second, many here will categorically disagree.My barrier was not understanding the basic principles of the bitcoin and not knowing how to interact with it. That is, where and how to buy, how to make transactions and where to store. All this can be learned, you just need to try it once and see for yourself how it works. If I had not been too lazy to find answers right away, then my acquaintance with BTC would have taken place earlier, when it was much cheaper.",

I did not believe in Bitcoin; it was just at the time when Liberty Reserve ceased to exist that there were many accusations against this digital money, and I thought that everything new that was created at that time would have exactly the same short lifespan.I moved in very narrow circles and was too lazy to step out of my comfort zone to learn more about Bitcoin, and now, of course, I really regret it.As for further trials and attempts to invest in Bitcoin, I have always been wrong about the price. As soon as I had free money when I could invest, the price rose, and buying a small amount, I always sold on the dip.But I got a good experience, and this is much more important than the loss of not quite a lot of money.",

Just with the help of my friends who are more knowledgeable, I was able to explore and learn until I become the one that influences others. Based on my experience introducing it to others, it's normal to be reluctant and afraid since you don't know anything. But since my friends are aware that I'm earning through crypto and they trust me, they also have the urge to learn as well. Sometimes, they're the one who will come to me and would ask me to teach them. The barrier that I could think of when I was starting and when my other friends are starting is the limited amount of money to invest and the fear of losing it, cause who would want to experience losing during your first try or when you're just starting?",

Did you have any barriers when you first started?Few years back then, my fear was that I could lose all of the money if I will invest it since I only had very little knowledge about crypto. I believe that it nature to us of not investing to things we do not know about.However, back then my first investment was to shitcoins. I don't have any idea on how can I know of potential scam projects and sh*tcoins. To give you a brief idea, there was some times back then that I really gotten into no-utility coins and lose some of my earned money from doing certain jobs in crypto space. It was a good lesson though, so I'm fine that I had experienced that. For our friends or anyone, I think they also are afraid of starting to invest in crypto since it is a gray area to them. Some other factors might be related to the fund security, and the volatility risk of cryptocurrency. People think that it can be hacked. Also, as we know it, cryptocurrencies are real volatile assets. But in the case of Bitcoin, I believe that later on, it'll be less volatile.",

Until they slowly loosened up after getting the general advice in this space, I said that there was no guarantee that they would get the same thing as I did. Even if they will, it will not be instantaneous because it has taken me several years and experienced various risks to reach this point.",

Bitcoin is illegal in my country so transactions are very confidential. Then came the second fear when I started investing. After investing in the first stage, it seemed that this cryptocurrency site was doomed. It was a new situation to be afraid of everything here but now I am definitely enjoying and investing my time here. No more fear works in my mind. Even so, I'm still working somewhat undercover here.

I live in an environment where people are naturally skeptical of anything as a result of the fear of falling for a scam. So naturally, they want to see someone else succeed at an investment before they go ahead to put money in it. This is the story with Bitcoin investment. It was very difficult at first to convince anyone to invest in Bitcoin, but as soon as I bought some items purely from the profits I took from Bitcoin, boom, they became convinced and interested. So they knew that they could both make some money by investing in Bitcoin and also be sure that they are on the right side of history.QuoteDid you have any barriers when you first started?For me, the only barrier I had when I started investing in Bitcoin was money, aside that nothing else mattered.",

I grew last the fear of failing and moved to fear of people's  opinion if things don't work the way I planned.I wouldn't have to speak  for others but I would say that one of the reasons my family and close ones haven't invested in crypto  directly through my preaching is simply  because of over familiarity and they don't think I'm  qualified  to tell them about it hence they need to see that I'm doing very fine in the industry hence seeing is believing.",

I know it's risky especially when it comes to trading and investing, but that will only change once you understand how the market works from cycle to cycle.If it is about trade and investment, then the main barrier is capital.

Did you have any barriers when you first started?I'm sure all of us must have initially felt fear or doubt when we first considered investing in Bitcoin. I think this is natural considering the unique and complex characteristics of the cryptocurrency market.I myself initially had fear when I got to know bitcoin investment because bitcoin can lose money. This fear of loss made my confidence when I started investing in bitcoin even more doubtful. Apart from that, in my country, investing in bitcoin still has pros and cons in the government and also among the people. But after I learned day by day that bitcoin has grown rapidly and has lasted more than a decade, this is the reason that made me interested in investing in bitcoin and made me even more confident.I think it is because of this Ignorance that we feel fear. The thing is that once I already know about bitcoin investing and I fully understand the concept and technology behind bitcoin, my fears and doubts about bitcoin will disappear. I proved this when I introduced bitcoin to my family, they were immediately interested in investing in bitcoin.In essence, a lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works, its security or how to manage investments in cryptocurrency can affect confidence and fear in starting a bitcoin investment.",

And the other people that I've talked to before, they've said the same thing \"If I've got money, I'll buy Bitcoin\". That's what I do hear a lot every time the price of Bitcoin goes high. They do recognize the opportunity that has been missing them but they don't do actions on it because they're short on money. The volatility of Bitcoin isn't scary at all, it's even lovely to see that there's such an asset like this that we'll enjoy even for the short run.",

Some of my friends are bit hesitant about that and obviously due to lack of knowledge about it. But I did introduced to them properly and some believed me. But due to experiece on bear market many have been discouraged and felt neglected about it. Though Im still incline to some of them.",

I'm not really gonna say Bitcoin is that new to everyone but I think one-a-half of the percentage of peeps see the orientation as \"new to them\".When you have alot of orientations on what you're joining, you'll be very confident to the point that there's no reason to be inquisitive about the durability of this whole cryptography. That's why you would normally them neigh-sayers proposing that - \"a learned mind is a free mind\" and that's true.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",
