The token that has really impressed me personally is JTO.With the current market condition, I think this is an opportunity for exchanges to leverage and attract new users by dishing out beneficial events to users in order to further encourage mass adoption.

If you see a cryptocurrency total marketcap increases, you must take into account contributions from new cryptocurrencies. By that I mean the increase of total market cap does not come from increase of previous cryptocurrencies. If you think so and don't count new cryptocurrencies and their market cap, you will have an inaccurate thinking about the market.",

If it is the latter, I second the opinion that they always do that regardless of the market condition. Even Binance is doing that with different programs such as their latest raffle airdrop. My local exchanges also regularly do promotions even though the benefit for new users is probably not that great in the long term.If it is about more users using crypto, I honestly doubt they care about it that much. This does not mean they won't advertise to the public, but it won't be their priority at all. Especially if the number of regular visits or registered users on their platform is still as high as ever. CMIIW.",

I don't worry too much about SEC.'s decisions.Yes, I mostly agree with you over a 0.5-1.5 year term. As historically, the halving has caused positive upside for Bitcoin in the months after the halving has occurred. However, I'm talking about before April, we still have 4 months left. What everyone forgets is that while whales and institutions move the market, they aren't able to just market sell or market buy the amount that they would like to. They do it over longer periods, building orders over time on either end, or causing supply/demand through external means.Let's say hypothetically that institutions were aware of their plan to submit ETF applications at the start of this year at 15k. Don't you think that they would accumulate, in lead up to their news? Then, further capitalize from the gains made from their news and bullishness over the last 6 months following initial news?Now from here, do you think they will just enjoy the ride upward? Or, create some orders for profit?No, now the difficult us offloading what has been accumulated and rebuying cheaper.The best way to do that is to let retail buyers buy into sell orders after the ETF news, taking profit at the highest possible prices from inexperienced market buyers...then, dump it and reaccumulate as these inexperienced investors sell.Not to mention, imagine all of those who have long positions for exchanges to liquidate...and the short opportunity available as well, for those in the know.All theoretical but it\"s what people least expect, and generally that's how I see things go in this market. Nothing is as straightforward as just up.",

Of course some exchanges have been doing really well in that regard.The main source of income for exchanges is trading fees. The more trading that takes place, the higher the income ... and trades mainly take place in market situations that are characterized by euphoria, i.e. bull markets. An exchange can of course open up other areas of activity, such as traditional share trading, but the situation is very similar there too - and you are also competing with traditional banks. Even very large exchanges such as Kraken and Binance have seen that they had to reduce staff (sometimes drastically) during the bearish phase in 2022. Smaller exchanges such as Bitpanda were just as affected.",

Even Pancakeswap which used BSC primarily did millions per hour on a almost dead utility chain just from events.Bull is easy, the test is bear. Binance was smart. Make the money and hype during the bull, quietly expand n the bear and \"buidl\" and wait for others to collapse and grow your market share.Don't think Bitget won't get in trouble though, it's always when not if, when you're dealing with regulators.",

Do you share the same sentiment or you have divergent opinion? Let's discuss. An exchange cannot attract new users if it does not have a good reputation because people will be much more selective in choosing an exchange for their trading activities. Moreover, in recent years we have seen how exchanges have had problems resulting in closures and the tendency for people to choose exchanges will definitely be more careful. There are many exchanges that are starting to be developed but not many people use them for the long term and even though they provide useful events for users, they still register only to take advantage in the short term. The definition of mass adoption that I know involves many people and what do you think about this. Market trends may attract new people to get involved, but I doubt people will choose an exchange that doesn't have a good reputation.",

People in the crypto space needs their services for convenient and reliable means of crypto transactions, and also to reduce the chances of being scammed in two party p2p. If exchanges wants to leverage on the current market trend to woo more investors because of the build up to bull run, what then happens when Bitcoin price starts to dip and bear run starts to set in? What will happen to the investors that they've wooed in good and profitable time? So I think that they should focus on excellent and reliable services at all times to gain investors trust",
