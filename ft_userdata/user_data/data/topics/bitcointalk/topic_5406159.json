They are not eligible for free bets. If you don't pay before the official game deadline, you are not competing for free bets.We accept new entries until end of month at latest, after that whoever did not pay gets kicked out for good and goes in my personal blackbook.

      "body": "@icopress, Thank you for organizing this fantasy pool and securing a prize pot that is more than decent.I'm curious to see how many people will join and how much interest there is in fantasy sports in this forum.I find FPL and Fantasy Sports in general not to be beginner-friendly, since you always have to be on top of recent events/news and go over a ton of stats before every gw, that's of course if you want to play competitively and win your mini-leagues. My personal goal this year is to get OR 10k or better, i was not that far away last season, just have to clean up a few things.Anyways, i've sent out the entry fee and a pm!",

I get bored easily. ¬†Well, this pool differs from the rest in that it is intended for a narrow circle of people, a pool in which we make joint decisions. So I'll talk to the betting CEO and I think he won't mind adding a couple of extra free bets (but this feature will only work from September).So .. addition to the rules ... whoever scores the most points in a particular round can qualify for a free bet (40$).",

Just to make things 100% clear when you add this info to OP also add something like \"after transfer points deduction\". That is how official site counts points and only right way but there is always somebody who forgets that you have 1 free transfer and every other costs -4 points.",

Don't worry at this stage, you can change players for free until the first match starts. So have fun and try to come up with your team. Then post it here and we will tell you some obvious mistakes you made and there will be quite a lot of them if you never played fantasy.Fantasy is all about players, you don't care about match result as long as your player scores well. For instance Fulham losses the game 8:3 and you are super happy since you have Mitrovic who scored 2 goals and assisted one even though they got destroyed.",
