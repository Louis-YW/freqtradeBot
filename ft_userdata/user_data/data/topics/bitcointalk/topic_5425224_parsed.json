It means that you can mine $VXXL with a miner based on the Scrypt algorithm and/or store your $VXXL on the projects native wallet to mint with staking.The projects first three buildings on/for the project are a nearly anonymously mobile wallet, where you can exchange FIAT, VXXL and stable coins with each other, a stable coin protocol and an unique lending protocol. The first project is nearly done, by creating - next to the web wallet - VXW, VXXL's native mobile wallet (1st version). The 2nd version is coming this month.VXXL wants to provide liquidity for the crypto community through a strong lending system, to provide stable coin assets based on leading FIAT and to build privacy features never seen before.Project name: VXXLMaximal amount of coins: 84.412.531.699 (mined/minted during the next 30 years)Algorithm: ScryptBlock time: 7 seconds per blockHomepage: https://www.vxxl.orgExplorer: https://explorer.vxxl.orgPool set up(?): https://github.com/VXXL-Project/poolListings:- XT.com (VXXL/USDT)Telegram: https://t.me/vxxlmainTwitter: https://twitter.com/biz_VXXLMedium: https://medium.com/@biz1/vxxl-is-fastest-up-to-date-pow-coin-f3e6ff13b4e2Discord: https://discord.gg/4ekJVkVtFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vxxlnetworkThank you very much for your attention!Roland Ionas BialkeEdit: The community pool is unpayed in the moment!",

In the market position now you have to pay for those 700-750 Euro. So where is the problem.

It is about building, solving problems and investing!Edit:And yes, I know that Bitcointalk and Reddit are one of the first stations to announce a new project. But VXXL did it different. So what is the point? What does it matter? VXXL had an official listing and is public for 5 month, yes. What we as a community are looking is programers, who would like built on a blockchain. We are not looking for cheap speculators. Bitcoin was worth \"nothing\" the first years, so I guess VXXL will not be 20.000 USD overnight now. Nobody is promoting that...",

Nobody is promoting that...you have it all upside down, the purpose you post here is to attract more miners, not mined first and tell other people later, that's akin to premine, which is not very popular among miners.every coin can be bitcoin, but first you need to survive and outrun other 20k coins, premine is a no no in this cut throat environment, I suggest you restart the mainnet and put some money in prelaunch marketing.",

      "body": "@ sdspsdsp I got you!Nothing what Kliv73 was talking was happening. There was NO pre-minting or exclusive pre-mining! There were a lot of other platforms, including common trading platforms and agregators, where the start and the early ongoing of the project was published. So the posting before me was and is pointless.And of course we* do further postings (on the same and other platforms - like this one here) to get further developers, miners and users. To invest(!), built and mine on our chain. (And not to speculate on the market position (price)!)And no,first, I do not want to atract miners who want to speculate on VXXL. I do want to atract miners, who are carring for solving real world problems. Yes, a llttle bit profit is good for everyone - but if somebody want to just mine to make fast money, please stay away!*And you get it wrong by thinking I am a part of a \"team\" or \"the maker\". It is decentral. But yes, there are developers who were the makers and who set up the homepage and the explorer. And are the core team of developers,. But I am not. I am community, and I like to invest in early stage POW coins and payment experiments. --Edit: A huge problem in the crypto currency ecosystem is, that two of three leading liquidity infecting coins were/are ponzi frauds: Terra Luna and USDT. And they were/will crashing. So what is a big deal is to bring a stabile coin that is not a fraud. Why not on VXXL?",
