  "content": "The Bitcoin academy, which is the brain child of Twitter and Cash App founder, Jack Dorsey and world renowned musician, Jay-Z also known as Shawn Carter was launched in 2022 with the aim of eliminating illiteracy, empowering the public with knowledge of Bitcoin and also the benefits one can get when it's applied financially.   Jay-Z has decided to take Bitcoin to his hood as he grew up in New York and partnering with Dorsey, they've been able to make residents at the Marcy Houses and this initiative is in conjunction with the @cryptoplug3 and @BlkBTCBillions Dorsey believes this act could inspire people to understand how powerful a financial tool they have in their hands to help them understand financial freedom.. The aim of funding the program is not only to understand or educate them about Bitcoin, but also teach them the importance of relating it to their economy. This initiative which started in June 22, 2022 was to run for at least three months to end on Sept 7th but with promises to spread to other parts of the neighborhood as it was initially exclusive to residents of the Marcy Houses complex. And to cap it off, the educational initiative ended with a gift of $1000 in Bitcoin to the participants and these where received through the Cash App and muun wallet. Way to go, Jay and Jack!!More details about it here. https://www.businessinsider.com/jay-z-jack-dorsey-bitcoin-academy-marcy-houses-2022-9?amp",

      "body": "Absolutely great initiative, it is important to spread the word of btc to as many people as possible, especially the usability aspect of btc not just the price speculative part.It is important to try change the narrative and the mindset of most new comers coming in with the sole purpose of making money within a short period. Btc is more than just an asset to hold for certain period and sell off, the earlier people start getting it that btc is payment option which can serve them well the better and perhaps the less the speculation and volatility. In addition, more btc pioneers should introduce similar initiative to help spread and promote btc far and wide.",

With that in mind, I doubt that it would be anything different, it is actually quite true and reasonable because it is how the money exchanges hand.What I really want to point out that, you could be anywhere in the whole world, and help these people because it is bitcoin, doesn't require you to be in the same nation as them. Most people couldn't send like 5 bucks for example, it is small amount but when you consider 5 million people all sending 5 bucks, that would be a big amount eventually.",

I guess some other prominent names in and around the world will take up similar initiatives to improve the knowledge and build the individual capacity of those living within and outside their immediate community. So many members here have done similar things in the past or present, and again the 1000 dollars in Bitcoin is another way to make the participants get more involved in practical terms. I was wondering if the Academy issues participants and certificates.",
