I think none of us expected such ending especially I never expected to make another huge lose in the business and paying out of my own pocket again after Bitlucy scammed me (Over $6.2K or something, I can not remember exactly). Anyway, it is what it is. You all expected to get paid a total of 0.05836495 BTC from me by the next 7 to 10 days.  Quote from: LoyceV on May 23, 2023, 06:59:50 AMIf the domain was seized, the DNS entries would have been changed. That didn't happen:Code:Domain:             bettercallraul.itStatus:             okSigned:             noCreated:            2023-02-22 04:40:56Last Update:        2023-02-28 01:04:33Expire Date:        2024-02-22Quote from: NotATether on May 23, 2023, 12:39:01 PMAlso, I have noticed evidence of slight photoshopping of the service name text (where it says \"chipmixer and bettercallraul\").In exhibit B, we have the notice by Raul with a stronger white font than the one used in Chipmixer. This font does not match up with the rest of the notice. That must mean some clever swindler must have carefully erased the previous text (this is every easy to do if you've seen my Background Eraser service) and then wrote his own text on top of it. Apparently they did not have the same font installed on their computer as the one used in the notice.You cannot see the difference even in this size. You must download the images and open them at 100% zoom to see the difference. They are both in 720p size.Meanwhile in Exhibit A we see the BetterCallRaul logo plastered on top of the notice, on the left and the right. The only problem is, the swindlers pasted the logo on top of part of the chipmixer logo. You will never see any law enforcement organization make this simple mistake. OOPS!",

Just as hugeblack has said, nobody had come up with anything about them being scammed by the exchange and from investigation, it seems they faked it all themselves. Who knows what really transpired for them to have done such putting the campaign manager in such position of needing to pay for services rendered by signature campaign members.Such experience is not worth it bit of happening to the same person for the second time requiring him to make payment from his own pocket.We just pray they come back to make payment for their debts and clear their name as the case may be.",

Just like the situation of ChipMixer which made many people fear so that they won't be indicted and sought after by FBI.  Let's just wait for few days more, many people are not aware of the situation and I even saw someone still wearing their signature today.",

There’s still some user that buying and selling the tokens without any idea that project is already dead.The telegram chat group of BCR https://t.me/bettercall_raul is already on chaos while the dev is already silent. Probably there’s only few to none investors here in the forum since this project have a very small community even on telegram. Team keeps dumping their bags since this announcement of website seize without any further explanation from their side.",

I felt uncomfortable with this exchange, which I saw for the first time being promoted in a signature campaign; Sad for the people who trusted this scam exchange and used it even though many well-established alternatives in the market are popular and safe. Fortunately, @Rose777 will pay out of his pocket to the participants in the sig campaign for the two weeks they worked to promote this nonsense, this is something to be thanked for being also one of the workers in promoting it, and it is also possible that he also did not get paid for being a bounty manager for the signature campaign, There is no conclusive proof, as @hugeblack mentioned, that the platform is Seized. This is a trick that the scammers use to remove the charges from them.",

Not going to occur if large sums are involved- it will just bring more attention than a simple website wipeout (like now)Not sure what they were dealing with behind the scene but probably it wasn't profitable to run so they decided it was better to shut down abruptly and maybe trap a bit of custom funds (if any?) along with the unpaid signatures. Or all of this so-called business was just a front to attract buyers for their token and it either failed or it was enough to move on?Either way, this just looks like one of the stupidest exit scams I've witnessed around here.",
