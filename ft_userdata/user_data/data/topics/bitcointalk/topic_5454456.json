Yeap, OP also created a topic in the mining section at the same time (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454457.msg62324149#msg62324149)Kano is a well known member of this forum. He is the last one to maintain the code of cgminer (the software which is the most used to mine BTC) and is the owner of a very nice mining pool : https://kano.is/ He was one of the two developers of the ckpool, before he made his own pool following personal differences with ck. He is currently developing firmwares for gekkoscience's ASICs. He's a real icon in the BTC mining community, whether you like him or not, he produces high-quality work and his posts are often very interesting to read. I'd give a lot to have just half his skills as a developer!Quote from: franky1 on May 30, 2023, 07:35:49 AMi know some people try to play around with the nonce range for a few reasonsa. so multiple devices are not bruting the same ranges of the same given blocktemplate header hashb. taking the chance that the solution is found not in the first or last 10%'s of ranges so ignoring them and only bruting the middle 80%but overall these games will not help you compete against the modern asics that are 300% more efficient. ...the r909 is 1.5th for 100wmeaning for 30x r909 you are getting 45TH for 3kwthis is very inefficient because most asics running on bitcoin (that break even/profit) are of 3kw for 150TH+so you are 3x+ inefficient per 100w.. yep 300% less efficient than modern asicsif you are trying to overclock:over clocking it wont make you 3x more efficient to rival/compete. overclocking it would simply overheat the device and kill it sooner meaning you want earn much long term.in short its time to retire the device and get something more efficient..the r909 is using old chips of 2019. (way out of date tech(the s17 range)) Yeap you're right, but people which are using R909 and other Gekkoscience ASICs, are not looking for the maximum efficiency, but for silent ASICs to solo mine with (in general). It is more for home miners / hobby miners than for the professionals/industrial scale miners.Some people like to keep them to have a lottery ticket, even if the luck to find a block is low, and to have some hashrate for a couple of watts, no matter of the efficiency.",

      "body": "Technically the minimum spec of the R909 is at least 1.5TH from at most 100W, but actual performance should be closer to 2TH at around 80 watts.Also, regarding editing the nonce range, that's not readily possible without altering cgminer code. Technically I think you can adjust this by hacking the chip addressing scheme during string initialization, which would adjust the range starting point for each chip, but you'd have to also adjust the work timing calculations to account for shorter cycle times per work unit so there's no duplicates, and I'm not sure but this might also affect the statistics calculations behind the displayed hashrate estimates.",
