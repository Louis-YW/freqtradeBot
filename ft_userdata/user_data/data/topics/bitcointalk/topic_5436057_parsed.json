  "content": "HejOverwelmed by the https://chat.openai.com/ I tested some help for my long time desire to write on the Blockchain, I asked Please give me some directions how  to write \"Hello World\" for ever on the Blockchain using Python.This was the answer:Here is an example of how to use the \"electrum-client\" library to create an OP_RETURN transaction with a text message:from electrum_client import ElectrumClient# Connect to the Electrum serverclient = ElectrumClient('hostname', port=50002, protocol='tcp')# Create the transactiontx = client.blockchain.transaction.create(    inputs=[{'address': 'your_address', 'value': 200000}],    outputs=[{'address': 'destination_address', 'value': 100000}],    op_return_data=b\"Hello, world!\")# Sign the transactiontx = client.blockchain.transaction.sign(tx, privkey='your_private_key')# Broadcast the transactiontx_id = client.blockchain.transaction.broadcast(tx)print(tx_id)My Python and Electrum knowledge is below this but I would like some comments on this.Is the Library goodWhat is the hostnameWhere is the fee......Best regards",

      "body": "Can you use the Electrum GUI to do this instead? It is trivially easy.Simply go to the send tab, and in the \"Pay to\" field you enter OP_RETURN followed by your message in hex. So for your string \"Hello, world!\", your entry would look like this:Code:OP_RETURN 48656C6C6F2C20776F726C6421Then just set the \"Amount\" to 0 and hit pay. You'll get the usual Electrum pop up to choose your fee, etc.",
