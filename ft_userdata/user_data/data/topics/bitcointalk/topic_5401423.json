Personally, I have earned a lot of money by investing in BTC when it crashed due to various reasons now and then since it recovered somehow over time.I have earned decent profits by investing in popular cryptocurrencies like ETH, LTC etc in a similar manner since I was confident that they would bounce back too. However, I always invested only what I was willing to lose.You won't become rich overnight through this strategy. Long-term HODLING is the best approach in this case.",

And no wonder why He is anytime ready to invest into Bitcoin when the price value drop at 20K$ each, probably He knew that the market was very volatile. I remembered when Bitcoin reached for the first time 20k$ during 2017, then dropped at 7000$ when 2020 came up. So, I guess Kiyosaki is right from this things. And I suggest when Bitcoin down to 20K$ that's the time I think to apply investing into Bitcoin anyway then HOLD.",

He recommended gold, silver, bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), and solana (SOL) as investments at the time.https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-plans-to-buy-bitcoin-when-the-bottom-is-in-17k/In this article I don't know why he mention to buy centralized shitcoin while claim bullish about Bitcoin and seems already understand about it. I find like he's still doesn't understand at all and when he read an article wrote a word \"decentralized\" he will define that's coin is actually 100% \"decentralized\". But the fact is ETH and SOL aren't decentralized, but centralized.",

What heis saying is no different to blood on the streets which is true also. $20K is the most bottom for me but if it drops to $17k, its certainly kind of a depressed market once the price stays there for quite awhile. I suspect   if BTC is on this level, we are going to wait for the halving.  Its a long winter market which could even plunge deeper.",

His experience allows him to stay calm and think rationally while other people still panics. Also, he has more money to lose than most of us.His bottom prediction could become true because we're still in the middle of 2022 and almost two years before the next halving.

I think something like a large recession which can drop markets happens every 8 years on average, with smaller corrections of around 10% happening every couple years. Trying to predict such crashes is so hard because the next crash almost never looks like any previous crash, as we saw with Covid and the war in Ukraine. Now we are in an inflationary spiral which might trigger a recession but it could be played out slowly over many years. Trying to time when to go in with all your money is hard and in most will keep a small pot separate while keeping most of their money invested at all times.",

Far from always, the \"fall\" value means that in the future there will be growth and buyers at low prices will bring fabulous profits.  Enron is a prime example of this.As for bitcoin, I think we're going to see a rise and the current (and future, if it happens) fall is a great opportunity to buy this asset. I am not a psychic or a super-investor like Kiyosaki, therefore, I can't know what will happen in the future. My forecast is based only on faith and hope, which in itself can't be a reliable signal for recommendations.",

It's like taking medical advice from a car mechanic.With this article I believe the author is selling Kiyosaki's thought of \"market in a downtrend is the best way to accumulate profit\".  Aside from that being a financial advisor/guru, he has a grasp of what is happening in the world's economy and how the financial system works.   Even though he made money selling books, you should check what kind of book he is selling.  Besides, he can't write any related topics and concept about finance or economy if he is lacking knowledge about it.QuoteRobert Toru Kiyosaki is an American businessman and author. Kiyosaki is the founder of Rich Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, a private financial education company that provides personal finance and business education to people through books and videos.",

The mindset he promotes is very valuable, it gives a new viewpoint to look at things from the eyes of an entrepreneur instead of an employee. The question I always have with Kiyosaki is how much money did he actually make the traditional way, and how much money he made through his books and popularity. He is a big motivational speaker and sells a lot of merchandise for his books. If he only made all his wealth through the rich dad, poor dad brand than I don't know if we should listen to him for investing advice. Nonetheless buying Bitcoins at 17,000 USD is a good idea. I would expect most of us to do the same, if the price ever drops so far. I am still sceptical that the price will drop so low.",
