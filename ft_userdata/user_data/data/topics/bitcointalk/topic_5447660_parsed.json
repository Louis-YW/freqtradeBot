The concept is simple, revolutionise the way real estate development projects in the UK are funded.By harnessing blockchain protocols we allow our web3 community to fund the development of real-world assets all through our self-serve platform; moving away from reliance on traditional institutions, we give the power of lucrative development financing to the people.I know this is a very brief and simple description so if you'd like me to share more details alongside our website and whitepaper feel free to drop a comment below.I would really appreciate it âš¡Thank you in advance for your time",

The concept is simple, revolutionise the way real estate development projects in the UK are funded.Real estate, bitcoin, wealth? Let me guess, will you create a new token for UK or Metaverse?Unfortunately, you will not find someone to fund your idea here, especially when you are giving general information and you do not have an actual project to be evaluated, so it is better to think about something well-defined or look for a developer to formulate your idea for you.",

Feedback from forum users here always has a significant impact on ensuring that your project is satisfactory amongst other projects. It could be positive or negative feedback, but it will help to make a great project. The brief description you provided of the proposed project appears to make sense, and I hope you will be able to secure sufficient resources to make the project a reality.",

I will certainly help to be able to provide suggestions and comments for the projects you are developing. You can include a link and website to your project so I can visit it immediately.",

I also tend to believe you are trying to get a yet-another-token project advertised under the appearance of this kind of questions.If you truly believe in your idea, why don't you try to fund it and develop it, at least until the stage of proof-of-concept? Because if it's that good, I'm sure you'll get proper funding afterwards.",
