  "content": "Everyone knows that the words that are used for seed phrases are not random. The BIP39 wordlist (2048 words) is used for creating seedphrases, and they hold a specific meaning. The last seed word generates a checksum, which validates the data. Also, the wordlist isn't infinite, meaning we have a certain parameter.My question is, Is it possible to crack a seedphrase with brute force? Suppose you have a lot of computing power. Like having a super or quantum computer.I am not talking about recovering a lost wallet or missing seed words. I know there are many Python based tools, like  btcrecover, that can perform this task. If one had the original seed (wrong order) or a part of the seed, like 10 out of 12 words or 21 out of 24 words, one might be able to successfully recover the wallet.What I am referring to is taking completely random words from BIP39, run some tools and algorithms, and try to make a valid existing seed (Having balance or no balance isn't important).I know this might be a stupid question, and a lot of you might be wondering why I wanted to know this. The thing is, I saw a bunch of videos on YouTube and Facebook where some tools were trying to bruteforce seeds. They were using thousands of combinations of seeds (I forgot to save the video link). I understand, it might be fake. But is there any technical explanation for my question? Another small question, why does BIP39 has only 2048 words? What's the reason? Is it related to any maths or equations?I am not a hacker, cracker, or anything like that, but a curious person who wants to learn new things. If this topic already exists, please give me the reference link. I want to know more.",

Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 20, 2021, 09:36:10 PMWith good hardware, btcrecover will descramble a 12 word BIP39 seed phrase in an hour: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/2020-05-02_Descrambling_a_12_word_seed/Example_Descrambling_a_12_word_seed/. Although not exactly the same due to the checksum, lets assume that if you know 12 out of the 24 words then you could descramble the remaining 12 words in roughly the same amount of time.If you don't know the position of 13 words instead of 12, then there are 13x as many combinations to try, so that would take roughly 13 hours.For 14 words, 7 days.For 15 words, 16 weeks.For 16 words, 5 years.For 17 words, 85 years.For 18 words, 1500 years.No point calculating beyond that really.

Is it related to any maths or equations?Because it doesn’t matter as long it is a 12 word seed phrase the entropy will remain 128 bits and 256 bits if it is a 24 word seed phrase and the entropy is actually what determines the security or randomness of the word not how many they seems to be.

A seed phrase is an encoding of a 256 bit entropy. That means there can be 2^256 different seeds. Here's a great video that demonstrates how big that is: https://piped.video/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY.Nobody is going to randomly brute force seed phrases, unless they're nuts. In fact, a private key can be cracked more easily as the public key cryptography used in Bitcoin provides 128 bit security.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 22, 2023, 01:45:01 PMHere is o_e_l_e_o explanation on the topic, this means for 24 words we will probably be looking at billions of years to come.

This means that for every 11 bits you can represent a word. Say that a seed phrase is 128 bits long, which is 12 words long. If you extend these 128 bits to something divisible by 11 (i.e., 132 which is the point of 4 bits checksum), you can represent any seed in a sequence of 132 / 11 = 12 words.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on October 22, 2023, 04:45:23 PMSaw that video.
