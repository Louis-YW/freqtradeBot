There are some stories on the internet of another early investors who have also lost access to their wallets which were replenished of Bitcoins.My doubt is, why some early investors were so careless over their coins back then? Didn't they believe Bitcoin have potential to become valuable like we see nowadays? Weren't they faithful adopters who were holding thinking on long term gains? What was their purpose by accumulating Bitcoin if it wasn't to store and keep it safely, then?",

So, this means he must have had an idea how to save his bitcoin since 2010, so what really happened and why remembering it recently. Maybe because the bitcoin price surged?",

There was once a thread here where exactly such stories were collected and an attempt was made to crystallize how many Bitcoins were \"lost\" as a result. Nevertheless, I hope that your long history in the crypto scene has allowed you to benefit from the constant bull run anyway and that the 100 Bitcoins were not your only ones.",

      "body": "This story is common where holders or bitcoin owners lose their bitcoin just because they lose access to it or they forget about it. It's a common story, and many stories like that exist. It's because when bitcoin has only a low value, it is being ignored by anyone, and yeah, they have bitcoins a lot but eventually forget about them, and suddenly, when the bitcoin price has a high value, they will suddenly remember that they have holdings or they own bitcoin, but mostly too late as they may forget their keys or throw the harddrive or USB that contains their wallet with their bitcoin in it. Thats what you called, regret will always be in the end. If atÂ  first you gave meaning and care to your assets, then maybe now you are a millionaire, but yeah, all things happen for a reason. Maybe millions are not meant for you, or you just get unlucky.",

But from your post, it seems you have overcome the loss and moved on. May early Bitcoiners also suffered the same fate because of carelessness or lack of faith in Bitcoin. Many of them never thought that the price of Bitcoin would increase to this extent. But I am surprised that you never remembered that you had such a treasure carelessly kept in a drawer. I don't care if the story is true or false I am just interested in learning from your mistake which is never to take anything for granted no matter how irrelevant it might look.

Don't you have an access to a device where you monitors this your Bitcoin assets because I believe the USB was a device only where you could store your document details such as your seed phrases and not a virtual device that displaces the views of your assets market.Don't you have your seed phrases on a multiple storage either different online devices, sites or even on a hardware storage such a ls writing it down in some pieces of papers or a diary?Oh my goodness. I do not know when you started accumulating these Bitcoins til you accumulated the sum of 100BTC but what I know is that interestingly, the value of Bitcoin at precious season or even to say just the past months can not be compared to the value of Bitcoin of today.This really feels like being exploded. For goodness sake it is unbearable to see how high Bitcoin is going this time in the market price rate while considering the Possibilities to lost a whole 100BTC.Sorry mate. We really and always have to be careful when handling valuables and not just Bitcoin because if you hand other necessary values in a careless manners it could become something usual that somedays, you could go careless with some valuables such as this mate who just lost the sum of 100BTC.
