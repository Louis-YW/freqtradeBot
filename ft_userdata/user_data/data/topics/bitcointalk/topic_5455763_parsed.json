  "content": "I would like to briefly tell you about myself. My name is Dan , and I have been a crypto enthusiast since 2015. Initially, I was thrilled by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I decided to develop a program for implementing blockchain technology in government agencies. I proposed this program to all the politicians in Kyrgyzstan but faced rejection every time. It was clear that they did not want to lose the opportunity to accept bribes if blockchain were implemented in elections and statistics. Fortunately, I found a well-known politician who agreed to adopt this technology, but there was a problem - he was in prison. In late September 2020 he published the program on Facebook, and in October, a revolution occurred, and he became the President. During the campaign, he spoke about his intention to implement blockchain, but after the elections, he backed out of the idea and stopped collaborating with me. By the way I wrote a programme to him for free. Before we did not sign an agreement but how could I sign an agreement with him while he was in jail?  Here is his programme: https://www.facebook.com/profile/100004948146129/search/?q=%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F I am starting to educate the people again, as I always do, from scratch. I have an idea to create a quasi-state with implemented solutions, where people can witness my work and realize that the time for change has come. Currently, our country is within the sphere of influence of three empires, and they even control the digitization of government structures. Witnessing the hopeless situation, I have decided to embark on my own path as a Mandalorian and enlighten the people. I am confident that I will be able to accomplish my vision. PS He became a Dictator and I am feeling a responsibility that I helped him to become a president. I feel that he doesn't want to be indebted to anyone, and any mention of him owing someone is met with imprisonment, thus he incarcerated many of his allies. He believes he became the president on his own and that no one helped him. He has turned into a super dragon and a dictator. It's possible that I could be imprisoned too, as I openly expressed my opinions about his tyranny.",

      "body": "Mr Diniar, after reading your post I just realized that how a person can change his mind when the power comes in his hands. The guy that became president did a very wrong act by forgetting the favor that the supporters have done for him, and your idea of implementing Bitcoin was a really good thing but the politicians are always like that and they don't allow anything to be a reality which can harm their current system. The democracy gets affected by such politicians because they know that a technology like blockchain could make the elections transparent and with transparent elections only the real politicians with huge vote bank gets elected as president or prime  minister. I hope that people may respect your opinion regarding implementing blockchain into the election systems.For your own safety it's better that you should not oppose the guy directly because in such cases you might be against the state where you are living and that could create more problems in your life. I recommend you to wait for the proper time to take further actions in order to accomplish your goal of fair elections with the help of blockchain.",

I see Blockchain Technology is the only way to be Independent from Empires.And how is Blockchain technology going to help you?As a guy who lived in a communist dictatorship where the special police could pick you from the street because you wrote some stupid poetry or said bad things about the party at a restaurant and get your ass thrown in jail without a trial, let me tell you this is just daydreaming.Blockchain si just a piece of technology, it doesn't grant you immunity from the government, all they have to do is gather 10-20 of your revolutionary friends execute them in a live broadcast in a stadium and your revolution is dead!QuoteI have decided to embark on my own path as a Mandalorian and enlighten the people. I am confident that I will be able to accomplish my vision.Stop watching movies and face reality!QuoteBlockchain technology. This technology will make it possible to increase pensions, attract investments, reduce corruption, make elections transparent and secure your life. Blockchain cannot be bribed, cannot be hacked, you cannot negotiate with it. Technology in its very concept is a system that does not allow regulation and control over its functioning from a single center. This technology will bring justice to the system. I have enough political will to introduce something that will not allow a person who is in power to get rich.In the field of agriculture, the situation is very deplorable, we are destroying the ecosystem, as a result, glaciers are melting, the fertile soil layer is degrading, applying mineral fertilizers, we are changing the ecosystem in the territory.Yeah right, he only forgot how implementing blockchain will announce the second coming of Jesus, Mahomed and Budha and all three will party till every war in the world stops. How in the name of god would blockchain stop melting glaciers??Do you actually believe all the crap people say during elections?",

      "body": "Blockchain technology, in and of itself, is not a solution to all societal and political issues. It is a decentralized and transparent system that can potentially bring some benefits, such as increased transparency, improved security, and reduced corruption in certain areas. However, its effectiveness depends on how it is implemented and integrated into existing systems.Regarding the claim that blockchain technology can stop melting glaciers or solve all environmental problems, that seems highly unlikely. Blockchain technology is primarily a tool for managing and verifying transactions and data, and it does not have the ability to directly impact or control physical phenomena like glacier melting. Environmental issues require comprehensive solutions that involve various factors, including policy changes, technological advancements, and collective efforts.",

Leading politics is not as simple as it looks, most often honourable people have no place in it.If you have the feeling that your life is in danger, it would probably be wise to contact an embassy of a country that has a strong influence in Kyrgyzstan. Maybe you can request political asylum. You can be present from a remote position as well, but still with your head on your shoulders.Not to go into the details of your blockchain implementation proposal, but even if you overthrow the current dictator, expect that quite corrupt politicians will come after him, so they will not be very interested in blockchain either, where it is difficult to hide some facts. Maybe it will be more democratic and open, but most doors will certainly be closed to new ideas.",

Jolbors, be careful where you're getting into, even if you think it's the right thing, surely no one will thank you, and you can get in a big problem.If your intention is to drive this movement, there are many other safer ways to do it, without risking one's skin.",

I did the same as your advice and give my programm to opposition and result is nothing.",
