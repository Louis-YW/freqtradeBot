Fintechs because they do not all have physical locations like the normal bank wey we get, Many people dey always fear an avoid them. I dey use Opay for more than a year now, and since this time, I never face any real or serious problems like the one wey the banks dey give us, but I still dey use my sense. How? I nor dey leave big money for the fintech account, na only money wey I know say I wan spend nai I dey keep for Opay.",

In a country like ours wey don heavily dey infested with ponzi schemes and thousands of scams in the past and present, people dey try dey careful with these fintech banks. Initially, I been dey skeptical of fintech banks because them no really get office wey person fit go lodge complaint in the event of failed transfers that were not refunded.For instance, in October, I had an issue with one of these fintech banks and the process of getting it resolved wasn't enjoyable one bit as we were just going back and forth with the session IDs, screenshots, etc.But I no go lie. Currently, I use fintech banks about 95% of the time compared to traditional banks. It's faster and more often than not, cheaper to use.",

Di rumors of dem shutting down fit no be true, because na so wicked people de take carry fake news to spoil other people businesses. But the point be say so far say dem no get branches like normal banks wey you fit enter do physical transactions or make complaints, if anything happen to your money na OYO be your case. Dem de very convenient just like exchanges and I de reason say dem fit also go down like some exchanges, so as e no de advisable to leave your coins for exchanges, e no too de advisable to leave better money for inside Fintech banks.",

I no blame them though cos the government no dey help us at all, in fact, they placed us in a state of panic already, so mostly, Nigerians are skeptical of bad new rather than good ones.These fintech banks are what I call life savers, they gained good prominence during the cashless economy and some of them like majorly Opay is still maintaining good standards up till now. They recently had a physical office at Abuja recently. standard banks are well known for their unnecessary dramas and network hitches, so these fintech banks saves us a lot of stress and drama and makes life easier for the citizens.Opay is my spending account, I do virtually all my money movements and bills payment from it and I've never had any reason to regret it for almost three years now. What more can I ask from them?. I virtually don't keep much funds there, I still spread my finances across other banks and investment channels, but Opay has been very instrumental and engaging financially over the years and I sure give them credit for that.",

Na from the beginning nof last year and till now we have not heard anything again and there was a time when the cashless policy started, I was also hearing that because of the way Micro Finance Banks operating and their services are very fast in transaction so CBN said they would stop the USSD code which banks are using to transfer money and stop their bank apps and really frankly speaking all the bank networks at that time were not working so people come dey think say na weti CBN tok nai dem wan accomplished that time. But later after every drama, things became normal again.And as it is now, those banks will not or can't be eliminated in the Nigeria banking and financial services or system. And really MMM spoiled many people mind for this online things and most cryptocurrency. Many people still never believe say Bitcoin e dey genuine because of weti dem lost for MMM.",

I love the fact that you don't believe the rumour but nothing should be taken for granted, remember smoke no dey just dey somewhere wey fire no dey. If the rumours keep popping up then we should keep our guard up because anything fit sup at any minute. Me I dey use fintech banks very well and I dey put better money inside and dey even use them dey do many transactions but I know the risk involved although opay looks unlikely to go anywhere. Recently self dey just open physical presence for the country and plan to do more in other states. Dem go dun see people worries for the net before dem do this one. Yes dem be fintech but you're in a country with bad history with companies without physical presence in the country so to avoid doubts do the needful and create a physical presence. Nigerians are right to worry as this country things get swept under the rug very quickly. When things go bad na only talk we go dey hear without people money been refunded. Even our traditional banks can't cover all the money you have with them if things go south talk more of fintech. Abeg na Nigeria we dey so no go put more than you can afford to lose for those fintech especially the ones wey no get better popularity. Highest wey the government go do na to arrest the owners of the fintech if them go bankrupt because of hack or exist scam so make we protect ourselves abeg.",
