I disagree with your idea. I agree with this post.Gambling discussion board is fine as it is. There are barely any meaningful discussion in that board. Adding more child boards will accomplish nothing. Let's say we added a \"slot games\" child board. Who is going to post there and what? What can anybody possibly discuss anything about slot games? It will be more of the same spam just in a different sub forum.",

We could just get strict and go back to basics and say if it doesn't involve bitcoin somewhere then it doesn't belong in there but something tells me people will find a way to squeeze in a mention of bitcoin in any which way they can.",

I am guilty of it too, I try my best to reframe myself not looking too odd. When I visit the boards I barely see a topic where I can have a good discussion. No one cares for a discussion there.Back to OP, I think first we need to take care of the redundant topics of the whole gambling board before doing anything else.",

I literally look at every topics that posted in Gambling Discussion board. I have seen a lot of irrelevant topics such as the latter sentences you said.So, I tried to get some of the redundant topics in Gambling Discussion from page 1 to 15. Though, they have different way but I think these topics are leading in 1 context.Criteria of a good gamblerResponsible gamblingHow to win gambling?gambling techniquesMy Unconventional Betting StrategyPoker strategiesDon't get me wrong, those are good ideas. But as time goes by, I think the contexts are bit similar with each other.Here is the thread that purely spamming:gambling discussionImagine, A (Gambling Discussion) under Gambling Discussion board.And lastly, Will you stop gamble if your girl friend insists ?The thread is useless. I really don't care if your girlfriend will stop you in gambling. I have my own life.Well, that's all I want to share.",

Sports betting makes sense since there's a ton of variables to discuss pretty much every week, but dice betting or even betting games against the house don't really change all that much. I imagine there would be a few threads about techniques, but that's about it. Hence, why I don't think we particularly need another section. If anything, you'd probably want to separate sports gambling discussion from gambling discussion, but again I don't think it's necessary.",

From what I noticed, most of topics not related with sports is just spam megathreads, sometimes with most stupid questions that you can make. Something like ''How to teach your dog/children/wife to gamble'' or ''what is right age to start gambling'' It's difficult to tell something new  about gambling itself, what wasn't posted yet, so, people repeat same stuff. In topics dedicated to sports we have at least some discussion between users. And I wouldn't say that in these topics people talk just about sports, there is more than enough posts about betting on these leagues.",

And i created those sections after considering where most and mine will fit perfectly.I actually bet and predict things but never used money to do them and I wonder If any could show me where I have been wrong in my predictions. So the risk for me and others like me is actually very low due to the fact I don't stake money or bet carelessly. So no one has the right to call me a gambler even though I predict/bet on things.The Gambling Section makes things clear for you:GamblingGambling and all \"investments\" that are so risky they might as well be gambling (HYIPs, pyramid schemes, etc.",
