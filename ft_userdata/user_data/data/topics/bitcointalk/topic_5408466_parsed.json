If you are a working class, you can just use 5% of your weekly income or less to gamble. If you use more than that and you are becoming an addict, best to quit.",

But if noticed I always losing then i have no option than pause for a while and wait for the favorable time to gamble again, most at times i noticed gambling has to do with luck and favor though it doesn't work all times. Keep in mind there are different between girlfriend and wife, my wife have the full control to ask me to stop and i have no option than to stop instead of going further.",

A girl shouldn’t be controlling a man’s hobby.  Women like to talk about steps a man can protect their savings, that is one of the aspects they are good at, they can give the best advice that we men already knew too though. If she is right, you will know, but I will say she is right. According to the OP, the girl friend knows he is gambling, which means the complain would be because he is losing and she sees that gambling is not helping his boyfriend.Quote from: dimonstration on August 02, 2022, 03:33:00 PMBased on my experienced as married man, Woman is always right if you really love them because you will never gonna win any argument if s*x is already on the table.     A good woman will also want to have s*x with his man, they have the huge too, if a woman do not have the huge, it means she has another man that the guy do not know that is servicing her.",

Well, it's up to you really and you can easily evaluate your relationship based on that. However, you should discuss this with her carefully, since she may just have misconceptions on gambling and all could be solved nicely in a way both or you are happy.Second, if you \"obey\", you can show that you are serious about the relation and, even more, you can show to yourself that you're not actually addicted to that (which, don't be fooled, is always a possibility).However, I cannot answer to \"will you stop\" since I don't gamble much and I'm also already married.",

We all need to have something to do with our spare time that we enjoy, I'd rather to have my hobbies and passions than such a controling person as my partner, to be honest.",

If there is one girl that boys must obey then that will only be their mothers because they came from it. It's only your girlfriend anyway not your wife but if it's about our wife then the trust and respect are already at a different level so maybe we will also obey them most especially if we already have a child.I think all of us wants a happy family and we don't want it to be broken, only because we got addicted in gambling and we also don't want our kids to get influenced in gambling at their early age. If only we do gambling in moderation then our wife or girlfriend are going to be fine with it.",

Gambling can ruin any relationship especially if there’s a money involve, some gamblers might not listed to this and ready to sacrifice their relationship just to gamble, this is a situation where you can confirm that you are already addict in gambling. Again, better to gamble moderately using extra money, don’t wait for this moment to happen when someone asked you to stop gambling.",
