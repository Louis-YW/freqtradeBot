      "body": "Twitter followers meant nothing, this can be bunch of bots that follow this meme token that has no value. The babydoge army was also very annoying. I just also remind you that if total address was also nothing. With multi billions of supply and this is not a big surprise for me but the total active wallet must become the main thing to determine this. You can expect a big profit in the future but not so big like when elon was hyping the meme token",

      "body": "Another meme-coin with a scary number of zeros after the decimal point. If such projects grow, it is only during periods of general market euphoria, when liquidity flows into everything.Â  In bearish periods, as well as in periods of recovery, investing in such projects is of little interest to anyone because the project does not carry any utilitarian value, just another pump&dump project which can pumping, if some Influencer takes it on and starts to PR it. Without that no one needs such projects.",
