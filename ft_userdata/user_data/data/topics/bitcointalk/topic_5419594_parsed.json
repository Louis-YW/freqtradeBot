If you still think so, then you haven't been paying attention to the mechanics of the crypto market.What is tamadoge even supposed to mean?A copycat shitcoin that can not help it by ride on Doge's popularity by adding \"doge\" to it's name...

You are typical person look at the price compare with the ATH and come to conclusion is a scam if it down below ATH.",

These projects might give you a good return but you should at least lower your expectations as unfortunately, even with how good the project is, there are other factors to consider for them to achieve that 100x increase.The fact that you were able to end up with that list with your own DYOR, I think you already know how to do some good projects based on your own view, at least. You won't put some trust in these projects in the first place if you didn't see something special about them but always remember that don't allow yourself to be looped in hype or shillers, if there's any.Good luck is the best advice I can say.",
