  "content": "Bitcoin Client Software and Version Number: 24.0.1Operating System: ubuntu 22.04System Hardware Specs: I5 8GB memory several HD with 6-7 TBDescription of Problem: unable to get BCCore running as a userAny Related Addresses: noAny Related Transaction IDs: noScreenshot of the problem: noneLog Files from the Bitcoin Client: don't know where to find themI had BC Core running on a 20.04 Ubuntu as user gezi for years. It had an external 5TB drive with a directory .bitcoin containing all data relating to this installation. The drive was mounted on /u/bigdata2.The hardware failed and I replace the machine and used the opportunity to start fresh with ubuntu 22.04. The 5TB drive was again mounted on /u/bigdata2.I installed the latest BC Core as a snap. On first start BC Core asked me for choose the data directory, but I could not select /u/bigdata2/.bitcoin - the file selector did not show the /u folder at all. When I tried to type in the full datapath the Choose button remained grayed.I tried everything I could imagine to get this to work, including adding dataDir=/u/bigdata2/.bitcoin to the config file Bitcoin-QT.conf in/home/gezi/snap/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-core/126/.config/BitcoinIn order get something to work avoiding any file permission I tried to run as root:/snap/bitcoin-core/126/bin/bitcoin-qt -datadir=/u/bigdata2/.bitcoinand that actually worked: it got the right data, it was a few days behind but it started the synching nicely.Obviously I tried the same command as user gezi, but first got  popup window with a Payment request error, and then\"Error: Error initializing wallet database environment \"/u/bigdata2/.bitcoin\"! This error could occur if this wallet was not shutdown cleanly and was last loaded using a build with a newer version of Berkeley DB. If so, please use the software that last loaded this wallet\"The last I tried was to accept the default data location and started to sync. Then, when it thought be only 5 days until done, I did as user gezicd ~/snap/bitcoin-core/commonmv .bitcoin save.bitcoinln -s /u/bigdata2/.bitcoin .bitcointo plant the old data into the new nest, but to no avail: BC Core thought it was a new install and asked me for the data directory again.I am now at  total loss and hope somebody can make sense if this all.Thanks, Merlin",

      "body": "Wow thanks - I did not know that snap was at least partially proprietary!Speaking of snap - I am still lacking basic understanding of the inner workings and principles;could you give me a hint where I can find out why (and how to fix) I am not seeing my directory/u at all in two snap applications that I tried - bitcoin and Krita?This is a directory that is fully accessible by everybody and I am using that for mounting allof my external resources, so I need my apps to be able to see that.Cheers,Merlin",
