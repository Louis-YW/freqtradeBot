With whom he successfully exchanges merits.@YOSHIE's investigation that these two accounts are alternate.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415701.msg61049983#msg61049983Then there is another discovery by @YOSHIE where he shows that in addition to these two accounts, there are two more previously blocked accounts.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415850.msg61090146#msg61090146@Nutildah now finds a post using an AI tool, and after verifying the Maxre account, you can see that it belongs to the old owner again. And also confirms his other accounts.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5448045.msg62060049#msg62060049Obviously, this account has been bought. https://bpip.org/Profile?p=MaxreBut the owner is so stupid that he does not stop using his old social networks.

Quote from: fennic on January 04, 2023, 03:37:24 PMMy wishes are very simple in coming day and these are just described below 👇1. I have at least 1 Bitcoin in coming yearsDuring my investigation, I noticed something. I know that Gmail sometimes suggests names for us by adding some strings of numbers to our preferred name, but I don't think it's a coincidence that an account connected to Fennis and another connected account have the same number in their Gmail username.Quote from: Bila0 on May 28, 2021, 04:55:01 PM~~~- Email: mb160440@gmail.com~~~Quote from: Lucius on April 10, 2023, 10:23:20 AM~~~but don't evil fees play any role for those people?

Not only that, there are countries where there are also some internet providers which offer their clients dynamic IP addresses. That is my case, for some reason my internet provider does not offer fixed addresses, as a consequence I have noticed that my login history in this forum varies widely among locations around the country.  Because of that it has happened to me that years ago I wanted to participate in a different webpage and I realized the IP was banned, even though that was the first time I enter there.  In those instances ban evasion is even easier, there is no need for a VPN.",
