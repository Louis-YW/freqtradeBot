I am personally active there every day and I do my part, but I think that board should be additionally protected in a way to prevent Newbies and all those who have not earned at least 5 merits from posting there. It is not something that would solve the problem with poor quality posts or ordinary spam, but it would be a good start if we want the Bitcoin discussion not to be overrun like some other boards.",
