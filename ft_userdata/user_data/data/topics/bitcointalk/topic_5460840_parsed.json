      "body": "OP it's obvious that not only were you a newbie but a trolling clawn indeed, you break two rules with this your useless post, first wrong you did was to come to economics board to discuss about relationships that is less of anyone's business here but something which is meant to be personal to you, if you think your libido is extremely high, then consult your doctor for that, secondly, this whole discussion is more of off topic to be because I don't even see where it could belong if moved by the moderator than to lock or delete it, is this your own definition of how to make a quality post?",

You are the first person that I really feel disappointed for, I wonder what your goals in life is, at this very young age all you could think about is this? You are a complete failure boy. Have your way with your little girl friend and see what happens next, mistakes that most grown up regretted is what you want to start your life with, good luck.",
