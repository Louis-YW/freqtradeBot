  "content": "Before you get any wrong conceptions, No I am not launching another scam.I live in India and currently am studying engineering. My university has pretty sharp minds and is very good in what they are doing, however, there is a very wrong conception about BTC among the same audience. Nobody understands bitcoin. To make it worse there is a wrong conception about Bitcoin from the same, brought in from old concepts about money and the government.To my ignorance, I wouldn't care about this anytime, yet I think having a basic workshop about how a Bitcoin works can help people to THINK, I believe. To bring in people, I am willing to put some promising offers for the candidates joining the seminar.Will this help in any way?Share your thoughts.",

      "body": "First of all, No one will assume this is scam because you are just planning a workshop. It’s a good initiative to help Bitcoin spread to your university.I’m just concerned about the acceptance of student to your goal since India is very clear on not in favor to crypto by imposing high tax on it to discouraged user to use it. This will be very challenging for you but this is manageable.Start to gather first your close friend to help you to start a small community. You can attract many interested user if you can showcase the benefits of Bitcoin through flyers distribution and bulletin board announcements. I once do this to promote my club on school before and we usually offer something to user that they can’t resist to come with us. Think of things that people in university like the most and use it as medium to lure them.",

After making that decision on the venue at the offline or online the next thing is to search for another speaker that will assist you. Someone who is particularly knowledgeable in bitcoin as well. Pick a date that is not too close, so you can have enough time for the next thing which is publicity.Invest heavily in publicity because publicity is what will determine if your workshop will will turn out successful or not. evaluate the best way to reach out to people around you and leverage on it because you need people to come.",

      "body": "A workshop is a good way to familiarize people who want to understand. I think it totally depends on your presentation.If your audience have a really old school mindset you're going to need to present it in a way that compares the old ways that they do things to how bitcoin and cryptocurrency works. Put some time into this and become an ambassador of bitcoin if it's something you really believe in. For me, one thing that is very appealing about bitcoin is that you can put it in a physical hardware wallet or software wallet and go anywhere in the world and convert it to the local currency without carrying a large amount of cash or currency on you. I know you can do this with banks too but its a more private way of doing things. Even though the FBI is mapping out bitcoin wallets and trying to figure out everybody in the world's bitcoin wallet. That's a different issue though.This is a very complex subject and I think for now to break it down into a simple and easy to understand way is what you would want to do.An analogy I might use would be how debit cards/credit cards first arrived onto the scene and people were wary because they always used cash. Well debit cards and credit cards use some sort of backbone service like SWIFT to handle their transactions. This can take days to settle a transaction with SWIFT. Bitcoin is like a newer credit or debit card type of transaction where it settles in minutes rather than days and is on a blockchain that is verifiable with more security and nobody controls it.Just my 2 centsCryptobeard",

It seems more likely that the problem is not that they do not understand but rather there is no interest among anyone at your university.So from my point of perspective, the problem that you should be solving is how to get people interested in Bitcoin. Your problem is a marketing problem. Find ways to market Bitcoin to them in a way that connects the old ways and the new and will drive people to become interested in Bitcoin.",
