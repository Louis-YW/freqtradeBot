You'd probably be surprised what people run bots on these days I've seen it be run on mmo games where a bot looks like it'd be difficult to code.I think I remember gambit having a few board game style games (back in 2015) - they used to accept bitcoin but had licensing problems (I think I'm remembering the name right).",

I'm talking about two people playing against each other. Possibly more people in the case of 4-player games e.g. hearts, spades.In SWC Poker you don't play poker against bots, you join a \"room\" where there are a bunch of other people playing.

Given that almost all board games are already an easy task for computer programs, your idea will face the fact that players will use computer prompts. How are you going to solve this problem? Even such monsters of the industry as chess.com have been developing a system for combating cheaters for many years and it is still not perfect.",

      "body": "It sounds like a great idea and it would be pretty interesting to see something like this. All of these games are relatively complex, and there is a lot that could be done in terms of multiplayer dynamics and tournament structure. In short, the idea sounds like it could be a lot of fun, and might even prove to be profitable for a venture capitalist looking for a unique new business idea. The problem is, though, that with modern computers able to analyze where the game will go through ten or more moves ahead, most of these games have been \"solved\". In other words, the computers have found the optimal pattern of play and know if they can win 99% of the time. So even if you were playing against another human, his best course of action would be to play according to what the computer would do anyway, because those games are all predictable. People want to gamble on casino games like poker that have an element of chance and unpredictability.",

Only that everyone Will be much aware that their wager goes to a particular user (that's when they loose). The big question here is: won't these development break the rules of pseudonymity; as the stackers have to be paired together -- say five of them --? isn't it a chance that anyone could view, text or manipulate through a person's profile?Just curious anyways......",

Chess games could potentially drag on for a long time as money is involved and I'm simply not sure there is a wide enough player base. It involves only two players, whereas Poker commonly has up to 9 people per table which helps to keep things interesting, along with the strategy of bluffing which adds an element of a wildcard into the mix. There is also not an established way for the house to earn money in these other games, unlike the rake which is common accepted by players as part of the process.",

Yes, it is a good question, in these cases there should be a type of protection for the player, if it is determined that he was actually disconnected, then there should be a reasonable time to be able to return again where his game becomes invisible and does not affect or his game nor that of others, then if he does not return in a reasonable time, then a fee will have to be deducted for such a fault, since it is considered an abandonment, and not everyone must pay for it, and if he returns, apart from being charged that, the penalty would be to start in another game, since if he enters the same game he might have an advantage over others, then many players would do the disconnect trick and then re-enter.",
