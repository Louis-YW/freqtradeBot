  "content": "Dear all,As part of a documentary, I am looking for somebody based in London or around in order to relate a personal story about a \"huge loss\" in cryptos and/or Luna, following the Luna crash.The documentary is not about the crash, and it's more a global film about the \"crypto revolution\". We have already filmed key players ( CZ, Vitalik, Michael Taylor...) but we would like to give to our audience the full flavor about a revolution who knows the best and the worst...We are a French team, based in Paris. We will be @ London 1 July 2022 to film a FT journalist. Available morning to shoot this guest.Please contact me :- jg.guillet@gmail.comHave a very good day,Regards,Jean-Gabriel",
