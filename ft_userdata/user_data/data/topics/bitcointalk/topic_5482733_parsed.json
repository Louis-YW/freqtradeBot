  "content": "It's a new year again and we all know what lies in wait, scammers are thinking of more innovative ways to decive and pollute the crypto community again and the one I hate the most are these wannabes that come and taint our fav coin image by creating not just inferiors but empty coins. They come I form of rug pulls, pump and dump all trying to scam crypto users who are ill informed. Not to long from now one new Influencer would start promoting a new rugpull, pls let none of us fall for such silly tricks anymore we are way past that already.But any way let me remind you of how you can quickly save yourself from falling into these malicious snares.üëâget rid of your get rich quick mentality : I know a lot of persons would be expecting me to say read their whitepaper, but like I said this guys are getting more smart and making a good whitepaper with excellent road map and all would not be a problem to them. But thign I know they can't change so easily is their offers, they would always work on your greed, trying to entice you with silly offers that are so good to be true. I'm crying üò¢ right now cause I also wished they were true, but sorry they aren't and don't fall to such this year.üëâ track their anonymously: so far I've noticed that most scams don't project any team members to the public and if they do they are mostly fake and this way could be very effective than reading a whole whitepaper. Check if the project has any real life representative and follow them up and see if they are posting in line with their big project in hand. Why i feel this is a good idea is because they are still afraid of the government too.üëâ yeah and ¬†finally stop listening to influencers: many persons that have fallen for scam was found following one influencer or the other. Just know this people don't have you in mind and would promote any shit to get paid. Always do your own investigations if you must invest in any new project.üëâonly invest in bitcoin üòé: ¬†by know we all know that bitcoin is the only reliable crypto right now. And I have history to prove that, to me every other ¬†project is not decentralized as they claim to be because they still have a kind of supervisory body even tho they claim not to, people did fund those projects remember and they would want something, nothing is free, no altcoin is completely decentralized.¬†Whole bitcoin on the other hand is developed by the bitcoin community and even the creator has no hand in it again . Now there is something we can trust.Stay safe yall. No scam getting us this yearIf you could add pls do we have everyon3 at heart ‚ù§ üíô",

Scammers appear to be attempting to devise increasingly creative methods as time goes on to defraud people of their money. The frequency of frauds and scam enterprises will rise as the bull run approaches, and it is our responsibility to protect our assets during this time. It is never acceptable to be unaware of something, especially when scammers take advantage of you by tricking you into investing in the wrong project or disclosing personal information. As they say, \"Knowledge is power,\" pursuing knowledge gives us the advantage over scammers. ¬†It will be simpler to detect scams from a distance if you recognise the many methods and strategies scammers utilise. Investing in altcoins increases the risk of falling for pump and dump or rug pull scams. ¬†To my knowledge, investing in Bitcoin is the safest cryptocurrency investment. However, if someone is interested in other cryptocurrencies, they should do some research or, better yet, choose well-known cryptocurrencies to reduce the risk and chance of being scammed.Quoteüëâget rid of your get rich scheme mentalityMany people have found themselves in difficult financial positions as a result of this mentality, their haste to get money quickly causes them to make decisions without fully thinking them through. Any site that offers free money or a rapid return is probably lying to draw investors to their platform because, in the cryptocurrency market, everyone is wanting to earn more money. As a result, there are actually no platforms that have money to give away. The majority of people who lack sufficient knowledge about cryptocurrencies are individuals who have the mindset of wanting to make a quick profit, they become impatient in their efforts to acquire knowledge and easily attracted by any small offer that seems to promise them a quick profit.",

They will be swayed by the white paper or the hype without analysing on their own if the coin they see is legit. Airdrop is one of the schemes that scammers use.

If I analyse that the coin will pump even a little, then I will hoard a lot of its coins while its price is cheap, and if I see that the market for those coins will be gone, then I will sell all of my holdings. It's all about analysing the market and potential coins, so you just need to make an effort and put in hard work.",
