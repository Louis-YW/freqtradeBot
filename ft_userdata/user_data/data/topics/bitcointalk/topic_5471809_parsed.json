Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it's not governed by any financial institution or entity. And if you're referring to government regulation, it primarily pertains to Bitcoin's presence in society but doesn't govern the internal system of Bitcoin or its blockchain.Quote from: Gideon66 on October 26, 2023, 11:39:50 PMTether is a stable coin, it have same value of the us dollar. That's why it is less volatile than Bitcoin, it can also be use for trading on exchanges or it can be stored value.  When the USD experiences inflation, Tether also undergoes inflation because it's backed 1:1 by USD. This doesn't truly serve as a store of value. It's not much different from you holding onto FIAT currency. Many traders might opt for USDT as a parking spot for their assets before making investment decisions on their chosen coins.Quote from: Gideon66 on October 26, 2023, 11:39:50 PMBoth have their potential of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology are endless.  USDT is issued by centralized institutions and cannot guarantee 100% immunity from insider meddling.",

Which leads us to my third point, that it is able to enforce censorship. This goes on and on. We can deduce a number of conclusions from the mere fact that it is centralized. For example, that Tether has the ability to freeze funds. And if they can do that, they can also seize them. USDT doesn't share Bitcoin's revolutionary features.",

Let's clarify this statement. I don't think that Bitcoin is governed by any financial institution...maybe you are referring to USDT and you are right since it is a stablecoin released and managed by a specific company and that it means it is centralized. Bitcoin is very much decentralized so nobody is controlling it though its price in the market can be manipulated by those who are holding huge BTC in their portfolio. In between the two, this is akin to comparing apple to orange...both are different and are having different functions and features.",

First it sound generic and second I don't even understand the purpose of this thread. What is OP trying to tell us.You could compare apples and oranges as well and it would be the same discussion.  I actually never used usdt. My wife sometimes gets paid in it, which is nice, but I am still not a fan. Also I don't understand why it must be on 3 ( or maybe more , I don't know ) different chains.Oh I remember, I used it once some years ago to deposit at a crypto mastercard, and I accidentally used the wrong chain, used trx chain while it had to be on eth, and I my deposit was lost forever. Probably not lost forever but since the depo was only like 45$ and the company told me \"recovering\" it would cost me 50$ for some reason it didn't make sense financially.",

Cryptocurrency in my opinion is a digital currency that is decentralized, not centralized.The claims of it been fully pegged to USD is something that is still on a debate because there is no to prove on that. Although I can agree that it some how comes into the line to digital currency too but been decentralized I don’t agree just like I don’t accept that all cryptocurrencies are decentralized as claimed. The only decentralized cryptocurrency in my opinion is bitcoin and with monero the only one coming close to it, the rest are just centralized digital currencies. Quote from: adaseb on October 27, 2023, 04:45:41 AMAlso one is a crypto and the other is a stablecoin which value is always fixed at $1. Although the changes are insignificant but it is still not total fixed 100% at $1 there were times were the market was totally down like during the FTX saga and the price was like around 0.96$ but then later retracted back, even now it is a little bit higher than $1 but the dominations are not necessary, but still it falls below that $1 when volatility in the crypto market becomes high during bearish periods",
