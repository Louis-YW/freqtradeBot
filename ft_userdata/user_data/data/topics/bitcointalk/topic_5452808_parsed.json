  "content": "I usually love being alone myself, my phone and my gadgets I always feels better, time when I was idle. One day I stumble into porn videos and since them my life turn, I became addicted to it, I practically turn hardly masturbating for long period of time while growing up, and I finally fall into likely women uncontrollably, it took me enough time to realizes how much am spending on women, how much I have waste my time doing the wrong things and how my life wasn't going forward. Idleness not good for anybody, young or old. My advice don't encourage in what you don't have idea of what is the implications and repercussions. What's that thing you regret ever done?",

      "body": "Well I regret not being any closer with my mother. When I was much younger she was mean to me and I did not see her as my mother. But when I grew older I started to realize the ways she acted, was not really all of it her fault.I have had many chances to make up for it. Be a nice son to her and for times we didnt spend together. But now she is older and sicker and it is too late I think. So I regret it from a long time ago not getting to know her better then when I was a kid.",
