Emotion is just one of it but not all. Others are:look for the right strategy to uselearn about risk management, very important learn about indicators too, do not gamble with trading but learn instead continue learning be careful of the coins you are using, some traders are using the wrong coins and they are losing just because of that do not go for profit that you do not expect loss in return that you can not cope with, do not use leverage or over-leverage. I mean use low or no leverage.Quote from: Sakanwa on March 01, 2023, 05:13:07 AM*And what will be your advice to a person in that position or state and what kind of trader are you going to call such a person?The person should continue to use low amount of money until he gets it right. The person might thought he is not having emotion, but using higher amount of money when the person is still losing is a sign of him not having control over emotion that is tempting him to use more than he can afford to lose, which is very wrong type of mindset in trading.",

You see, most of the time traders exit their trades based on a positive or losing percentage shown on their PnL.Sure this maybe difficult at first but having to trade based on your technicals and not on your PnL could give you an edge among other traders not only when it comes emotional side of things but also in creating a repeatable and profitable trade in the long run.",

That was when I knew that leveraging which can make someone to close trade very fast or leading to liquidation is not good. I think this is what you are talking about, that not all trades that first go against the position you opened that may not lead to a profit but later lead to profit. I understand, that is correct. But that should not be a good reason to disable PnL, I do not think that is even possible on exchanges. I have used more than 7 exchanges before but I did not noticed that, maybe because I do not see it usefulness though because PnL makes traders to know fast the amount of money they have gained or lost. If low leverage is used and going for a good coin like bitcoin, no problem.If you want to disable PnL, then why trading at all, knowing the PnL in trading is very important. People that I do see this can encourage are holders, people that do not want to sell for over long period of time, it is good for that kind of people not to look at their wallet or they should disable the fiat estimate, that is possible on many wallets.",

Suppose you are at a loss; your feelings will force you to trade more in the hope of recovering the loss, even if you know that you might lose again. You have to control it and do research before you open another position. Even if you are at a profit, greed will force you to open another position like before, in which you made some profits. You have to understand that the same strategy doesn't work all the time, and if you are a trader, you already know that. So, I would say, You have to have control over your two human nature; Emotions and Greediness. Rest depends on skills.",

That is good for your health and emotion control.- Control your emotion is difficult and it should be supported by your orders like stop loss, stop limit order.
