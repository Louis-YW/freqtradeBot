  "content": "There is Anderson Silva (47 years old)There is Jake paul 27 years old.Anderson silva is one of the best fighters in ufc of a ll times along with jon jones, Demothry Jonson, gsp..He has good boxing as well.  Finally paul someone who can box.Anderosn silva is the better boxerJake paul has more strengh and youth advantage.Both fighters know how to box. Jake paul ko some ufc fighters who don't box well like ben askren and tyron woodenly. Anderson silva is the same weight class as jake paul (unlike his previous opponent who were weight class bellow)  That also help me to make my decision on the bet. The odds now are close. -140 on Anderson silva (Bet 140$ to gain 100$)+100 on jake paul (Bet 100$ to win $100)The Floyd mayweather fight show us  that champion kick ass even on their old age. Floyd  now is 45 years old and beat some young tokyo guy with 22-3 records.I go on Anderson Silva  The dude has good boxing and he will train and be in good condition for fight.There is no reason Silva shouldn't beat him. 500$ on Silva.",

Might be the same outcome in here if Silva is motivated only by money, which somewhat shows on some interviews that were done to him. +100 isn't also a bad odd to bet on considering that Jake Paul is also a capable boxer in his own regard. If skills and grit I'd say Silva, but again this is a Paul initiated fight and that should suggest you something.",

If skills and grit I'd say Silva, but again this is a Paul initiated fight and that should suggest you something.They are not legends Ben askren sucks he  knows only wrestling and got away with it on the octagon with people who can't wrestle. Tyron Woodley lost all of his recent fights on the ufc. both Tyron and ben are were lower weight class than jake they are natural 77 kilos and jake is natural 84 killo. Is a big difference on this sport. Anderson silva is the same weight class as Jake and elite level boxer. Former champion of UFC with 10 title defenses.The question is can Anderson silva get KO or not . People say that Silva has underrated chin https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/qwxfs/anderson_silva_iron_chin/About Jake paul  chin i think he has weak chin. But We don't have yet enough data to determine it for sure.  we saw him almost getting knocked out by Tyron woodely. If he stay on the ring with Silva I believe Silva can land on him and ko him and finish him.",

Anderson Silva is one among the greatest UFC fighters of all time. He's one among the UFC fighter with most knockout history. These things surely add value to his game.",

Me too, I bet Paul doesn't mean he's better boxer than Silva, but he's very good making money in this industry and of course he must not lose to make the hype still crowd. I believe Silva is agree to lose and taking a good amount share, Silva has a chance to beat Paul but this match is already fixed.Quotehowever, since it's just an exhibition fight,Based on boxrec, this is a professional fight though I understand most people will think it's an exhibition fight.",

Floyd is also fighting on his original sports while Silva is came from MMA and will fight in boxing so obviously Floyd is a different case and shouldn’t be compared to this match since he is still in perfect shape on Boxing. Silva body is full of fatal injury so definitely he is not the same during his prime strength. I will bet on Jake Paul since he have the odds advantage while this match is even if we will not view Jake as a influencer  in my opinion.",

In my opinion experience is what will give him the win on this one.",

We all know that Anderson Silva had a terrible leg injury that made his long winning streak over, I think his leg injury affected his whole MMA career given that he experience multiple losses after he lost his winning streak. This affects his agility in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, Anderson Silva is a great boxer and he has experience to it. I think he still has the fire to beat Jake Paul on a boxing ring, So my bet is on Anderson Silva if ever this exhibition match happened.",

      "body": "I think Jake Paul hits harder than Anderson Silva. Jake is the bigger power puncher. While Anderson Silva has the better technique and boxing fundamentals. Its a power hitter (Paul) vs finesse and technique (Silva) match up. In Jake Paul's last fight, he hit Tyron Woodley with a solid right hand to the body. It must have hurt as Woodley spent the rest of the fight trying to avoid being hit with the same punch to the midsection again. The ending sequence came with Jake Paul faking a punch to the body. Woodley dropped his hand to parry what he thought would be a body punch. Jake Paul shot his right hand to the head instead to score the knockout. It was a basic setup that Woodley fell for. I don't think Anderson Silva will fall for that level of trap. Silva has options Woodley did not.Anderson Silva is my pick here. Although at age 47 it is possible that Silva has slowed down enough for Jake Paul's youth to win outright.",

Anderson Silva is a good fighter, but he already had his peak years ago and haven't been the same anymore since he was caught cheating through drugs usage to boost his performance. Age must be also a factor that can be strategically exploited by Jake Paul on the arena. Sometimes it's not solely about who is the toughest and strongest, but the smartest one who is able to use the disadvantages of the opponent against him.",

He still has a fast hand but his legs might just prevent him from moving away whenever Jake comes. Anderson struggle to balance after a spinning kick, he has to drop his hands to the ground.  He is not in good condition to fight a big young man like Jake.",

Nothing is wrong if this is an exhibition fight, I'm sure they consider letting people know is an exhibition but they are not saying yet. They already announce and set a day. It would be a shame for Jake to once again postponed the fight.  It possible but if not, its def Jake winning.",
