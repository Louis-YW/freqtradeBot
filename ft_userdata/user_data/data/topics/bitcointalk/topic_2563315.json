As we would have to do this in order to have Satoshis vision live on.It can destroy us, but we CAN stop it / delay it if we work together.",

      "body": "It would be impossible to say with certainty because quantum computers are still in development, but scientists estimate that they could be. Right now, public keys could be easily derived from private keys, but not the other way around. Deriving a private key from a public key would require a lot of computing power, so much that the conventional computers we have right now can't do it. What if quantum computers are powerful enough to do that though? They would have access to every address that has broadcasted a transaction, so each address would have to be emptied and trashed after use. This is why it's typically considered bad practice to reuse addresses, apart from privacy concerns.That being said, it's all theoretical. It's hard to find out the true capabilities of quantum computers given that they don't exist yet. For now, we can rest easy that it remains impossible.",

I honestly don't think so but i would like to hear other opinions and more importantly #Facts.  Yes it is possible to happen, Bitcoin private key and public key are generated through an encrypted algorithm that is really hard and almost impossible to solve while Quantum computers have the ability to run Shor’s algorithm and Grover’s algorithm that can break this private and public key encryption, but not only Bitcoin can be destroyed by this Quantum computers but also most of the existing cryptocurrencies but there is a quantum computing resistant cryptocurrency like IOTA (I don't know if there are other altcoins that is secure with QC). Quantum computers are also a threat in Bitcoin mining because if there is an individual that can use it for mining, it can solve every hash and mine every block before anybody else do it and it can mine all the remaining Bitcoin supply that is not yet in the circulation faster, that sucks.",

I honestly don't think so but i would like to hear other opinions and more importantly #Facts.  I think the concept of quantum computing is far from now and also why would anyone use that technique to mine the coin.  They might use it to more sensitive stuff like solving the question of humanity and how we came to life.  But lets say if we use it for bitcoin stuff then we will have to design it to work on it.  I mean though it is quantum computer it will still need to be coded for it. With the evolution it will start grasping the advances of bitcoin and then it will start working on it.",

In addition, perhaps many years after the development of quantum computing technology, there may be cracked keys, but then maybe bitcoin has become a history of coins, not worth breaking, that time may have more perfect function of the coin is we use every day.",

I said that SHA-256 was created by the NSA, and BTC is a baby of ZOG/GS/BIS;Don't need to talk shit about sha-256 hacking with QC, when it can be done by NSA anytime they wish.",

However, since we are always ready for the change over the period of time, we might replace today's technology to make it difficult for the quantum computers to crack. If I am not wrong then I think ETH has that ability today so even quantum computing can not crack it.",

About the same time that Cold Fusion is operationalIts amazing how detached from reality people are",

If quantum computers will exist then it will be impossible to crack bitcoin they will be needing beyond quantum computing by that time.",
