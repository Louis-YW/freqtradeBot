  "content": "There is the article titled \"Bitcoin’s Future Depends on Six Mysterious Coders\" in Wall Street Journal. “There have been numerous covert fixes,” Mr. Chow said in a phone interview\" quoted in the article. Andrew Chow is Bitcoin Core contributor. CSW doesn't attack him unlike others in the court cases [2023] EWCA Civ 83, where he contends: \"the developers (...) in this case control and run (...) bitcoin (...).\" and should transfer $BTC (equivalent to $4bn) to CSW. \"[Developers] contend that they have nothing like the power or control Tulip [CSW] alleges (...)\".It seems that Andrew Chow opinion expressed in the article could be used as argument against the defendants (Bitcoin Core maintainers) and supports CSW's claim. Do you agree?",

Get one of them to write something arbitrary into the code, and people will notice, question, likely protest.

I didn't realise Chow'd been \"promoted\" What's so mysterious about those developers? He's got an account here and he's never struck me as a guy shrouded in mystery.",

Do you agree?You didn't link the article or even quote Andrew Chow's opinion, so it is hard to agree or disagree with him.I believe that the effort by CSW to force the Bitcoin Core developers to make changes to the code is moot. Even if they are forced to add the feature requested by CSW, there is no requirement for anyone to use it.Furthermore, the developers that implement the feature could not be prevented from distancing themselves from it, or denouncing it, or even recommending that people avoid it. It is not clear that they would have to build on it, making it a one time release.I believe that if such a feature were incorporated into a version of Bitcoin Core, then most users will simply choose to skip that version.",

The devs responded to requests for interviews, and by way of gratitude, the journalists and their bosses label them \"mysterious\"? assholes, all of them",
