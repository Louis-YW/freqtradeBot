Can you explain why?One reason could be they're afraid of accepting/adopting because they think that it could be a harm to their government banking system.  But in fact, it is not.  Because each government has its own perspective view on Bitcoin, those government officials who are open-minded and willing to adopt crypto, better regulate it than if they don't have benefits from it because people can still use crypto even though it's banned in their country.QuoteMoreover, do you think that which country could be the first?It's given above, country of El Salvador was the first country that legalized Bitcoin.But this depends on your country, like my country it's not fully legally accepted but partially regulated.",

You should review the applicable laws in the country you want to know about. My country allows certain cryptocurrencies as commodity assets and prohibits them as means of payment.  So far only 2 countries have made bitcoin a legal tender(Elsalvador and Central Africa), the rest are prohibited and unregulated. But the majority of countries in the world allow cryptocurrencies to be traded on exchanges.",

I think Some African country also tried to follow the trend (Central African Republic) if I recall wellMost governments obviously don't want their citizens to adopt cryptocurrencies because they (the governments) will have no control over the crypto (In terms of printing more coins which Governments love doing in order to fuck up the economies)",

Google is free and I think even kids now know how to use that wonderful piece of tool for researching things. He can also make a search inside the forum. As long as it's related to crypto, I am sure that he can always found what he is looking for since this crypto forum is huge enough and it started long time ago.Indeed that lots of countries already legalize btc for trading or as an asset use while for purchasing or as a currency I think there is only two or three of them so far. The two of them were namely El Salvador and the second one is central African republic.",

Just like the country I belong to, there are many companies related to cryptocurrency that can operate here legally. Such as Coins.ph, Bitpinas, and other wallet apps that can be downloaded on mobile devices such as Maya, the gcash coming soon, and others that are currently completing the requirements that must be submitted to the BSP (Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas).Europe, Japan, and Singapore are just some of the countries I know that are open to cryptocurrency and some merchants enjoy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a mode of payment in their businesses as well.",

Can you explain why?Moreover, do you think that which country could be the first?Many countries are concerned about cryptocurrency price volatility. In addition, many regulators in various countries do not believe in the decentralized cryptocurrency system and are considered a threat to the current monetary system. On the other hand, countries that prohibit cryptocurrencies also usually use the argument that crypto assets are used for illegal acts such as buying and selling drugs and money laundering. Some countries clearly prohibit cryptocurrencies, while others have implemented policies that prevent crypto assets from getting support from the banking and financial systems to be traded and used in those countries.Here's one of the countries that ban cryptocurrencies:China: Chinese regulators blatantly prohibit the trading of cryptocurrencies, one of which is bitcoin. Any banks and other financial institutions such as payment service providers are prohibited from engaging in any activity related to cryptocurrencies. In addition, cryptocurrency trading is also prohibited in China. The Chinese government has also in the past year been busy implementing a ban on bitcoin mining activities in its country.",

And there's a prospect that in the next ten years to come more countries would be able to accept the use of bitcoin along side their local currency alternatively,Many countries that are currently not giving room to bitcoin to operate is as a result of the decentralization of the coin, every government wants a currency they can regulate  and be in charge over it's usage and for that they fear risking that economic power.",
