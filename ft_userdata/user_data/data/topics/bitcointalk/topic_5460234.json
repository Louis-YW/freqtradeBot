  "content": "I apologize to the moderators and to all the frequenters of the forum, I don't know which could be the right section.I have been using the electrum wallet for several years (very occasionally, i can say for two or three transactions a year).Today I couldn't remember my password (I tried the 6/7 that I usually use and none allowed me to access) and so I created a new wallet and entered the seeds I had saved.I found all the old transactions in this new wallet and I sent myself from binance, as I usually do, bitcoins for an equivalent of around €600.Inside the wallet, in the transaction history, I found two operations at the same time, one with the credit of what I had sent and the another one with the same amount but in negative. The result after 6/7 confirmations is that I have 0 in the wallet.What happened? I've lost everything? Please help me",

Either someone know your seed phrase or you device is infected with malware.I use passphrase with my wallet. Any loss would definitely be online. Passphrase can help, but it can also lead to loss of coins if you lost its backup, just like seed phrase. It is good to backup the seed phrase and passphrase differently in different locations.Also always make sure you avoid malware.For €600, you need a cold wallet for it. If you can not make yourself a cold wallet, buy a hardware wallet like Passport.",

And possibly you maybe accidentally upgraded it from 3.3.2(as you mentioned above) to a fake Electrum wallet before? Older version 3.3.4 are vulnerable to phishing attacks and they will push you to upgrade to the latest version if you click the popup with a phishing link it will bring you to a fake site with fake Electrum.Have you verified the installer before you upgraded the Electrum to the latest version? Have you also uninstalled and deleted the old version before you install the latest version?If not, then you've been hacked.",

I found it shocking because i never used electrum before and i was told to use it because it is open source and if it would contains any backdoors then they will be exposed but now i am wondered to think that how a person like you using after 2 or 3 years later, and didn't have the time to research about the wallet.Like, what has been happened till now, is there any phishing attacks going on. How a person like the OP would know when something will happen. I am so confused and don't know that should i use it. Because i can not remain that much active to keep tracking the activities of this wallet or maybe i have to follow some investigator from Twitter. Overall, the point is, such thing could also be done if your OS is not downloaded from the official platform, because a few weeks back i heard a news in which the OP said, hackers now had implemented Backdoors in the Cracked OS that you download from Pirated websites so that you don't have to pay fee for activation or if you might have used some software that was pirated and was compromised. Well in any cases, it might happen that, you fall prey to clipboard scam too in which your copied address is changed with scammers address in the clipboard of the System.",

Obviously you should only ever download from electrum.org, but an attacker could still compromise the Electrum website and upload malicious software there for users to download. The only way to be safe is to verify the software you download using the developers' PGP keys.Quote from: Faisal2202 on July 19, 2023, 05:16:10 AMI am so confused and don't know that should i use it.There are no backdoors or issues with Electrum itself. It remains perfectly safe to use provided you have downloaded the real version and verified prior to using it. OP has either downloaded a fake version or has leaked his seed phrase, and there is no issue with Electrum itself.",

At the very least, you already know that using a pirated OS is risky so as long as you don't use any pirated software then there should be no problem. Follows the suggestion to verify the file and so on above. I believe you can avoid what happened to OP as long as you have good security practices. I don't think following some security news is that difficult either, just visit this forum once in a while and see if there is any news related to any exploit. Most of the time people will post new threads if something major has happened.",
