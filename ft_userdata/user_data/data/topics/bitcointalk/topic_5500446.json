  "content": "I’ve spent hours digging through Sirius's /Martti Malmi email dump with Satoshi ( https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/ ). He decided to release these emails as some sort of evidence for the Craig Wright court case, I believe to help prove Craig is NOT Satoshi. If you haven’t dug in yet, holy shit do yourself a favor, it’s fascinating stuff !!Anyways, I noticed that the idea of the first bitcoin transaction being used as a medium of exchange for pizza was Sirius’s idea, as he used purchasing pizza with btc in the very first bitcoin FAQ on Bitcoin.org, something Satoshi asked him to create. Clearly a planned out event by early bitcoin “developers”, as you can see by BitcoinFX who hints/winks with his first post (“Bitcoin Hairdresser”) then shortly after asks why Laszlo’s proposing this, if he’s just hungry or ? ( as if he doesn’t know exactly why).  Laszlo plays along stating he “thought it’d be interesting to say he bought pizza with btc”. I know Laszlo was an early developer/helper (I don’t know if you’d call Laszlo a developer the same as I’m not sure if Theymos is/can technically be considered as such???).  I’m guessing BitcoinFX likely played a similar role helping Sirius & or Satoshi get BTC off the ground. (I’ve yet to dig in to their post history, so a full on assumption/guess). NewLibertyStandard (who happens to be the first “person” to create a bitcoin exchange, who Satoshi included in emails early on with Sirius due to his early adoption/creation of the exchange) as well as Sirius can be seen shortly after Laszlo making his announcement that a deal had been made, congratulating him.  Again, two early “devs” playing along, clearly.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0So the first transaction was no accident or something of sheer “light bulb idea, right place- right time” and a hungry belly. I’m assuming I’m not the first to mention this here on btalk but I couldn’t find any similar threads having done so  (Apologies mods if one has already been created and I’m just doubling up). Also, I can’t seem to find the original Bitcoin.org FAQ, as I’m curious/guessing the pizza for bitcoins faq Sirius drew up was posted as an example for at least a period of time   Perhaps Laszlo even discussed this eventually???  Any further insight to my assumptions would be appreciated.",

There’s no doubt in my mind the whole thing was conjured up with early development members. I also believe NewLibertyStandard was not just some random person who saw the BTC WP and decided “hey I’ll make an exchange for this super new digital money that has barely any eyes on it at the moment”. I believe it was created by Satoshi, but that’s just wild/just for fun speculation. If you read through the emails, this all becomes pretty clear/obvious.  Then think about how public Laszlo made the pizza purchases, even posting photos of himself AND his children’s eating them. This kind of stuff was vital for early day btc adoption. No question it was all well planned out.  Also surprising just how quickly Hal got “involved”. Just makes ya wonder, is all. I still half of that email thread to go through. Fantastic/interesting/entertaining ..a must read!",

Thats not that much important nowadays that whose idea was this and who started it. The main thing that we need to focus is that what will be the positive and negative impacts of this. Buying pizza from Bitcoin is not a joke as governments are not allowing Bitcoin to integrate into payments.It will be very difficult to get this idea practical we have to make sure that Bitcoin should be integrated with different payment gateways.

You can ask it directly with Sirius on his X account. If he decided to release many old emails, he did care to defend legitimacy of Bitcoin and I see that the fact behind Pizza for bitcoins is nothing bad for Bitcoin history and its future if Sirius confirms and explains information in the email.The pizza trade can be an idea from a random person or can be a combined discussion and initiative to make Bitcoin more popular. Whatever the fact is for that trade, it's a milestone and we don't have time traveling machine to revert it. The importance of the trade is massive and now, it's what it is.Who gave the idea is important, genius but who actually did it is the person made history.Did Laszlo Hanyecz exchange 40000 BTC for 8 pizzas, not 10000 BTC for 2 pizzas?To Hanyecz, who told Bitcoin Magazine that he spent something near 100,000 BTC on pizza that year, the purchase was just another drop in the bucket.",

We owe them all a great deal of gratitude ! Just like we do Theymos, lucky to have him still around...I hope one of these early devs writes a book eventually. Anyways everyone should read the GitHub thread above, you won’t regret it! Cheers.",
