  "content": "PLEXUS Interswap — Cross-chain Liquidity aggregatorWhat is Interswap?Interswap is a Cross-chain iquidity aggregator.It is a next-generation DEX aggregator that guarantees the fastest, the cheapest and the most secure multi step swaps across all blockchain networks and bridges with a single transaction.PLEXUS Interswap connects all blockchains and aggregates the liquidity. Users are now able to connect their wallets and start swapping any tokens across all blockchains instantly.What problems does Interswap solve?1. Complex swap process across different blockchains.Currently, liquidity on the blockchain ecosystem is fragmented in many different mainnets and users need to go through complex steps to swap one token on a blockchain to another token on different blockchain.Ex. In order for a user to swap a Polygon ERC-20 token to an Ethereum ERC-20, users have to go through steps below:① Exchange token in a Polygon DEX② Convert asset through a bridge③ Exchange token in an Ethereum DEXSolution: Interswap allows users to make fast and seamless swap across all blockchain networks by sourcing liquidity across muliple DEXs, DEX aggregators, AMMs, cross-chain DEXS and bridges.2. Gas feeDifferent coins are needed to pay the gas fee for each mainnet network.Ex. In order for a user to change an polygon ERC-20 token to an Ethereum ERC-20, three types of coins are required as follows.① Matic at Polygon DEX② Wrapped ETH at bridge③ ETH at Ethereum DEXSolution: Interswap allows users to pay network fees for different networks in PLEXUS token(PLX). Users won’t need to go to centralized exchanges.✨Live event✨① Referral Event for active community of PLEXUS ($10,000) - gleam.io/3rbMp/plexus② PLEXUS Promotional Event ($10,000) - https://forms.gle/yj6TsQwoSq3E3SWU8Web: https://www.plexus.app/Twitter: https://twitter.com/plexus_fiDiscord: https://discord.gg/M9cU9eQCyJ",
