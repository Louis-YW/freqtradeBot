  "content": "Hello, Bitcointalk!I found an old topic here about NanoGames. It's been few years and the site has gone through some changes, so it's time to make a new one!Welcome to NanoGames!Deposits and withdraws are instant.Over 1200 games to choose from, including live casino.Crypto swap is available in the cashier menu.Players have also the ability to use a vault and 2FA for extra security.Site has been in business for 5+ years and is in good name. At the beginning of 2022 they switched their site template to an older version of BC (BC2.0).Also for all of you out there who enjoyed Egyptian Slot this is the only place you can still play it.I would like to introduce a little giveaway for this community:25 free entries to the daily lottery draw to each new signup from this community as a gesture of good will. You could win the top prize of $100k free of charge. There is no wager or withdraw limits, what ever you win you can keep to play with or withdraw.Simply go to www.nanogames.io and click signup and then use code: 25drawLimit = 100 first new users.Tickets will be credited in maximum of 24 hours from sign up.If you used alternative signup options like Google or Metamask then don't worry!You still have the ability to use the code 24 hours after you have signed up, by locating a code box on the left side panel on the site.Crypto currencies that are available on site:Community is nice and friendly and when you are just bored the chat will be entertaining as well.Chat room languages available:Daily contest:Level up rewards and perks:Every time you level up based on your wagers you will get a bonus that is fully cashable at any given time. For example reaching level 22 will give you 24$, 30 will reward 60$ and 38 will reward 128$ and so on. The bigger the level the bigger the reward.NB! Many of you are probably familiar with BC and have heard rumors like SVIP Parties and cruises do not exists, I can not prove or disprove these rumors. However once you achieve SVIP status at NanoGames - You will be contacted and offered either a crypto bonus or a nice vacation, you will get a choice regardless.Invite your friends, because there is also an award winning referral system available:Best regards, good luck and enjoy your stay!",

The games icon and website themes complement to each other. I really like too the many exciting feature in terms of bonuses.I just notice that your github page doesn't updated since 5 years ago. I thought that you will include there the source code of your house games. What's the purpose of your github page for your casino because I don't see anything important on it that is worth including on your website.Lastly, what's the status of your casino license? Do you plan to get some?",

Bc.game casino template is very popular same with other top casino platform like Stake. Connecting them with this kind of proof will not gonna make your accusation strong. This casino just recently update their website probaby with new management but that doesnâ€™t mean they are scammer already. We still need proof for this.Quote from: markk1 on August 06, 2023, 03:41:36 PMThe operator in the live chat said that nanogames.io is not related to BC.game.
