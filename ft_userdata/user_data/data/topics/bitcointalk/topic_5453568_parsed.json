But then, after the bull run it has to lie low and have to go through a bear market which was the one that you've said wasn't favourable at all.Enough with saying or thinking that bitcoin is a scam if its price moves up. We're done with that and only those people that have no bitcoin are keep on saying that. But most likely when we see the price of bitcoin moves up, we're regretting that we haven't bought when it's cheap. Those that have been holding, there's no problem if that part was missed.",

How sure are you that bitcoin price has drastically reduced the number of bitcoin buyers, I think you should back your post up with proof, and how sure are you that most of us are not buying bitcoin anymore, let me be honest with you, the only time I will stop buying bitcoin is when I don't have any extra cash with me, but if am having money that I know I won't be using for now, then I can never stop buying bitcoin no matter how low bitcoin price is, because I believe bitcoin will be grate once again, it might just take time and am ready to wait.

Although it may not likely give another ATH, but since Bitcoin is a store of value, any time the price drops, it's really time to buy because, as time passes, the value will increase, leading to a price increase too.From the example you gave, no one needs to really regret anything if the price hits $50,000 any time soon. The reason being that they all had the chance to buy when the price was down, but they did not, so what they need to do is hold on for when the price drops, and they should buy if they truly wish to invest in Bitcoin.",

Kidding aside, I will not say that it will be a scam even though that thing will happen, but in reality it will not happen, or at least in an overnight. It might happen in a few weeks especially when the market is in a bull run. As for the bull run, I've seen the crypto market went into the bull run twice already (2017 & 2021). Did I felt shocked? Not at all. I didn't feel any happiness whatsoever during the last bull run, because I don't have plans on selling at that time. Turns out that it's my worst decision ever because I just let my potential profits slip. Instead of happiness, I felt disappointed on myself, but at the same time, it was a lesson learn. Like the OP said, keep buying Bitcoin as long as you are trusting it. Bitcoin is more than a year away, and a few months after that, the bull run will happen (base on it's past cycles).",
