But normally self this people supposed know say immediately you dey carry another person work as your own e no go well abi dem no do defense when dem been dey university. Plagiarism shouldn't be encouraged in any way and starting from today, any post wey just copy and paste link without any additional thoughts won't be merited by me and any newbies wey just dey come and create topics that are copied from other sources won't be rewarded as well.Thank you OP for drawing our attention to this disturbing matters arising. It's a bad image to this board if numbers of banned users keep increasing and they're all due to plagiarism. It doesn't say good about us and that has to change. Abeg make we dey be our brothers keepers as well. Whenever you see any plagiarism, immediately info the person so dem go correct their ways. E no make sense say we dey lose members instead of having a steady increase.",

Others have been banned for such acts in the past. Those few line of words aren’t yours, it was a case of word spinning, it’s grace that moderators are lenient with plagiarism nowadays and yours flew under the radar if not it would have straight up ban.
