I think that would be ok to speed up your transaction but do not forget to seek the services of an escrow so as not to loose your funds or being accused wrongly.You forgot to also state the nature of the transaction for clarity because that would warrant people to come to your rescue if it is what needs urgent attention. One would want to know why they must give out their bank account details to a total foreigner whom they have no access to neither have they  met before. And lastly, i hope you will be able to be kind to whom ever comes to your rescue because i know this is strictly business and all involved must in one way or the other benefit from it no matter how small the rewards might be.
