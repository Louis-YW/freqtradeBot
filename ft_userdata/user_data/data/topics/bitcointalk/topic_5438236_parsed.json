I found several things that made me quite uneasy and it'll be very nice if Aeddon team could appoint someone to answer with the capacity of their officials.If I may start from probably the easiest, is the site build by a website builder, on a free trial version? I saw this watermark on the bottom of each page, and if I may use wix as reference, it's basically there to persuade the user of the web-builder platform, on this case, Smilodo, to purchase paid membership and remove the mark.",

I look around --well, it's part of the DD i do for the community, I hope you understand if I'm being nosy-- and can confirm this ownership through this crunchbase page, as well as that I can see you're completely registered --since 2016, if I understand it correctly-- under Aeddon AG.Your story of beginning your journey with smilodo.com also matched the trace back done through waybackmachine, given you've launched smilodo back in October 2020 and only purchased the aeddon domain roughly one year later.May I ask, out of curiosity, why'd you decide to launch your own metaverse only now? I mean, these metaverse hype has been around since like... 2021? I honestly can't remember when does it start. So why now and what pushed you to finally build and launch your own metaverse?",

LOL, ok, I have to say it's quite rare that I smiled a when I'm conducting --well, typing-- a DD, yet here I am, grinning widely at the wittiness your postscript. Addressing it, the answer is a yes and, sadly, a no.Yes, finding the nature of your relation with Smilodo which leads to finding your web age --both of them--, domain history, and your license took a significant burden away from my mind. But no, I am not exactly at a relaxed state. If... you perhaps would indulge me on the people behind your project? It would took another slice from my plate.I can see the names and their avatar as their profile picture but since it's an avatar and the names are quite... overshadowed by other, more historically well-known people, I can't pinpoint on the exact people behind this team and verify if they're indeed a living being with records as stated on your pitchdeck, and the fact that the link to your linkedin on your website somehow... didn't work, made it even more difficult to verify and get assurance of the credibility of these team.Another thing that I'd like to know is your tokenomy. Do I understand correctly that team owned a 15% of the total supply, with the collective percentage under the team control for development, marketing, anspd advisors, minus the one frozen on vault, is 37%, while the sum of circulating supply available for the market is 33%?",

Need to check what people see if they are not logged in into LinkedIn.They'll see an authwall.I was actually logged into my account when I checked your LinkedIn. However, I think I've found the issue, your profile somehow won't work on mobile version. I was talking about the \"/m/\" part of the url, not the device mode.I tried to access your profile through my phone, both in mobile version and in \"desktop site\" and it shows as below. Removing the /m/ part --which take us to the full desktop version of LinkedIn-- clears this [see image next to it, pay attention to the address bar] Quote from: McStone on February 10, 2023, 10:28:16 AMRegarding the Tokenomics, I understand your concern about the 37% / 33% ratio that you mentioned.

Afterall, it's the community and your future investors that you need to convince. It'll be more convenient if anyone can access the info so they don't have to ask again and again in the future.",

I spent few good minutes searching their profile and name, just to be sure that they're indeed the person said in your updated pitchdeck, only to realize later that you've conveniently add link to each of their linkedin profile. I can see that some of them indeed listed Aeddon as their current employment, a prove that you didn't just grab random profile without the owner's knowledge. That's another thing clarified.I'll be happily waiting for your updated tokenomy so the community could also be rest assured of your project.",
