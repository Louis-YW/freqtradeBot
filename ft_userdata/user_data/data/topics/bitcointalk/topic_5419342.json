      "body": "I dont think it's possible , especially with apple pay. Apple pay interacts with an attached card and is very secured. There wont be a way to allow a 3rd party app to utilize this. Also converting crypto to fiat without commission is not possible. 1:1 rate or what not, there are still network fees and exchange rate difference. If you're referring to creating a platform which will convert those crypto deposits to google / apple gift cards, then there are already a few providers which provide this.",

Then you would issue them against the user's wallet balance, which requires a KYC from them. It is not something that a bunch of people can do remotely, it is heavily regulated.",

Now everything will be fast!BTCIf you were familiar with programming, you can probably make something pretty quickly (<3 weeks) using third party APIs. Places likePoof (self-service)1. https://www.poof.io/ | API docs: https://docs.poof.io/reference/poof-apiWyre (requires business) 2. https://www.sendwyre.com/are pretty well known for fiat/payment infrastructure. Just call some endpoints for address generation, payouts, and build some fancy Ui around it. If you wanted to make it yourself, there's likely a lot of regulation involved, business incorporation, exchange registration, and other spending involved.
