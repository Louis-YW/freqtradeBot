I think the most important factor to consider when choosing or switching to a career path is the fulfilment one derives from the job. I wouldn't be working in a place where I am not comfortable with the task or the task gives me much stress. It is important to select a career path that you like and derive joy and satisfaction in performing the tasks from the job. I have also seen jobs that is risky or  has health implications. The safety of the job is very important to me. I wouldn't accept a career path that exposes employees to toxic materials regardless of the financial rewards attached to it. I consider my health or security first before money. I don't think I would ever be a banker that follows bullion vans because of the risk of armed robbery attacks.",

That is:We have large savings of hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars from our previous business or job as accommodation for our lives for 1 year. With that, even though we are currently focusing on learning the profession that is our passion, our family's needs can still be met. but if you don't have enough savings, then do whatever job the most important is the high salary.",

I have also been in the position you are talking about, everything feels tired and stressful every night.Ways or tricks to switch jobs if you think your job can be better and more comfortable, because this is a problem that lies within yourself, whether it's satisfaction, comfort or whatever it is, you can always feel grateful for what you have and take advantage of better job opportunities in terms of anything from your previous job, even though basically the skills learned for a new job are still minimal, and the most important thing to consider is how long you will work at that company until you can fulfill what you need in the future.",

Also, some situations that I have been that I have to leave a job that offers really great skills and improvement because I choose freedom over it. There really many different factors that we have to consider upon taking our career paths. In the end of it, choose what's going to make you happy and excited to work everyday. Yeah, that's true because even if how skilled you are but the working environment isn't that fun and not giving you the happiness that you should have, you'll just resign soon.",

Irrespective of the pay which is no doubt important, I think it doesn’t hurt to stay positive as well.

But not all companies can do it and only employees who have the ability get that opportunity. An increase in salary will affect lifestyle and maybe stress because the job will provide more pressure than the previous job.Maybe only studying job descriptions and knowing what to do at work can help us improve our ability to work.

Have a good reason before you choose to abandon a career path for another. Changing career means starting afresh in something that other people have started long before you, it may not be the best choice. A better choice is choosing to improve and become more advanced in the career that someone has already started to create better opportunities for yourself if finance is the motivation for wanting another career, except the problem and need to change career is not finance driven.",

If the 1st choice career as a liberal arts musician or painter doesn't work out. They might have an exit strategy and college degree which would allow them to fall back on a secondary career.There are famous cases of this being put into practice. Famous real estate mogul A.D. Kessler is known for having real estate as an alternative career option, while a career in radio (if I remember correctly) being his 1st. With the rise of modern day job automation and job security not being what it used to. There is a question mark as to which career options might be viewed as being durable and reliable under current economic conditions. Which would open the door to them serving as good fall back points.Knowledge and skill of stock market investment was considered another good skill for youth and teens to develop. Which might allow them to someday fall back upon stock and asset investment, in case their alternative career option doesn't pan out.With the conventional wisdom perhaps being on a decline. People could search for other options. It will be interesting to see what we come up with.",

There will be a lot of positive values when we prioritize happiness and health at work rather than working with a high enough salary but stress on happiness and mental health will be dangerous for the future which might make you a person stressed by that job and become a madman later.",

Are you looking for a job base on vacancy only because it seems you are doing it that’s why you landed on different jobs that you didn’t like until now.I can’t relate much on your situation because I’m working white collar job with my profession. I spend year job hunting just to get my desired job based on my profession when I’m newly licensed professional. I already have 10 years experience on same company that I first work and our competitor companies are trying to offer me a better job salary.Maybe you should start finding your fashion on finding your job. Priority first your desired job over salary just to gain experience so that you can demand for higher salary once you find another related to your job.",

Because everything will lead to one goal, namely everything that must be determined based on freedom. When we are still working, like it or not we are bound by a company contract that requires us to comply with all of these regulations.Before you decide to quit your job and take on assignments according to your skills, you need to consider a well-thought-out plan and make sure that the finances that will be generated really make you feel enough. At least enough for family needs. Reducing the excessive lifestyle of expenses that are not too important.So you have to be prepared for all the risks because basically starting a new task outside of your usual habits as a company employee is of course very different. Even though you are free to manage your time, that doesn't mean you have to be lazy, but you have to be much more active and record achievement targets in as much detail as possible.",
