Hence the chance of me selling my bitcoins is minimum even if case of a huge dump back to three digit prices in USD. Besides, the options to sell in my country are limited without having to go through a huge tax barrier.But I believe this might not be true for many other members of this forum who might have only invested in bitcoin till date because they started late or their liquid cash situation is not that good. Most emergency situations happen without warnings and they draw the maximum money out from savings.When it comes to trading, a veteran trader can hodl through bear markets without having any emotions because they have a lot of backups to keep them afloat, including different assets they are invested in and the <10% allocation to risky investments technique.",

Health reasons are perhaps at the top of the priority list, because what kind of person would he be if he didn't want to help himself or a member of his family. Some people have pre-defined exit points, others are smart and know how to profit during a bull run, and then buy cheaply during corrections and bear markets. Anyone who has the courage to sell it above $50k and more not only made a profit, but could buy a few BTC for that amount and calmly wait for a new bull market. Personally, I have no problem using BTC as a currency, or exchanging it for fiat regardless of the price - but not everyone has the same starting positions and that is something that needs to be taken into account.",

Selling temporarily to buy back later is smart. Not selling at all is foolishness.",

There’s no reason for me to hold if I really have no other money to get for my personal needs because I can always buy back at any price and continue my holding at different price entry. What matter most for me when it comes to holding is I don’t sacrifice my personal needs in exchange for more gains since the reason of my holding is for my own benefits in the future and it’s useless if my current life is waste just because I keep holding than use the money I invest for my needs.I’m sure at some point I can hold again if ever I spend the money.",

But if you lack liquid cash to spend and BTC in your wallet, you surely have to spend your BTC, not only when you are forced to, but also to take care of yourself.People should also get used to it that BTC is a currency, and they should spend the currency itself if they can, they do not have to be forced to spend or sell it before they do.",

Does that mean that you think people who held through a cycle weren't smart?Some people don't want to be exposed to exchanges and their KYC. Some people have no means to store 70k USD in cash and don't trust banks enough to move their lifetime savings there so they choose bitcoin. I wouldn't call that stupid. The way I see it, I'm going to keep adding to my bitcoin collection as long as I can. I'll probably sell some of it if we ever move above 100000 dollars to celebrate the event and buy myself a reminder, a gratification gift. If we keep going lower than we are today I'll never sell. Low prices will not make me panic that I'm sure of. The only thing that will push me to sell is a large price spike.",

Is family or health challenge enough reason to?\"Hold\" is a very familiar word to us. Everyone who works with cryptocurrency knows this term. But no matter how easy the word hold is, actually holding is a very difficult task. When a trader or holder starts holding, there is an invisible pressure on him. But while those who financially independent are different, there will be a lot of pressure on others. There are certain circumstances that will force you to sell your assets, including if a holder sells for family health reasons apart from such problems if some people buy asset with borrowed money but if its price falls he can no longer take the risk then such a situation can force him to sell. But strong holders can never sell their holdings in any adverse situation.",
