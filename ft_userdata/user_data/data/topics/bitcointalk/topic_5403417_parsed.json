The government also can't afford to lose a day's revenue as they heavily rely from its fund. Economy shouldn't stop.Applying the Zero Covid Policy I think which this  could just be temporary, they exclude the casino players after all most of the gamblers in Macao are tourist.",

And probably this is going to be just temporary, as they can't afford a full blown lock down again. But the problem is:QuoteMacao only has one public hospital with its services already stretched on a daily basis.",

Gambling in Macau includes more than 50% of their GDP. Closing this revenue inflow would kill their economy and take it into a recession. Also, through the Macau casinos are where large money laundering rings for mainland Chinese millionares are located. It might be something similar to a highly industrial country if they closed their factories.",

I guess that's where the bulk of casino users come from if they were to let casinos stay open and yet close down restaurants (which is still odd imo, but eh whatever). Though then again it's understandable since as the article said, the majority of the income they get is from casinos. They might just be doing this since they're still on the testing phase, they might also close down casinos later on if the results prove to be on the bad/worse side.",

The government must have recognized how essential offline casinos are integral to the joy of their citizen and are just looking to keep them happy.

Coronavirus Covid - 19 is a very serious disease.  It is spread by airborne droplets.  Medical masks help prevent infection, but are not a panacea.  The main way to stop an epidemic is to avoid crowds.  It is very easy to get coronavirus in offline casinos.  Therefore, in my opinion, the Macau authorities should actively encourage the creation of online casinos.  Online casinos are safe from the point of view of the possibility of infection with coronavirus.",

So they are not going to close them again even if the COVID numbers are increasing. People have stopped fearing Covid and I believe it is now more important for people to feed their family than to staying at home. We have already seen an example of Sri Lanka due to covid and few external matters. Macau certainly wouldn't want that fate for themselves. I think it's all fine for the government to continue with the casinos as it's very closely related to their GDP.",
