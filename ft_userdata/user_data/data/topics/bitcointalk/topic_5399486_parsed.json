We can say that investing it is so risky for now but lets give the dev a chance on how he can settle this huge problem occur to them.",

The holders have choice whether they wanna try to sell their old luna or keep. As far as i know both of blockchains will be co exist but again there's a very big chance for the next luna to be another fail again for sure. Quote from: Mark301 on May 20, 2022, 10:59:40 AMand do you think it will be beneficial because most people have lost trust in them and lost all the investmentsIt's not only retail investors who have been loosing the trust but big VCs and various companies have been loosing a lot of money in this garbage coin. Why do they need to bet more on this scam coin if they have another choice to invest in the market that's proven to be even better than luna?",

I mean they are not dead or something so you can still send those old tokens around and even sell them on exchanges like pancakeswap or something if you find someone that buys it from you by mistake.I don't really know what to think about the Luna relaunch as i am not following it that closely because i don't own any Luna myself but such a relaunch could be the only hope that is left for Luna holders.. so good luck.",

The question is, if all LUNA v2 supplies are shared, then in the future what kind of ecosystem will they build in LUNA v2 so that it can be as big as the previous LUNA. Because I think it's impossible to build LUNA v2 with the same ecosystem as before, not only because of its weaknesses, but also very minimal investor confidence.",

But in my opinion, whatever plans they have in the future, it will not be enough to bring back the confidence of investors to them. Whatever airdrops or burn strategy or reconstruction plan they have, they will still fall from grace. The most that the investors will do is maybe get half of what they lost and then go on and move to other alt coins and stay away from Luna or from people behind this project.",

Trust rating went in the wind, just like that. But if you are like some investors who want to take the higher risk then go for it, who knows, right? I have been in the crypto industry for a lot of years and I don't see many miracles that do happen. Most of it is just in Bitcoin or in Ethereum but if we are talking about other alts, once they are down they mostly stay there.Like I said, who knows? There's a big network on the internet now and social media could create a big impact to increase the support of a project that lost its trust. But, I would not expect too much if ever I am in the position of buying it.",

But from the proposal I don't see how they explain what their project plan is in LUNA v2. I don't know if they're still starting plans, or if it's deliberately not going to be published in the near future, but with this we can't really believe it.",

All holder during pre-attack will surely get the benefits on it since they already sold during the attack get some money while there bag will be fully refund even though they are not hodling anymore since the snapshot they are taking is the pre-attck block. This is a total disaster for those who bought on the exchange during the dump because all those Luna classic can’t received airdrop while the project will abandon already so the traders who bought the dip will be holding useless tokens. I doubt that the fork Luna will gonna have a huge value after the launch.",

The lesson to be learned, this is crypto can even live when others mourn its fate. because I know the scenario of lesting and delisting in several exchanges. I don't hold back and have high expectations of Luna) good background and reputation is no guarantee. For Luna v2 I don't think as far as people mumbling in my ear.
