  "content": "We all Some still remember that Bitcoin was built based on a libertarian and crypto-anarchic ideology. Although Satoshi only rarely referred directly to politics or libertarianism, he expressed Bitcoin's spirit in various, subtle ways. Maybe the best example is the very message embedded into Genesis block: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\". After Bitcoin was created he also offered us this forum. Indeed, it was hosted on another site back then, but it still was \"Satoshi's forum\".Many users / individuals back then understood the libertarian and crypto-anarchic views of Bitcoin and they embraced them. Many were also well educated and used to read books written by Ayn Rand or by well known economists which followed Austrian School, such as Murray Rothbard, Friedrich August von Hayek or Ludwig von Mises. (Did you know that even Ross Ulbricht was a passionate libertarian and a very educated person? Among others, the secret word he used to identify himself when he used to talk to DPR was Murray Rothbard -- ever thought of that?)I, myself, had the chance to put my hands on Ayn Rand's magnum opus Atlas Shrugged, a book of 1356 pages, which is considered, by American readers, the second most influential book, after the Bible.And I could not let the book from my hands until I finished reading it. It is impressive and, most important, the real message is not expressed by the fiction presented inside the book, but through what you read between the lines...After I found this forum I used to find so many libertarian topics, written in the past. Or topics written by anarchists or crypto-anarchists. Many of them were very interesting, such as:- Quick guide to becoming a libertarian... -- written in 2011- Send all the libertarians to prison and beat it out of them -- written in 2011- Libertarianism and externalities -- written in 2011.And the list can go on.But nowadays you can't see any new topics anymore on these matters. I found a few (and very interesting) ones, which were written in 2020:- Murray Rothbard Quotes on Libertarianism, Economics, and Freedom- Ayn Rand Quotes on Capitalism, Government, Philosophy, and More- Friedrich A. Hayek Quotes on Socialism, Economics, and More.And I think that the lack of such topics / subjects is a loss, a loss not felt directly, but indirectly. This is because Bitcoin was built on libertarianism and crypto-anarchism. You can't have it wihtout these concepts. Therefore, I ask: Libertarians -- where are they now? Crypto-anarchists -- where are they now? Where are you now?Was our Bitcoin completely surrounded and overwhelmed only by those which are greedy and see inside it only a way to get rich? Is our Bitcoin only another way for CEX owners to fill their pockets? Doesn't anyone remember its libertarian principles...?Topic is self-moderated for avoiding spam.",

Perhaps one of these 'alt' flavors of anarchism might work in some fashion. not so interested in them, but as long as they mind their own business, it's neither here nor there to me if they try it out.I lost interest in talking about the concepts; it is what it is, and arguing about it is to fall into re-creating the problems of politics, but with new labels for the groups. I did it myself really just now; I firmly state that entering into a discussion where divisions of libertarian doctrine are discussed is exactly what an opponent of libertarian ideas would like to see. It's not that hard to state the basics plainly, so arguing about the basics for any reason falls into the \"don't care whether trolling or stupid\" category",

I'm not entirely sure why that happened, or why they claimed to be libertarians in the first place.

      "body": "Interesting article, I've reached my 50-Merit limit for your posts unfortunately, so don't worry, I'll come back here later.  It’s really difficult to \"label\" Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is only code, I wouldn’t label it as anything. It’s just Bitcoin. Bitcoin has so many aspects and yes, we could \"label\" some of these aspects but we won’t get a clear picture what Bitcoin, as a whole, really is: -   Libertarian = it’s your own money, you only need to remember 12 words-   Progressive = a completely new technology-   Conservative = Bitcoin will help to conserve your monetary value (hard money, capped at 21M coins)-   Anarchist = Bitcoin is anti-dictatorship money-   Constitutionalist = Code is law! -   Transparent = everyone can verify if a transaction happened, coins were moved etc.-   Private = people can take some steps to protect privacy-   Democratic = run your own node and participate in the Bitcoin network-   …. (I could add dozens more)And yes, some of these single aspects can be labelled as \"anarchist\" or \"libertarian\" etc. but for (most likely) everything I can argue for the exact opposite. Let’s take \"anarchist\", implying that means \"unchained\". At the same time, Bitcoin is completely the opposite of \"anarchist\" because Bitcoin is indeed following the same rules- for everyone. The rules are defined in the code. Bitcoin is \"unchained money\" and \"coded Blockchain money\" at the same time. There are so many explanations, what Bitcoin is. We could write some educated books about it, we wouldn’t find the answer because such an answer does not exist in my opinion. Crypto Anarchists, like Eric Hughes, Tim May, John Perry Barlow or David Chaum have been the earliest adopters but I’m in doubt if they want to be labelled from an economic side. Especially, I’m in doubt if they would want to be associated with what some \"Libertarians\" are intending, as \"what’s Libertarian?\" is hard to explain: there are so many people who claim to be \"Libertarians\" but when they are explaining their vision, I’ve so far not come to a conclusion what their end goal really is: For example, let’s take people like Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Jeff Bezos just constructed a new \"support yacht\" because his new Superyacht needs a support yacht, where he can land his helicopter. Sounds completely exaggerated? Yes – but it’s true. How could that happen? By wrongly applied \"Libertarianism\" because people like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk or Peter Thiel are seeing \"Libertarianism\": \"Nobody needs to follow any rules\". But that will ultimately fail. Jeff Bezos is buying a \"support yacht\" for his new sailing yacht because he has too much money...Elon Musk is orchestrating a shitshow on Twitter as he has done for Tesla (Tesla’s stock is down 60%, so many people lost money). Peter Thiel is CEO of a private surveilance company (Palantir), and that company is know for spying on normal people. At the same time, he’s calling himself a \"Libertarian\" while he’s openly opposing the free market because in his opinion, monopolies are better. That has nothing to do with \"liberal / libertarian\" values. A free and fair marketBut in his \"Libertarianism\", he’s allowed to create a monopoly, to crush the free market because Thiel simply can do it due to his wealth (and get even more wealthy from his monopoly). There’s a great article about Thiel’s bullshit here. And similar to Thiel, many rich people are pushing such a \"Libertarian\" strategy. \"Libertarian\" has become a sponge word used by everyone and the people pushing this \"Libertarianism\" (which is exactly the opposite of that what would be really beneficial for normal people like getting rid of powerful structures abusing anything to their advantage) just want to replace currently existing rules with their own rules. And that’s where I’ve questioned how to turn Libertarian theories into reality because always someone like Bezos, Thiel or Musk will come and abuse a vacuum of power. It’s very important to understand the consequences of a vaccum of power. Some Libertarian theories explicitly try to remove any rules but when there are no rules (vacuum), this vacuum will be filled by those who have or will quickly accumulate power (money). Maybe you’ve also played monopoly (the game). There are some rules how to play but it always turns out when very late in the game one person owned all of the streets, placing hotels on it and everyone else goes bankrupt (because you can’t pay your rent). That’s a likely outcome how Thiel’s vision would escalate quickly. On a much bigger scale than our monopoly of course, where the monopoly game could be your city. It’s not a secret that when there are no rules, chaos will arise. Just imagine the forum where no DT would be active, no rules would be in place and spam piling up because it’s not getting deleted. Some players filling this vaccum might be nice, get powerful but don’t do many harmful things. Some other players filling the vaccum might be the opposite and they will abuse any vaccum for their profit. And these evil players will crush everyone, nobody could stop them at one point. Similar like Thiel intends to construct his monopoly: remove all rules and when all rules are removed, use your money (power) to establish your own (insane) rules (his monopoly). Netzpolitik.org, the site where I’ve linked the article above, calls Thiel’s vision \"anti-democratic Libertarianism\". And that’s exactly what Thiel is trying to do: trying to dictate the rules himself. That’s vacuum of power. I can’t see in regard of Libertarian visions any concept of how the end game could suceed. Libertarians (or what some people claim to be) have provided interesting visions and part of that are very important and also relevant for Bitcoin. But the end game from Libertarianism is similar like Communism, it just doesn’t work because it’s quickly abused by a small, wealthy and powerful group of people. So far, nobody could address arising problems of these visions, both Communism and Libertarianism. Most likely \"Libertariansm\" is an utopia itself and Bitcoin is what we need to understand, how to fix some flawed libertarian thoughts. Bitcoin is so powerful on so many layers and it will probably teach us to understand some flaws of Libertarianism and other aspects because Bitcoin is addressing the vaccum of power issue. There’s a big difference between what Libertarian theories say and what Bitcoin says. Bitcoin is following clear rules, everything is certain. There’s no vacuum of power in Bitcoin. So, to come back to my initial conclusion: In my opinion, Bitcoin is a big mixture of different characteristics and the mixture is very well evaluated making Bitcoin so promising. It’s libertarian, constitutional, progressive, conservative, digital and verifiable at the same time. But removing the flaws for what Bitcoin does. Something like Bitcoin has never existed before because it’s completely unique. And in my opinion, it’ll never be possible to \"label\" Bitcoin properly because Bitcoin is so unique.",

And in this context it's somewhat ironic, because libertarianism is a pure form of capitalism, and this is what capitalism looks like on practice - people care about money first. People don't mind sacrificing privacy and control over their funds when they use centralized exchanges, because it allows them to make money more conveniently and cheaper. It seems like libertarianism is at odds with itself.",

I believe people have addressed those problems (usurping structural changes in the political system) even on this forum before, I certainly remember talking on it myself.and yes, you might well conclude though that Bitcoin is also anti-democratic too, depending on your definition of democracy. for sure, it has already begun to re-shape the nation state, and may not stop until the re-invention leaves the state unrecognizable; I expect the former country's name will be the only characteristic that sticks. And not a single vote will be held that could endorse it or stop it (legislators \"legalizing\" something that's impossible to enforce against is never any more than an attempt to avoid looking weak/incompetent)Unfortunately, a power vacuum is exactly what that kind of scenario has as it's destination, although temporarily perhaps. But the system we're presently living in really is nothing more than anarchism gone wrong; the smartest, least ethical gang leaders turned the world's successful tribes into a series of elaborate yet thinly disguised cults. Maybe the gold money revolution started it all? Now that would be an unpalatable irony. The picture you paint of Thiel is arguably more benevolent than what we're enduring now (of which Thiel himself is simply a execrable component, albeit a valuable one to the ruthless). At least with Thiel, he himself makes it plainly obvious that he's a snake. Or at least I would hope it's obvious.And so the answer to me is that some critical mass of people see we're an anarchic system that was overrun by jackals and coyotes, and that we can expect the same cycle to endlessly repeat until we recognize it",

Because we are not libertarian, why do kids go to school and not work 7 days 8 hours a day in sweatshops? Well because we are not libertarian, honestly USA is close to being libertarian when it comes to companies, more than most other nations, lower taxes, ways to avoid taxes, Nike putting their patent company at Belize stuff? Well certainly not helpful to the world.Me and many other people believe that if we go full on libertarian, we would be horrible, because greed is unlimited, and we are going to be in a world of pain and humanity can't just flow like water and find the right place, it would go off a cliff like a waterfall instead. I am not saying the some people have good intentions, they do, they really do have good intentions and by all means governments and their interventions SUCK, so its normal to want them out of the way and that's good. But right now, the whole world is saying government terribleness, only because without them it would be even worse, that's why libertarianism wouldn't work, and doesn't work.",

It might be considered as \"taking place\" into something, but change doesn't come according to the number of nodes that demand it. Proof-of-Work is a voting system, but it doesn't bring change. It is only to sustain the current system, with current rules; not to change them. A 51% attack isn't changing what's valid. Quote from: 1miau on January 05, 2023, 11:39:28 PMSome Libertarian theories explicitly try to remove any rules but when there are no rules (vacuum), this vacuum will be filled by those who have or will quickly accumulate power (money). And in which place there are no such rules? As far as I'm concerned, very few countries live on free enterprise, with minimum government intervention. In most countries, government steps in regularly. Quote from: 1miau on January 05, 2023, 11:39:28 PMIt’s not a secret that when there are no rules, chaos will arise.What you describe is anarchy. Not libertarianism. The former is described by lack of moderation. The latter is described by lack of government intervention in most (if not all) market activities.",

      "body": "Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on January 04, 2023, 06:31:31 PMWe all Some still remember that Bitcoin was built based on a libertarian and crypto-anarchic ideology. Although Satoshi only rarely referred directly to politics or libertarianism, he expressed Bitcoin's spirit in various, subtle ways. Maybe the best example is the very message embedded into Genesis block: \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\". After Bitcoin was created he also offered us this forum. Indeed, it was hosted on another site back then, but it still was \"Satoshi's forum\".Many users / individuals back then understood the libertarian and crypto-anarchic views of Bitcoin and they embraced them. Many were also well educated and used to read books written by Ayn Rand or by well known economists which followed Austrian School, such as Murray Rothbard, Friedrich August von Hayek or Ludwig von Mises. (Did you know that even Ross Ulbricht was a passionate libertarian and a very educated person? Among others, the secret word he used to identify himself when he used to talk to DPR was Murray Rothbard -- ever thought of that?)I, myself, had the chance to put my hands on Ayn Rand's magnum opus Atlas Shrugged, a book of 1356 pages, which is considered, by American readers, the second most influential book, after the Bible.And I could not let the book from my hands until I finished reading it. It is impressive and, most important, the real message is not expressed by the fiction presented inside the book, but through what you read between the lines...After I found this forum I used to find so many libertarian topics, written in the past. Or topics written by anarchists or crypto-anarchists. Many of them were very interesting, such as:- Quick guide to becoming a libertarian... -- written in 2011- Send all the libertarians to prison and beat it out of them -- written in 2011- Libertarianism and externalities -- written in 2011.And the list can go on.But nowadays you can't see any new topics anymore on these matters. I found a few (and very interesting) ones, which were written in 2020:- Murray Rothbard Quotes on Libertarianism, Economics, and Freedom- Ayn Rand Quotes on Capitalism, Government, Philosophy, and More- Friedrich A. Hayek Quotes on Socialism, Economics, and More.And I think that the lack of such topics / subjects is a loss, a loss not felt directly, but indirectly. This is because Bitcoin was built on libertarianism and crypto-anarchism. You can't have it wihtout these concepts. Therefore, I ask: Libertarians -- where are they now? Crypto-anarchists -- where are they now? Where are you now?Was our Bitcoin completely surrounded and overwhelmed only by those which are greedy and see inside it only a way to get rich? Is our Bitcoin only another way for CEX owners to fill their pockets? Doesn't anyone remember its libertarian principles...?Topic is self-moderated for avoiding spam.The ones you talk about, the one who are init for the true libertarian word are still in it. However the world and especially the crypto industry has changed a lot for the worst and now we all have to lay low. It doesnt mean that we have abandoned the general idea, ot means that we will only go out when there will be the need. Bitcoin was made by libertarians for libertarians and it will be always like that.",
