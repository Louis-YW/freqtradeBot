  "content": "I have some miners that I wish to sell due to some unforseen personal financial issues (Job loss).  I have 3 Caanan Avalon 1166 (79TH, 81TH and 81TH).  2 of the units have blown PSUs (A spike at the host farm caused this) and should be relatively easy to fix.  The Antminer S19j (104TH) is currently hosted at the farm but can be transferred either physically or the new owner takes on a new lease at the farm (North Carolina).  The 3 Caanan units are available for immediate shipping.  I haven't had the funds or time to repair the PSUs (this is a presumption but from what I gather is the very likely cause).Make me a reasonable offer (US$/BTC) if interested.  We can discuss.",
