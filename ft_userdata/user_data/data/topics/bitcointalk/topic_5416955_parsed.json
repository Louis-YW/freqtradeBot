SOAT made a video for the 5800x3D and the hashrates are not much higher than the normal 5800xFirst, many user can´t optimize their cpu´s right for randomX for example (also SOAT) - a normal 5800x can reach with 16 threads running, around 12,5 kh 5800x3D                           Verushash: around 22,5 mhGhostrider: average 3,38 khRandomX (monero): 9600 h cryptonite heaven: 1230 hdero: 70 - 80 khsource:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2HKW3Rw_c4&t=808s5800xVerushash: around 20mhGhostrider: average 2,8 khRandomX: around 9000 hSo not much improvements with the extra cache over the normal 5800x.

FP91G is a known member here, and no faker  Agreed.It was not my intention to single out one individual but to highlight the issue. Well known users tend to be trusted more implicitly andmalicious actors will try to use them to spread their misinformation. This case was trivial and wasn't a good example to make my point.Edit: another possible angle to this particular case, it's easy to fake the CPU ID.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cpu-renamer-rickroll-trolling-benchmarks",
