Hope you will also have a good laugh with this news. Some people will not see what is right all because they are old fashion people. Even when bitcoin was low in price, there were many critics including Warren Buffett and Peter sheriff and many of them, but bitcoin has let us know that these people are only just not knowing what is right about bitcoin. Probably they do not want to invest because they have other means of income but that does not mean that they are not all wrong. All I know is that bitcoin is a store of value.",

His bank however is involved indirectly with crypto, especially with the etfs. So it’s funny how the guy says it’s a bad thing but as long as his bank can make money off it, he is ok with that. Basically completely two faced.Either that or it’s a completely different division of JP Morgan which deals with the bitcoin etfs. A division he has less control over. That would make more sense.",

With that kind of statement, I think that it's a really good idea to recommend him to stop yapping about bitcoin because ain't no way that people ever cared about his statement and his words about not investing or being convinced that bitcoin is a thing is as empty as his soul, it don't mean anything for him or any of us because even if he doesn't invest in bitcoin, he's still a rich self-centered attention seeking annoying goblin so to the people that are still caring about what this hoodlum in a suit says, it's high time that you stop doing that because the less people that care about what he has to say about bitcoin, the less he's becoming relevant, the reason that he's probably this way anyway is because he wants the exposure and ire of the bitcoin community not to mention that it also generates his company some exposure.",

Hope you will also have a good laugh with this news. Jamie Dimon I don't know about the ending. But if he is influential, I don't mind his reaction because it seems ridiculous to compare Bitcoin, a store of great value, to smoking. Maybe he said that to make himself viral. We see many people doing many dramas in many ways to make themselves viral, maybe he did that. I don't compare it to any other bitcoin as I always think it is very valuable.",
