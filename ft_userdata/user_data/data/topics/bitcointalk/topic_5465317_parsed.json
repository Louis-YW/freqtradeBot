Just a quick background of what Prime Trust is, it's a fintech company that manages assets of its customers, yeah a custodial service. See the reference:Quote from: https://www.cbinsights.com/company/prime-trustPrime Trust is a financial technology company. It provides trust and custody services to cryptocurrency and digital asset businesses. The company was founded in 2016 and is based in Las Vegas, Nevada. In August 2023, Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy.Going on, they've filed for Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) and if we're going to search for some reasons behind that. Mostly, it's all about the mismanagement, liquidity issue and misuse of its customers funds, etc. which is written all over several articles: Crypto Custodian Prime Trust Files for Bankruptcy Crypto custodian Prime Trust files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Crypto Custodian Prime Trust Files for Bankruptcy Protection and many more...Now the part that I've like to share is their negligence of one of the main reason why they fell is because its owners have lost the control to their keys. Yes, you've heard that right, they've lost the seed phrase of their wallet.Crypto Startup Bankrupt After Losing Password To $38.9 Million Physical Crypto WalletThey've got tons of customers and money on their custody and they just lost it. Maybe a planned exit? or just truly negligence of its owners. This is the reason why we shouldn't keep funds into these centralized/custodial services and exchanges.",

To be honest, I feel sad for the ones who lost their funds, but AFAIK, if they would hire someone good at investigation, then the chances are that they might get access to the key.

But there is an obvious thing that those who are well aware of the nature of BTC know: what it is promoting and why people are adopting it, referring to its decentralization nature. Then why would people deposit their funds or BTC on such a platform that cannot even hold their hands on the keys and recovery phases they have made?This definitely looks like a rug-pulling plan, but we should not jump to conclusions so fast; instead, read the whole story. But honestly, even after reading the story, it seems so unbelievable to think that a company mainly made to provide protection services has lost the key to their wallets. I mean for real.A lot of companies are just some shell companies which are used for bad purposes like Money laundering and these companies are mostly not new. They are old ones to gain trust of the people on it and when they gain enough money they do this. As they have a legit reason to. I hope this issue will be resolved with the help of some recovery operation if some legit investigator will do it.",

I was thinking it was some kind of company that is based on helping users keep their wallet phrases and private keys safe, and I almost said there should be little to nothing to worry about here since users can still reclaim their funds if they have the access at their end intact. But this is not the case, and all funds in custody are in their hands.But what the heck is wrong with some institutions, like exchanges, where customers will trust you with their funds security as if that's not enough, and you as an exchange will take these funds and entrust them with other bodies that you see as more professional bodies to manage those funds? What's the stress of creating a multi-signature wallet and taking security upon yourself by knowing what responsibilities you have to play to make sure that customers funds are secured?But let me ask a question because this still seems unclear to me: were there some kind of benefits that depositors get by giving out their holdings for prime trust to hold, or are they still the ones to be charged for prime trust security charges? I'm just wondering what will happen to the faith of Coinsbit customers who have their funds stored with the exchange if this escalates more than this and it appears that there is no coming back of those lost funds.Another good incident to remind the public that “Not your key, not your coin”...",

Yes, you've heard that right, they've lost the seed phrase of their wallet.This is too bullshit reason to file bankruptcy for their losses since they are custodial company which ironic to lost their keys while their service is safely manage invetors funds.  Losing private key is the most convenient reason to file loss on crypto since it’s very to prove that you are lying unless polygraph test is admissible in court.This is an exit plan and probably this coin will sleep in there for a long time untile the issue cool down while solving everything using the bankruptcy funds.Yeah, most likely this is just a excuse that they have lost their keys to their main wallet.LOL, this is laughable as they supposedly Prime \"trust\", but then forget about their private keys, and obviously this is the best exit strategy for anyone.Just like when the founder of Quadriga CEO, Gerald Cotten died, he had all the keys in their wallet and so all the customers money where gone.I'm not sure who has the authority here, and maybe prosecute Prime Trust for their financial negligence.And maybe this will set a precedence for other companies as well to just file for bankruptcy if they have problems and then with the same bullshit reason.",

Maybe a planned exit? or just truly negligence of its owners. This is absolutely a planned exit bud, never should we believe all these lies that they tell us, a criminal will always have an excuse and when coming up with such excuse, they will look for one that seems very true and appealing and believable.I personally believe that nobody in their right senses will lose a private key or seed phrase to a wallet containing such an amount of money, 38.9 million dollars is not child's Play, they have probably planned it all and are ready to Battle/defend this claim whether it takes them years,  at the end of it all, when everyone has forgotten, they will quietly withdraw this money and start enjoying themselves meanwhile those that have lost have lost...Not your keys,  not your crypto , those who have refused to listen and believe in this the soft way,  will have to learn to believe it in the hard way.I very much agree with you.  There is a high possibility that the people behind the company intentionally create this reason to exit scam and enjoy the money.  It is very impossible for a big company to neglect the security and backup of its seed/private key.  Unless the owner have sole holdings of the seed or private key and dies, it is unacceptable that the bankruptcy is due to forgotten seeds.",

And if they really know that they have lost the seed/private key, then why not have a investigation? They simply declare bankruptcy right away? I will echo the same sentiments here, it's very clear that they messed up and they want to hid everything thru Chapter 11 and hide their incompetency.",
