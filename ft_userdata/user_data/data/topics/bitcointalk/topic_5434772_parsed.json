If it's a single mistake - things happen and it will be sorted out.But if others are having similar issues but until now decided to keep silent it would help ring some bells early on.",

Just a little hypersensitive. Reached out to smoothie about some lealana pieces he got right back and all is good. Just not the same from another after 3 or 4 messages",
