  "content": "We are sometimes surprised that every now and then new people are falling into the 1xCrap trap, as this recent thread shows:1xbit is a scam betting site, DO NOT ENTER!!On the one hand this forum does not moderate scams, which has a certain logic but is debatable, but in any case, from this forum we have tagged the members who promote it there are actives flag against their representatives on the forum.But if they also advertise on sites of a certain reputation, it is not surprising that people continue to fall. Do you think that Mycellium does not know that 1xCrap is a scam? Or they just turn a blind eye and take the money?",
