Lookingfor someone who has actually DONE IT. Any issues?Yes you can buy BTC through PayPal and directly transfer to your Exodus wallet, no need to send to Coinbase because there's no benefit and just add more fees.But I see you're want to protect your privacy and trying to become long term holder.I suggest to use other no KYC exchange e.g. Bisq or Agoradesk and you should use better wallet which is non custodial and open source e.g. Electrum, Bluewallet etc. Exodus isn't a good wallet due to closed source. Consider to use hardware wallet too, but don't use ledger because there's a recent serious accusation against them.",

If you're not familiar with them or you don't think they can properly secure your bank credentials then all the more that you should avoid. Limit giving out personal information as much as possible.There should be no problem transferring funds from Paypal to external wallets like Exodus since they already have that feature available for users in the US. Not sure if those from Hawaii are still not allowed.",

I have no worries about Plaid, let’s be honest our KYC is everywhere these days with all the exchanges we use. It’s up to you but Paypal are just as likely to sell your info to companies as Plaid.",
