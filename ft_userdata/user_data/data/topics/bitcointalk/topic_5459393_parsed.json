      "body": "First thing first, this needs to move to altcoin mining.Now to answer your question about the risk of buying KS3, it's pretty simple, you look at the current hashrate of Kaspa which is 1.5PH in other words it's 1500 th, that miner does 8.3th which means as soon as the first 180 miners are plugged in, the profitability of that miner is going to drop by half.Just a bold assumption that they will see 10000 of those gears, which would bring the total hashrate to 81,500th vs the 1500th now, so you are looking at something like 90%-99% drop in profit, I don't know how the difficulty adjusts with this coin, but the theoretical $2000 per day is not even close to being real, the chances that anyone manages to make even a couple hundred dollars per day on this miner are slim to nothing.Also not to forget how Bitmain will likely fire up a dozen gear right before their clients get theirs, so they won't even get a few hours of decent profit, the overall profitability will probably drop to 2 digits at best.I have not mined altcoins for years, but what I described above has always been the case for all the altcoin miners, could this time be any different? maybe with very low chances, could it repeat? very likely.",

Looking back in 2017 and the Dash D3 miner. Or A3 for sia coin or the Kadena Miners. So donÂ´t buy such expensive asics for only 1 coin, it will fuck you up.",

      "body": "It won't stay that profitable for long, if you are even lucky to land on that gear before the big mining corporations do. For example, 2,100 USDT per day is massive, there would be gold rush. If your focus is that estimated reward per day, then you will be very disappointed after a while.Like they always say, if you are going to purchase, use the money you can \"afford to lose\" or can do away with for a long time because the ROI could take a very long time than what you actually might think.",

You will pay $36,000 and get the ASIC later, and most likely when you get it, the payback will increase by 10-20 times. Every day, the profit will fall sharply, and whoever gets ASICs first will pay off faster. And look at the graph of miner rewards on this coin.",

Asics are very expensive, so you need to take into account this moment, and not the profit from one asic now, which will greatly decrease very soon.The only miner I would buy from Iceriver is that 65 watt 100 Gh/s which can easily be kept at home or office and you don't really care if the profit goes up and down as this does not cost over 20.000 dollars,in fact you can get it just in the 1500-2000 dollars range and right now has a daily profit of 25 dollars,so this is low scale miner which anyone fancying buying a miner for the Kas should be buying this.The electricity is ridiculous at only 65 watt so it is very much worth trying for people like OP who were thinking to enter and buy a very expensive miner as with this miner whatever happens to the profitability you still will get decent amounts of money back from this miner.",
