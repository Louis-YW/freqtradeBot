  "content": "Last week, I read a painful story from a local newspaper where a huge amount was legally won but the lottery company is refusing to pay.In USD conversion, the guy bet about $690 and won about $169,000, but the gambling company refused to pay him, claiming that his record of the winning has been wiped off from their database as a result of a technical error.The first step he took was to report at a police station where he was offered about $23,000 by the company which he rejected. He later reported at the National Gambling Board where he was offered about $29,900 which he also rejected. It's at this time he charged them to court with three counts charges of Conspiracy, Obtaining money under false pretence and Stealing. The case is on, and I hope he wins. The guy is lucky enough to have money to file charges and this is happening within his reach/jurisdiction. This is a very sad story to me, which is why I ask these four questions:Can this guy win the case?Has anyone experienced not being paid for their winning for real?Why would they take your big money but refuses to pay big winning?What could be done to curb this cheating permanently in gambling?For those requesting the link, here it is: https://punchng.com/lagos-lottery-company-arraigned-for-refusing-n72m-win/",

The fact that the company is offering him money means there is legitimacy in his claim, there must be proofs of his win that's why he won't budge at the offers given to him. Now, the gambling company will have more problems after he wins this case. Reputation is first. Instead of just paying the man, they took the risk of going this far so now their business will be in danger too. I have not experienced this yet and I wish to never do.Why do they do it? Well, when it's about the money anything can be done. But sadly, in this case, they are not looking at long term profits.",

Meaning that the winners are usually not so random, instead they're linked to certain businessmen or parties.I would not be surprised it's also the case here. There was indeed a technical error: it was not their man the one winning.Whether he can win or not this, it's hard to tell. They afford to do this kind of shenanigans exactly because they expect the law enforcement be weak and take the side of the money, not the side of the truth (which may or may not be true).It's now up to this guy get good proof and it's up to the judge prove the law works in your country. Best of luck (and I mean it)!",

OR they are a small company that is still growing and thus can't cover that huge win, but that is definitely not an excuse, before getting into this business, they ought to have sufficient funds to cover their maximum winnings, thus any player who wins either the exact maximum or anything under it ought to be paid.QuoteWhat could be done to curb this cheating permanently in gambling?As players, just ensure you are playing on reputable gambling platforms. Having said that, every country has their own body that checks gambling companies, so they can on their own part work harder to penalize gambling companies that are found guilty of fraud and ensure they pay whatever is owed.",

I guess the casino is a small one and might not be able to afford such amount of money because from the story he was offered almost the same amount twice at different time and reason, which means they might not even have up to $50000 to give to him,or they are scam.I know of a gambling platform that when you win very bid like this,if they can't pay you because they are looking at just giving you alone this huge sum of money that can take care of so many persons winning, the casino might get broke so instead of depriving you of your money,in order to keep good reputation of the casino,they will give you a share in the casino by opening a branch for you to operate for them instead of you still playing, you will not be allowed by the casino to play their games. I haven't experience such before but I have heard of such",

Hiding behind an excuse like a technical error is flimsy, would someone who didn't win from a gambling website or casino have the boldness to demand money saying that they won? I doubt. The excuse of a technical error is not sufficient, except they would look for something to pin their refusal to remit wining to.",

And like Oshosondy said, you should put a link so we can read it up to get the whole story. Most casinos and gambling sites are that way. They are structured in a way that players will keep losing and when anyone escapes it, they find an excuse not to pay. It is either they accuse winners of KYC not being adequate or some double dealings. No, I have not encountered such. It is bad that casinos are set up and will not want to pay out when winnings are recorded. He will win the case. I hope no judicial manipulations happen to him.",

It also matters that said lottery should be a legal one though. On the matter of experiencing it, I have to win first before I can  It might honestly be a real tech accident of sorts, it happens, I just think it's impossible for it to not leave any traces whatsoever though so them avoiding it like this kind of seems odd. It might be for money though I don't think they'd shy away from paying it that much since they're a lottery company, they'd inevitably win in the long run tbh. Put a punishment, a very heavy one for law breakers like in this scenario.",

If this is government mandated lottery then they should pay the winner, no if or but.And why are they offering him that money in the first place? they should give him full credit if by chance he really won fair and square.So of course we are in the side of the man and hopefully he will get his full price.",

But the man is aching to receive what he deserves and I think he will get it, and justice will be served. Is this a private lottery company?

With winnings of above 150,000 USD it makes sense to get an expert lawyer to take care of it. Since he was offered already two times money from the company his chances seem good. The lottery company know they are in the wrong and trying to get a cheap payout. It's good that he declined the payments avd I hope he is documenting everything properly. It shouldn't be an issue for him that the company lost the data for the winnings. If his lottery ticket shows the winning numbers and its legit than he deserves all the money. In my country the lottery company is partially owned by the state and there is no way that they could get out of paying out winnings. The winning numbers are broadcasted on TV and if you have the lottery winning slip with your name on it, its your money. Hopefully he gets all the money and doesn't except a partial payout.",
