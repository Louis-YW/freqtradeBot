Regarding your question of institutional money flowing in the market, yeah why not? You don't need to worry about those institutions though, as retail investors just like you and me are very important on the market. We are the one going to push for the price in the next bull run. So the question is, are you ready? have you accumulate enough to make profits? If not then you still have months to save and buy Bitcoin.",

There are still a lot of opportunities for the participants be they individual or corporate, once they invest their money, they get to make their income in multiples.Come to think of it, let's say that a company with a huge amount invests $1B in Bitcoin. And in just a year after, if Bitcoin grew just 4 times the amount of its price at that time (which will be easily possible), the company would have made $1B. This is as easy as that, as though they did nothing but earn more.How many investments and business contracts could do that?",

More companies will start securing Bitcoin in their own wallets, anticipating a future filled with surprises from Bitcoin, courtesy of these major corporations.In the years ahead, Bitcoin is poised to unveil more surprises, further increasing its value. Its limited supply compels everyone to vie for ownership, and Bitcoin ETFs serve as a significant gateway for institutional investors to enter the market on a grander scale.Now, 1BTC =",

They have seen what benefits Bitcoin can provide.I agree with @Yaunfitda, who said that 2017 was an exciting year. In that year, Bitcoin gave big profits and many altcoins also gave big profits. From there, people started to pay attention and join in crypto.You can continue if you want to buy Bitcoin again for long-term investment. The current Bitcoin price is still worth buying, even though there was an increase to $34k yesterday. And a correction has come so that the price of Bitcoin declines again to $33k. That is a lower price than yesterday. In the coming years, mass adoption will likely occur. So prepare yourself before that happens.",

Of course, there is no question that just within that time period Bitcoin made a very impressive growth leading to the present $34K level...and with 2024 scheduled to be its halving and the offing ETF approval many experts are now telling us that there can be a big possibility for a bull run in 2024. Will BTC be reaching a new ATH next year? That is something we should be excitedly watch for developments. One thing for sure HODLING is the best strategy one can do especially if one is not a certified trader.",

Not to mention that today price is closer to $35k!As for the past 5 years, the world is not the same though. A lot of things have changed. We've endured 2 recessions, one because of the pandemic and the other because of the proxy war between East and West that is still ongoing.

Do you think this will continue in the coming years?There's no doubt Bitcoin has come a long way in the past five years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. One of the biggest changes for Bitcoin over the past five years has been the growing interest and investment from institutional investors. it's now considered a legitimate investment opportunity by major banks and hedge funds.Now to answer your question, The short answer is yes because I think that the use of Bitcoin by companies and organizations will continue to grow in the coming years. A convincing number of large corporations like tesla that you mentioned and some others like Microsoft and PayPal are now accepting Bitcoin as payment and I believe more and more small businesses are also beginning to accept it. I think this trend will continue as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream and as more people become comfortable with using it. We still have a long way to go thou.",

When bitcoin price reached to sixty nine thousand [69k] some people never believed that the price can fall to any point lower than fifty five to sixty thousand [55k-60k] then, so that is while always emphasising that bitcoin market price is unpredictable and you can depends on the price. Since three days now bitcoin has been to thirty three thousand to thirty four thousand [33k-34k] so that is to say each of the year have it price tag in bitcoin, and especially the highest price of any year, when you invest in bitcoin base the increase in market this year and invest next year it will be that the price will not reach to the point you expected, it can neither falls or increase, because the possibility is there due to the market  determination.",

As time progresses many institutions and countries will join Bitcoin after seeing the successes of those who have been there. I'm optimistic that the major Bitcoin ETFs will be approved and when this happens, many large institutions will have the confidence to invest in Bitcoin, thereby leading to high price of the asset. Bitcoin will perform better than it has done in the last 5 years becauze the potential is there. Besides, the doubt around Bitcoin is fading day by day as many people are not realising that those lies about Bitcoin being  bubble were promoted by those who are afraid of the power of Bitcoin.

In the past years, not many companies have key into this project because they haven’t saw the potential in it and some are being sceptical about their investments. The earliest that invested reaped the profits of their investments, so this has brought about the interest of others to invest into this and hope for a better return in the future which they will undoubtedly benefit from also. As whales, they can sometimes manipulate the market but not without the consent of many other investors and miners which is very hard to happen.",

However, these numbers must be examined alongside their underlying  drivers. The embrace of Bitcoin by Tesla is not a casual investment strategy. It proves the digital currency's potential as a hedge, asset, and mainstream payment. But, is Bitcoin's popularity due to its worth or speculation?Institutions want diversified portfolios due to low interest rates and high asset prices in the global economy. Bitcoin provides that. Regarding your trend continuity question: While business giants have validated Bitcoin's utility as an asset, its volatility is clear. As corporations experiment, the stakes rise. The next few years are crucial. Bitcoin's trajectory depends on regulations, institutional interest, and market dynamics. Not just growth, but strategic and sustainable growth.",

Bitcoin is on a track in which it will only move forward from here. There's nothing that is going to stop it from happening. The history speaks for itself.
