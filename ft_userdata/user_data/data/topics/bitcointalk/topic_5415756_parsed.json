And when we heard news about ether merge 2.0 many members were saying that it might get very cheaper withdrawals fees and still I think that's not the case with Ethereum and that is not good for snallers volume traders.",

Ethereum gas fee dropped drastically then how can you say that ethereum transfer is still high?If you're talking about the withdrawal from the exchanges are still high then the exchange has to lower the withdrawal fee but as of now the gas fee is reduced too low.",

Sharding is not working yet, and the cost of transactions has fallen because there is very little demand now due to the bear market. Danksharding is implemented in EIP-4844, I wrote about it in this post.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=428589.msg61066344#msg61066344",

      "body": "honestly maybe everyone thinks the withdrawal fee will be cheap after merging but that's wrong, because there is still another process that must be updated in the next map, actually if the transaction fee has become cheap if you make transactions on weekends, maybe around 4 gwei or 5 gweiQuote from: Bitcoin_Arena on October 03, 2022, 10:56:20 PMCan you please enlighten us on why you think the cheaper transfer fees are not yet the case? It could be something I am missingAccording to Ether Gas Station, the fees seem to have pretty much dropped so low compared to those days when Gwei was so highit looks like you gave a reference to the ethgasstation site which already looks not working properly, to see the cost of active gwei gas can be seen here https://etherscan.io/gastracker ,",

Any exchange site has different policy about the fees. Some may chart low fees and high fees. I meant when the transaction fees for swapping is still quite high caused by it consumes a few dollars for a single swap. Yeah i do agree if it's dropping drastically",

Perhaps you didn't read the most common misconception about the ETH merge.https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-merge-top-5-misconceptions-about-the-anticipated-ethereum-upgradeQuoteMisconception 1: Ethereum gas fees will reduce after The MergeEthereum’s impending upgrade will reduce Ethereum’s infamous gas fees (transaction fees) is one of the biggest misconceptions circulating among investors. While reduced gas fees top every investor’s wishlist, The Merge is a change of consensus mechanism that will transition the Ethereum blockchain from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). So there will be no cheaper transaction after the merge, but in any case, as others have said it is still quite cheap and so we don't know what is your complain here.",

While reduced gas fees top every investor’s wishlist, The Merge is a change of consensus mechanism that will transition the Ethereum blockchain from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS). Many uninformed think that this merge is done to fix the scalability and gas fee of ETH so they got disappointed when the gas fee doesn't change.  If they only read the roadmap and different article that explains about the merger, they will find out that merger is the initial phase of the update to accommodate further upgrade of the ETH network.  Scalability and gas fees will be fix when sharding is implemented.Quote from: Jating on October 07, 2022, 05:24:25 PMSo there will be no cheaper transaction after the merge, but in any case, as others have said it is still quite cheap and so we don't know what is your complain here.Probably he had transfered some of his ETH asset during the peak time or probably he transfer them from an exchange that hasn't adjusted its processing fee yet.",
