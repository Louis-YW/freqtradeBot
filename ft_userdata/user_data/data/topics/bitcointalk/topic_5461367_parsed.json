  "content": "Hello,I recently bought an ASIC miner just to give it a try and after a couple of days trying to set up the miner correctly i finally managed to get a stable hashrate.The problem is when i try to connect to a pool i keep missing the target even when i was really close to hitting the target.I tried switching to a different pool to see if i was banned from the pool or something but the issue persist no matter which pool i join and i even tried on NiceHash and the issue persist.The miner has a stable hashrate but i never submitted a single share at 7218 MH/s.The overall network hashrate is high but once in a while i see a share popping up but target is missing.Any help, comments, thoughts, links or whatever would be greatly appreciated !Have a nice day !",

If it's not then share more details about your issue and your unit.",
