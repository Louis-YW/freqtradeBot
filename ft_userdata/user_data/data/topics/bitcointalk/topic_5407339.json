When people trade and leave their currencies into exchanges and e-wallets, that old idea behind bitcoin is already broken.Every time, the governments have higher control over people and society isn't going to resist.

After first claiming that the savings products of these people were \"investments\" (which they may have been but they were marketed in a very manipulative way) they were starting to see a bankrun in other banks, which would have been even more devastating to the financial system of China and have now backtracked slightly by offering to cover, from state coffers, a certain proportion of the billions that were stolen by the individuals in charge of this company.",

It is a good response from the Chinese government quickly responding to refunding citizens money because money issues are very delicate like I would always say. The Chinese government frowns heavily at corruption and the bank officials if found guilty will pay a heavy penalty for it.Regardless of the fact that the Chinese government is not responding to refund in people's money this incidence country boots do the arguments the need for you to be your own bank and exercise more of financial independence.

They are using their clients' money in order to earn. In the case of failure and they grow insolvent, they would implement measures such as freezing withdrawals. In case they're successful, they won't share with their clients their profit other than the promised interest which is even lower than the inflation rate. In case of bankruptcy, the insurance will pay their clients after years. But before criticizing the banks for this, be mindful that this is also present in crypto.
