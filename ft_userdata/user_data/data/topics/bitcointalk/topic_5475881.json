  "content": "I haven't plugged in my nano ledger s plus into my laptop for many months.  I did log into ledger live the last few months and notice each time it finishes loading, there is that message at the top right that says to update ledger live.  I haven't done that in months.  I then notice every single time I close ledger live, it would then allow me to click yes or no to update ledger live to the latest version and I just click no and close ledger live.  Now this message that shows you to click yes to open ledger live to update came months ago this year correct?  Back then, it was never like this.  You always had to manually click on the top right to update ledger live... or you go to the website and download ledger live yourself.  At the moment, the Ledger Live I'm using is version 2.66.0 which is few months old.  So I should after logging into ledger live just click on the top right to update ledger live right?The other thing is I haven't connected my nano ledger s plus to my laptop in months.  I also recall back months ago, there still was no new firmware to update and since I did not need to send or receive bitcoin the last few months, I haven't connected it to my laptop.  I think the last time I did a firmware update was last year and months ago when I check to see if there was any firmware update available for the nano ledger s plus, there wasn't.  It seems only the nano ledger x seems to get lot of firmware updates but not the nano ledger s plus?  Well I took a look now and it seems the latest nano ledger s plus firmware update is 1.1.  Is that correct?  Now is there a way to check what firmware I currently have before I connect my nano ledger s to my laptop with just logging into ledger live or that isn't possible?  I do believe I have the latest nano ledger s plus firmware but not 100% sure.So in my situation, log into ledger live.  Click on the top right to update ledger live.  Then connect my nano ledger s plus laptop to it and enter my pin and then check to see if it's fine and also to check if firmware is 1.1 and up to date right?  The other thing is I should update all the apps as well or that isn't necessary?  Example I have bitcoin, bitcoin cash app but the version for each is obviously months old.  Back then I never updated these apps unless I did a firmware update.  But would you still recommend updating each of the apps like bitcoin and bitcoin cash app on the nano ledger s plus?",

      "body": "So I just noticed the nano ledger s plus had a firmware update a few months ago.  I did not know this as I haven't connected my nano ledger s plus to my laptop in the last few months.  I have opened ledger live on my laptop though few times and updated ledger live the few times I noticed there was a new update.At the moment, I do not have access to my seed phrase where I am located.  Thus you never do a firmware update when you don't have access to your seed phrase right?  I mention that I travel so because of that, I don't have access to my seed phrase.  So there would be no issue still using the nano ledger s plus as is right?",

You're not required to have your seed phrase if you want to update your firmware. As I haven't updated yet my firmware as well, what if the process will require you to write some of it? I wouldn't even have the guts to update the firmware when my seeds are not around me. My experience long time ago when the firmware update failed, I have to restore it through my seeds. Are you in a hurry? Why not just go home and have your seed phrase and do the firmware if you want to just to be safe?",

I'm not sure if you've already updated the firmware to v1.1.0 or if you're still using v1.0.4 and below firmware, but the only thing that v1.1.1 brought was giving Nano S Plus users the option to use their controversial/questionable ledger recover, so you can peacefully continue to use the previous firmware version.",
