  "content": "As bitcoin enthusiasts we all like the concept of both privacy and Decentralisation and even in addition to that the bitcoin network also packs transparency via a Blockchain network that is easily accessible to anyone with internet of course. Anyways, decentralisation comes with a very nice advantage of having no central body in charge of controlling the network . What about making decisions? Would that be a yes?Well firstly in this context I'm not referring to bitcoin developers as decision makers rather more of whales and big firms. The concept of decentralisation kind of suggests that everyone has a relatively equal right or rather power in the network more like the concept of egalitarianism and democracy. Now I'm not talking about politics here so let me cite an example to make the picture clearer. The bitcoin network has a supply cap of 21 million coins and as of, today excluding Satoshi's mined coins we have roughly 18 million coins in circulation. Now this constitutes the hodlings of both individual retail holders like you and I as well as WHALES and bigger Firms like BLACK ROCK. If power is relatively shared based on decentralisation, then these whales and big firms have a bigger edge on the block chain in price influence than retail holders since they Hodl more coins (POWER). We've seen many times where prices move either up or down drastically when big firms either buy or sell huge amounts of bitcoin. So could it be seen as a flaw in decentralisation? Remember nothing is 100% flawless!!",

      "body": "Let me start by asking, is decentralization tied to network or the market?.I think there is a contradiction here between the Bitcoin network and the whole market thing. Just as you've said, decentralization makes sure no central authority is in control, and I believe that is strongly related to the Bitcoin network itself, and doesn't really enforce same to the market.Of course, I agree that there are some organizations or people that tend to have more of the Bitcoin than others, but that doesn't mean that there is a flaw in the technology or the network itself. It's just some random economical principles where those with more money or resource can purchase more than the other.Okay fine, Mia Chloe has 30 million Bitcoin which makes him the highest holder, but that doesn't give Mia Chloe the authority to assign working days of the Bitcoin network. It doesn't give Mia Chloe the authority to create more Bitcoin without the consultation of the community.(just an example)So, I don't think this could be a flaw in decentralization. We can maybe say that there will surely be some price manipulation if any of this major holder, like the popular we know of(don't really need to mention the name), decides to sell and buy back.",

Whales can only temper with decentralization if there large junk of bitcoin make them decision makers when it comes network forks or things like that",

I observed that some members in this forum warned about the negative effects of this move. There is nothing anybody can do because the market is free, people can buy and sell without restrictions. But as the amount of Bitcoin institutional these investors are controlling keeps increasing, they might have some level of influence over the market. Bitcoin might never be centralized but if these whales keep acquiring more coins we might end up having a partially controlled market where they can cause FOMO at will.",

When governments of every country worldwide work together to ensure that exchanges comply with policies, they become the central power that compromises decentralization where they can freeze and block the trades and transactions of someone. The government can tell the exchanges to delist coins and tokens or block the funds sent from addresses. More flaws when the developers have a public profile.

Of course, as a side effect, solving that problem makes Bitcoin the best form of money to ever exist.Bitcoin is absolutely decentralized. As stated in the whitepaper, it prevents electronic coin double-spend attacks using a mechanism inspired by hashcash. This principle remains valid today and has nothing to do with the perfectly legitimate right of organizations to use it. Similarly, organizations holding gold and creating gold-backed assets don’t diminish gold’s intrinsic value.While I understand the concern about greedy organizations potentially trying to take control of Bitcoin, do we actually see this happening? For Bitcoin to maintain its value, it must remain useful. Any violation of its principles would spark an instant revolution; the response from the cypherpunks who have dedicated their lives to this technology would be overwhelming, and the market would adjust accordingly, supporting the rightful version of Bitcoin / Bitcoin ideas.Ideas cannot be destroyed, only improved. In my view, Bitcoin has grown too big to fail. I will support any project that adheres to its profound fundamentals, with Bitcoin \"Core\" being the most likely to fulfill this vision.",

By definition, decentralization means that Bitcoin cannot be controlled by a single central authority. This implies that large institutions or entities have no say in how Bitcoin operates, including its blockchain and technical aspects.While their actions significantly influence prices, as we're well aware, this is a normal phenomenon in economic markets. These large players cause price fluctuations, which can impact the market's significance. However, they buy and sell Bitcoin just the exact same way, we individual or small scale investors do through the market making us even The only distinction between institutional investors and individual investors is the scale of their transactions. Institutional investors buy in bulk, potentially generating more profits as prices reach new levels.Generally, prices are influenced by human activities, which is a natural aspect of any market. Therefore, there's no reason to fear that price fluctuations caused by big bodies will compromise Bitcoin's decentralization.",

However, as of 2024 this is more a danger \"looming in the background\" than a real problem. [1]\"Traditional\" Price manipulation is not the main problem I'm seeing. Instead, if a new conflict about a development decision, like the one about Segwit/big blocks in 2017 happens, then whales could indeed try to position themselves in this conflict. This doesn't apply so much to ETF firms like BlackRock, because they are mere intermediaries of their customers. Independent holders like MicroStrategy, or nation-state whales (imagine the US buying a million coins) are more dangerous in this regard.Imagine the following scenario:- Developers plan a privacy coin function (let's say something like MimbleWimble introduced by LTC)- The US government (if it holds large amounts of coins), Microstrategy, or whoever opposes this plan, buys trolls on X and Bitcointalk to support the position and tries to fabricate a debate about the \"harms\" of the privacy feature.- An \"independent developer\" appears and creates a Bitcoin version without the privacy function, which would hard fork at a specific block (same as Bitcoin Unlimited in 2017)- The whales say that they will support the branch without the privacy feature. This leads to fears that they could sell the Bitcoins on the chain with the privacy feature, and in consequence, the privacy feature loses support.This is also the reason why I don't like the idea of governments buying too many Bitcoins. It would not do harm if they hold some as a strategic reserve, but they should never have excessive power. Nobody can stop them however, so it's the community who has to fight against that scenario.The solution is actually that the community must uphold cypherpunk values also in the future (see @albertorma's post), to counter all these possible attacks by whales. Bitcoin is also a kind of social network, not only a technological solution; we shouldn't forget that, so the community does have some power too, not only the whales. It's the community who builds the \"story\" Bitcoin's success is based upon. And it must stay crystal clear that censorship resistance is one of Bitcoin's main features and never a development decision should be taken that harms this.[1] In the case of Bitcoin, at least; many altcoins instead have indeed problematic levels of power concentrations, often in the hands of the \"developer\" team.",
