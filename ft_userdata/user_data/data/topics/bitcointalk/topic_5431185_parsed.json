  "content": "Recently there have been a number of PMs I have received asking for neutral trust I had left for them months earlier, to be removed. The timing of this has coincided with a particular signature campaign being managed by a particular campaign manager who was vouching for a neutral trust to be removed from a participant but I will not claim that is the only reason I am receiving PMs, I think the timing is suspect that is all. It also has coincided with me removing or revisiting other neutral trust recently.I have no issues at all in reviewing and/or modifying any trust I have left in the past but the sort of members with dubious conduct sending PMs asking for a neutral trust to be removed is surprising. Their reasons for asking to have the neutral trust to be removed are also hard to believe. One has even stated he stopped posting after I left neutral feedback and wants to join a signature campaign and will only start using the account after/if the neutral feedback has been removed.In my time here in the forum I have never experienced such a movement by some members with dubious posting history with suspected farm accounts (or alt-accounts) asking for a neutral feedback to be removed and I find it somewhat strange this is happening. It is just a neutral feedback not a negative one yet therefore watching this new trend makes me want to ask if others are receiving PMs too.In my case I have recently received PMs regarding neutral feedbacks only but have any of you recently received similar PMs asking for either negative or neutral trust to be removed by those that you left them for?",

It must have been years when I was last asked to reconsider negative feedback. My response was: open a topic in Reputation, and see what the community thinks. The user didn't do that.I think it also helps I don't easily leave negative feedback, and when I do, it's obvious it won't be removed.For neutral feedback, I don't remember any removal request. It helps most of it is written in a neutral sense: \"xx support member\", \"confirmed owner of xx\", and in some cases: \"Warning: xx\".Back to you: I appreciate that you're starting to use more neutral instead of negative. That helps against \"inflation\" of the value of a negative, and it's less drastic. The only neutrals in your list that I think may be inappropriate are the ones saying \"Note to self\".

This is one of the example from many. You are seeing he is talking to FatFork (in a discussion which was already dead) and deliberately choosing words which are troll, untrustworthy, spouting nonsense. He is doing it to justify his feedback leaving habit. The neutral I left for Ratimov was also found interesting by him as if it was supposed to be a negative.The words he deliver towards the people he does not like, on his negative feedback he left for others at-least shows that he is disrespectful and feels happy when insulting the people he does not like. @JollyGood my diaper baby, there are many examples I can bring where you bumped dead discussions with low quality unnecessary few lines of words either to fill up your signature requirement, or to devalue the people you don't like.Stop being a hypocrite. How would you feel if I leave a feedback like:BitcoinGirl.Clubxxxx-xx-xx No referenceSelf note: Signature campaign spammer. (This user is bumping old discussions with nonsense few lines of words and seems to be posting for the sake of fulfilling signature campaign weekly requirement via post count and promote his signature. Also, I would not be surprised if the user intentionally building up his reputation in DT network with his fake scam busting and cashing out from 1xxxxshit bad reputation so that he gain trust and some day when he will have an opportunity he will scam a large business deal. Not to mention, he is a sadist.)Learn to respect forum members. Â If you don't have money to buy a dairy to take personal notes, ask daddy, I will buy one for you.",

My response was: open a topic in Reputation, and see what the community thinks.Best approach for negative Trust in my opinion as well. If there's any legitimacy for removing a particular negative trust, it's required that the community needs to come out in strong support of removing it. If the community doesn't come out in strong support of removing it, there's just no legitimacy in removing that particular negative trust. @OPRegarding your PMs: I would review a particular neutral trust if the request via PM is really honest, constructive and the member is willing to admit his mistake. But that's also including that the abuse which has led to that trust, is lenient enough to be removed from the account's trust page. If the PM is not constructive at all or the abuse has been simply too harsh, I would keep the neutral trust even longer. Probably, if someone is sending you repeatedly PMs requesting to remove a neutral trust, it could be considered as \"unsolicited PM spam\" and could be reported. And for your particular case, it really looks like that these people only care to get rid of your neutral trust due to paid signature campaigns. So, your neutral trust is most likely very accurate to \"warn\" campaign managers about signature spammers.",

A neutral feedback does not limit one from much on the forum, so they would not be losing out at all, and maybe they don't know how the forum worse really.I leave a couple of feedbacks, few and far between, but have only been contacted to remove a negative feedback I left.

I have over the years received both sincere and highly deceptive PMs asking for trust to be removed. I try to be courteous when engaging with members to understand their views but usually their sincerity can be picked up after a couple of sentences.Quote from: 1miau on December 25, 2022, 03:32:09 AMAnd for your particular case, it really looks like that these people only care to get rid of your neutral trust due to paid signature campaigns. So, your neutral trust is most likely very accurate to \"warn\" campaign managers about signature spammers. Â You are right, nearly all the requests from years ago to those being made today are related to signature campaigns but I have to be honest and add that I am only but human and am therefore more than capable of making errors. I have acknowledged several over the years but I do not understand the desperation of some members to have their feedback removed when it is just a neutral tag. Previous PM requests have even been from members with multiple tags and they were probably trying to have them all removed or just mine for reasons unknown.---------------Thank you to all. As my reply has got long I will reply to the remaining members in another post.",

If you doubt the quality of their \"product\", then why did you accept them in the campaign in the first place?For me it is more a question of ego, of someone who is overflowing with ego and runs $100 a week signature campaigns now, so his ego is even more boosted. I'm curious to see if he wins the antihero award, as you have to think that people who get paid from his campaigns or think they might do so in the future are unlikely to nominate him for that \"award\".At the moment he has quite a few votes.",

If yes then that's normal, I don't know why people worry about neutral feed back, it actually look cool to have the middle digit going up instead of just being a boring zero. If the feed back doesn't serve any purpose then there is no need for it to exist, forgive and move on, someday someone will do the same for you.I'm guessing it's related to the conditions to be accepted in the signature campaign that is handled by @Royse777, he decided not to continue work with members who received neutral feedback especially if the neutral feedback was related to shitposting.",

I don't know why a manager would do that or consider a neutral tag to be anything sinister because that's not the way the community saw it a few years ago. I don't know if things have changed now. Besides, I know of a member who runs loan services here and uses neutral tags for those he lends money to and not as something bad. So, would such a campaign manager then base their conclusion on all neutral tags being for a wrongdoing? But of course, no. Screening hunters out based on neutral tag is a wrong call.",
