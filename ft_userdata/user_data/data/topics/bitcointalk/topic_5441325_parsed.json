At the end of each game I will raffle one loser and post it here. Each game will take a week, if there are more than 10 people, I may open another room.First game will take place from March 1st to March 8th. We will start at low deposits - 50 USD and I will take no commision in order to gain confidence.Send your LTC here:ltc1qdh24t3zmucl6yzqt5f3vj328e3ta5gskqltc0nBTC:bc1qmea5ntp0m5qyvjy693690hp7sh44c9dee5fjj4The wallets will remain the same for all games for transparency.

What is the security that you will pay for all who deposited excluding the loser? You mentioned transparency. It could be transparent if you can deposit 500$ for 10 people to the escrow. You can see trusted escrow provider lists here. You may tell that deposit from the player will be direct to the escrow but that will not work too as you may not moderate the service, in this case, transaction fees and time will be wasted for all except you.",
