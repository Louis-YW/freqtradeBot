Plus, there are lots of them.I am suspecting that posts in ANN(Altcoins) is counted but does not reflect in the history? I may have missed this.[1] https://ninjastic.space/search?author=kurry&board=159",

We have had several threads of this style in Meta. One of them was opened by myself. When things like the OP's happen to us we are clueless and it doesn't occur to us to think that it is because we have ignored boards.",
