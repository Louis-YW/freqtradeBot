I know people sell these \"calls\" so ill be willing to pay. Probably medium or high tier tokens that on the top 100 CMC. The fact that when you are looking for the daily trade and you may seek for the volatile asset in the market and i just know that when you are watching the market and it seems whole of market is still in the bearish trend for now. Scalping luna was good but this is too risky for you if you didn't know how to play but i guess what about to go to the some tokens on the binance like metaverse tokens? This is first time to see that someone called NFT was a good way to investing while we know that so well of NFT was illiquid asset. That sounds nonsense to call NFT as investment",

I know people sell these \"calls\" so ill be willing to pay. You could flip NFTs but you need to be in a discord community that gets info before others on which ones to buy. As to swing trading, pick something with a high marketcap. Personally, I never trade because most traders lose money. You can't predict the market and TA is a scam. I earn 28% APY staking ICP and that works best for me. DYOR",

Nft becomes profitable if its getting hype on social media and if no news or trend on a project you invested then thats something scary I think. For altcoins stay only on major coins or those who got a lot of volume.",

There are some coin which are so volatile and very good for day trading . You can use these coins for day trading but it's better to learn charts reading before trading. Loka token is best for day trading and you will find it very volatile and can make daily profit.",

Well, to be honest, they could just be disturbing to you as most of these signals aren't really going to give you signals that you people have believed.They're more of the call of those owners and mere trades by them. Learn on your own through trading and use that money for paying in actual experience.",

Because what they are about to say is not 100% true. But even so, I still join some trading call groups just to find out what they think about the current crypto market. For NFT, I suggest you to look for the latest trends on Twitter, there are lots of people sharing about NFT there.",

I know people sell these \"calls\" so ill be willing to pay. it seems my advice you better take the initiative to invest in BNB, and in this BNB coin you can also trade in the short term and in the daily timeframe and also here it's very easy not too difficult, many people recommend it, I also include into it, but you need to remember you should also research before investing in any altcoin, it's best and my advice you should consider it well and very carefully so that later you will not experience losses in investing.And maybe there's one more thing I want to talk about about the relationship related to NFT, the first thing we know is that NFT is not an illiquid asset in his view. , and my little advice you should be careful with NFT, especially with the new NFT.",

I'm not sure that your signals, which you use, can steadily bring you $ 5,000 over and over again.

I know people sell these \"calls\" so ill be willing to pay. It would be better if you just try to learn for yourself but I understand, it is quite a hassle starting from scratch. A better way would be trying out a paid one. There are quite a lot out there and some don't only give out calls for apot trading but also for leveraged trades along with calls for good potential start up altcoins. Some also help you learn more about trading while giving out those signals. Of course, not all are legit and the effectiveness of profitability depends on the signal provider which varies depending on your budget for signals or calls. It would be better if you skip looking for people giving out free signals or calls since most of the time, you are just being used to pump and dump an altcoin. Be careful op and good luck.

Anyway good luckThere's not that much difference if you're going to trade NFTs.Too many marketplaces for it these days and you just have to look at those NFTs that are currently popular and in demand. I have seen people making that much within a few days.But the usual is the same as holding bitcoin, it will take you several months of holding until you see the value of that NFT you hold to go up. That's not guaranteed to all NFTs that's why choosing wisely is needed before you buy.",

There are tons of people right now that are flipping NFTs for profit which is why tons of NFT platforms have popped up ever since the NFTs became famous. Even on the bearish market there are still people creating, buying and selling NFTs on various platforms. I suggest you try it out, really worth your while.",
