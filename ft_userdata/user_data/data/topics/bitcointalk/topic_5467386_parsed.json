I don't consider myself an early adopter, but like you, I used or spent it without realizing its potential. I also feel regretful about not holding onto more Bitcoin from my early days. However, the important thing is that I now recognize its potential and can make better-informed decisions about how to manage my cryptocurrency holdings moving forward. We should use our past actions as learning opportunities.For me, it's never too late to start accumulating and holding onto Bitcoin because I believe in the long-term.",

If there was a way to correctly forecast the future, I doubt that a lot of us that made the decision to spend our bitcoin would have found a different alternative but it's not possible to know the future and that's life. I believe that what's past is past and I can only look towards the future and not the past. This is why I don't go over past wallets to avoid regrets.What would you say are valuable lessons you learnt over time plus having gone through an aged wallet of yours? Will love to hear your thoughts. Hopefully it's more than regrets.",

IMO, this isn't good for us to have regrets and I will say, let it be.If we think it too much, it might be disheartening to think about missed opportunities, but instead crypto isn't the end and there may still be opportunities ahead.  It isn't too late to accumulate again and forget what you have in the past, past is past.",

When I had the chance to do that, I barely even visited my transaction history for my old wallets. This is because they are heartbreaking, they bring regret and discouragement, and you can also be encouraged by them if you choose to face reality. To me, the issue is not with me not being able to save in the past, but now, based on how I treat the information I have on my table, now that I have realised the mistake I made in the past, how much I have saved and accumulated so far is what I should be worried about right now. In order for me not to use today's experience as a regret again in the coming future, I can use it for testimony instead. Bitcoin is an asset; it is also wealth, so whenever we choose to start accumulating, even after wasting it in the past, it will still be beneficial in the coming future.",

The future is unpredictable, so unlike you, I have never felt regretful about what happened in the past. It is simply a lesson for us and there are still many opportunities for us in the present and future, and the important thing is whether we can learn from experience and avoid repeating the same mistakes again? Human instincts are greedy and selfish. When the opportunity is not clear, they refuse for fear of being scammed, but when the opportunity becomes clear, they feel regretful. Although bitcoin is valued much higher than it was many years ago, its opportunity is still huge. Why don't you start now to correct your past mistakes? The fact that you regret the past shows that you are thinking negatively about bitcoin in the future, because you cannot predict what will happen.",

I might just have to snipe your first paragraph out as I don’t share the same ideas as you but on the later, it’s very much the case for me and like, I do that you know. I sometimes drop by to check my withdrawals and each time, it’s more damaging than the last I checked. Even with the idea not pegged on sending coins across borders without having to go through the rigorous checks and interview sessions at the bank.I often come to a realization that, I’ve spent far too much coins than I am hodling at the moment. When I look back to what I’ve spent it on, am not 100% encouraged to have dealt it good as well.Worst is, I still spend some more up to this day. I still get to top up my portfolio every now and then but, the idea of hodling don’t stop me from spending. As much as I spend, I do buy as well and my hodling volume ain’t that bad.

I think everyone would have experienced this and would have regretted that they spent the bitcoin when it was so cheap. On the other hand, if they could hold on to the bitcoin, they would be millionaire by now. I have spent bitcoin under 5000$ too and at that time I was so happy but later when Bitcoin reached 19,800 at the peak of 2017 bull run, I was so depressed.Anyways, we always learn things with experience. Now I do not spend Bitcoin unless it is extremely urgent. I keep holding and wait for the next bull season to cash out some of my bitcoin. You can accumulate too as much as you can. I know that owning one full Bitcoin is not so easy nowadays but still, any amount will be good. You would not want bitcoin reach 100,000$ and you do not have any portion of it.",

      "body": "I had a similar feeling when I managed to recover my first Bitcoin wallet. It was an online wallet on Blockchain.com, and when recovered, it had $100 worth of Bitcoin in it, which is not too bad. However, when I started seeing the transactions and how much Bitcoin my wallet had transacted, I was dumbfounded. I had dealt with quite a decent volume in the past, more than triple my current balance, which is an effort of over two years. The saddest of all is that most of it was spent on digital crap, such as gaming accounts or a few Steam games. Only a small portion of it was salvaged years later.It'll probably take me over 2 to 3 years to surpass the amount of BTC I had back then, which was then probably valued at less than $100. I wish I could turn back in time.Edit: found my address again, oh my.https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/16BjYxYMjFcXLRFJE5UxrDXvHbW6VM5M2d",

Although we nay regret for not saving any bitcoins earned from the past still I'm glad that I still use this up till today and just move on with that chapter since at the end of the day we happily use that balances on any means. And for sure we are so satisfied at that time so maybe learn to move on from those but instead make that amount pass on your wallet as inspiration to gain more. Since for sure if crypto will exist for more years we still have many opportunity to gain a lot of money from our investments.",
