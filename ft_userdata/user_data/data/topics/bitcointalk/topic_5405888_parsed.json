This tool is only in beta, I would not advise trading off it as it online version only to get feedback.Hey,I don't think I did my application justice with my previous thread, so let me try again.So to give a little background, I have been working on an application that would assist you, bitcoin traders in increasing your profits while trading bitcoin, So before I even start talking about the tool and what it does, has the tool been proven to assist traders in making more gains? The answer is theoretically yes, but in practice no. So that is what brings me here, not for people to use the tool but to see if people think it would benefit them in their trades!Without me going into a large amount of detail, here is a little proof without me explaining how but the proof of concept has been tested:https://gyazo.com/d864dd4a9462802ddffa1cae181155dbSo what does the tool do? it gives you a very quick real-time overview of the market so that you only need a single application opened rather than multiple exchanges, in theory, giving you an edge over the market as you can see what happens across multiple markets rather than single, as you be able to see the live trades as they happen, so, for example, your trading on Coinbase, but there massive dump of bitcoin happening balance, you would be able to see this happen without having balance open and also see how BitMEX is reacting without having both exchanges opened at the same time. This may seem to be similar to other tools, such as trading view, but most of them only give you 1 min average price while with this tool you be able to see every individual trade happening, meaning you could second ahead of the market.Â Image of the tool:https://i.gyazo.com/6b2338b42318444a84a18efc4d578015.pngThe full version of this tool will give you an overview of the market, allowing you to see bitcoin, eth, and LTC at real-time speeds using currencies such as euro, GBP, and USD of course, and even allow you to convert these currencies to each other!Example gif: https://gyazo.com/47a12afc031f4aada7d01340c2a5dd1f (This is test bench version which is NOT THE LIVE VERSION)The delay in getting data from the exchange is around 0.01 mil seconds. You can also filter data so if you only want to see certain things you can or convert your currencies of other markets to your market1these are gif videos below:Converting to your currency to your market: https://gyazo.com/7bad50a0832f06da247839aada5f7c7eOnly show currencies in market:https://gyazo.com/606a434bff2e461d896c4a831e5ad876coin size over certain size:https://gyazo.com/cc0faacad59828a08df34936fc4d2f88image:Buy and sell bar:https://gyazo.com/f9803de754b10cae9c694f4248b734d5Which gives you an overview of the whole market as whole (or at least the stuff we track)speaking of stuff we track it's BTC/LTC/ETH, USD, EURO, GBP and from bitmex , coinbase, bainace, if the exchanges have we track it!Now with all this talk you probs want to try it?here a link https://thesis-masters-project.vercel.app/but I have some bad news, due to technical limitations due to free hosting software, as this is only a beta, we have had to limit some of the functionality, which is why I am only looking for feedback at this stage, so of limitation include not being able to include any bitcoin or eth, USD pairing due to high volume and having lower the speed of the trading table and bar, which means they are not suitable for trades atm, but we would still love your feedback!Note you need to sign in using the navigation button, use the sign in as guest, feedback did though the form on the website would help a lot of feedback here would be great too!The website does not support mobile and may not be a responsive site, remember it's only beta.final note if you get to page with data and it's not loading reload the page once or twiceKind regards,CB",
