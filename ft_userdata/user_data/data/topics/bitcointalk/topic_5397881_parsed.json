This is what looks to be the case this week. The USD surged to 2001 and has been bought and fixed income sold on ideas that the Fed had taken a hawkish turn, with investors searching for safety.  The hikes will be front-loaded with the next 50 bp hikes discounted for the next two meetings (June and July) and a strong leaning for the same in September (~66%). Yields 10-year is up 1.0 bp at 3.14%. Stock markets are broadly lower, with Japanese markets underperforming and the Nikkei down -2.5%. Tighter Covid lockdowns in Beijing and Shanghai raised pressure on its economy, while China reported faster-than-expected growth in exports for April, while imports were flat.Meanwhile in the market, speculation that President Putin might declare war on Ukraine in order to call up reserves during his speech at “Victory Day” celebrations could further hurt market sentiment.The week ahead is important because it may show the first signs that peak inflation is at hand.* USDIndex above 104.10. * Equities – Nikkei down -2.5%. The ASX closed with a loss of -1.2%, the CSI is currently down -1.4%, while Hong Kong was closed today. USA500 led the way with a drop of 1.1%, while USA100 shed 1.0%.* Yields 10-year is up 1.0 bp at 3.14%, Australia’s long yield also continued to climb and the German 10-year rate is up 0.4 bp at 1.13% this morning. * Oil back to 109, after EU and G7 mull Russian oil imports while Saudi Arabia cut prices for buyers in Asia as China’s lockdowns weigh on demand in the region.* Gold drifted back to 1869 as it looks less attractive from the safety of USD, while elevated yields further weighed on prices.* Bitcoin hammered! Gapped down to33,228. The start of a sharp technical fall ?* FX markets – EURUSD is just over the 1.05 mark, AUD and NZD also struggled against the largely stronger USD.

Stocks traded mostly lower, with China bourses hit by news suggesting that virus restrictions in part of Shanghai are already being tightened again amid a rise in case numbers, shortly after Covid lockdowns were lifted. Shanghai will lock down the Minhang district on Saturday morning for mass COVID-19 testing, according to Bloomberg.

Turkish lira slid to beyond 17.2.Today ECB Rate Decision and Statement and US jobless claims.ECB Preview: Markets are eagerly awaiting today’s press conference. Rate settings are expected to be held steady for now, and while there are some members who see the urgency to act sooner rather than later as inflation goes through the roof, the ECB’s timetable for the phasing out of stimulus effectively excludes a move on rates this week. Net asset purchases need to end first and Lagarde is expected to confirm that this will happen early in July, which would pave the way for a rate hike in July. Lagarde has already mapped out two moves in July and September and the basic scenario is for “gradual” 25 bp steps, although the discussion on a bolder kick off with a 50 bp boost in July has already started. We suspect that Lagarde will stick with a focus on “gradualism” for now. But she will not rule out a 50 bp step as the need to maintain credibility and assert the Bank’s commitment to price stability and the 2% inflation target seem increasingly urgent.Biggest Mover @ (06:30 GMT) Platinum (-1.92%).
