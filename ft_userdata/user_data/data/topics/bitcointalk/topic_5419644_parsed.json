Why trust? You didn't need to do any adopting seminar for bitcoin. The global economy is having need for digital marketing system.Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on November 06, 2022, 04:50:42 PMIt's extremely difficult and hard for people to agree and come to term with anything that has to do with Bitcoin  They probably have issue with networking and other aspect of getting rich quick.Quote from: Lordsilvabtc on November 06, 2022, 04:50:42 PMWhat do you think one can do, to educate those young ones, And drive the point that with all honestly, Nothing. Absolute nothing. What do you even need to convince someone about bitcoin ?

There aren't lots of things to do. Essentially what you're asking is: how can I make a conversation with a biased person? Apparently, by doing it. Explain them the FUDs, counter-argue to energy waste, criminal activity, mining pool oligopoly, ponzi scheme narrative etc. End the FUD.",

There has been a misconception that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, it’s one that hasn’t faded because scammers leverage on it. People that say they do not trust bitcoin simply do not understand how the blockchain works. And I think you should start from there, if they understand the nature of bitcoin and how transparent bitcoin transactions are on the blockchain I’m sure they would see things differently.",

You need to tell people that Bitcoin and altcoins are fundamentally different - altcoins are poor copies of Bitcoin that exist only to enrich the developers, while Bitcoin is a legitimate open-source project. And people should be aware of dangers of using Bitcoin to avoid doing expensive mistakes and getting negative experience that would turn them away from Bitcoin. So you shouldn't out right dismiss concerns but explain how Bitcoin has both positive and negative sides.",

If you live in where Bitcoin wasn't banned and most of the people aren't Muslim, then another reason they're scared of the volatility and don't have physical appearance. It's hard to educate them, personally I will wait until they have a problem at bank aka third parties. You can offer Bitcoin advantage that doesn't rely on third parties to solve their problem.",

Homeschooling is the answer to this flawed 'traditional' form of education. With your trained ability to search for and filter the information about bitcoin and all related stuff, it is quite possible to give people around you education of high quality, education which will be free of misconceptions, government narratives, FUD, and other drawbacks which otherwise may corrupt immature minds. Do not be afraid of being a tutor for your kids: there are many sources on the Internet nowadays which can be used to consume educational information of high quality: YouTube is one of them, where thousands of videos about different topics can compete even with high-quality books. Don't underestimate books, though. If written by people who are able to think critically, they may help to understand some nuances of the cryptocurrency world, even better than visualizations like guides on video platforms.",

I am only willing to teach people who tend to be neutral and curious, because they will of course empty their cup first.Regarding the adoption of bitcoin, of course the government will not reveal the shortcomings of fiat to the public unless it comes from self-awareness of the concept of fiat. The government has already tried to build pro fiat trust long before bitcoin was introduced which is the basis of people's trust in general. To introduce the new system to them, at least not insulting the existing system to be more easily accepted.",

However we explain to them, this will not affect how they are thinking because they seem to like getting a mindset and the doctrine that Bitcoin is not something to be approached, Bitcoin is a fraudulent investment, a Ponzi scheme, related to terrorism and crime, gambling, and so on. This thought seems quite difficult to erase in society although we have explained it exactly, although we have suggested they take Bitcoin from several sources, they will only believe in one source that they trust most. Although we can also find some people being open-minded about this and then can understand what Bitcoin is, We also find this in society.
