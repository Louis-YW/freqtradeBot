  "content": "Hello, BitcoinTalk community. A few months ago we ran Social-to-Earn program to incentivize users to join and to be more active.  Solcial's Social-to-Earn (S2E) Program is a unique rewards system designed to incentivize users for their active participation on the platform. By staking $SLCL tokens, users can earn additional SLCL through various activities such as posting content, receiving upvotes, and gaining followers. The more active a user is, the higher their yield will be, effectively transforming social media engagement into a rewarding experience.The process is easy. You create your account on Solcial.io, you can mint your own token (recommended to increase your APY in the staking program) and go to the Referrals and Earn page where you will be able to stake $SLCL tokens for 30 days and start earning. There are two types of APYs: BASE APY equals 20 percent and EXTRA APY which grows depending on your activity on the platform. Also, you have to come and claim tokens daily.  So if you missed one day the rewards will expire. Being shortly you can use Solcial, make posts, interact with other user's posts, trade tokens of other users, and in the same time earn from staked tokens. For more information come here:https://blog.solcial.io/english/solcial-launch-social-to-earn-program/ and do not hesitate to comment. I'll help you with a big pleasure. I am from a team",

      "body": "Quote from: vvoronovskiy on August 25, 2023, 07:20:12 AM Solcial's Social-to-Earn (S2E) Program is a unique rewards systemIts not unique. We already had such platforms already in 2016, so the \"unique tech\" you are talking about is already 7 years old (STEEM and HIVE social networks). In the crypto world, time flies so fast that presenting technology from 7 years ago is like calling a DVD drive something new.What's the problem with these types of projects? For one person to do \"Social-to-Earn\", another must want to pay them for \"Social-to-Earn\", and this someone is an investor in the project, and I assure you that there are not many people who treat investing as a charity supporting the random videos with cats creator. Even if there are people who like to support creators, they usually support their favorites and not random ones by buying and holding a token that goes down like a stone.",

      "body": "Yes, we have user tokens that other users can buy to invest in creators or get access to their private content that is actually not something new as you said. But our \"Social-to-Earn\" program is more like mining program. You stake main utility token ($SLCL) with a 30-days  period lock and start receiving tokens with a particular APY. If you want to increase APY you have to perform daily activities on platform, like making posts, trading and engaging with other users' posts.  So you earn tokens by being active on Solcial. We will scale this program 'cause now we have limited number of actions you can perform to increase your extra APY.",
