Now a days most of the scam or phishing sites are asking users to connect their wallet. So we must have more awareness and should learn well about where we are going to connect our wallet to prevent scam attacks. This phishing site is really very tough to catch by a Beginner because it's almost similar and a very little difference at the website link. If someone don't focus on it properly he will obviously fall into this trap.This domain just registered 2 days ago and you have caught much earlier.

Better You Should Create New Account For Airdrop Or Other Sites Joining.",

      "body": "I don't understand which one is real and which one is fake as both website domain is looking same. I think there is some writing mistake. The fake site has a letter L instead of digit 1 which looking similar to one. I will also add this phising site in my phising site list. Quote from: BD Crypto on July 02, 2023, 02:51:50 PMThis domain just registered 2 days ago and you have caught much earlier. Yes its quite new and i hope this site have not scammed big yet and has been exposed. This kind of phishing sites is now become very common and you will see many in twitter which is place of their promotion. We will be safe until we didn't connect our wallet.",

Thank you, @OP, for this catch, and I hope you and anyone will continue to publish warnings about any new phishing platforms or sites and others to raise Newbies' awareness and warn them not to lose their assets.",

Yeah, and install some apps too that will detect all this kind of phishing attempt as scammers will never stop, and on the contrary they continue to evolved their attacks and becoming hard to detect by using our naked eyes.Just like what I found here, I was searching for gucci koda pendant, and this fake website pop up,Code:https://koda-pendant.com/While base on my research, this is the original site, https://kodapendant.gucci.com/",
