  "content": "Hello everybody,is there any solo pool available out there that allows the mining on testnet ? If the answer is no, what does it need to mining on Bitcoins' testnet ? I have a full-node running bitcoin core v23.0.0 which is synced in testnet but to my knowledge I cannot mine directly onto bitcoin core any more with the latest version? Can anyone shed some light onto, please?thank you.",

It is clear that direct mining at bitcoin core has been shut down, I had explicitly written that in my post. Who can read is clearly at an advantage. But you obviously do not want to make a meaningful contribution here, you are known for that. Keep it up, just continue to make a fool of yourself with that pointless post with no quality. Save the smartass comments and do yourself and the rest of the world a favor.Quote from: NeuroticFish on October 26, 2022, 02:15:17 PMThere are 2 tutorials for solo mining on testnet, both written recently.

Will dig into them. Unlike the previous speaker, you have created qualitatively meaningful contribution.EDIT: Great! Exactly what I looked for. Thanks a bunch NeuroticFish !",

Difficulty is about 67 million, as of block 2,378,483. Why don't you want to earn some for free? That's what testnet is all about.

The answer is that the difficulty in testnet3 reverts to 1 after 20 minutes have passed with no one finding a block. A difficulty of 1 is so low that any CPU or GPU is capable of hitting a block. Note that this was the difficulty of Bitcoin in the beginning(2009). More details about this can be read here: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18554/how-can-i-find-the-real-difficulty-on-testnetIf you read that topic you'll see it was tried successfully.",

      "body": "of course it does. Everyone willing to read and learn is knowing that. As I said earlier, I am not interested in faucets, I was interested in mining on testnet. On testnet the difficulty is reset to 1 after 20min when no block was resolved. I already mined dozens of blocks meanwhile without issues. This was for learning purposes and such crap replies like those from NotFuzzyWarm are useless and not helpful for the community. Thanks again to NeuroticFish for his helpful post.",

Legit testnet users do fine using Faucets vs trying to get whole test coins. That of course is the reason behind my answer above.",
