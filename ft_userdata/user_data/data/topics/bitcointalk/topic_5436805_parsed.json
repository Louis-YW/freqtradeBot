He made mention of 0.008BTC being enough to have a lifestyle \"far more luxurious than an upper-middle class lifestyle today.\" He even claimed that 75,000 Sats could become a literal life-changing amount in the future. Notwithstanding his math, which carries a bit of exaggeration, these are all pure speculations. Regardless, however, the point has always been to stack as much Sats as possible. This man's prediction may or may not come true but, as Satoshi advised, \"It might make sense just to get some in case it catches on.\" And every single day that Bitcoin remains alive is a day that Bitcoin grows stronger and inches toward the prophecy. So, the possibility of Bitcoin becoming bigger in the future grows every day. Therefore, it is probably not enough to ask how much Bitcoin is enough. After all, there's no stopping now. I simply can't go like, \"I already have 0.008BTC or 0.00075BTC or \"0.12%\" or 1% of my entire worth in Bitcoin, I could stop stacking Sats now.\"",

We are talking about intergenerational wealth here. Well, doing a x3 per cycle, and decreasing surely each cycle, if you invest $50 is not going to change your life radically, if that's what we're talking about here. Then you have to think about something else: the person who invests $1k in Bitcoin, who normally does it because he cannot invest $10k or $100k, how long can he hold on without selling when it goes up? It is normal that if it makes a x5 or x10 at most 99% of people sell. You have to have a lot of patience and know about personal finance as well as good management to see it go down from the peak without having sold and endure 4 years of bear market.Quote from: fillippone on January 26, 2023, 01:28:16 PMBecoming rich is not that difficult, in the big scheme of things. One good idea, a bit of luck, or an incredible skill (think of Leo Messi) can lead you to become very rich. Without becoming very rich, everyone can become rich without having a special talent, simply by spending less than their earn and investing their savings. Month by month, year by year, investing and reinvesting. This is reflected in the book The Millionaire Next Door, which was criticized at the time as having a small sample size of less than 1,000 people. Years later the book Everyday Millionaires: How Ordinary People Built Extraordinary Wealth--And How You Can Too  with a sample of 10,000 people had very similar results.Regarding the Twitter thread, it's not the first time I've seen a thread like that, and just now after how disappointing this cycle has been in terms of returns, I'm not getting my hopes up too high. Besides for me Bitcoin is just a part of my wealth building plan, which I have been following for a long time, copying what those two books reflect and which is a safe but monotonous way to get rich.Since I became interested in personal finance many things have changed in my life. At the beginning everything seemed very difficult and I started with what everyone does: saving, then I controlled expenses, then I started investing, and to top it all off I came up with ways to get paid more for my main job and to obtain other sources of income. At the end there comes a time when everything becomes easier because you control income, reduce expenses and make more money month after month, year after year. What happens to a person who does that? They become rich. And this taking into account that I donate regularly, I take it as an expense like paying the electricity, yes I donate, I give money, every month, and every time I get richer.",

One good idea, a bit of luck, or an incredible skill (think of Leo Messi) can lead you to become very rich. The difficult part is staying rich. Securing such a luck to your heritage. This is what Bitcoin si for. There is some truth in that, although only a small percentage of people manage to find the perfect combination that consists of a top idea, a way to finance that idea and an element of luck without which it is difficult for it to succeed. Admittedly, some people are just lucky and become rich because they won the lottery or a rich relative left them a large fortune that they didn't even know existed.Staying rich is really a problem for some, because I remember an example when an elderly man in my country won the main lottery prize (about a million euros) and after a few years appeared in the newspaper with a story about how he was left with nothing.It is hard for me to say at this moment how much BTC I would need to feel rich, although I am not one of those who would like to have some kind of status symbols that determine how rich you are, such as yachts, luxury villas or expensive cars. For most of us who live in the EU or the US, having one BTC is not a fortune considering the prices we pay, maybe if the price of BTC would go up at least x20, but for someone who lives in a country with a low standard, 1 BTC is already a real fortune today which can enable you to buy a house, a solid car and more.I somehow doubt that 0.6 BTC would be enough for a slightly better lifestyle in countries with high standards, at least not in the near future. However, maybe one day that amount will really be enough, but only if the demand is so great that it pushes the price to heights that few people talk about in a serious tone today.",
