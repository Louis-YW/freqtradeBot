  "content": "I came across this shot online, it's a new paper from Daily Mail dated Tuesday, December 5th, 2000. The bolded headline which I quote below... QuoteInternet 'maybe just a passing fad as millions give up on it' Is what caught my attention. Seeing how this correlates with what is currently happening to bitcoin made me believe in bitcoin the more, it shows that every innovation that changed the way the entire world does a thing, faced alot of challenges at their beginning. The internet came, it changed the way we used to interact and connect with one another, it changed the way we used to pass information, it connected the whole world together, we enjoy it today, But at its younger years, not many people accepted it.Today, Bitcoin is here to change the financial system, it is here to take financial/monetary power away from the governments, away from the banks, away from so called financial authorities, bitcoin is here to take financial/monetary power away from all this entities, and give the power back to those it really belongs to, but still alot of people are refusing to accept it, even at the detriment of their future, the Chinese government are at the forefront of the war against Bitcoin, and some foolish people are blindly following them.I remember the story of paypal, PayPal fought against bitcoin, they banned users who bought bitcoin with PayPal, long story short, today PayPal has a bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallet in-built in the app, the co-founder once said the greatest mistake he made in the last decade was getting too late and too little into bitcoin.If the internet faced challenges in its early days but today, it's a success, give your reason why you think bitcoin can not succeed even far better than the internet.Put your comments down below. Let's discuss.",

You will have a leader or a group of powerful people who will make rules for society and the rest will follow it. This is how human were trained from the ancient time. The powerful people always took advantage from it. Unfortunately people know it but still they are just too afraid to make their own way. Democracy was never there. The only example of democracy is bitcoin.

Internet was a bubble. Obviously now it's bankers time. It's all propaganda from the groups who will lose their power.",

It's an evolutionary system by that time that seemed to be ineviatble so, humans would develop it, improve it, spread it by any meansm, because it was simply too good be be left behind. Just like Bitcoin. Looks like Bitcoin is taking longer to get a grip but it will prove the best and will prove the only one that can take over the current fiat system. And even if CBCs tries to slow it down, people will tend to follow the best evolution an that's not CBDCs for sure because they are just a 100% digital version of the same shit we alreay have now!",

The Internet is a radically new structure for communication and spreading information, for the first time people got ability to instantly send information to any number of people at any place in the world, and also have this information available 24/7. It's a vastly different dimension when compared to radio, TV, telephone, newspapers. Now compare Bitcoin and banks - both allow you to send money to other people, the difference is that Bitcoin is free from limits and control, but it doesn't matter to 99.9% of users. And money with fixed supply is not innovative either, people abandoned gold standard, because they decided that the benefits of supply that can be inflated outweigh the downsides. Bitcoin is here to stay because of this tiny share of global population that values its benefits, but expecting it to be nearly as adopted as the Internet is a pipe dream - if Bitcoin was on track to such adoption, it would have already saw much higher adoption.Also, the Internet was rapidly improving since its introduction. At first it was slow, expensive, the browsers lacked features that we have today - but it quickly became cheap, fast, available and full of content. Bitcoin fundamentally barely changed since Satoshi mined the first block, without considering Lightning Network.",

But then again how many newspapers and magazines was killed if they didn't adapt to the changing times, all of them did become online.So that might be the same plight for bitcoin and crypto, will people going to used the old and traditional fiat and banking system? or those needs to adapt as well (we have CBCD's already and then banks embracing crypto).",

It's about giving control back to the people and that's why government and other entities wanted to stop it early. But they can't, we already marches to our first decade already. And now they started to realize that they really have to accept it. As the saying goes, \"if you can't beat them, join them\". Maybe that's what they are feeling right now, banking systems, financial watchdogs and countries themselves.",

Let's discuss. In 2017, the CEO of JPMorgan, Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a fraud. According to him “It’s just not a real thing, eventually it will be closed,\". And he went further to say that, he’d “fire in a second” any JPMorgan trader who was trading bitcoin, noting two reasons: “It’s against our rules and they are stupid.”1 But fast forward to 4 years after, JPMorgan is quietly offering 6 crypto investments funds to clients.2 And no employee as fired.I could understand why people at the beginning called Bitcoin a fad. They hadn't seen any investment so good that it could give you a 300% ROI and that was very volatile. Like you could lose the 300% profit in a heartbeat. However, Bitcoin is the first of the cryptocurrency. It already has the credibility. And right now it has gained so much prominence that it cannot be ignored or overlooked.1. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-raises-flag-on-trading-revenue-sees-20-percent-fall-for-the-third-quarter.html2. https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-quietly-offers-6-crypto-investments-despite-ceo-jamie-dimons-anti-bitcoin-stance/",
