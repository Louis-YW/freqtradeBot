Another one again that malware is also becoming reality through using ChatGPT. I do not see any good reason to use ChatGPT for now, but I am really discourage again and again.",

      "body": "ChatGPT won't create or provide answers to anything that is illegal or what it is programmed to deem illegal. But the problem is, you just need to tweak your question or request a little bit and what was initially unacceptable is suddenly fine and OK according to their TOS. I am sure that's how people trick the AI to make it create such code for them.I wouldn't recommend that anyone enter their actual passwords on https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/ai-password-cracking/. But you can enter something similar if you are really curious. A password made up of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters would take billions of years to bruteforce according to that site. And they are pretty easy to generate.",

Â I will not advise that also, it is not good to type your password on what is online. AI may be good to crack password but I do not think it is capable to know strong password which is what should be used and it is what we are telling people on this forum. A password that is eight character long or more character long that consists of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and characters like .,-_$#@*\"':!?? should be strong enough for AI to crack the password.",
