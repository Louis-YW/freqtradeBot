  "content": "Are you as tired as me of missing out on interesting seed investment opportunities due to based IDO launchpad that favours established investors? Well, today is a lucky day for you as I discovered the best IDO launchpad that uses a Proof of Attention model to allocate funds called AdLunam. AdLunam assigns allocations for the upcoming IDOs by testing out the investor’s active participation with the project’s socials and their trust scores. So basically you’re being allocated funds based on your interaction with the project making it a fair allocation of funds. AdLunam is changing the IDO launchpad industry!Learn more: adlunam.cc",

(it just doesn’t sound like the best platform)",

      "body": "Previously I tried to see about the AdLunam project at: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/adlunam/, AdLunam project is not registered yet.I want to ask, what is your relationship with the AdLunam platform and the launch of IDO, are you the CEO or the AdLunam Team, and one more question who is @Nadja Bester.Looks like the AdLunam project has been developed and running for about two years and has 28 investors, should, the AdLunam project is already known and in demand by the wider community, especially crypto users, what happened to the real AdLunam.Current investors, a little more careful with crypto projects in investing, it seems if you are part of the AdLunam project team, you should be more transparent and open about AdLunam, what's even more great is campaigning for AdLunam on this forum, to introduce more widely to crypto investors, just a suggestion, many do like that.",

Which is being promoted as the solution to these problems?In general, the attractiveness of projects does not determine their value, but rather the effect of supply and demand.so, in short, and with the current market situation its better to avoid any new terms projects.",
