  "content": "With the introduction of the Ordinals protocol, various adventurers appeared who wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to issue tokens on the most famous and popular blockchain. As expected, there were also those who announced the release of stablecoins on the bitcoin blockchain.So, recently the Stably project announced the launch of its USD-based stablecoin. Of course, the announced emission of $69.420 trillion suggests that it is hardly worth taking this project seriously, and Decrypt additionally cites arguments against this project. But there will surely be other projects ahead that want to issue stablecoins on the bitcoin blockchain. Perhaps these will be some of the currently popular stablecoins.How do you feel about the prospect of dollar stablecoins on the bitcoin blockchain? Will you use them? How might this affect Bitcoin?",

As expected, there were also those who announced the release of stablecoins on the bitcoin blockchain.Am hearing this for the very first time, what we know already was the introduction of bitcoin tokens which is often callee as ordinals inscriptions on the bitcoin blockspace, yet we don't know what the developers have concluded on regarding this, but what we can also see is that there's a little calmness now unlike the heat and pressure that got accumulated at the cause of high transaction fee. Quote from: Who is John Galt? on May 27, 2023, 11:46:49 AMHow do you feel about the prospect of dollar stablecoins on the bitcoin blockchain? Will you use them? How might this affect Bitcoin?If bitcoin tokens can succeded in finding it way through the bitcoin network then the stable coins may not be exceptional provided that they will have to share the same network with bitcoin because if you consider the stable coins today, they have their own separate network on the blockchain under BSC, Tron network. Or the developers may create another new stable coin that will make use of the bitcoin network aside from the existing ones.",

How might this affect Bitcoin?I feel very bad if something like that happens on Bitcoin blockchain. The stable-coins have no place on Bitcoin blockchain and if someone adds those into it just like ordinals then that might be a problematic issue for the Bitcoin users. The stable-coins are okay in their current state and adding them on Bitcoin blockchain will be an extra burden on Blockchain.I will never use such useless stable-coins that can cause network congestion in Bitcoin blockchain. They have no use on the blockchain but there are those people who create such projects to disrupt the working state of the Bitcoin. They won't be successful in their operations because the developers are already trying to find a way to stop the Ordinals protocol.Those useless stable-coins will affect the sate of Bitcoin without any doubt, they will cause huge congestions to the market and because of that the fee could go very high once again after that BRC-20 tokens. Although, I'm not against such project but due to limited block size of Bitcoin blockchain it isn't worth to add those things in the blockchain.",

      "body": "firstly ordinals is not even a real token or NFT. its a pretend \"theory\" of junk data that pretends to have a proof of transfer even though the deadweight data sits outside of what gets signed into a tx. yep data sits outside of a signed TX thus is not assigned to any output nor inside the signed data content.. thus its not owned by what the theory suggests.. (yep you can prune the deadweight data of ordinals and not break the transaction. so its not actually part of a transaction.. its just appended deadweight after the transaction)secondly if bitcoin ever did become a network hosting multi currency it breaks the economic policy of bitcoin that meant to only offer upto 2099999999967690000 sharable units of a currency called sats..(yep the hard rule always was starting from genesis 50000000000sats every block for 210k blocks then halves amount per 210k blocks. totally the amount of units mentioned.. )thirdly regulators would then want more controls.. due to regulations about ICO scammers and also regulations of stable coins. it is funny that some people suggest that bitcoin is not fit for bitcoin transactions('no weeks wage amounts for 3rd world countries allowed', 'no coffee/pizza amounts for 1st world countries allowed', and such) and thus they advertise other networks pretending to be next gen bitcoin network.. which they want people to be pushed over to/offramped/offboarded too.. but the same groups then advertise that bitcoin should then fill up with junk data(ordinals) or ICO scams or regulated currencies(stablecoins) that will hurt bitcoin.",
