How you would be able to determine those into this speculative market.- Following someone is never been ideal but its not bad to get some idea as long it is really for free.Lastly, use up one signal? There's no such thing you could really be able to get a hold of yourself well into this market on having this kind of mindset.Price is volatile and theres no way that a single signal would able to solve it out.",

OP is completely anonymous, so one day he may just disappear, taking your money with him.Claiming this to be the secret of successful futures is quiet a hype for me and yes, better to be more careful on dealing with someone especially if you are going to rely too much on any signal. Trading futures should be based on your own strategy, and timeline because futures is too risky. In order for you to succeed you must know first to analyze, and signal might not be a good start for that.",

And right now you have peruse into the signal and understand or find out a loophole. So it's better for we to build up reputation first before venturing into what can not finish because of money.",

Maybe I'm wrong but there is one thing I've noticed here, someone is trying to offer his signal in exchange for money and then make himself a good/best trader that he only knows about it. I'm not against doing it but due to a rampant scam issue of using signals, this makes me think that it was not good anymore. If I were you OP, better keep your signal and continue what you are doing because there is no other reason of saying you can give true/good signals other than collecting some amounts.
