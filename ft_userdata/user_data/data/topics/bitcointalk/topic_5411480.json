Also I am interested to see the first YouTube video. I want to analyse it to understand its contents and its nature for a reference. Can any body help to find it. Thank you for your help. Actually there are many news and news sources that you can make reference if it is about the history of the birth of Bitcoin. But if you want news that was made in late 2008 and early 2009, then it's a little hard to find now because Satoshi Nakamoto first introduced Bitcoin on October 31, 2008 which was then officially released to the public in early 2009.And if your goal is only for reference to Bitcoin. So try to find more references in the form of articles about Bitcoin from now on. But if you want a reference in the form of a youtube video, I can only share three videos that have been uploaded to the youtube platform since 11 years ago and I think you can use it as a reference although I can't be sure if it's the first video for Bitcoin or not.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejiqbzqmxSEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrikj7fy4MU",

There are tons of video sources and historical news about the origin of Bitcoin, but I don't know which one is really genuine about this, maybe you can take a look and find out in this thread. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5139531.0If in the thread I provided you are unsure of what they provide, you can look it up through articles you may actually believe.",
