The headline might look serious like a country is attacking crypto mining, while in fact we're talking about a small and politically unstable region with a little over 200k people. How many of them are trying to mine bitcoin? Probably not many.Also, it's worth noting they're talking about fighting people who are stealing power to mine crypto. It must be a real issue in this poor region if they're releasing statements to the press about something like that.",

I believe that if there is a lack of electricity, it should be added, not banned mining.Yeah, in reading the article, they're dealing with energy shortages just like everyone. It's understandable to crack down on excessive uses of electricity, and a mining farm certainly qualifies. This would be a big deal if these crackdowns were in US where a third of the mining comes from, but in Georgia, it's not going to change anything for the rest of us. Something you'd never guess though, is that the third largest mining country is Kazakhstan, which is right across the water from Georgia. I'd suspect they're going to be dealing with similar electricity issues, and perhaps Georgia cracking down on mining is just a sign of what's to come for Kazakhstan, which could have a relatively large impact on the entire industry.",

It's not a country, just a part of territory of another country. ~No. You can't say \"Georgia\" in this case, because it would be misleading. Abkhazia is a part of Georgia ruled by separatists backed by Russia. So, the \"Abkhazia's government\" is doing what their masters in Moscow are telling them to do, in accordance with what is taking place in Russia itself.(a screenshot from the same source, news.bitcoin.com)",

No one wants their equipment confiscated, or, worse, all their money, or, even worse, they are put in jail on top of everything else. And you better be paranoid when going to places controlled by separatists backed by Russia.",

Also, the crackdown on legitimate miners will be good for the illegal miners because difficulty will go down and give them a bigger percentage of the total hashrate. There might be a future where illegal miners will make up more of the total than legitimate miners if all jurisdictions around the world begin cracking down on bitcoin mining. It will certainly not stop the criminals if there is money earned. Illegal bitcoin mining can also be funded by our favorite hustlers in the cryptospace to continue the party heheheeh.",

This is not very much similar to a house heater that you can control which part if the house is heated and control the temperature with a switch. The heat also cannot be collected and directed to be used over a large scale to make it a serviceable solution.Also, I speculate that the power companies would like to take advantage of the demand, however, the regulators are the problem. This will only cause miners to mine illegally or make some under the table deals with lawless minded people from the power companies.",
