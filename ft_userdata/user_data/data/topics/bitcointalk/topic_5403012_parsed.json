Has anyone else heard that our US fuel reserves are going to Europe?“We’re Barely Making It”: Furious Farmer Goes Viral Explaining Why Food Prices “Are Going To Go Up”Quote from: https://www.activistpost.com/2022/06/were-barely-making-it-furious-farmer-goes-viral-explaining-why-food-prices-are-going-to-go-up.htmlAccording to the monthly survey by Purdue University/CME Group, The rapid rise in production costs and uncertainty regarding the direction of input prices have been important contributors to the drop in sentiment. About 44 percent of farmers, according to the monthly survey, cited input costs as their biggest concern for the coming year, according to the Epoch Times.In fact, 60% of farmers predict farm input prices to be at least 30% higher this year compared to 2021.To that end, Ohio farmer Holly Weilnau took to TikTok two weeks ago in a now-viral video to explain how farmers are suffering under inflated input costs, which is going to send the price of food much higher than it is right now.\"There are things that we have to buy,\" she says, adding \"There's something we have to buy that two years ago cost us $24, last year was about $46, this year it is costing us $96.\"\"Please understand, food prices are going to go up,\" she continues. \"You wanna act like it's the farmers' fault—it is not the farmers' fault. We are barely making it to grow the stuff so you guys are able to get it in August, September, October.\"...Pennsylvania farmers are unable to harvest their crops because of the diesel shortageQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-17-pennsylvania-farmers-unable-harvest-crops-diesel-shortage.html#In two short years, America has gone from energy independence to an energy crisis. The average price of diesel is now $6.19 in Pennsylvania. Diesel prices are up 75 percent from one year ago. Farmers are struggling to obtain and/or afford diesel fuel and are therefore unable to get their crops out of the ground.The Morning Call reports that Pennsylvania farmers are getting “crushed” by the record diesel prices, and the situation will most certainly affect food prices and bring about new food shortages in the coming months.Farmers left stranded and broke, unable to harvest this year’s cropA report from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania found a farmer completely stranded, unable to get diesel fuel and unable to operate his tractor. He cannot afford to harvest the corn he planted earlier in the year. The farmer reached out to Kyle Kotzmoyer, a legislative affairs specialist at the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. Kotzmoyer testified to the state legislature on behalf of the farmers struggling to make ends meet. “We have reached that point to where it is very close to being a sinking ship. We are teetering on the edge right now,” Kotzmoyer told the legislature.If farmers can’t pay to get the crops out of the ground, then the domestic US food supply will take another blow. On average, a farmer responsible for 3,500 acres will burn about 2,000 gallon of diesel every month. As the cost of farming doubles from just a year ago, many farmers may only be able to harvest a little over half of what they once produced. Many may sell their corn and bean seeds back so they can harvest hay, which has a better return on investment.Build back better communism is punishing and impoverishing the producers...",
