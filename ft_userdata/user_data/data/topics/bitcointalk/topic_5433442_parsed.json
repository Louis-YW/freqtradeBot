Keep reading across the various boards focusing on stickie threads (those are threads that are pinned to the top of each board) and with time you will begin to learn how it works.Improving your use of English can also be helpful to entering discussions and understanding what others are discussing. You can also check for a local board to join to help you communicate better with your community. You can find them from scrolling down at the home page.Quote from: Onyeeze on January 08, 2023, 07:48:08 AMcan i make suggestions in another place that is not this board.Yes you can, if your suggestion is relevant to that board.Each board has a slight description under it which tells what sort of posts should be made there.",

If you feel that topic (conversation, discussion) is non sense, it does not worth your time to join it, so let's skip it.If it is interesting for you, you must read the opening post (OP) and follow flow of discussion in that topic, from first post to later posts, at least in first one or two pages. If you see questions were answered in first two pages, no need to repeat what others discussed. Of course if you want to be helped by others to clarify some idea, you can join and ask.",

Don't let the ranks of members intimidate you into believing you aren't qualified to respond to them. First thing is to understand what's being discussed before you make your contributions.

It's a kind of congregation for newbies but it doesn't mean newbies can't post or start threads anywhere else. Threads are placed in sections that befit the questions asked in the OP or its content. Of course, threads are also moved to the relevant board if they aren't placed in the right board or section in the first place.",
