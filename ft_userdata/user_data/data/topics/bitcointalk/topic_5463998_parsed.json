I am not expecting airdrop from them soon but since I am a retroactive drop hunter in interacting to such platforms like this, I am taking chances.",

Its also good thing they got a code for invitation and this wouldnt spread like wildfire. Ive got 3 invite codes too. Will be giving that also here if some wanted to try it out.I dont have yet points and waiting till friday for update and I just started last night. Do you know how the points or activities needed to gain points? I think the codes arent basis of it or also part?",

I can see why they're botting it though, buying some influencers' shares early and cheap is guaranteed profit. Guess we need to find some hidden gems among CT profiles I think it still has a lot of room to grow, i.e. we're early, I haven't seen many non-CT influencers and they haven't launched the token yet. But I think it won't be sustainable, 2-3 months of hype at best.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on August 21, 2023, 02:51:27 AMThey have a point system which updated every friday but not sure what this for, could be an airdrop thing.

As long as there's that point system that's being promised to have some sort of use case on the system and the rumor about an airdrop, I think it will continue. The points they will share will range for 6 months and there's rumor as well that they have partnered with VC firm Paradigm and don't know the exact number but it was around $50M. This is just a thing I saw on Twitter.",

You can be as much hyped about it as you want but the end result will not change, this is a low level cap thing and it will not change anytime soon at all. I feel like it is going to matter in the end, but before it could matter we need to realize that it is going to be a bit tough, and we need to find something different about it.This is why I believe that we need to make sure that everything stays quite similar to each other and not really change all that much. Hopefully it is going to be fine and we will not see anything bigger like people losing tens of millions of dollars into these things, it could be a lot worse if we had that and I would suggest otherwise.",

Trend always change at crypto so we should always be at alert cause we can feel if the hype is over. But I think until the airdrop points discuss by the team and reach the concluded possible drop thats where it end.

Yes obviously its system is a ponzi scheme but if you try it out youll see the whole process as convenient and not a bad idea. You think CTs would do a vulgar ponzi if they dont like what they earned. Keeping safe is to only send funds you willing to play and withdraw once you earn.",
