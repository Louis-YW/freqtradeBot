Not because bitcoin's unit price doesn't make it \"expensive\" and that most people wouldn't be able to use it.Remember: bitcoin is highly divisible. At some point it's likely (and I freakin hope) that we would be using a smaller denomination as to make it easier for day-to-day transactions.Quote from: lenaza2022 on June 09, 2022, 01:10:20 PMRe: What is the future of bitcoin? Commodity, currency or smth else?It doesn't need to be one or the other. It could be all those things at the same time.On another note, this is one of the main reasons why I've been a heavy advocate for everyone to use sats by default instead of bitcoin lol.",

That is, everything is denominated in units of 1, and cannot be divided (cents are for extremely cheap stuff).Actually, it is impossible to adjust the unit value of a truly decentralized currency, since that would be equivalent to a central bank issuing a new banknote and taking the old one out of circulation.

Bitcoin/cryptocurrency can not act unilaterally in a system and that means it transaction has to involve either faint at some point. Bitcoin's limited supply does not make it unaffordable to buy its smallest unit that is a misconception it may be expensive that is only when you want to exchange it with a faint, I will advise you to take your time to study Bitcoin and its decentralized nature to build a better knowledge about it so that you would not work around with this misconception for long.",
