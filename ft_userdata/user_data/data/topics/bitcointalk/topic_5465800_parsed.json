  "content": "I just checked in a few boards and i don’t see a topic like this, so i am going to start it.I want to create a list of the current problems of the bitcoin community and open a discussion for possible ways to help to solve it or atleast try it.Please feel free to correct me if i am wrong or suggest some solutions if don’t mention it, the list of issues is open to new itemsList of issues The current network congestion caused by the spam/dust transactions of Ordinals. …How to address each of the previous issuesThe current network congestion caused by the spam/dust transactions of Ordinals.If you are a regular user of bitcoinEducate yourself how to save try to save every satoshi at the moment of make a transactionChoose a good wallet that allow you to setup the fee manually stop using legacy addresses, try to start using segwit address or taproot addressLearn about terms like RBF, Bump fee, CPFP, UXTOsYou can perform some tests on the TESTNET environment, just to validate your knowledge.If a transaction isn’t urgent try to wait for the correct moment to broadcast it and learn how to select a good fee value for it.If you are a business interested in to accept bitcoin transacctionsStart accepting payments using the Lightning NetworkIf you are developer of some exchange or entity that perform bitcoin transactionsSave every satoshi that you can. (Try to demostrate to your employer that this changes can generate profit for them)Implement as soon as possible segwit or taproot walletsTry to avoid the use of p2pkh walletsImplement an efficient way to select automatically a correct fee for your transaction.If your transaction need to be bump for fee, just increment 1 sat/vB, there is no need to double your current amount of fees, your transaction will be included in the next block regardless if you increment the fee in 1 sat/vB or in 100 sat/vBIf you are minerWe know that mining it is a business but the final user experience will dictate the legit demand of bitcoin in the future, nobody is going to like to perform transactions in a network that prioritize dust/spam transactions and have highest feesCheck the possibility of reducing a little the priority to those dust transactions in any case the mempool is full of legit transactions that are also paying fees.Check the possibility of reserve some little percentage of space the block to include some stuck transactions, less than 3% or even 1% will be good those transactions can be selected randomly Remember that the health of the network depends in a wide way of your actionsI am going to try to make some videos trying to educate to the final users about this topics, also i want to redact some kind of open letter to the miners.Wha do you think about this, i want to read you.Regards!",

Is the issue about the Ordinals still the hottest issue in the community today?Anyway, using a native SegWit address should also be an option for a regular Bitcoin user. I also didn't see Lightning. That's a much cheaper and faster alternative, albeit off-chain. Also, checking the mempool before making a transaction helps. Although there are currently a total of more than 600,000 unconfirmed transactions, you can still pay 16 Sats/vB. Furthermore, it is best to choose a wallet that allows you to personalize your fees. You can save a lot with it.",

It's like the Bitcoin devs don't want the Ordinal community to leave the network because their transactions cause fees to go up which will benefit the miners on the network. And maybe this is the reason why until now they haven't solved this Ordinal problem.",

They often possess limited technical know-how; a comprehensive, user-friendly knowledge base, universally accessible, solves this.Secondly, community consensus is invaluable in streamlining transaction priorities. Should developers create a decentralized voting system embedded into the blockchain? Users, miners, and businesses alike could upvote/downvote types of transactions. Decentralized democracy at play. And we'll need incentives to participate in such systems; micro-rewards, perhaps?You touched upon miner ethics. The power dynamics between miners and users are stark. A decentralized “code of conduct” ratified by the community would hold them accountable. This isnt merely theoretical; its a systemic overhaul that would sustain Bitcoin's core philosophy.",

Few months back though, it was a huge issues, the network congestion was due to the BRC20 and Ordinals and it really took bitcoin enthusiast by storm. But lately though, at least at this point is has slow down a bit. But there is occasional spikes in the network, and just like now, I see that the fastest is around 20 sat/vB which I think it's too expensive for us average Joe and all we can do is wait for the mempool to at least clear in the next hour and see how the fees will be.",

Well ordinals are not considered as good for BTC blockchain while they are tagged as spam by stompix and DDmr said miner are trying to manipulate the transaction fee by making small transactions just to fill up the block so that tx makers have to select more higher fee using RBF so that there transaction could get more priority. (Not mentioning the links to there threads but you can find them in my recent replies). And one more thing, which would help a lot, you can add links to the useful threads which actually are tutorials of how to reduce or pay lesser fee using wallets or any platform. I found this one about the use of electrum to pay lesser fee which is a good one actually I was trying to find another thread but did not found it so instead of that this might work too. i know this is not enough but still as I said it would ve better in my thoughts otherwise it is ignorable.

This is just starting to cause problems again. To be honest I was now aware of the whole story before but after reading some topics related to this issue I also aware of this know and you are right just like you I also cane to know about such issue due to this forum as members here are really active. And they all are sharing insightful ideas too, to solve the problems. Currently, the only issue to BTC blockchain is due to Ordinals but there are many other issues which BTC needs to solve them.How are we going to beat the reptilians when monkeys are kicking our ass? You should read this new thread and also read some replies to get better ideas about which issues BTC is facing and which issues need instant solutions.The solutions which OP had mentioned in his post,  are definitely not enough but that's why he has said I want to read you. As he might not bw a BTC developer neither I am but in my opinion these issues can only be solved by the developers while people like us who are after BTC and are miners too then they might try to manipulate the network with dust transactions.
