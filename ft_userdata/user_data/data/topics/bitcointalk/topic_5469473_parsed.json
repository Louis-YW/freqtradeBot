      "body": "I just went through the chat on that bounty telegram group you dropped and made a few previews, and this is what I got. The bounty campaign runs for several weeks, which was not even as expected from the beginning of the campaign; it was extended, and no extra allocation was made or added to the initial bounty pool. Some members complained about it, while others didn't, as the manager, who happens to be a female who is always active in the bounty group, promised everyone that payment would be made after the end of the campaign.¬†After the campaign ended and it was time for distribution, the project team came up with the excuse that the token price was too high and that the bounty distribution amount, if distributed on PDX, would cause a lot of damage to the project volume on the exchange, claiming they had little volume, which couldn't convey a massive sale from bounty hunters. They later came to the conclusion that they were to distribute via USDT and not directly to the user's wallet but to an exchange account (KuCoin), according to this . spreadsheet  ¬†There was an agreed amount, which was agreed for the hunters to be paid per each of the PDX coins they earn. As the first spreadsheet was calculated based on tokens, I can't get the amount from the spreadsheet or from the telegram group; maybe I search or scroll too fast. But based on my observation, the amounts agreed upon are lower than the initial coin price that they are trading on the exchange (which looks like a means to scam the hunters to me).¬†Based on the disagreement between the bounty participants, PDX representatives, and the bounty manager, there was an agreement to pay the first agreed amount to all the participants and convince them that the exact same amount that was paid to everyone will also later be paid to them all on the same account, which was the PDX project representative statement, but it appears that the statement was later rephrased to sound like the next payment was to be a bonus and not something obligated to them.Quote Hello everyone! Wait for an announcement from the CEO.It cannot be said that the project is a scam because you received a reward on the first distribution, and many of them were quite high. The second distribution is an additional reward.‚ö†Ô∏è Don't spam about the project or team anywhere! Those participants who do this will definitely not receive the second reward!  Source  If you ask me, I will say that this is most likely some kind of scheme drawn from the beginning by the project owners in order not to pay the hunters their reward as promised from the beginning of the campaign.If there are other hunters who can support you, either you guys let it slide or you can organise and report their social media accounts and see what will come afterward, but this event appears to be a year or more old, so I wonder how many hunters who were active in the campaign are still here right now.¬†Oh, It appears that I have plenty of time to waste .",

Orpichukwu gave a very nice brief summary of what happened. Their telegram bounty channel is a ghost town. They have no representative here, other than the BM who no longer active, no ANN, so there's no way to flag the project.Quote from: Mst.Wangdan$ on October 08, 2023, 04:57:29 PMYes of course I think this project team has knowingly corrupted our bounty huntersOP, there is no possible way to tag them, they don't have a representative here, unless I am mistaken? How much did they owe the bounty participants for 2nd round of distribution?They're trading on P2B [formerly p2pb2b], with 24h trading volume $886,000+, I won't be surprised if it's a trading bot activity and not an organic volume.",

Well the team behind this project employed a poor and bad marketing strategy taking advantage of bounty hunters by promising them substantial rewards and then cutting and changing the initial promised amount. I remember having a similar experience with a project's signature campaign in the bounty section. They distributed tokens to participants but started making excuses to prevent anyone from exchanging those tokens for more than 2 months, Eventually they imposed a KYC process and a 6 month lockup period for the tokens that were worth only a few dollars.These kind of projects are likely to turn out to be a scam after few months or so, simply we can know that with the evident manipulation they did with participants. I¬† noticed that with so,e experience that many projects lacking honesty and seriousness tend to scam investors and exit after gathering much money. everyone should be cautious when thinking of investing or even getting involved with their bounties in such projects just to avoid wasting time.",
