  "content": "Hey Everyone,Mechanized Mayhem is an upcoming TCG Web3 Game featuring unique movement and deckbuilding mechanics.Our Veteran team has over 40+ combined years of AAA game development experience, having worked on titles like Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, FIFA, Gears of War, and Mass Effect among many others.We believe the TCG space can act as a bridge between web2 gamers and the web3 space.The idea of high priced Trading Cards have already been accepted by the mainstream (Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, and Various Sport Cards). Therefore we believe that the TCG space will be one where Web2 gamers will be able to more easily make the transition into Web3 and NFT ownership.Mechanized Mayhem will be a freemium game that everyone can play without blockchain knowledge.We will be releasing booster packs which will allow users to customize their decks and gain an advantage in our competitive PVP ranked modes.These packs and cards will be able to transition into regular NFTs that can be traded on the open market.We will be releasing a lot more details about the game over the next couple months. At the moment our team is focused on building a strong community before we start looking to raise funds.Eventually we will also be introducing a MECH token which will have various utility in our game and marketplace.Of course, all of our early twitter/discord followers will be rewarded handsomely Here are some links to our project and socials, as well as a short gameplay teaser!Those of you lucky enough to receive a Beta key will be able to access our Vertical Slice demo on Elixir Games!Website: https://mechanizedmayhem.comDiscord: https://discord.gg/VPbkPxtsbwTwitter: https://twitter.com/MechanizeMayhemTeaser Trailer: https://youtube.com/watch?v=GgLUo5V27eMElixir Games Listing: https://launcher.elixir.app/games/mechanized-mayhemElixir Game Partnership Announcement: https://blog.elixir.app/mechanized-mayhem-elixir-partnership-announcement/Looking forward to hearing from everyone!",
