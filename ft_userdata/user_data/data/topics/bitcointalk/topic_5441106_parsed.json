      "body": "What do you mean by \"DeFi\"? Are you talking about participating in liquidity pools, staking, farming, etc on an altcoin chain? If that's the case, I've never seen one other than those mentioned above (note that I never actively try to look for one either). Most of the time these service providers talk about trades done on exchanges, at least those that I'm aware of. They use DeFi regularly, but it also strictly limits trading on decentralized exchanges. Have you Googled it on your own? It seems like there are a decent of options right now (Taxbit, Bear, Zenledger, etc). I don't know how reliable they are since I never use one.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on February 25, 2023, 08:11:38 AMAlso you could use Binance Ive just remembered that they just recently announced their Binance Tax feature, just check their blog post about the details. CMIIW, this newly announced service is limited to France for now. That being said, the Binance tax tool already exists but it only helps with exporting trades history afaik. It still doesn't sound like what OP is looking for though.",

They will help you to calculate it with the appropriate taxation rules in your country, all you need is to be transparent with them. If you have any intention to hide some profit you've make, you're still want to manipulate the income you make and it's considered as illegal IMO.",

      "body": "One option for finding a reliable tax professional for crypto is to search for a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) who specializes in cryptocurrency taxes. Remember, when it comes to taxes, it's better to be safe than sorry. Don't rush into hiring a service without doing your own research and verifying their credentials. So, it may take a little time and effort, but it's worth it in the long run to ensure that your taxes are filed correctly and you avoid any penalties or fines depending on the legality of crypto in your current country.",
