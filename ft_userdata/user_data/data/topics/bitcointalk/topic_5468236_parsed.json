  "content": "Hi everyone, I just recovered my old account    . I am glad of that, I've seen that some members that have multiple accounts and I just want to recover this one.My current profile in the forum is albert0bsd. Before that created it, I tried to recover this account that was two years ago, but they said that it was not possible because the account never has activity.I tried once again this week and today they unlocked it! In this occasion, i just point to my current profile (albert0bsd) and it works!In the past years I missed the opportunity to see the development of the distinct histories that have been developed in this forum in all these years.In any case we can’t change the past, so I am just looking forward to using this account often.Quote-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----I'm albertoSeptember 26, 2023-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----1Coffee1jV4gB5gaXfHgSHDz9xx9QSECVWIB9o171RaG0rW5LOZ6A0e5pWlLHc2SmszPiHxs7Bw9esamMA5qTTCrPauW/RS1762bsuv0T20KtByESTPTUIK5U=-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----That address is on my github page.Regards!",

People try to recover accounts that already have an achieved rank, with a certain number of posts, and that makes sense because ranking up a new one takes time and effort but recovering this one only makes sense because of the name, although you can always create a new one that varies it a bit, like you did with albert0bsd.",

If I were you, I would have tried to get it back too. I hope that in all the years, apart from missing the opportunity to have followed the stories on this forum, until a couple of years ago when you registered with albert0bsd, you didn't miss the opportunity to have accumulated a decent amount of bitcoin. Many of us dreamed of having known about bitcoin and this forum as early as 2011, although I see some people on the forum who registered a few years later and they don't look like they are loaded.",

Recovering a Brad New account (0 posts) is something I can’t recall hearing happening before during my stay here so far.Side note: Back in the day, with some end of 2018 data, I recall accounting for over 1,7 M Bitcointalk Brand new accounts. A bunch of them obviously were nuked accounts, but many seemed to follow a bot like pattern when created (i.e. name pattern and date/time of creation suggesting large batches), specially from the later years.Going over the chart I then created, there were, at the time, 26.446 still brand new accounts created in 2011, out of which 6.792 were last active in 2011 (I believe your recovered account was one of the latter).",

Maybe it will be the case for some who will consider it as proof that the OP is one of those early users of the forum, but I think that in this particular case the date of account creation does not have much to do with what will happen with this account in the future.",

Will such an old account mean something special even if it manages to rank? It will look on face value as an old member who left Bitcoin for years an only returned to it after stumbling on an old wallet they could not recover or a different reason brought them back. In the end the user will care little of it ranks as they already have an account here which is a Sr. Member, it is just a prove of their long term involvement in Bitcoin.Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on September 27, 2023, 04:55:24 AMbut I don't think it's of much importance because it's obvious from the nicknames.

I am not only speaking about this case but in general, if the account owner does not link both accounts, others should not do that for them through a tag.- Jay -",

It is left negative if one of the alts already had negatives, and neutral in all other cases.It is perfectly understandable if one of the alts has negative to leave a feedback on all connected accounts. My comment was from the position of the admin that;Quote from: theymos on August 28, 2012, 09:17:31 PMI don't have a problem with alt accounts as long as they're not used for evading bans. If you're hesitant to say something controversial because you don't want it to be associated with your name, please create an alt account and say it.If the person is not doing anything wrong and want to make an argument or complaint with a different personality or for whatever other reason they should be allowed to do so.- Jay -",
