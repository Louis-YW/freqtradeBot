  "content": "I have seen Alice and Bob on several cryptographic codes, even on physics problems and they've not be a time that I've seen a different function or name used to replace Alice and Bob. Read further about them and an article said that they are cryptographic couple. Did they exist? how did they come into the cryptographic world and don't forget my question is it a constant? Thanks.",

Generally, Alice and Bob want to exchange a message or cryptographic key.Carol, Carlos or Charlie    A generic third participant.Chuck or Chad    A third participant, usually of malicious intent.Craig    A password cracker, often encountered in situations with stored passwords.Dan, Dave or David    A generic fourth participant.Erin    A generic fifth participant, but rarely used, as \"E\" is usually reserved for Eve.Eve or Yves    An eavesdropper, who is usually a passive attacker. While they can listen in on messages between Alice and Bob, they cannot modify them. In quantum cryptography, Eve may also represent the environment.[clarification needed]Faythe    A trusted advisor, courier or intermediary. Faythe is used infrequently, and is associated with faith and faithfulness. Faythe may be a repository of key service or courier of shared secrets.[citation needed]Frank    A generic sixth participant.Grace    A government representative. For example, Grace may try to force Alice or Bob to implement backdoors in their protocols. Grace may also deliberately weaken standards.Heidi    A mischievous designer for cryptographic standards, but rarely used.Ivan    An issuer, mentioned first by Ian Grigg in the context of Ricardian contracts.Judy    A judge who may be called upon to resolve a potential dispute between participants. See Judge Judy.Mallory or (less commonly) Mallet or Darth    A malicious attacker. Associated with Trudy, an intruder. Unlike the passive Eve, Mallory is an active attacker (often used in man-in-the-middle attacks), who can modify messages, substitute messages, or replay old messages. The difficulty of securing a system against a Mallory is much greater than against an Eve.Michael or Mike    Used as an alternative to the eavesdropper Eve, from microphone.Niaj    Used as an alternative to the eavesdropper Eve in several South Asian nations.Olivia    An oracle, who responds to queries from other participants. Olivia often acts as a \"black box\" with some concealed state or information, or as a random oracle.Oscar    An opponent, similar to Mallory, but not necessarily malicious.Peggy or Pat    A prover, who interacts with the verifier to show that the intended transaction has actually taken place. Peggy is often found in zero-knowledge proofs.Rupert    A repudiator who appears for interactions that desire non-repudiation.Sybil    A pseudonymous attacker, who usually uses a large number of identities. For example, Sybil may attempt to subvert a reputation system. See Sybil attack.Trent or Ted    A trusted arbitrator, who acts as a neutral third party.Trudy    An intruder.Victor or Vanna    A verifier, who requires proof from the prover.Walter    A warden, who may guard Alice and Bob.Wendy    A whistleblower, who is an insider with privileged access capable of divulging information. The source is in the quote.Note. we will have to redefine Craig's roll, you know what i mean... he should be the character who steal identities.",

Just read them now and they's another Merlin and Author Character below the characters you shared. As for Craig, his 1 million BTC ownership claims is near to the above roll, he must have timelessly tried to crack into Satoshi's wallet.",
