Just like others who posted above me, I never stored any XRP on ledger. Two of the hardware wallets that I know where you can secure and store your XRP are Ledger and SecuX. For Trezor, I'm not sure if XRP is supported.This post should be on Altcoin board I guess.",

It's a nice idea for you to consider storing your ripples on a hard ware wallet since you are holding for long term. I really do hope that XRP would worth the sacrifice in the future because there seems to be a fundamental issue with that project that has warranted SEC going after the project. I pray they scale through the process and come back stronger.",

Recent months, it seems we have seen some positive news but the lawsuit is still not finished. So we are still in uncertain situation about future of XRP. I wish you luck but why did you put most of your fund in XRP?Ethereum, Binance BNB are safer coins for you to choose if you love altcoins. A more safer coin is Bitcoin.I don't take risk like you. If I want to invest in XRP, I will wait for final result of lawsuit and even so it won't be too late for me to buy XRP.",

I think it's better to just hold it in a Safepall wallet, safepall also has a hardware wallet so you can buy it through the online store, I've been using the safepall hardware wallet for 1 year and it's proven safe, it's good that we can use the software wallet feature as well as the app using a hardware wallet , so there's nothing wrong if you store XRP in the safepall hardware wallet.",

Yes, you can read everything here:https://www.ledger.com/ripple-walletAnd as what others have suggested as well, buy Ledger to it's official site or from it's authorized dealer.Don't buy it in Reddit or any social media site as it could be tampered and you just don't know, maybe one day your wallet will be hack by this cyber criminals.",

So go for Trezor if you want to hold your XRP for a long period of time.",

You can manage Ripple (XRP) with Ledger S or X. It is not difficult, but you should inform a little. I have put together an explanation in 2019, maybe it will help you. Have a look here: NEW: Ledger Nano X - Information - Hardware Wallet. Trezor or Safepal hardware wallets are also okay. I think it's important to protect all your valuables and always keep calm and informed about everything.",

Both have good reputation in the community and they're both supporting XRP deposits.I'm using Trezor T and I can vouch for this. I've bought it last year using some of my profits during the bull run that time. The software and hardware itself constantly updates to prevent security issues. It's easy to setup once you bought it since the instructions are very simple and clear to understand. I got it at around 210$ last year since there is an official seller in our country.Nice, good buy for you. I haven't owned a Trezor any model but has Ledger's old model and still didn't able to upgrade since some of the latest versions has got some issues that I've read. If there's really a new for me to buy a new one, I might look at Trezor so that I got two of the known hardware wallets.",
