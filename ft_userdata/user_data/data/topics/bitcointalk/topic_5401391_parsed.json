  "content": "Hello there,I tried accessing TrustDice today, which is one of the first cryptocurrency casino's I've been introduced into, but it wouldn't load, claiming that \"Connection is not private\". I thought something was fishy at the moment, but quickly realized that it was actually blocked by my ISP.How should I deal with such an issue? I certainly thought of using a VPN, but I only have a free one, meaning that it could easily be used by another person on the website simultaneously, which could potentially lead to a ban. Stake and Fortunejack are also banned, after making a few guesses, Roobet still works fine.",

      "body": "^ It should be on your country's jurisdiction towards gambling casinos, those internet providers also follows government jurisdiction so if gambling is prohibited in your place, there is no way to access gambling casino, not unless you will use a VPN which is not a good decision to me.  The site that you talking about is working fine with me, I can able to access it and I think, your country did it that is why you can't access that site. VPN? No, this is very risky and it could be your fund trap on the site when your account will freeze due to the VPN you have used or read the ToS carefully.If I were you, find a gambling casino that did not restrict in your place.",

Using VPN to bypass the restriction could be called cheating, so once the site knows that is what you are doing, then they can always implement a ban on your account and worse is you'll not be able to withdraw your funds, so just carefully evaluate the risk, if you can take it, then go and enjoy using VPN.",

Now, the solution is very simple, you use VPN to change your IP and that will give you access to enjoy the gambling site. Some sites would okay that, but some will see it as a form of cheating since the word \"bypass\" is cheating for them, so I agree with the poster above, you know the risk, it's up to you if you are willing to take the risk of getting banned later.",

Also, it is rare to encounter an issue where another users will be using the same IP with free VPN. However, using free VPN will make your account more suspicious as you will have different IP every time you use it. So you should be prepared when asked for a KYC check or any possible instance where you might be caught by the website.Anyways, Casinos asking you to solve captcha doesn't necessarily mean anything other than avoiding spam and possibly use of bots.",

The ban isn't issued by the gambling platform. His internet service provider is restricting OPs access to the site. This is what I would do.Contact the support, preferably via email so you are left with written proof. Explain to them that your ISP is blocking access to their site. Ask them if players from your country are allowed to gamble on their casino. Ensure that you read their TOS as well just to be safe that there are no territorial restrictions where you live. Ask them if you are allowed to use a VPN to bypass your ISPs restriction. If they say you can, great. If not, find another casino and do the same.You can of course disregard everything I have said and just gamble with a VPN, but you could then get into the kind of trouble you mentioned yourself where you are accused of multi-accounting, etc. Save the email from support as proof they allowed you to use VPN (if that indeed happens), so you can show it to them if they limit or ban your account due to VPN usage.",
