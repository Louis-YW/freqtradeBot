This approach can be really helpful for majority of people like salaried people who get fixed monthly income and can allocate some part of it to bitcoin investment. You mean dollar cost averaging? I think majority of investors are doing that regardless of the current bitcoin value, they have allotted fixed amount for buying bitcoin and other altcoins. I know some investors doing the same way even if the value today is higher because they are used to it and it is included in their monthly expenses, They said that It will be worth it and by doing that in the long run, they already gain their profits.",

This approach can be really helpful for majority of people like salaried people who get fixed monthly income and can allocate some part of it to bitcoin investment. We call it Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) but for the investment period it depends on how someone can run it, whether the approach is done monthly or weekly. It is believed that the DCA approach can provide convenience for people who do not have large financial resources because they can adjust investments to other needs. I also allocate money for the DCA strategy but sometimes it doesn't have a duration because when I have the money I will buy responsibly.This move was successful enough that there are many people who have accumulated bitcoins even though they did not have a large amount of money for the purchase. People must have a strategy in carrying out investments because if we rely on large purchases we will definitely not be able to afford it. This is what can be done and if we are consistent then the assets we collect will increase slowly.",

I guess there are many investors like this who buy the coins irrespective of its price. Forget about monthly investments, there are many people who invest in regularly. These people know the value of Bitcoins, and they regularly try to accumulate the Bitcoins. They believe in Bitcoins and have seen Bitcoins rising from 1$ to 70k usd. I myself also buy the coins irrespective of the price. If i have some extra funds to invest, then I just buy it and hold the Bitcoins for some years.",

DCA really brings confidence, especially when going through a price decrease, when the price increase returns, it brings a much more comfortable psychology when buying all at once. I also apply this method to investments, some of the income is converted into bitcoin and with specific expectations for it, I am sure it gives good returns if the plan goes well.While I'm not sure about the take profit point, there is speculation dedicated to it and the action of just accumulating more bitcoin, long term there is not too much concern with this type of market approach strategy.",

It's a really nice system too because this way, I'm not spending all the money that I've got on other things besides necessities and it's also much better for my lifestyle, I eat more vegetables to make sure that I'm not spending so much money on food and my expenses on commute is greatly reduced and I get the exercise because I walk to work and when I'm going home. Some might see that I'm doing good but if you try to do what I'm doing, if you don't have the discipline and the will to continue building on that habit, you're going to be miserable at the first few days, weeks and months because you're not used to this kind of thing.

Well due to security purpose it could be hard for someone to come here to announce how they hold rather they don't mind giving you guidelines to how you could succeed in your bitcoin investment instead of them openly saying that do monthly investments and besides DCA cover's that because when you keeps applying this principle you would end up holding much value of bitcoin within the period of working.

Of course there are many and in my opinion the members of this forum can be said to be the most active in implementing DCA, it could be every day, every week, or once a month. The most important thing is to ensure the source of income to implement DCA. But for now I have stopped using DCA, because the price has touched ATH and the halving is in sight, so the choice is not to buy but to be prepared to sell at the target price, maybe 100K-150K.",

This approach can be really helpful for majority of people like salaried people who get fixed monthly income and can allocate some part of it to bitcoin investment. Yeah, many investors who you see with large amounts of bitcoin use this method of fixing an actual amount of money to invest in bitcoin after a monthly, weekly, or daily earnings. This method, known as dollar cost averaging, is very simple when it comes to bitcoin investment, especially for newbie investors who are yet to fully understand how the other methods go, so they use this method to acquire more bitcoins, and before you know it, you will see people with bitcoin worth thousands of dollars. But still, while using this method of investing bitcoin, don't forget to invest the amount you can afford to lose.Quote from: MainIbem on March 10, 2024, 09:36:43 AMWell due to security purpose it could be hard for someone to come here to announce how they hold rather they don't mind giving you guidelines to how you could succeed in your bitcoin investment instead of them openly saying that do monthly investments and besides DCA cover's that because when you keeps applying this principle you would end up holding much value of bitcoin within the period of working.

The OP is just asking a question to know if there are people who invest monthly from their earnings, so any one who comes here and openly says what they have already invested, if anything happens to their investment, they will be the ones to blame. However, monthly earnings should not push someone to invest huge amounts in bitcoin as it is a long-term investment, so we should still keep in mind that even when we are using the easiest method of investment, we should still invest the amount we can afford to lose to avoid the story at the end of the day.",

You are talking about the DCA strategy and I believe you are not alone because the majority of people here are using that strategy and it is arguably the safest approach for any investor. Since bitcoin is unpredictable, using DCA is the wisest solution. I also did that strategy continuously for the past 2 years but I stopped that strategy when bitcoin crossed $60k and I was changing my investment plan. I have accumulated enough bitcoins and now I will spend a small amount of capital to start accumulating potential altcoins in preparation for the upcoming bull season.",

If the question had been asked on some other forum, far from Bitcoin, the OP would probably have received very few positive answers.

This approach can be really helpful for majority of people like salaried people who get fixed monthly income and can allocate some part of it to bitcoin investment. It is called the DCA strategy. A lot of people practice this strategy because of the rise in the price of bitcoin, majority of people are not rich people that have enough money to buy a whole bitcoin or have a lot of money to buy and waiting to save up will actually cause them to miss out on the opportunity to buy bitcoin at a lower price because of it’s volatile nature so adopting the DCA strategy is best way for the less rich people to accumulate bitcoin. It is really helpful since you are not investing more than you can afford and there by reducing the risk of losing too much. This strategy is best suitable for people who intend to hold their coin for a long period of time and it wouldn’t matter how much they invest on a timely basis because before they notice they would have accumulated a significant amount of bitcoin to make them some profit.

Investing in bitcoin is a not a do or die affair and i see no reason why a person should invest his whole salary and neglect his personal needs. This is a terrible investment idea because when the market crashes they will get frustrated and may be forced to sell at loss and such situations might have some effect on the health of certain individuals. Investment should be solely based on what one can afford to lose as advised by experts.",
