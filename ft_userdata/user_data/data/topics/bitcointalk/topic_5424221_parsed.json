  "content": "I am wondering if there is a legit seller of bet365 accounts...I need about 100 of them per month...I had a method for deposit and withdrawal but unfortunately it is no longer in use...I contacted a couple of sellers from this forum and they are all scams... I can't believe that you want money in advance...why do you have everything in your hands...why don't you give an account for a test and if the buyer happy, then he buys from you. my t is velibor1133 please no stupid offers   like bangladesh account for 200 usd  or bet plus n26 500 usd !!!!!",
