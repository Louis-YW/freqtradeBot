After opening it, I had to close it back immediately and come back later because everything was too bright for me emdure. Is there a way to add dark mode to the forum? If there is, I think it will be a very good idea.",

Beware some of them might be dangerous and you should only download it if you really need this and you trust the author of the addon. I recommend open source addons if you can find them. It sounds like you will be looking for a phone based browser addon and I think only certain addons are supported on mobile devices. You could inject custom css if you can code css but there is no official dark mode for the forum you would need to get a custom solution just for the forum but you can get universal addons like I said.",

The solution is simple, in fact, and if desired, it could be easily googled. I'm interested in the next point. Can't these extensions somehow get account details like username and password?

There is no dark theme switch, but you can install custom themes or use extensions and add-ons with dark themes, BPIP would be nice option that enable many other useful stuff for bitcointalk.I don't know what web browser you use, but for Chrome or Brave browser you can do one small trick to enable dark theme for all websites, and all that without installing any script or extension.You can do this by entering this text in your browser address bar: chrome://flags/#enable-force-darkYou can Enable any option you like most, restart your browser and you can always return back to Default option.",
