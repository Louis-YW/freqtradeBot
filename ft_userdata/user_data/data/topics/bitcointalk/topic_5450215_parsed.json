Now there are many varieties, there are screens, there are ordinary ones, there are also cheap and expensive ones, how to choose and what to rely on?Hi! The question is very generic.Have you checked here (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=37.0) first? Perhaps this thread should be opened there. And I assume that you can find an answer navigating through the threads in that board.One post that could help you is this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631151.0However, 1. what do you want to do with your wallet? You want to use it for Bitcoin only, or for altcoins too? 2. do you prefer to use it mainly using mobile or computer?3. do you want to buy a device and store your keys offline? (recommended)note 1: I assume from the post that you want to buy a hardware wallet, though I am not absolutely sure.note 2: what do you mean \"there are ordinary ones\"?",

      "body": "I suggest you spend some time browsing around the Wallet Software boards. There are many threads that discuss different wallets there, including which wallet is good for beginners. The threads linked above are a good source too, just remember that some info on the OP might not be up to date, although the principle should stay the same. You can also use resources like https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet (although the list is a bit out of date afaik, CMIIW) to help you decide which wallet to choose, although it looks like you're limiting your choice to a hardware wallet only.Since you're looking for a hardware wallet, the Hardware wallets would be the best sub-boards if you want to ask more. I suggest you read and learn something first before you make a new thread though, since information on how hardware wallet works, which products are available to buy etc are easy to find.",

For your security measures, you can go for thesebitcoincorehttps://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/Hardware wallets which may cost you little amount of money in getting onehttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hardware_walletAs a beginner, i wouldn't advise you to use hot wallet.",

When I was a newbie, I was too confident with web wallets because they're easy to navigate and thought that they're one of the best. But thank you to the other members that were more knowledgeable and suggested what one should consider upon choosing a wallet. So, it should be Electrum as one of the best candidate as the wallet for Bitcoin-only holding for beginners. Well, in general of a crypto wallet then there goes the other desktop and multicurrency wallets but apart from that, the next that should count are the hardware wallets.Quote from: Sudas896 on April 26, 2023, 08:26:59 AMNow there are many varieties, there are screens, there are ordinary ones, there are also cheap and expensive ones, how to choose and what to rely on?I don't understand why there has to be the cheap and expensive ones, maybe you're reiterating the hardware wallets on this one. They're not cheap nor expensive compared to the security that it will provide to your assets.",

You are referring to a hot wallet when you said ordinary wallet? Electrum wallet is the best Bitcoin wallet that you can run on your smartphone.In the same way that you would store your ATM card, your recovery seed should be kept in a safe, preferably offline location. If you lose your recovery seed or if it somehow leaks, scammers and hackers can gain access to your coins.",

In addition to that, it's crucial to know that different wallets may have varied features and functions according to the user's individual needs, so do your homework and evaluate several options to discover the greatest fit for your needs.If the wallet you need is solely for Bitcoin I will recommend the Electrum wallet or get the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet for multiple crypto.",

If you use multiwallet as a beginner, you will get better experience about the wallet. Then from here when you gain more experience you can decide on your own which wallet to use for more security. First of all, I don't recommend you to use a hardware wallet. That's why in the first instance I can guide you to use trust wallet as a multi-wallet. Trust wallet is full of security but you must keep its password very safe.",

One is the web wallets where you keep the coins and those sites are accessed by username and password. You do not hold the private key of those wallets and hence you are taking a risk by depositing your money in centralized wallets. Though they are easily accessible but there is no control and you do not own the coins 100% in case the site closes or scams.Then there are Desktop/Mobile wallets that you may install on your laptop / Mobile and you can access them by seed phrases and private keys. Though they are a bit technical to use, they are much more secure than online web wallets.",
