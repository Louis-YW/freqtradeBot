I think that's how it works. The feeling of loss, anger, frustration and other emotions experienced by the actors in the movie who invested in crypto is very relatable to anyone who has lost money in any crypto exchange. I am eager to see this movie. In my mind, I have given the trailer a 3/10. I'll add it up with my rating of the complete movie when I see it.",

I am eager to see this movie. In my mind, I have given the trailer a 3/10. I'll add it up with my rating of the complete movie when I see it. Seems that the movie is relatively decent, just basing on the trailer. At least better than previous crypto movies. Remember the Crypto movie (2019) having actors with the likes of Kurt Russell and Luke Hemsworth. For me, this movie didn't justify what crypto is all about. But anyway, seems that the film directors haven't realized yet how they can portray crypto in a good light or the true nature of crypto. I believe film people should consult the likes of Buterin...",

Thanks for making this post !Although the film has a low budget which might make it less glamorous but the plot and message is timely and important. Besides educating viewers about the importance of embracing non-custodial wallets, it will also spread crypto awareness. I doubt the film can be viewed in any film channel currently because I couldn't find it in anyone. However, it would be great to take out time to watch this movie. And if I find it useful, recommending it to some of my friends wouldn't be a bad idea.",

It looks like it will attract many people to watch it, but it looks like it will take a long time for us to enjoy watching this movie.Haha you are quite observant to see that Ledger is in the screenplay of this movie, it is clear that Ledger will be hated a lot after their previous decision to backup his seed phrase.",

Hardware store villains The trailer isn't that bad, pretty normal for a b movie. I've seen worse than that. More or less the same genre as Don't Breathe, just worse budget, fresh actors and all that. Probably going to be disappointing, but I like thrillers and I'd watch it if there was nothing better. As for the safety of your home, most of us underestimate it until they have to really face a burglary or an invasion. Then we hope we had that lock on bedroom's door, or a video camera, but it's too late. These things usually happen only once in our lives and you either are prepared or not. Buying all that stuff after the fact won't make much difference.",
