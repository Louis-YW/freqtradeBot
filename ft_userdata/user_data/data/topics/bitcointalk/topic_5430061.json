  "content": "I'm in need of some advise as to what to do if someone no longer has the computer that had the wallet  my minner was depositing my minned bitcoins into, as well as no longer have the word phrase or the private key nor the public key, but I still have my minner! Can I get my lost bitcoins back at all? And I believe the wallet I used was the Bitcoin core wallet cause I was running a blockchain node as well as my minner on the same computer!                 I would be very grateful if anyone could help at all cause my minner minned for a year and a bit before my computer crashed and then was stolen.",

      "body": "Miner has nothing to do to retrieve your coins from your old PC.Where is this PC we talking about? It was stolen? If yes there is no way to retrieve them.If your miner still running fine why not continue to mine and earn the BTC again?Because you won't be able to get your BTC back without your PC. Next time I suggest make a paper backup or make a copy of your wallet.dat to an external HDD or USB Drive so if it's happening again you have more chance to restore your wallet.",

      "body": "Are you sure that you did not mine against a mining pool? If you mined with a pool it might be wise to check if the pool still holds some coins in your account. Otherwise you are not able to access the coins without the seed phrase. If the Computer was stolen and you know your address you could at least check if the coins were moved away from the thief even if this will also not ring them back.",
