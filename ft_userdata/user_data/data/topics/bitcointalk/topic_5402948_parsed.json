For universities, there are special economics majors that each student can choose, it will make them understand more about the problems that exist. But in the forums, we may have different educational backgrounds but some of them are smart enough and deserve to be called economists without a degree and bitcoin has taught us about that especially if we like interacting with them real experts.",

The law of demand and supply is one of what we were taught. Anyone that did not go to school and learn this basic aspect may likely still have believe in what bitcoin is if taught though, like how it has limited supply and how the price will increase as people are buying it, but all included in the basic economics. That aside, if an agric product is plenty in the market, the price of the product will be cheap, but a period will come when the product will not be in its season the it becomes scarce, leading to increase in price of the product. This is what people should know and a means to learn how bitcoin is valuable.",
