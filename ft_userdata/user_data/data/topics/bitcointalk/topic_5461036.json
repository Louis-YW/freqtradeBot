That increase, combined with the April 2024 halving set to slash daily mining rewards to $12 million, means the price of bitcoin would have to rise substantially to meet an equilibrium among buyers and sellers.\"This [bitcoin ETF launch] would bring daily demand to $125 million, while daily supply is only $25 million. The implied equilibrium price would need to rise so daily supply matches daily demand. Equilibrium analysis suggests that a clearing price is $140,000 to $180,000, before the April 2024 halvening,\" Fundstrat said.Many bitcoiners are hoping for much more than that, but I'd be content if we hit the $100k mark.",

      "body": "\"could\" etc.  Plenty of hedge words.  They always build in wiggle room because they don't know.  No one does.  Just people who have been watching for a long time know that the trend has been up and with the halving coming if previous years have been any indication, more upside seems likely.  It really just depends on whether enough people are paying attention and getting sick of inflation eating away the value of their fiat.  It amazes me that places like Argentina don't have a huge presence in bitcoin. It isn't as if bitcoin's value as an inflation hedge is hidden.",

And some major banks are also coming up with some positive predictions that are encouraging.Standard Chartered Bank ----- $120,000 by the end of 2024Berenberg-------------------------------$56,630 by April 2024.Standard Chartered’s prediction came through its top financial analyst Geoff Kendrick and it is based on next year's having. I think Bitcoin going higher than $100k next year will not be because of just one factor like the approval of BlackRock and other firms' spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other positive market forces will have to contribute to the massive price rise. Anyway, next year is less than seven months from now, and my expectation is high.",

Fsinsight predicts that Bitcoin will spike up to $200,000 and Ethereum will skyrocket to $12,000. The research company claims the bull run will start after the second half of 2022.~“This is much different from 2018 where tech stocks were still doing well. But Bitcoin sold off along with the rest of the crypto market cap,” said Farrell to Fortune. Last year, venture capitalists invested $30 billion into the market, which eventually boosted the prices significantly. He predicted a similar feat will be repeated again this year triggering off a phenomenal bull run.These analysts are really trying to prove that a broken clock is never right!",

I don't expect fireworks but it will have a positive effect on the price, it might be spread over a longer period of time though. And it's not like the price would be bumped by the ETF alone. The current demand is still there, so it's just adding a \"little bit\" extra on the top. And coupled with reduced supply from the miners after the halving - that's a strong case for a bull market.",

It isn't as if bitcoin's value as an inflation hedge is hidden.maybe it's bigger than the available evidence tells us. Breaking argentine capital controls is probably only overlooked for small fish and well-connected fish, yet with a country that has a long term/endemic regime of  capital controls, all sorts of people are looking to break those rules somehow. Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are no doubt the most accessible tools to do sobut maybe the problems doing that in argentina are very specific; the Turkish seem to be engaging in cryptocurrency trading completely openly (tourist-area foreign exchanges have huge Bitcoin and Tether logos on the street), and their hyper-inflation is not as acute as in argentina, and only began relatively recently",
