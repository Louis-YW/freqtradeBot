  "content": "Interesting question about the future. Bitcoin is humanity's money for the digital age. It's secure, decentralized, sovereign, global, open and hard money. There's nothing like it in the world and it is so hard to make something like this that after countless attempts the rest of the crypto world simply gave up on trying to be like Bitcoin and gave up on trying to be money and had to go the route of smart contracts/apps/tokens instead.But, given that the digital age is just beginning, and presumably will last for the rest of humanity, do you think there could ever be a technology, whether in 50 years or 200 years or 5000 years or whatever, that could be better and more powerful money than Bitcoin and potentially replace Bitcoin?Now I know there's gonna be people who say don't worry Bitcoin is good lol I'm not asking if Bitcoin is in trouble I'm asking how likely do you think it could ever be superceded. Gold lasted as the best money for all of humanity until we moved from metals to paper and to digital. Presumably there isn't something beyond digital technology but given that we are just at the start of the digital age what do you think? Would even a technically superior digital money be able to displace the network effects of Bitcoin? It would likely have to be far superior to Bitcoin to even have a chance, like the motto goes you have to be 10x better to beat the current competition. Would it even be possible for a later digital money technology to be THAT much better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself could certainly be better in a few ways, and of course is upgradable. But to make something better from scratch and no network would be something else.What do you all think? Is Bitcoin the final money solution for humanity or do you think there is some possibility in the near or far distance future that there will be another 'bitcoin-like' moment in history where someone will revolutionize money all over again and create something so much better than Bitcoin that it overcomes Bitcoin's network effects?",

It made it easier to debase the currency for sure, but going away from gold was in general moving from hard currency to weak but the upgrade to paper and then to digital was orders of magnitude greater efficiency for both those upgrades. Much easier to carry around paper bills than a bunch of coins.Anyway that's not the point of the thread.As you say, the future is going to last awhile haha, so yeah, the question remains.",

And because everything is dynamic, it is possible that there be another kind of technology for payment that is better than bitcoins. The next ten years is difficult to predict, so there is no certainty with any predictions. Rather than thinking far into the future, it is better you focus on the the now and the challenges facing bitcoins currently of which acceptance and adoption is its biggest challenge. We should concentrate on where bitcoin will be in the next 10, 20, 50 years, and not if it will be replaced.",

      "body": "IMO, technically speaking, there have been a lot of efforts put into the Bitcoin blockchain before it has lasted till now, and they will continue for a very long time. Innovation will steadily continue to occur, even when most of us are not living in the next 50 or 200 years, but I know Bitcoin will last for a very long time and its value will continue to increase way more than what it is right now.The world population grows every day as new babies are born, they grow up, and they develop an interest in something, which could be Bitcoin. With that said, new people will continue to dive into Bitcoin and begin to accumulate what they can afford. As this process continues, don't forget that all unmined Bitcoin will finally get mined one day, and by then, people's interest in Bitcoin will still continue to grow, and more people will continue to invest in and accumulate it.Even if the total supply of Bitcoin is being divided among the world's population, no one might even have up to 0.1 bitcoin. So, from my assumption, in the next 500 years or more, when there are more people and more interest in Bitcoin, there will not even be enough for people to buy it, and its value will increase more than it does today.From the example of using paper money to replace gold coin, does the availability of paper money devalue the price of gold? or instead gold even became more valuable and more costly than before? A short answer: Even if any other technology will supersede Bitcoin, which might be possible or not, it cannot make its value less.",

      "body": "\"A technology\"? For sure. For example, we can think about futuristic economic systems which don't need money at all because resource usage can be monitored in realtime, or which use not a single general-purpose currency but several sub-currencies, e.g. one for natural resource usage, one for knowledge-based work, and so on.If the question was \"a currency\", my opinion is that it largely depends how Bitcoin itself develops over time. If we speak about timeframes of hundreds or thousands of years, there will be probably events which would require a significant update of the protocol.Take the fears about quantum computers. It's possible that Bitcoin will have to change the public key algorithm, eventually even the hashing algorithm to get rid of some threats related to this technology. And it's possible that this requires a hard fork, although I'm not completely sure. In this case, the community will largely be responsible to decide if the update is applied or not - and if it behaves in a too conservative way, it's possible that a competitor can take over.I'm however optimistic that Bitcoin solves the \"currency\" aspect in a pretty timeless way (for decades or centuries to come), and at the same time the system is flexible enough to be able to adapt to these future challenges.",
