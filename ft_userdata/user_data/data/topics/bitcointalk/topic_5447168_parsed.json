  "content": "I woke up this morning to find this update, I thought it was a joke untill I tried to communicate but discovered some people got a temporary suspicious tag. The update of new CAPTCHA is tough and it seems almost impossible to win, but the reason behind this will yearned result by the end of 24 hrs. If shit posts are reduce it will be a great joy for Mr. @Theymos and Co, I don't know if am speaking the mind of others but for me the captcha is too much even google captcha is not as hard as this new CAPTCHA. I will love to plead to an extent that CAPTCHA CHALLENGE should be reduce because some of us here are really going to leave the forum if it doesn't stop. Both snr colleagues couldn't finish it, how about newbies? Anyway game lovers stand a big chance to win the challenge and I hope there will be a reward for those who will win and those that won it already",

I would have advised the OP to move it to Meta or create the topic on Meta, but even if he/she wants to, he can't do that since he's still on Junior Member Rank. He could probably move it to beginners and help or off-topic as an alternate since that's the only two places it can be right now.@OP,  I don't know how you and others who are solving this are really doing it, as for me it's taking me more than I can ever imagine. The worst of it all is that I have to earn about 89 points before I can be declared as someone who has passed the captcha. I must confess that today is the most confiscated day among the other days that I have spent on this forum.",

As long as you can create a thread, you can move it, even as a newbie.You either do not know how to move it or tried to move it after it had been moved here by a mod, in which case you would not be able to.The option to 'move topic' is at the bottom left of any thread you create.",
