  "content": "Before getting into blockchain’s role in online gaming, it’s important to understand what we mean by gaming. There are two uses for the word gaming.The first is regarding online video gameslike those on Roblox or Steam. Players don’t wager money on Roblox. Instead, they make in-game purchases.For our purposes, gaming refers to making bets on sporting events and playing 3D games like those you’d find at the MGM hotel in Vegas. Now let’s get to blockchain’s role.Decentralization is the keyThe three facets of a blockchain are security, scalability, and decentralization. Among the three, the most important aspect is decentralization.For sure, security and scalability play a role, and will discuss that role in regard to online gaming, but both are secondary to decentralization. So what does decentralization mean?Regarding online gaming, or sports betting and casino gaming if you prefer, decentralization is the idea that you oversee your sports wagering account and your personal information.For example, in a traditional sportsbooks, you must hand over multiple pieces of information so you can open an account.This isn’t true when you open a bitcoin based sportsbook account like what you do via Nitrobetting. A Nitrobetting account requires an email. That’s it and you can start betting.It’s truly decentralized in the sense you oversee funding your account, withdrawing from your account and, most importantly, you keep your information away from a second-party.2. Security is the second part of blockchain’s roleDecentralization dovetails into security. A truly decentralized blockchain like Bitcoin, because the bitcoin blockchain runs on proof of work consensus instead of proof of stakes consensus, has built in security.Proof of work blockchains, like Bitcoin, have inherent security because miners receive rewards for working.What does this mean? It means that it’s impossible for someone to steal your transactions. Also, because online gaming companies like Nitrobetting are truly decentralized, you mustn’t give up any more personal information than providing an email address.Read more→ https://n2g.io/92ae1d1",

      "body": "Blockchain democratizes the gaming industry. Let's just put it that way. The fact that you can imbue in-game items with the innate perceived value and rarity, so much so that people will be proud of buying and selling it just like what they do with Steam loot boxes but more organized is just something that's amazing. Gambling could see the same thing happening with it too. KYC becoming no longer a need as everything from data to gambling history is saved neatly in a blockchain that could be traced back to its user. That's just amazing. Although it's going to take more time than we were expected to think. Blockchain couldn't just be integrated willy-nilly without the approval of appropriate parties involved.",

You may engage with typical or fiat online gambling sites but it would be either taxation from your winnings or high service fees.Web 3.0 gambling industry applies the nature of decentralization to players. Thus, anyone would be allowed to play. So basically, differences are concerned with mode of payment. There would be anonymity with regards to transactions. Unfortunately, this feature allows minor to participate as well with online casino platforms. Definitely it is just a matter of a security level that players should comply. Quite of a revolutionary gambling era online. So far developments still are in preparation and polishing of what this industustry could take place.",

      "body": "The gaming sector will experience nothing short of a revolution because to blockchain technology. It's about changing how we view value in video games and empowering individuals. The attractiveness of Steam loot boxes, but with a more organised approach, is matched by the potential to attach actual worth and rarity to in-game objects, resulting in a dynamic ecosystem where users trade these items like virtual gems. Even gambling experiences could change thanks to blockchain, which neatly organises data and betting histories and eliminates the need for the conventional KYC procedure.",

      "body": "Blockchain tech can be centralized especially when Online gaming is created by a certain company and is registered under a nation's law.  We may look at the network as decentralized by these networks is governed by a central authority that can alter the blockchain network anytime they want.  They can revert transactions, freeze accounts, and even blacklists them.With blockchain technology, I believe the main focus is security, also the integration of NFTs and cryptocurrency in online gaming is made possible.  There are lots more good options that blockchain technology can offer to online gaming which can give lots of innovation to the online gaming industry.  In short, Blockchain tech is a game changer in online gaming.",
