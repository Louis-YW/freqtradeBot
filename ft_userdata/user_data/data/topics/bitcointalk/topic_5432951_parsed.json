Quote from: theyoungmillionaire on February 23, 2019, 10:52:08 AMAssuming you have your seed, you can simply recover it via File > New/Restore > Wallet with two-factor authentication > Next > I already have a seed. Assuming you did not write down/lost your seed, Electrum 2FA service provider is TrustedCoin, you can contact them here: https://api.trustedcoin.com/#/contact-us. Now I wonder how you have an access to your old Electrum if you're changed your phone? using public key is just a watch only wallet and you don't have an access with your coins.",

Well, as it is now, the plain truth is that you might have lost everything you have in the account unless you still have access to your old phone with your details intact. If not, not even electrum could help you if your seed phrase is lost. That's the downside of the non-custodial wallet, there is a limit to how they could help you, so be very careful next time.Also, don't be bothered about the 2FA on the account anymore if you have already lost the seed phrase, there is no point. However, if you have the seed phrase, you will need your backup code for the GA to gain access, nothing less.",

I need to transfer my assets from electrum, but I cannot do that due to 2FA and needing the Google Authenticator.When generating keys and addresses on both the Electrum desktop and mobile versions, it is written there that you should write down your seed phrase on paper, that it would be used for recovery. Why not backup your seed phrase?     In case of next time, it is even good to have at least two or three backups in different locations.Assuming you have your seed phrase or unencrypted backup file for the 2FA, you can still be able to recover your wallet and spend from it even without 2FA authentication, only wehat you have to do is to bypass the 2FA.",

I need to transfer my assets from electrum, but I cannot do that due to 2FA and needing the Google Authenticator.Where is your old phone now?Maybe you can still turn it back on and export everything you need, but seed words must always be kept offline on piece of paper or on metal plate.There is backup option for 2FA but I would suggest replacing Google Authenticator with much better open source alternative called Aegis Authenticator, and even KeePass can be used as temporary solution for this.",

I need to transfer my assets from electrum, but I cannot do that due to 2FA and needing the Google Authenticator.I need to remove 2fa;  Can anyone help me with this?I once had same issue with my Google account connected to my Youtube channel of over 600 subscribers which I was growing and when I changed device, I wasn't able to login due to the fact that the 2FA was already connected to my old device, of which I was able to locate it, tried logging in the new, OTP sent to the old, pasted in the new device, and finally I was able to start using my YouTube channel back again. So that's the same thing you need to do, since you did connected your Google account to your device, of which without that device you can't access it anymore. But I don't know if someone has an alternative. I wish you the best of luck",
