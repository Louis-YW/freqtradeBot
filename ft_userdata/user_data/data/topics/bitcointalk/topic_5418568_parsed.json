Finally found the real site of:chipmixorflykuxu56uxy7gf5o6ggig7xru7dnihc4fm4cxqsc63e6id.onionI clicked on \"Start Mixing\"I saved the session token and then clicked on \"I have saved my session token and want to continue\".On the next page I copied the wallet address of: \"338nMkxrz4NkzBSKSDxcUP1zRqHEBM2966\"I deposited .001 BTC into that address. Waited hours and nothing happened.I reopened TOR.  Went to: chipmixorflykuxu56uxy7gf5o6ggig7xru7dnihc4fm4cxqsc63e6id.onionI clicked, \"Restore your Session\".It was the same wallet address of: 338nMkxrz4NkzBSKSDxcUP1zRqHEBM2966I then realized that the wallet address was not starting with \"bc1...\".Tonight (a day later) I restored from the session and now it is showing a wallet address of \"bc1...\".I contacted support and they are saying its not their wallet and that there is nothing they can do (even if I got the wallet address from their site).Can anyone tell me what happened? I lost two deposits and it makes me sick to be throwing money away. I don't want to try a third time.",

I don't want to try a third time.I cannot understand what has happened. Clipboard malware usually creates addresses similar to what is copied. The ChipMixer clone site you've mentioned (and I don't want to write it again) seems to also use bc1 addresses.So it's *very* strange, I don't know where that address comes from. According to oxt.me that 33* is a 2-of-2 multisig, which also looks rather unlikely for phishing. Plus it has far too few transactions.I have no idea where that address comes from.I know that this will not be much, but all I can help are some advises if you will (ever) try again.* bookmark the ANN topic and always get the ChipMixer address from there: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1935098.0* double check very good the address you send to with the address of the mixer - before you send the tx* for absolutely every step you make, make screenshots. If you use Windows I recommend Snapper, since if configured you will only have to press Print screen key and everything else is automatic (but it's by far not the only software doing this).** make sure you make the screenshots showing the web addresses you use** make sure you make the screenshots showing the bitcoin addresses (both the mixer's and one you actually send to)** make sure you make the screenshots showing the current timeThis way you can track what is happening there if it goes wrong (and you know who is to blame).You should do this every time you use a platform you're not familiar/comfortable with, not only mixers.",
