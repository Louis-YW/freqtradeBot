I'm sure you're going to have a great time here and learn a lot, so I encourage you to take some time to browse through the existing discussions and get a feel for the community. While we love open and honest discussions, we also want to keep the conversation here meaningful and valuable for everyone. Just make sure to steer clear of those low-quality, garbage posts. We don't want any of that junk cluttering up the place. This is an example of what I'm talking about:Quote from: DiMarxist on December 28, 2022, 09:04:59 AMQuoteShould your wife or husband know your seed phrase?This is a rhetorical question. As a man that f a high caliber, reputable character in the society supposed know what to do. Charity and liberality is from the heart. So given out you seed phrase or mnemonic key is from the Liberal perspective. If you know that they can keep the key safe and the funds or coins would not be tempered any then you have to. But whereby they are not trustworthy, I will advise you to steer clear from them because at the end they will cripple you to zero wallet. Instead of giving them the seed, teach them how to invest.But hey, we've all been there! We've all accidentally posted something we regret. Just try to have fun, be respectful, and keep an open mind. Happy posting!",

Bitcoin will save you from governments stealing your savings through stealth tax (inflation). There are a lot of super smart people here. You don’t need to get involved in every conversation but a little bit of voyeurism is a great help. There is lots of very good information to feast on.If you have any questions, there are lots of people willing to help. This forum is invaluable & so much better to pick things up than something like bitcoin twitter which is a waste of time.",

Recently the forum has been flooded with threads of some selfless members that created awareness of Bitcoin in different areas. Maybe this is a student that was in one of those awarenesss classes. It seems the forum has begun to reap from the tireless efforts of these members. We might soon have more of these students joining the forum because they have developed an interest in Bitcoin.My advice to you OP is that you invest more time in learning and observing in this great forum. If you don't have any idea about a thread, do your research and read other people's comments. It is not compulsory that you must comment on threads. Your commitment to the forum would determine how much you would learn.You are welcome.",
