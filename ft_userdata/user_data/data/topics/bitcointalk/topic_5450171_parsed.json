However, Binance has recently introduced a new subscription model for new projects that requires a commitment of BNB. Despite being an old crypto user, this is a completely new concept for me. Upon conducting thorough research on all previous projects launched on Binance Launchpad, I became interested in committing to it. On April 28th, Binance Launchpad will be launching Open Campus (EDU) and I have set aside some BNB to invest in it. I am aware that it involves a certain level of risk, but it's a risk worth taking as we cannot earn without taking chances.Is anyone else planning to invest in EDU?",

Investing 20 BNB is already a high amount to me as that is the equivalent to more than 6600$.",

Isn't it better to wait for the opening of trading to at least know the real price?Yes, it is mandatory to complete the KYC process to participate in Binance Launchpad. Since I have been trading on Binance from the beginning, I had to verify my account. Participating in Binance Launchpad can be profitable in some cases, as I have researched a couple of projects that have launched on it and have gone up by 10x to 20x after the initial trading period. However, it's important to keep in mind that any initial investment in a crypto project is always risky. This will be my first experience with Binance Launchpad, and I will share if I can make profits from it.",

Isn't it better to wait for the opening of trading to at least know the real price?Well i think it depends on the exchange launching the IEO and quite a lot of other things; IEO can be profitable for the people who bought the token before it starts trading if the token pumps immediately it is launched and available on the market, but most times if that pump happens it is only temporary and the token might dump after sometime. IEO's can be profitable if one is lucky, but there is always a high risk with new tokens and altcoins in general.",

Investing 20 BNB is already a high amount to me as that is the equivalent to more than 6600$.Try to get in if you can. Binance was always doing fair launchpad unlike another exchange platform that was doing raffle for their launchpad. You will be getting allocation based on how much you have been committing to the sale. It will better to join late in the train rather than get noting caused by you were missing in the train. The hype is big caused by it will be launched on binance. The thing that i knew if binance had many whales on its exchange sites. The price can be pumped by them periodically.",

Maybe this is also one of the experiences that many people know to optimize their assets by spending only a little interest fee when borrowing. It's true that the risk I can imagine if BNB suddenly drops in price, and the crypto I collateralize also drops in price but I can guarantee that will be very unlikely. While not recommended for everyone to follow, this is also one of the interesting tips in the crypto space that I learned.And now maybe it's up to luck if I get a lot of tickets it will be great.",

In terms of profits the Binance IEO has been one of the best so far. It never failed the investors to gain from this. But the competition on this launchpad is quite high since it will depend on your bnb balance. The more you have the more youll get an allocation tokens. Basically, whales are getting a lot from this.

Surely youlk have a nice profit from it especially if you are holsing massive Bnb.I think most projects always gain on this launchpad and not a single one didnt make a multiplier. Judging from the project itself, its a related one on educ which pretty clean and neat for a platform. The partnership also are superb.As of now committed bnb are in line I guess 2hrs left, will wait for the draw results and everything will be seen afterwards.",

You earned more than 2 BNB for such a small Investment. It seem a great project actually which is more doe education and spreading adoption to the youth. I think the price will go more than your selling price in the bullrun. I have no idea launchpads still works. With news like this, felt like ICO days again.",

Will watch out for the next launchpad because there’s a good hype for a project that is being introduce by Binance, let’s see if this will continue.
