  "content": "In a bit to hurry up in the morning,to be able to meet up,there is the need to tell the holy spirit good morning,and after which you study and meditate on the word of God,and go down on your knees to acknowledge the one who made it possible for you to be counted among the living.More so,you need to understand that every day has a door,so you command the gate of the day open for you,and make some declaration for the day, because everyday is pregnant with great things made available by God,so speak into the invisible to birth them out in the physical.Sometimes when you are in communication with God your phone will be ringing,pls don't pick, it's the¬† devil that wants to distract and stop you from possessing the day.after this then you can touch your phone.A thought for the night.",

I get some breakfast & have a shower. I‚Äôm always kinda cranky in the morning, I get tired & don‚Äôt function too good. Some people love the morning but I‚Äôve always been a moody ass. I am much better at staying up very late.",
