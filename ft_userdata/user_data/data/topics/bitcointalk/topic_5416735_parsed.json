Is there's any problem? Anyways as far as I know when you already create an account here in bitcointalk.org you can not delete your account, otherwise you will ask for permission to banned your account. Or else you will do an self discipline from now on abandon your account and forgot your password.",

Banning an account does not delete it, it just restricts one from posting on it. If that's the goal, locking your account;• Either by attempting to recover it through secret question or,• Attempting to change log in details and following the lock account opion received in the mail.You can check the about privacy page for more information on what data the forum stores.",

And it says that admin can[2] delete accounts too, but i wonder if theymos really do it.Anyway, threads linked above are the most easiest way to do it e.g. changing password to random characters then just logout, simple.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=help;page=profile#owners[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=help;page=profile#admins",

However, theymos may consider if there's a good reason behind asking for the deletion of an account. If someone can convince theymos that deletion is necessary, I think theymos would do it.You have shared a link where it says account can be deleted. It's an option available on smf but bitcointalk doesn't. Maybe theymos forgot to remove the message.",

Many users have requested account deletion on this forum, and others may have been deleted for non-publicized reasons. I did some data crunching, and got 3565 missing account numbers, either because they were deleted or were never createdThere was one purge of inactive accounts a long time ago, and it used to be policy to delete the accounts of spammers. But accounts are almost never deleted nowadays.",

Try not to remember your account login detailsEven though i don't know the reason why you wanted to delete your account but staying mute with it alone is like killing the account, but i doubt if there's the function bottom for delete account, if you're not interested you can always avoid login in and that's very simple to achieve.",

He won’t be able to post, nor send neither PMs nor Merits and such, but it does not equate deleting the account.The only case where a user’s posts get deleted in cascade is when the account is nuked, which I believe can only happen to accounts that are Newbies and have less than 30 Activity points (not sure if the said Newbie can be nuked if he has received any Merits).Also note that a ban on an account theorically extends the ban to all the accounts belonging to the same person, now and in the future. On may wish to delete an account, whilst not compromising his other accounts now or later on.",

Just leave the account deserted, but with a strong and unique password you don't throw away. You never know when you'll want to come back.",

Or maybe I think this is a multi-account of a certain existing Bitcointalk user. Just my assumption but correct me if I'm wrong. Once you have created it, there is no way for it to be deleted.
