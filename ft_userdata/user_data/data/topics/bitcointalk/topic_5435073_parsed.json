There's simply no such thing as a guaranteed profit in an investment.From their self-announced audit, on the first line:QuoteNBA Apes Club is an NFT project that claims to provide 1-5% Daily Interest. There is no clear explanation on how they are able to provide this Daily return.It would appear there's nothing wrong or highly unusual with their smart contract so it is likely one of those things that works until it doesn't. I recommend staying far away from it and am leaving the campaign manager a neutral tag.",

After that, they asked me for my wallet address, which I connected to their site, and after that, they sent me a free NFT, and after I made a mint for it, the site deducted 20 cents from the BNB fees, and after I made HARVEST for this NFT for a period of several days and collected 0.50, I was able to withdraw them to my trust wallet from the USDT coin successfully, I did not lose anything because I did not invest my money in buying their NFTS. Frankly, their website seems suspicious and there is not enough information about the project team and the source of these weekly and monthly profits.

No legitimate business can pay its investors at a rate of 5 percent per day, regardless of whether it is mining, staking, trading, or anything else.They will probably also offer a nice bonus for referrals. Additionally, as usual, the early small investors will spread their greediness by sharing their referral links to innocent and greedy individuals.",

Because of your willingness to stop promoting the project I will rewrite the neutral. Its still obvious you purchased this account because you are using its advanced age to give whatever project you are promoting more credibility. Meanwhile you actually have zero credibility and very limited knowledge of cryptocurrency.",

As I've stated several times accross this forum, just because you put a disclaimer at the end of your post that you're just managing someone's project, it doesn't mean you shouldn't be held responsible to a degree if the project you managed turned south.You accepted the job, you're the one introduced the project into the community, you're the first layer of security of this forum against scammers. You should at least do a preliminary DD and see how credible the project is before introducing and managing it, and if they have red flags yet you accepted it, you should take a share in responsibility if the project is a scam.If just by writing a disclaimer then you're free of any consequences, then what's so difficult about being a BM? Why can't I --or someone else-- just made a pure BS project with fake team and all the red flags, promote it on this forum and wrote my disclaimer saying --and lying-- that I'm just a BM, not part of the team, then I'll be free from all of the consequences.A good BM always do their own DD.",

Therefore, it could be a scam Ponzi project that pays these small amounts at the beginning to lure people. Quote from: holydarkness on January 19, 2023, 06:03:33 PMI call this a fool's statement. As I've stated several times accross this forum, just because you put a disclaimer at the end of your post that you're just managing someone's project, it doesn't mean you shouldn't be held responsible to a degree if the project you managed turned south.You accepted the job, you're the one introduced the project into the community, you're the first layer of security of this forum against scammers. You should at least do a preliminary DD and see how credible the project is before introducing and managing it, and if they have red flags yet you accepted it, you should take a share in responsibility if the project is a scam.If just by writing a disclaimer then you're free of any consequences, then what's so difficult about being a BM? Why can't I --or someone else-- just made a pure BS project with fake team and all the red flags, promote it on this forum and wrote my disclaimer saying --and lying-- that I'm just a BM, not part of the team, then I'll be free from all of the consequences.A good BM always do their own DD.Your words are somewhat logical, it is clear that the BM did not know whether the project was a scam or not before he managed its bounty on this forum, because after he saw this topic against the NBA CLUB project, he immediately closed the bounty topic to prevent new participants from joining, I do not know the manager of this bounty personally, but I hope that he does not repeat this mistake again and that he does his research in order to preserve his reputation. As you mentioned, disclaiming responsibility is not alone enough to clear himself. Thank you for the clarification",

If you don't, allow me to serve you a snippet of what wiki said about this invention by Charles Ponzi,Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_schemeA Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud that lures investors and pays profits to earlier investors with funds from more recent investors.Yes, you got paid as you're one of the early investors, but sooner or later their fund reservoir will come to an end, or they thought they've got enough funds from those paying investors, so they ran with the money.If I may give a friendly advice dear, maybe you want to stop with this \"they're paying, I have proof\" charade, lest people think you're supporting them --which, if we may be honest, in a way, you are-- and you got dragged into the mud.Dude, you may not have read my post above. In any case, I do not support them and I do not know their project or the team behind this project. And yes, their project is a Ponzi project, as I mentioned earlier. There is no doubt about that, and these are the proofs of payment that I shared. It is just proof that they paid me, but it is not proof that they are honest.Quote from: albon on January 17, 2023, 05:10:56 PMFrankly, their website seems suspicious and there is not enough information about the project team and the source of these weekly and monthly profits. Therefore, it could be a scam Ponzi project that pays these small amounts at the beginning to lure people.Yes, but keep posting your payment proofs [it's plural] would gave people idea that they're --still-- paying. If I may be nosy, what's the reason behind these payment proof anyway? To show that they're still paying up to this day? And what exactly do you think would happen and what newbies would think when they saw those payment proof? Exactly?Quote from: albon on January 19, 2023, 06:33:13 PM Quote from: holydarkness on January 19, 2023, 06:03:33 PMI call this a fool's statement.

As you mentioned, disclaiming responsibility is not alone enough to clear himself. Thank you for the clarification  Your post just made it worse for the BM in question, because it gave an impression that the BM just blindly accepted the job without even looking for every single aspect he can, while the banner I quoted on my first post on this thread clearly shows a red flag.Dozens of BM out there --good and examplary BM-- took their time to consider accepting the job. I know one by name --which I won't mention here-- that reads all of their WP and check team background prior to accepting. I also know one who check their participants post, every single one of them, made a note on what to improve and even made a demographic of their post spreads on the forum boards --again, not mentioning name, but I'm still very much impressed by that work-- to ensure that the project he managed reached as much visibility as it can get. And that is how people should manage bounty.Just saying.Anyway, I'm not trying to be your enemy here. Like I said previously, it was a friendly warning; stop posting payment proof as people could be misled by those screenshots.",
