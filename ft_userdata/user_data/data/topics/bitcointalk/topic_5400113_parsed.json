When the token is adopted by institutions and companies globally e.g Ethereum.Are you sure Ethereum is adopted globally by many national scale companies today compared to bitcoin? That won't prove anything especially since Ethereum's price volatility is heavily dependent on bitcoin. I can assure you that bitcoin is still at the forefront of best adoption cases in many countries compared to Ethereum, so don't ignore this message if you want to become a holder.Bitcoin has been shown to provide a commensurate return to its holders over the long term compared to altcoin. I honestly don't necessarily overlook potential altcoin like Ethereum, but for real world use cases, bitcoin is still the best. You can believe that the price of Ethereum will be high if the price of bitcoin is high and vice versa, but in one or two cases the two are very different.",

Without being chastised by another, you should try to develop that consciousness that it is bad and wrong to lift someone's intellectual property without paying credence to the original creator. Op, if you wish to last in this forum, avoid plagiarism (copying someone's work without reference). It is a crime both outside and inside the forum. Thanks",

You may think that if you spent more time trading, your results would be better, but this is easy to verify. Give yourself some time, take a few days and just try trading. Most people will find that this will not make much of a difference to their trading results. Time devoted to any business is a very important point, but in addition to free time, knowledge and practice are needed.",

Trades are judged better in this case if the holder has no other source of income, but it may be better if they hold as well as trade.So far my choice hold, hopefully it will be useful in the future. I'm not trying to be actively trading and would really like to be a long term holder. There's definitely a target I want to hit although I don't completely ignore trading.",

It is logical that a person will not invest the last money for a long-term holding if he does not have any means of subsistence. To do this, first need to accumulate a certain amount, or set aside some amount every month. This is already a kind of investment with the expectation that in the future your investment will bring you a good profit.",

Point number 2 is a risky play as well cause the risk you derisk when you bought the top could also be a bad decision if it turns out failed. But if you trust the project then there is a chance that it could overtake the losses you lose by buying the dip you thought it was.Cutting loss is the last resort I have if I entered on a very mid to high entry price.

You are right, I am going to answer the Title question only.I had no plan to Hodl any crypto or Bitcoin. I wasn't aware much about the fundamental of Bitcoin. Many local YouTubers make videos about how you can profit by doing spot trading. So I bought some BTC and some altcoins too at the peak rate. BTC was $59K when I bought it. So, I waited for profit, and it kept falling. It was just hit ATH a few days ago, so I thought $59K was a Dip. The situation is like, I bought the dip, and it keeps dipping. LOL. Now, I am a holder because that's all I can do to recover from my loss.",
