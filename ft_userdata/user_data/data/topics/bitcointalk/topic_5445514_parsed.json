If I have no option but to choose one that I'm going \"trust\" then I would still pick bitcoin. I mean it's still going through many developments despite all the criticisms and regulatory pressure. It's been over a decade since the genesis block and still.QuoteLets say a project like Kaspa and Truebit.......Who? Or should I say what are they?",

I feel confident in myself when I join after a long time of research, and I use the word \"grateful\" because this market has created an environment for me to see many cognitive issues in my life. And after all, agree with me about the all-encompassing ETH.",

I also have atom, fantom holdings. These are L1 too with different features. I am also trying to invest on new projects but definitely will look on new ones like arbitrum, zksync, starkware, and layerzero.",
