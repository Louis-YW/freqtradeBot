  "content": "The thermal pads of RTX 3080, RTX 3080 Ti, RTX 3090 and RTX 3090 Ti graphic cards needs to be changed for memory mining like ethash algorithm. There are many youtube videos how to change them. We can measure the thickness but the best way to learn the thermal pads sizes and thickness is to ask for vendor.Personally, I contacted with EVGA, Palit and Asus. Please share under this topic your requests if you contact with the vendor and got a reply for your request.*******************************************************************************EVGA warranty period is not affecting by changing thermal paste and thermal pads.Dont damage SN sticker if you care about the warranty.NVIDIA GEFORCE EVGA FTW3 ULTRA GAMING RTX 3090 24GBhttps://i.imgur.com/YCLIeyK.pngNVIDIA GEFORCE EVGA FTW3 ULTRA GAMING RTX 3080 Ti 12GBhttps://i.imgur.com/YCLIeyK.pngNVIDIA GEFORCE EVGA XC3 ULTRA GAMING RTX 3080 Ti 12GBhttps://i.imgur.com/bdh2h5H.pngNVIDIA GEFORCE EVGA FTW3 ULTRA GAMING RTX 3080 10GBhttps://i.imgur.com/XOOltLZ.png*******************************************************************************Palit warranty period is no longer valid if you change fans, thermal pads or thermal paste.Be careful about two stickers on two screws if you care about the warranty.

Of course we can measure and find the information what we need.But Asus company doesnt act fairly for their customers. I will not buy any Asus product anymore because they hide the necessary information from their customers.*******************************************************************************Please only share the informations from the graphic cards manufacturers.",
