It doesn`t matter what OS.I could also buy your copy of pancake sniper plus if you don't use it anymore. I can pay half of the market price. Please PM if you wanna sell.",

I choosed uniswap as I focus on sandwich trading and I found comments that sandwich trading works better on uniswap bot then on pancake bot. I'm satisfied with the bot and customer support. With sandwich trading it works like a charm.",
