It's bit extreme \"kill your self\" just because you're waiting a KYC verification.I can see just a bookmaker that is waiting some checks on their side and referred to wait a couple of days.

The common problem of KYC casinos seems the same on this, it's always a problem with the KYC procedure.Have you made sure that you've read already the Terms and Conditions?  Sometimes we didn't know that we violet the terms, there's a reason behind blocking the account but why they didn't inform you for that reason?

But I'm sure there must be a misunderstanding somewhere, of which creating this thread was actually a good idea, I'm sure sooner Roobet representatives will get to see this, investigate and ensure your fund is been paid if only you never went against the rules.. so in the meantime, you can PM Sir Hhampuz. Because I'm sure he could help facilitate on your behalf. I wish you all the best my friend...",

Yes.  You did get a reply, they told you to wait 2-3 days.  So wait 2-3 days.  Maybe even 4.  Then send follow up email.  Don't tell them you will kill yourself.  Wait 2-3 more days.  Then you can start thinking about opening scam accusation thread.",

Although this would also have its drawbacks, as I believe that at the beginning at least there would be a drop in business.
