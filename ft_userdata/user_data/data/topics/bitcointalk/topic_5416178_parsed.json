But there are still some things the team needs to work on to make the site look even better. Among them are scroll bars and links such as ToS, About, and Contact.Or will we see it when registered and in the dashboard? If so, it won't look good because a user will want to know the rules and other links before they sign up.",

Soon we will also launch options to sign up with social logins like Google, Facebook and more! All part of our choc-a-bloc roadmap for awesome integrations, features, promos and games that will all be first announced here and in our other community channels like Discord and Telegram  Since we're not a crypto exchange, unfortunately we can't swap cryptos on site, but you can soon Sell crypto into fiat. So if you come in with fiat funds, you can buy crypto on Metaspins via our PSPs in the Buy Crypto section of the cashier, then once you win and want to withdraw you can either withdraw your crypto winnings or sell them into fiat and onto the card of your choice!Quote from: stomachgrowls on October 06, 2022, 07:46:30 PMQuote from: Fivestar4everMVP on October 06, 2022, 06:36:40 PMFirst, I want to say..
