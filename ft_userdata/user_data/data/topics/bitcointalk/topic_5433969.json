  "content": "I've noticed maybe 5% of the time, walletnotify setting within bitcoin.conf will fire off duplicate messages, or at least dupes that my software can't pick up.Ieven went as far that when a notification comes in, system immediately checks redis for a dupe.  If txid is not in redis, adds it, and processes the deposit.That doesn't even work though, as sometimes dupes will make it into the system.  Apparently the notifications are so quick in succession, a quik connection to and check in redis takes too long.How can I resolve this?",

      "body": "You can also try the following:QuoteYou can use local database instead of Redis to store the transaction ID since local database is faster in terms of read/write speed, which can help to filter duplicates.You can also use a lock to prevent multiple checks of redis at the same time which helps prevent race condition where multiple notifications are processed at the same time leading to duplicates.Increase the minimum transaction fee required for a transaction to be considered valid. This can help prevent spam transactions, which may be causing the duplicate notifications.You can also include sleep command to adjust the walletnotify for a few milliseconds before each Redis check.  This will give more time for the transaction ID to be added before the next check.You can als use a different type of notification system that is less prone to duplicates, such as the -walletnotify command, which allows you to specify a command to be executed when a new transaction is detected.You can also look into the transaction confirmation time, if the confirmation time is low then it increases the chances of duplicate transaction. So you can increase the confirmation time for the transaction to make sure you are notified after the transaction is confirmed.That is the collective suggestion I found searching the internet, you can try it and I hope it helps even a little. Though it is said that the best solution depends on the requirement of the application and the available resources you have.",

And time when node receive the transaction or timestamp on block isn't very reliable.Indeed happen to verify it, my bad for getting some bad sources though I am glad we have you guys to fix things for us  Quotewalletnotify is a feature of the Bitcoin Core software that sends a notification to a specified script or program when a new transaction is detected on the network. It sends notifications when a transaction is first seen on the mempool and then again when it is included in a block. So, it is not possible to increase the confirmation time for walletnotify as it is just a notification mechanism and doesn't have any control over the confirmation time of the transactions.With regard to duplicate, is it a possible solution to use a message queue to buffer incoming notifications and filter duplicates?",
