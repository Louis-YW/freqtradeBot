  "content": "I have been and bearing the burden of unemployment for a long time. Although I tried hard for a job, I could not get a good job. This life of unemployment was so unbearable to me that words cannot express it. One day I met one of my friends suddenly. My friend saw my helpless condition and told me about this bitcoin forum. The whole way he was saying it was unbelievable to me. Later, with the help of my friend, I continued to devote time to this Bitcoin forum. With the help of the members of this forum I achieved full member status. Then I joined a campaign from where I got $40 bitcoins in a week. Unfortunately, the campaign stopped for a week. Then I was transferring to sell bitcoins because of low transfer fee my bitcoins were stuck for about 12 to 14 days. Back then I thought earning from Bitcoin was incredible. But yesterday all my thoughts changed as Bitcoin was successfully deposited in my wallet. I have successfully sold bitcoins in my native currency. Earnings from bitcoin forums today I have no more negative ideas about bitcoin forums.",

Earnings from bitcoin forums today I have no more negative ideas about bitcoin forums.Congratulations on your first earning.But I still don’t see any reason why someone would be angry or hold any negative thoughts about a forum that has nothing to do with why your transaction got stuck, you already mentioned the reason why your transaction got stuck (low transaction fee as you mentioned) and I’m guessing it happened during the time bitcoin network was congested so there’s actually no need to include the part about how you felt about the forum during your waiting period.So I’d advice you edit that part out because I feel you’ll definitely get bashed for that.",

It's nice the forum helped you earn something tangible; it might appear to be small to others, but it's also a large amount to some. This is a reward for consistency, and if you continue to be contributing and active on the forum, you will be able to earn from more campaigns, and your rank will also increase as you grow, which will also be an increase in payment. I know how this payment feels, as I was very excited when I first earned on this forum for my first signature campaign, which was from my member rank. I don't see much of a member rank campaign these days. I was so excited that I even created a thread for it. I gained a lot of advice from reputable members, and one of the advice was that I should not relent; I should just keep on pushing and I will get to where I am looking soon. And very soon, the earning I celebrated will be something little to me as I will be earning more as I grow. I wish to see you celebrate more things in the future.",

People were been by duped by people who presented shitcoins as Bitcoin and centralization as decentralization. But this forum changed my perspective through education and also provided a platform to own Bitcoin. Hence this forum is like a school and an alternative source of income. Congratulations on your first earning, just be a quality poster and you will achieve more. I also support the position of Cantsay. Your transaction getting stuck in the mempool is nothing strange. There are many topics on mempool congestion in the forum that would have enlightened you about the cause and what you would have done.",

Hopefully the achievements you have achieved so far can be a strong encouragement for you, so that you can continue to contribute well to this forum.Apart from that, I hope that the first income you get from your signature campaign on this forum can be a blessing in your life. Because I, as a member who entered this forum earlier than you, and have earned income from this forum, also felt how difficult it was when I first entered this forum, and also felt how happy I was when I got my first salary. It feels like the difficulties I experienced have passed, so I don't feel them anymore. Because in essence all the contributions I have made to this forum have borne fruit. So as fellow members of this BTT forum, we must be grateful. Because in this forum, besides being able to increase insight and knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies (in particular). But you can also generate income every week.So never waste this excellent opportunity. Because where else can we find a forum as good as this. Because it can be said that this forum is a very good forum.And the most important and interesting thing about your story is that you can have more trust and confidence in bitcoin forum.",

Random posts without any relation to the actual topic or the previous conversation.Making good posts will only help you in the long run. You can earn merit, climb up the ranks and with this get a better salary in the campaigns.Keep up the good work and the bitcoin keeps flowing.",

This is only a temporary inconvenience and once the Hash rates decrease, such inconvenience no longer exists.Anyway congratulations you have earned your first income through this bitcoin forum.

It is very true that the Op does not understand very well how bitcoin works and the difference between bitcoin network and the bitcointalk forum. In his brain, he is just contradicting everything. This can be seen how he blamed the bitcointalk forum for delayed transaction. I have to congratulate him because he has started earning from the forum, but it will be very good if he will start to learn about bitcoin. This will help him in the long run. He just concentrated on learning about the forum and how to rank up.  Now you have gotten the full member rank, please, endeavour to learn about the bitcoin which is the main purpose we are here.",

I also recommend you learn more about Bitcoin so you don't mix up with Bitcoin forum with your Bitcoin transaction. I don't know what wallet you have used to receive your Bitcoin and send it to our exchange. I suggest using one of the best Bitcoin wallets which is Electrum. It is available for mobile and desktop. If you make a transaction from your Electrum wallet, you can always bump the transaction fee so you don't get stuck for a week or so. Congratulations that you cashed your first Bitcoin earnings.

This is the reward for your hard work and consistency that you do in this forum. I know it's very difficult to start from a Newbie rank earn merits and achieve full member rank. Earning merits is difficult because it needs a quality post and cooperation with other members. Remember that full member ranks are not the final stage you just enter and stand on the first step. Bitcointalk is so wide and you need to do more work to achieve Sr rank and hero and legendary ranks which will support you more economically. Also, you need a good wallet for your funds and that is no doubt Electrum wallet which is more secure and reliable. Also, do more study about Bitcoin I am sure it will open more ways for you.",

It's really important to ask people here regarding crypto-related issues rather than getting angry easily because that's not the best thing to do because it won't change anything at all. I just realized the problem was with my transaction fee because it was too low back then, that's why after that, I never had the same problem again.",

I hope you don't give up in finding a good paying job while you continue with your activities here in the forum, because it is certainly possible to do both. Personally, that is what I am doing and I can confidently say that I am doing much better now compared to when I only have one.",

You have spent time behind this forum for a long time and stepped forward with faith that you are now able to choose a good way of earning. Also, since your friend told you about this forum, you probably have a good idea by now. Also you said you may have had to wait a long time to get to the point where you transferred bitcoins with a low fee to an exchange. Because if you sent your bitcoins with less free, when the bitcoin fee increases it takes a long time to reach the point where your transaction will not be successful until it reaches that point. But you've waited so long that you probably got impatient, which you shouldn't have done at all, because you might have thought something negative about Bitcoin. I want to tell you that since you have been associated with bitcoin forum for so long you must have acquired some knowledge about this but you may not be experienced about it. Since the bitcoins are in your wallet, there is no need for you to rummage, of course, when you make your transactions, your funds will be completed. However, you should be aware of this so that you don't lose patience later, and enjoy it for your first payment.",
