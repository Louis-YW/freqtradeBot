      "body": "Yes I agree don’t live your life saying \"I can’t\". You should live your life saying, \"I can\". That “I can” is being positive, that it can lead one to infinite possibilities in life. Having a positive attitude is healthy mentally and physically. Whether you are in a sour situation, remaining hopeful, and having self-confidence will make things better. I also think that having an inner circle that can help you reach a goal is essential. Taking optimistic perception can lead you through a dark tunnel where you can see at the end there is a bright light. With that mindset above you can only show the “I can” approach to a better life.",

      "body": ";)I agree with your perspective. \"I can't\" is a limiting belief that can prevent people from achieving their full potential. It can hold them back from trying new things, taking risks, and pursuing their goals. By embracing a growth mindset and focusing on what they can do instead of what they can't, people can overcome their limitations and achieve great things. Developing a positive attitude and taking action towards one's goals can help build self-confidence and lead to success in all areas of life.",
