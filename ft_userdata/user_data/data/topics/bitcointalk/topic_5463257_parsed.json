Because all I can see on your chart was Bitcoin price is on a long dumping price trend before that 85% occur while the currency price is sitting on after the few correction of the 85% pump trend.",

I saw this on Twitter few weeks ago:I think if we should guess what the price of bitcoin would be, this can be used to conclude by some people that bitcoin may still rise to $37500 or more before falling again. But I do not know why I am not thinking that bitcoin might not go up to that price before halving.All I am waiting for now is halving and followed by all-time-high prices.",

I am expecting 41k before anything else.85% from here will be $55k. That will be amazing.Let's see how this one goes.  First - for a better view I have to disable your image. Sorry about that.Second - I don't expect that to be a misleading signal. I mean - the 85% increase seems reasonable after we've been in a sideways phase for a while. I hope the price will recover so that the uptrend can be enjoyed instead of just at altcoins, but bitcoin too. I haven't concluded anything yet - but yes, I hope it will come soon.",

      "body": "There's a lot of talk about this signal right now. There are several threads about it on the forum, there is also a lot of discussion on Twitter. If manipulators really exist in the cryptocurrency market, then now is just a good opportunity to do everything against expectations. Maybe this signal worked really well in the past, but it seems to me that before the new growth there should be a fall.",

      "body": "Also created a topic about this half an hour before you, but guess you didn't see it  See: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463250.0Overall I'm a bit sceptical about this buy signal. It reminds me of July 2020 with multiple short-term miner capitulations and recoveries followed by eventual buy signal with the price increase, rather than a considerable capitulation of miners. So while I think it's bullish in the near term, I think it could take a few months to play out like it did in 2020, and meanwhile price may correct further or others stay sideways.It's definitely a positive sign though, or at least has been confirming a bottom 12 out of 14 times previously. The other two times \"only\" saw a 50% increase soon after before making new lows.",
