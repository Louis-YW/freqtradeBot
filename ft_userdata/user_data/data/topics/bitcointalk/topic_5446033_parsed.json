Rip off complete trash sportsbet.io scam.It's hard to believe your story while rdbase already pointed out which energy you are using to circumvent site rules.If you do this now there is a high probability you did it in the past, and that's where the problem is.Maybe because of some coincident the account with the money that is blocked really is \"your\" account, who knows. They never said it's not yours, they just linked you to many other accounts, as they could do with the ones you tried to buy here.Also, there is 1 guy commenting they you scammed him ( which you didn't even deny ) , so you have bought accounts for this or some other site before.",

Why no block when i made deposit ? Why they let me gamble if its was multiple accounts flagged, there is no logic. Its just scam and thats it .We have previously asked if you have any other accounts created with Sportsbet.io, to which you have replied that you do not. Coming from our second level investigation there were multiple accounts flagged that you are connected to.With that in mind, we would ask what is your connection to the following usernames: Marcin667,Huragan88,tombry16,Pawel1344,Rogowicz346We hope for your honest response regarding this situation for us to proceed.Thank you once again for your time and understanding.Best Regards,Player Safety and Assurance TeamYeah yeah imagination players connected to me ,  when its time to pay they lock and send after verifications such nonsense .They should lock on deposit if i was flagged by these players. But no they let me play right ? For what reason? Where is logic?So its means it wasnt flagged to any account - and when its profit are made on withdrawal request, UPS LOCK sorry - multi accounting, yeah yeah.Good luck with that.Yes i agreed with the terms by registerting there but its scammy terms any time when they will decide they will say oh sorry it was flagged you aint getting money back.

When using a sportsbook or any online platform, it is important to follow the terms of use set forth by the provider. Using multiple accounts to gain an unfair advantage, is often explicitly prohibited by these terms of use.When you're caught multi-accounting, it is understandable that you may feel upset or regretful. However, crying or showing other forms of emotional distress does not change the fact that you violated the terms of use and engaged in unethical behavior. Moreover, the clear evidence against you in your post history makes it even harder for you to argue against the accusations.",
