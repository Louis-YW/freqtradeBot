Everything is in the dip right now so buying is a really good choice in my opinion. I just wanna remind you that trading in stock means you have a lot of patient to wait for the right time to sell for you to maximize your profits in the long run.",

Gmt,Near,Ape,Ust and the most important Luna. The market is down and all these coins mentioned below are in a serious dip, they will still pumped back but it's just a matter of time. For me, the two top alt coins I'm going to bagged are GMT which was $4, has dump to 0.9 cents. This is the time to bagged more coins and hold your position. Luna is the worst of it all, for a coin that have surpassed $100 have dumped seriously to 0.02 cents and it's still dipping. These investments might been considered as long investments because these coins mentioned will not just get up and pump, rather it will take time before it go back to it's ATH value.",

It is one of the best and trusted coins in the cryptocurrency world and there is no doubt about its future. If you look at the chart of BNB it has touched 650+$ in 2021 and the current price is below 280$. After the bearish market, it will replace its price. If you are going to really invest just invest in it. You don't have to worry about the profit .",

It is possible that you will lose this money completely, but if the UST problem is solved, then there is a high probability that you can get a profit of thousands of percent.That is not really a bad advice, investing a very low amount of money on this coin that has been crashing could be an opportunity and I have been thinking the same myself, now in the case nothing gets resolved then you only lose a minimal amount of money that you could afford to lose, but if things get resolved then the profits can be decent even with such a small investment, however this is an advanced move which I would not recommend to newbies as it is likely they will invest way more money than what they should.",

Investing in BNB is also a valuable project. Binance is partnering with twitter and that is going to solidify bnb more in the cryptocurrency business. Ripple though is not my best investment coin but for whatever reason it has stayed up there despite the challenge.",

Yeah, fees could be high sometimes but I think that despite of all the market situations, ETH is remaining to be a strong candidate on top of all altcoins. That's what I think and I wouldn't buy Luna and UST as they're attractive to buy because they could go nearly zero and could plummet for more. Just for the sake of my own money to be in a safe altcoin, that's what I'm going to choose and maybe if there's another one, it could be BNB.",

Like if you trust bitcoin, and you think that it will recover for sure, then it is the best one.I believe it is bitcoin but some believe it is also eth, and bnb, and some others. Look at the drops, the coins that do not have truly strong support will go down a lot more, like how bitcoin dropped a lot less than SOL for example, which means that people trust bitcoin more than they trust sol which is normal of course. So, whenever you invest, invest into a coin that is better than all others and trusted to go back up, just like bitcoin.",

I've read this argument when somebody has said that those people that have been telling about investing at the top altcoins, should think specifically. I'm hit by that argument because I'm also suggesting the top altcoins. But with confidence, if the market is like this, nothing beats buying bitcoin. Then next is ETH.",

But all of them did not have the feature of being fully decentralized the same as BTC which is I put a large amount of investing that the altcoins. Prior to my investment is BTC and the amount that I can afford is on altcoins because you will never know what will happen to them since they are not fully decentralized.",
