There are no clear tokenomics or game theory behind it that i can find. Since you guys partnered with them i thought that they might have shared a reason for you to do so.Quote from: CROBABY on November 04, 2022, 07:19:50 PM1% Donation Fund will be exclusively used on the 3rd Party Charities (from Hospitals to NGO´s and other organizations like Doctors without Borders, Rainforest Action Network, Australian Koala Foundation, and others) as listed on our Website: www.cro.babyWhat i mean by transparent data is that are you going to be providing proof of payment? As anyone can say that they gave money to charity but without proof no one knows if they just pocketed it for themselves.",

But i don't think anyone lost that much money that they are willing to take this to court. Officials could be interested about this though and there are tons of free government funded reporting systems for whitle blowers about unregulated icos, online scams and such.Although i am not sure it they want to waste their time as hunting pseudonymous scammers that takes a ton of time and resources. Often they get help firms that trace blockchain transactions as a service and if they won't give their services for free, it can cost way more then stolen amount, and everyone's salary who is involved in the search. So finding them might not be anyone's priority.",
