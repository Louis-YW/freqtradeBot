  "content": "Hi guys,I am trying to reflash my S17+ back to the factory software. I tried following the guide here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5269100.0 but this is for an S9 where they are reporting they are getting multiple files after unzipping the firmware from the Bitmain website. When I try to follow their procedure I am only getting one TAR GZ file when I download the firmware from Bitman (Link: https://shop.bitmain.com/support/download).Do I just need to copy this single file to a SD card (after formatting to FAT 32) and then put it in my miner? This doesn't seem right considering most of the tutorials I have seen online show zip files that need extracted that have multiple files inside.Does anyone have experience doing this and can give me some advice? Lastly, the reason I want to reflash my firmware to factory is because I currently can't connect my miner to the internet and I can get its IP address when I press the reporter button. The LED is solid red on the back indicating a fault so this is all I can think to do.Thanks in advance.",
