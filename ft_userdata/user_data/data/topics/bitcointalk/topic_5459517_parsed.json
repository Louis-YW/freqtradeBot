Day trading is a trading style for professional traders and it is better to avoid it if you do not have a good background in day trading, as it is not that trading that brings you a lot of profits, but achieving a profit of 1% daily means a percentage more than 30% per month, which is better than being collected by long-term trading. Therefore, day trading is not for achieving high profits in the short term, but rather for continuity.I can give you links on how to learn day trading, but I do not find it logical. You cannot learn to run before walking. Start and master the basic skills represented in identifying support and resistance points and reading technical indicators. After you master walking, you can ask about running.",

Are there any decent cheat sheets or videos you guys have for chart patterns?If you are new to trading, you should start with spot trading or swing trading if you wish to use leverage. You cannot be a day trader for the first time because it is difficult and not recommended for newbies. Many beginners lose money when they day trade, which is why I advise you to avoid this type of trading. I understand that you want to be profitable as soon as possible, but forcing ourselves to trade will only serve as an obstacle to our life goals. You must be patient and stick to your trading plan no matter what. And if you notice that you're profitable, that's when you should start day trading.",

I don't believe in videos because I never understood it as a newbie. So I don't know how you can understand videos that easy. You have to put more effort in learning whatever is difficult to you. Even when you watch videos it doesn't end there. You need personal effort to make your trading experience profiting for you. Use indicators like RSI and MA and you have to know that as a day trader, your focus is on what happens in the market for the day,  your focus should be the prospect of the market reaction for just that day and not spilling over your trade because tomorrow is a different and new trading day. You have to close your trade for the day and don't allow it to swap over to the next day.",

Are there any decent cheat sheets or videos you guys have for chart patterns?Indicators and Chart patterns are good enough to be used while trading because these are for the safety measures in the trading market as we all know market behaves similarly in similar historical circumstances and traders always repeat their actions according to market emotions. As you said you are not much experienced in the market I would advise you to never follow the pattern blindly and closely follow the market developments because as you according to the current market situation market is more dependent on the developments rather than the trader's emotion because maximum of the trade is the accumulation process o the long term holders in the market at I can say it, for now, it is a fact.",

Then see the momentum that US Dollar Index gains/loses and then decide for your trade because it's an indicator of where BTC will head towards. Nowadays, I'm observing that the institutions are definitely considering these things in order to accumulate and distribute at times when they believe what's correct for the market to head towards.",
