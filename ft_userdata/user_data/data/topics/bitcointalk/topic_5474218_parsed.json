You can use any of addresses listed in \"addresses\" tab to receive bitcoin.I guess the problem is that the base unit has been set to mBTC and with entering 0.00052172, you make a request to receive 0.00052 mBTC which is equal to 0.00000052 BTC. Note that any bitcoin address can receive any amount bigger the dust limit. The dust limit for legacy addresses (those that start with 1) is 546 satoshi and for native segwit addresses (those that start with bc1q) is 294 satoshi. Again, you don't need to make any request to receive bitcoin.",

When I enter the amount, it tells me that it is too small.Simple question - where are your bitcoins at this very moment? Still in your ViaBTC account, or did you already transfer them over to your Electrum wallet? Im guessing you are trying to withdraw your coins from ViaBTC into Electrum, right? If so, just know that Electrum has nothing to do with setting restrictions on withdrawals from ViaBTC.  The only way Electrum can get in your way is if you try sending an amount from Electrum thats less than the recommended transaction fee, which is not the case here.  But other than that your Electrum wallet wont interfere with a ViaBTC withdrawal at all.",

To make it to the minimum withdrawal limit of ViaBTC pool which is 0.001BTC, you need 0.00047828BTC. But you have to deposit more than that because you will also be paying the fees. So, if I were you, I'd rather keep it there for a while. The fees aren't cheap these days. Even low priority transactions will have to pay 117 sat/vB. And for you to be able to withdraw your Sats, you need a couple of transactions at least. You only have $20 worth of Sats. After all the fees, how much would you be getting? If you're planning to convert it into cash, you might end up with less than $10.",

If ViaBtc isn't preventing you from withdrawing, then where is the issue actually? Just simply copy the address from the Electrum and send it. Because the amount doesn't seem like dust and it should be approved. When are you going to withdraw something from a centralised platform? They would have withdrawal fees and withdrawal limits as well. To get a solution, please provide more details. Otherwise, we may just speculate instead of giving you a better solution.",
