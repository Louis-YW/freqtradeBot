  "content": "Do Kwon Owner of the Terra Luna platform are going through  various adverse environments and obstacles.  After receiving cases from South Korea, USA, Interpol, etc., this case is being started by Singapore.  350 investors in Singapore sued for 57 million in compensation.  In May 2022, Singapore filed such a large compensation case based on Luna Crush.TerraFounder has suffered such huge losses mainly because of the Terra UST stable coin.  Terra UST in particular is a stable coin due to a design flaw that drives the price up and down in the market.  Therefore, this error in the market has caused losses of millions of dollars to investors since last May.  Therefore, in September, South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant against Terra Founder.  This time, Singaporean investors filed a lawsuit seeking $57 million in damages.",

No one's gonna save him and even if he surrenders, he'll be continued to be sued. So, it's only likely that the charge will be lessened if he volunteers to surrender but these cases are still heavy for him together with his team. He's nowhere to be found and he's still uncaught while hoping for most of his victims, they want him to be in jail.",

Is there going to be real documentary for this one. Idk, but that would be interesting to see if they have studied to the inside level and give us the insights on how this happened and what was going on the minds of owners or management?Till date it’s unclear why this happened and how such huge market cap was swiped off the blockchain in one go. The problem is, due to nature of currency (stable) it was noticeable and was put forth in front of justice eyes. Imagine, this happening with bitcoin and there is literally no owner in existence to blame on. That would be terrifying for mankind.",

Many big people have also lost huge amounts of money due to Luna. DK is not going to get out of this situation easily when the big men are involved. The entire market was affected by the Luna crash. A lot of people have lost their money due to the mistakes of the Do kwon team and are clamoring to get it back. But I think there will be no solution by filing a case against Do kwon because he will never be able to return such a huge fund.",

For sure it's all about the negative side and if i'm of those who lose the money i wont expose such stories. Anyway this can be more interesting if they will add other scam incidents, there's a lot to tell. DK already knew this will happen because it involves a lot of money. With this, he cannot defend anymore so better to admit it and compensate the losses. Imagine being wanted from many countries, that's stressful.",

There should be other parties involved he is not the one running the TerraForm Labs soon we will have the names of his co accusers, the only positive side I saw on this disaster is investors will think deeper and will do a lot of research if there are flaws on the project they are investing, I have not invested on this Luna I just don't like the arrogance of Do Kwon, he think s that he is way better and his project is just too good to fail, he even treats those who questioned his projects as haters and poor people.",

If DK will not defend his side, most probably the verdict will be guilty.I think even if he defend his side his still guilty over what happened to Luna and that will never change. If he's not, why is he still in hiding? I doubt if he surrender himself to the authorities unless it really threaten him fully that he'll goes out of hiding. The question now is, will those who got into this mess of DK be compensated?",
