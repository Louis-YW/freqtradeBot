In the international theater, we still have the unresolved Ukraine-Russia war and there are those sounding the alarm for the possibility of the China-Taiwan turmoil as well as escalated North-South Korea protracted relations.Now, in the face of a global chaos, do you think holding on to Bitcoin is a good idea to protect our assets? Will it be acting like gold which can be so valuable during war?",

Will it be acting like gold which can be so valuable during war? https://i.imgur.com/A5M3nZb.jpgAbsolutely! When a country declares war, it messes with their economy big time. Money's value tends to plummet because of high inflation brought on by the war. But hey, if you've got some Bitcoin stashed away in your wallet, it won't be as affected since its price isn't solely tied to one nation's situation. Unless, of course, there's a full-blown world war involving major countries; in that case, everything's probably in trouble. But at least your Bitcoin remains safe and sound, as long as you've got that key handy.We've been through plenty of crises before, and you know what? Bitcoin's still kickin'. Actually, it's doing pretty darn well these days. Some folks even reckon we might be headed for a bullish period soon.",

Holding bitcoin is a good way to protect our wealth, it is probably the best asset to do so. I think you have expressed yourself incorrectly and that is why I am clarifying. When economic crises come, those who have assets always come out better off than those who don't, and this time will be no different. We have seen this with the war in Ukraine and inflation, which started before, and was exacerbated by it. Right now the price of oil is rising and this is going to have an impact on the economy in general.",

The market which had the most effect was oil markets where oil spiked higher during that month.Right now the indices tanked, oil pumped and crypto markets traded sideways. So most likely it won’t have a negative or positive affect if the war in Israel is long.",

They might influence some effect like oil price, inflation etc, but you can still live freely even though it's quite struggling.During global chaos, every assets will become worthless because foods, weapon and place to live are the most important thing.But the case you mentioned above, it's a small chaos, the best is holding BTC since you can move to other countries and your wealth are still protected.",

During a war, countries destroy each others communication capabilities (Example Cellphone towers / Internet cables etc).... so citizens will not be able to use the Internet to access the blockchain, making Bitcoin payments almost impossible. On the other hand.... storing your coins in the Blockchain... might save it from total destruction.... when buildings and Banks are destroyed. Your personal belongings like gems and precious metals might be raided or stolen, where you can easily store an encrypted Private key online or buried in a waterproof container, where you can retrieve it after the war.",

So it depends on conditions. But I think up to now Bitcoin is still the safest investment instrument for wealth.OP isn’t asking about the value of bitcoin or it’s price but the significance or it’s importance in the face of war. During War between multiple nations the best type of currency to hold will be a universal currency because holding on to a particular countries currency will place your asset on huge risk if the war prolongs in that particular country which leads to either the country been faced with sanctions which in turns can actually lead to the devaluation of that currency or probably the long way affects the country banking system which then makes it hard for you to convert your funds in the currency. But a general currency like bitcoin wouldn’t be affected in this cases as you can move to just any country to exchange it to any type of fiat you want or even directly use it to transact in business. A clear example of bitcoin importance was shown during the Ukraine-Russia war when donations were done in bitcoin",

This is absolutely correct! The war in Ukraine have proven this to be the case because Bitcoin helped in sending funds to  many people that I know during evacuation when conventional methods of payment failed . Millions of dollars were also raised for Ukraine through Bitcoin. So it is surely looking like Bitcoin is a good resort for people when there is uncertainty.",

This is just a lay scenero of the Bitcoin where it is a decentralized global coin that posseses phrases and private keys to uphold your Bitcoin wallet by yourself without a compromise.I can also say to you that many conventional investors are affected by even just a community inflation but Bitcoin has itself determination values as fluctuations like to be inflation or delation but not as a course of a crisis or waring amongst nations.The only possibilities of staking your Bitcoin asset's to a lost is when you get out of your private handy keys( passwords & phrases) else your Bitcoin remains 100% untempered by a second party and not even a global economy can get rid of it from you aside the effects of inflation and deflation as the coin is a volatile with the possibilities of fluctuating.",

Banks app won't work anymore, you won't be able to move funds out once missiles strikes a country, there will be massive panic and connections will be messed up, it's like the end of the world, it's better to be in Bitcoin at this stage, you can easily arrange space for yourself and your family, Bitcoin is very useful in this type of situations.",
