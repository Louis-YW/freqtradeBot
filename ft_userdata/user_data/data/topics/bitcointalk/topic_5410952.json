Few years back, one Saloon started accepting bitcoin as a payment method in my vicinity, they have got only one payment in bitcoin from me before closing that option in the inset of COVID lockdown. So it's encouraging to know that you can got 5 customers already paying through cryptos. A lot is changing and changing fast. I hope this trend continues.

Bravo OP. It is very much needed now. Two points that I wish to make is - 1) Beware of scammers. There are sophisticated scammers out there who may have found a loophole and want to unbeknownst take advantage. 2) Take your security very importantly and do not trust any of your staff who may handle these transactions in your absence. Watch them like a hawk. How do you plan to deal with the dips? I understand that you may want to exchange it when it peaks but what if you need the money to put back in the business?",
