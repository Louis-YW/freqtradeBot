  "content": "I used to use freewallet as my main wallet because when I started at cripto it was recommended to me. Today, after reading some complains about freewallet, my ledger has arrived. First I sent some bitcoins to my ledger to check if it was alright and it arrived correctly, but when I sent the rest of my bitcoins they suspended my account transactions saying that it was suspicious. I have seen some people writing here about the same problem and decided to write too, cause I know that freewallet has an account in this forum and I really hope they read this.I already opened a ticket, which the ID is 447583.Hope this is solved asap (I need my money  )",

Remember, \"Not your keys, Not your coins\"it's good to know that you acquired a hardware wallet, which means at least you know that noncustodial wallets are the real deal.I do hope freewallet gives you back your funds.",

Some are open source and reproducible, while others are closed source. You should avoid closed source wallets at all costs, even if they are noncustodialA good example is atomic wallets that was recently \"hacked\" and customers lost money, and they have no good explanation to what happened during the incident.

But the problem of scammers can't be solved just by using non custodial wallets. At least, you need some services to buy and sell crypto. Decentralized exchanges won't work if you use something like BTC, XMR or LTC. So once again you may get scammed. And my opinion is that it's really important to inform people about not just \"unsafe\" but \"really fraudulent\" projects. It's a great difference between \"I have a service but its unsafe so hakers can steal your coins\" and \"I have a service that will steal your coins\".",
