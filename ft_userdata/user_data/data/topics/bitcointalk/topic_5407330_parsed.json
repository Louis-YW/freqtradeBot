Like when I engaged some of my folks on bitcoin adoption, I had to be practical while teaching them for easy understanding, I had to download a wallet, how to setup a wallet, how to transact by sending and receiving of bitcoin,  I went to the extent of opening my exchange account for them to see how I received my bitcoin on exchange after I had transferred from my custodial wallet to exchange and also how to trade bitcoin on exchange. I did all these in their very before so they could see. I also engaged them in a practical session so they could also do it themselves while I supervised them. This was how I put them through. I also encouraged them to do research online while I recommended some website and YouTube channels they could follow and watch to get more insight on how the blockchain and crypto space works.",

If you bought Bitcoin around $20000 and sold it around $60,000, it is only 3 times of your capital. It is lower than altcoins like Solana with 200 times of profit. It can be higher with DeFi and NFT tokens but altcoins are more risky than Bitcoin.Fast comes fast goes and most of people on market can not keep their capital safely in altcoins.",

If you explain to them that they should use Bitcoin as a currency, most of them will tell you that they have nowhere to spend it anyway, and even if they do, it's too precious to them because they bought it in the first place for profit.Knowledge is mostly free and available to anyone with internet access, so anyone can research what they are interested in - the only problem is how to filter all available information. I often heard people talk nonsense about Bitcoin, and when I asked them where they got it from, the source would always be the Internet.I agree that everyone should contribute in order to pass on the knowledge they have acquired about Bitcoin because that is the only way we can fight against lies and misconceptions. At the same time, I always emphasize that we should also take into account our privacy and security, because people who talk publicly about Bitcoin can often become targets of hackers, as well as ordinary thieves.",

I am not sure about the whole world adopting Bitcoin and the level of this adoption, but I do agree that it is likely to grow over time. Education is important, and it's a noble task to educate people about Bitcoin for free. People should stop seeing Bitcoin as first and foremost an investment, and they must understand the basics of safety when storing and transferring Bitcoin.",

Having the basic knowledge of the different market periods will save them from being overwhelmed when the market is down. It is a lifetime learning process because there will always be newbie coming into the space and needing assistance to understand how crypto operate.

Upto the maximum extent one should try to distribute their knowledge but obviously there are some skills that you have learnt which you have to sell in order to earn money and not all education can be free so it's even okay to charge minimal amounts for the education that you are providing. Talking about adoption and the way it has grown i feel adoption would grow more rapidly if people would know about the returns of bitcoin rather than the utility behind it.",

But, most people do not like getting their hands dirty with any new idea, and it is good that you try to educate others, because they are likely to be more receptive to the idea once they have been properly educated. The main drawback about Bitcoin adoption is lack of awareness.So if you do not know what Bitcoin is, or how Bitcoin works, so how can you ever understand the advantages of Bitcoin?

One very sure thing you have to understand is that you can a take horse to the river to drink water but you can't force it to drink water. What I did mean here is no matter how you teach people about the fact that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick business, you still gonna have numerous number of people that would still look at Bitcoin in that way, because some of them have heard how Bitcoin transformed some people's lives without knowing or taking into account how long those people did invest into Bitcoin (early investors). Therefore, so far that Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency are still highly voilatile you gonna still have such kind of people in this space until they got to a time when they're mature in the space and I think this is much within people coming New into the industry.",
