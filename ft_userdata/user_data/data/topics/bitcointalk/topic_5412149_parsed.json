It comes scratched, but doesn't get additional scratches easily. It must have been something in the production line, similar to the iPhone 5 (or something like that) 'scratch gate' back in the day, where a bunch of them came with a deep scratch on the back from the factory. It's actually tricky to find media coverage about it right now; I remember a few years back it was all over the net.On the other hand, BitBox02 comes pristine and it feels like the moment you start to use it it has all those glossy-plastic microscratches (we all know those, right?) all over the screen.Quote from: dkbit98 on September 03, 2022, 06:55:33 PMI know some people still keep original foil on their Trezor wallets  On the Trezor?

It is just a matte LCD and it's recessed, so chances of touching are slim anyway.And if you do, it won't really scratch. You could pierce and destroy it, but a screen protector won't help with that, either.Quote from: dkbit98 on September 04, 2022, 09:11:44 PMOne information I found recently is that Trezor made metallic case model and gave them to all their workers few years ago, and they sold some as anniversary edition.That sounds nice!

      "body": "I have toyed with the idea of somehow making or ordering a metallic case for my Trezor. I am the kind of person who likes to customize my belongings if possible and I would love to have a Trezor with a nice a tidy bronze or stainless steel case (not sure if include the name and logo of Trezor on it tho). The weight and sturdy feeling added to the device would improve my personal experience with it, I think. I am aware that this may not make sense in terms of security, it is a very personal thing, I assume.To this day I have neither found a way to achieve this idea nor a clear grasp of a budget. I would not like to hire a CNC workshop in my city, it is a little bit risky, but I assume CNC works abroad are more expensive, so for now I will have to stick to the plastic case, until I find a solution.",

You treat it from a practical position, while others may see it as an aesthetic necessity. There is a similar trend with mobile phones: for some, the appearance is indifferent, while others want cases with all sorts of bells and whistles. I don't want to catch up with fear, but if the manufacturer stops supporting the Nano S in the future, then no skins will be needed for your wallet.",
