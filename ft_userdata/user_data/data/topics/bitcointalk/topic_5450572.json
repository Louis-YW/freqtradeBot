      "body": "Have you no good deed to do but spend time begging for money? I have answered you in our local board (arabic) that what you are doing will not lead to any result.You continued to publish topics requesting loans after you posted positive trust feedback from new accounts to delude everyone that you are an honest person and have an honest trading history. This is clear from the type of evaluations and the timing of their publication, and this is considered additional evidence of your intentions to scam others.Forget about this matter so that you do not receive more negative trust, because no one will give you a penny. And work on providing good content and doing useful things instead of continuing to beg for money.Quote from: btcpepa04 on April 29, 2023, 02:12:13 AMNote1:Please help me I want start my project miningIt is interesting to know how you can start a mining business with only $500. Can you share your method with us or should we join you in the Western Sahara?Quote from: btcpepa04 on April 29, 2023, 02:12:13 AMNote2: Loan to member Not trusted but i dont have collateralThere is a general rule here on the forum that says that any new account that wants to obtain a loan without being able to secure it with a Collateral mortgage is necessarily fraudulent and the community should be warned about it. And for your information, your account is at risk to get banned.",
