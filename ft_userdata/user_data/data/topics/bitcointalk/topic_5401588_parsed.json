The license is also important and doesn't forget to make sure that the country where you live is not on the list of prohibited countries in the casino.

Hope it makes sense and please share what are your favorite online sportsbooks.  from me and the way i see the thing's moving you can only trust all the sites after working with them and the results or how they treat you will show you how credible the sites it, because right now if you did not work with them you will not know exactly what is going alongside with them and especially the site,if you bet goes well with them you can give them half of your trust because no site that you can trust fully",

If you are here in the forum, the gambling boards are very good sources of information about casinos and sportsbooks. From the first item you mentioned, reviews - better check if the review site is a comprehensive and not bias one.Most review sites are after for the possible referral commission, hence, they don't care if they will list a popular yet scam site.For me, if you are a user of this forum, it is better to check the respective thread of the casino and check the trust summary of their rep.You can also have a good understanding on what's going on if you will read the content of their thread. It may also give you handful of information that you can use before sending any penny to the site.",

It is very hard to know those gambling sites that does not worth it which is the reason why we need to stay informed. It is good to do research before jumping on gambling sites for betting. There are gambling sites that do not worth the time or that can take away gamblers fund if care is not taken. The forum is a good place for us to ask questions about what we don't reason have good idea about.",

I usually follow the crowd, if the reviews from the gamblers are good then most probably, I will also try their platform to experience it for myself. I also look for good security, KYC matters to me as well and if the withdrawal and deposit is fast with a smaller fees. To be more safe, better to gamble only with the top sites, mostly they run their site for years now and that could be a good assurance as well.",

Well, I believe that some variables can be analyzed and this is important!!I believe the reputation is essential these days, speed/time in withdrawals and also quantity (fast, slow etc). Customer contact support (chat bot? online? email?)And I also believe that some reviews are also interesting to analyze.",

It is always best to learn from your own experience, but you can reduce your risk by taking certain steps.It is quite important that the casino is on the market as long as possible. The shorter the casino is on the market, the greater the risk.For sure, don't make a large deposit at first. It's best to try to make a few withdrawals before depositing a larger amount.If you do not care about anonymity and it is not a problem for you to do KYC verification, look for casinos that have a license. This makes the risk quite a bit smaller as well.",

I have never seen yet a sportsbook as in legit and officially recognize just like website/pages in some channels but anyway I just think maybe cause this is gambling so that's why it's not meant for it.As I already tried several sportsbooks,  I can say that I know how to trust them. There are a lot of factors to consider and most of them have already been mentioned such as reputation, licenses, review, etc. I also look into how many active players are betting on it in the day-by-day cases. If you will rely on this forum, you are in the best place to look for answers and know also how to trust a sportsbook, especially a crypto one.",

I only trust a few sportsbook that accept bitcoin and other cryptos, and everything else is risky to use.You should always check reputation, activity and history in bitcointalk forum, for example Sportsbet website is one of the best you can find.Fortunejack is next on my list and I sometimes I use Stake website when I find better odds there.",

Also, feedback from outside the forum like google and their social media.This is the simplest and one of the most efficient ways to check a site's legitimacy. If it's not a good place to bet, of course there will be several complains in different sites and forums on the internet. And in case there is none, better to avoid the sportsbook until it becomes more popular and recognized by the gambling virtual community. Reviews are easy to find and are usually very complete. All important informations and details, like for how long the site is operating, can be found there.One trick I use is to always search the website's name followed by the word \"scam\" on google. If there is something against them, it will appear on the top results. When there is nothing, the support promptly replies and solves the situation or the accusations are fragile it's an evidence the site is safe to play.",
