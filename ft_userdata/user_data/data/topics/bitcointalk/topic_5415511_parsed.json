  "content": "People who are addicted to gambling have done crazy things as a result of their addiction. Nonetheless, I never imagined reading a story as unbelievable as this. It is the story of a woman who abandons her 4-year-old child after using him as collateral and sustaining huge losses. Firstly, I am shocked because it is the male gender who have been known to go to any lengths to satisfy their gambling addiction.  In addition, I wonder what would have moved the woman in this case to do this kind of thing. My assessment is that this is simply a case of irresponsible parenting and problem gambling. How do you think about this?QuoteA woman has reportedly abandoned her 4-year-old son in a lottery shop in Enugu after incurring huge losses in gambling. The incident Sahara Reporters gathered happened at Moore House Street, Ogui in the state capital on Thursday. Residents of the area said the woman left her son in the Lotto shop after she incurred a huge loss she couldn’t offset. The little boy was later taken to Ogui police station when the wait for his mother was becoming endless. A police officer who confirmed the incident to SaharaReporters on Friday narrated how a little child was brought to the station by some persons who claimed his mother used him as collateral to play lotto.Source: https://saharareporters.com/2022/09/30/nigerian-woman-abandons-4-year-old-child-gambling-shop-collateral-after-huge-losses",

How do you think about this?Yes, irresponsible parenting. The woman is not responsible at all. But the woman would be found because likely she would be gambling in an area close to where she is living or close to her working place  where people would know him.I think the woman is tired of her life with the child, or maybe not.If people do not know the woman, that means she is from a far place and have no other mission than to sell the child or something, but she used her child to gamble instead. If this is what that happened, that means this is not about gambling or gambling addiction, but a mother that does not want her child again. But who will do such a thing? To let a woman use her son as collateral and he does not know her? So I go with my first opinion.",

I'm not sure I fully believe this story though, I just can't fathom of something like this happens.",

Most probably the 4-year old son would be put to use in some kind of labor or whatever that the owner of the casino deem fit. The mother is so far into gambling that she consciously made the decision to leave and use her son as a collateral, and that is already a tell-tale sign that the mother has something going on with her mind. On the part of the gambling platform however, they should also be fined for accepting the kid for collateral because that can also be considered as human trafficking.",

Often there is all sorts of drinking going on and the occasional violent outbursts, not to mention that gambling itself is pretty looked down upon in society due to the addiction generating behavior it can cause. It is sad to see someone hit rock bottom like this, as it was most likely a case of her completely running out of money and feeling absolutely devastated from losing the little she had. It just goes to show how irrational gambling can make certain people, most often those that have the least money available and not enough education to determine how the odds are stacked against them",
