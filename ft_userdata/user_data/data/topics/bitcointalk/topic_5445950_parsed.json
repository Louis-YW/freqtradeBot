I have thought of changing my password reason being that I am no longer secure with it, I don't know what happened to my browser in my absence for the number of days I wasn't active, usually I don't really give attention to the forum due to family challenges includes wife, children and parents. Also noticed I lost access to my email used in registering my account I have thought of changing it as well but something in me kept saying don't change while my instinct keep telling me to change it, I have tried to recover email happens but that the mobile number I used wasn't there I know the stress involved while trying to retrieve my stolen line so alternatively changing mail will be the best option for me currently. So I thought of posting here to know if i am that free to make any changes or i should continue using it that way without any changes. My question is; what will be my fate if I can't have access to my btt account and then what about my mail I don't have access to. Please let experts update me based on this issues.I love you all.",

You should definitely change your email and password if you have reason to believe they have been compromised. There is no rule that says you can’t change your password or email, but it raises a eyebrow that the account may be bought/hacked. If an accusation ever comes up, you can sign a message from your old bitcoin address to prove account ownership hasn’t changed. You have been here long enough to know this.",

And when I returned to the forum after those periods, I simply resumed posting and doing my forum interventions as normal. Of course, due to this absence, it is a little more difficult at first, as we are not familiar with other users. But, the forum is a family and everything becomes normal.Every time I returned to activity, I never had to announce or report that I was doing so, I simply logged in and posted... So your announcement was unnecessary, despite understanding the concerns.Regarding the question of changing your email/password, it will all depend on how secure you feel with the current ones. Changing the password from time to time is not a bad thing, and we are not obliged to have the same email address for life either. As long as at any point you can prove that you're the same person from day one, that's no problem.So welcome back and try to stick around! I only regret being away a few times...",

Please let experts update me based on this issues.I love you all.In my opinion, there's nothing wrong with changing your password if you're still actively using the email you used here on the forum. It's possible that you just forgot the password so you changed it through the email you used here. Because you haven't been active in years or months.      But you can't get rid of others here thinking that you bought or hacked the account. You may be telling the truth, but such things should not be said here in the public forum. But if you can't access your email and password here in the forum, chances are high that your email and bitcointalk account has been hacked. But anyway, if you become active again, welcome back to the crypto space here on this platform.",

Just as a few other members have said here, they could have overlooked the account even if you start being active again after a long break, unless you violate any forum rules that will warrant further investigation. Either they will detect your change details and add them up as evidence, or you are probably doing a total different thing than what you were known for before your long break from the forum.",

Here is an example[2] of mine when I changed my email address like a few months ago.Assuming I am an account farmer, I opened a Bitcointalk account and built it to full member or higher rank. Before it ranked up, I staked bitcoin address, or even joined one signature campaign. Later, if I sold the account for which was my initial intention, or later intention, the account buyer can have some experience about this forum, he can ask for the private key of the address I used to sign a message which I can give the person. I am not an account farmer, but I am just using myself as an example of what possible scenario that could happen while buying Bitcointalk account. Signing a message with your bitcoin staked address can be a way to know the ownership of an account, but it may not go up to buying Bitcointalk account because the seller can handover the private key of the staked address to the buyer.",

The only change can be seen in the IP address, but that's not information that we can see publicly anyway.A signed message from a staked address does not necessarily mean that someone is the original owner of that address, but that he just came into possession of the private key of that same address.Changing your password from time to time is not a bad thing, unless of course you replace a strong and unique password with a weak and predictable one.",

Posting style and change of local language are other indicators that the account has changed hands. I don’t think I have seen any case where an account was tagged only because they changed posting style so it seems that alone is not a strong enough reason to tag an account.
