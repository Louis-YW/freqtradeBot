      "body": "Are you saying that the site is scam? If so, it is difficult to get your money back, because there is no data about this site and it does not provide a legal service, or at least legal without certain conditions.There are no services that offer anonymous cards, and even those that you offer, they are similar to what you can buy with gift cards with high fees, and therefore all services that require personal registration will not work with them.",

Do your own research before sending Bitcoin to any cards like this.",
