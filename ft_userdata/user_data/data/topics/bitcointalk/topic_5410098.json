  "content": "In 2021 I joined this forum as a graduate, having a small-paying job. This forum has exposed me to the fundamentals of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, and how to enhance economic productivity in my daily life.This forum is Satoshi Nakamoto’s second great invention: a well-thought idea that was initiated to enhance our crypto knowledge. We had youth week in our church last week and we were asked to share ideas and knowledge. I tend to use the opportunity to lecture them about crypto, but last week I talked about the Bitcoin Forum, and how it is similar to our church group. There, we created a platform that will foster training in crypto, empowerment, mentorship, growth and networking for young people to collaborate on ideas. Like the forum, this will help get everyone achieve financial independence and the knowledge of crypto within and beyond our immediate environment.The desire to help these young people navigate through a career path in the crypto sphere through this forum is my vision to accomplish. I want my friends and well-wishers to know about crypto. That's why I came up with the plan to introduce and tell the youths about crypto, the forum and the rules and regulations governing it.Getting positive results of how eager they are willing to join and attain knowledge in crypto wasn't that easy because I started with the basics of crypto to lecture them, the forum ranks, merits, how to post and promote bounties, and the rules and regulations and so on. It is intimidating for many.However, I am happy about how far I have gone with them on the platform, and we are very grateful to God that the awareness may turn into a successful mission.We hope by the end of it, the exposure to crypto and the Bitcoin forum will be magnificent. That many will find a career path in this field, as it presents a rare but available opportunity to advance into financial well-being.",

But I had tried to introduce this forum to my nearest persons. But sadly they don't spend time here nor much interest. Everyone just looks for money which is impossible from here for a beginner. This forum isn't for earning purposes, here we can learn. Anyway good to see you have chances to share about the forum and cryptocurrency publicly. The next generation should know about cryptocurrency very well.",

It is a good thing you have in mind, but I must also remind and advice you to be careful and cautious as you introduce cryptocurrency to your friends. Cautious in the sense that as you talk about crypto and have highlighted its potential to affect ones financial situation positively, many of them may be eager to want to skip to the part where you tell them how exactly to gain and may urge you to give them some financial advice, however tempting, you must avoid that urge to give financial advice to them as you talk about crypto, so tomorrow if it doesn't go their way, they wouldn't have you to blame and your relationship will be save.",

The few that will escape ban might find it difficult to excel in the forum and eventually leave. So, it is important to educate them about the forum.Secondly, enlighten them about Bitcoin and neutralize the mindset of get rich quick scheme, then teach them the real things of bitcoin, many could find career here. Crypto is relatively new and may evolve into wonderful things than we could think in the future.",

I believe that from a financial point of view that this forum as well as crypto have helped people have a better financial situation and early adopters are no exception. I believe your initiative will more or less help them know about bitcoin or crypto in general, but of course you will not be held responsible for their ability to persist and understand it well.But unfortunately, the habit of the community that is formed because of the basic desire to make money will be the beginning that plunges them into various scams when they only care about money without much curiosity about knowledge. They just spamming this forum, they don't care about the quality of the posts and they start thinking that having more account will make them rich faster than forever depending on real work. This is the negative impression I've ever thought of from the crypto community out there especially when they make this forum a place to make money.",

It is intimidating for many. Your initiative is good,  and one that is highly encouraged,  but I must correct you on something which I feel is very important. I feel that when ever we are educating our friends about crypto and presenting this forum to them as a place to learn more about bitcoin and crypto currencies,  we should always rule away the bounty part of it,  this is one of the reasons why we have so many spammers on the forum,  they register/sign up on this forum for bounty purposes alone, and not to contribute or learn anything meaningful on the forum. So I think it is high time we stop introducing bitcointalk to our friends as a forum where they can make money in bounties,  introduce the forum to them as place where they can learn about bitcoin ~ if they are new to cryptocurrencies and a place where they can share their crypto knowledge ~ if they are already into crypto currencies before.",

Don't get me wrong, its ok to mention that aspect of this forum as well as it will certainly attract some people (especially in developing countries) but it shouln't be a sole reason to register here.My only concern when it comes to success in attracting younger audience to bitcointalk is that for majority of them forum is too slow so they rather prefer Telegram/Twitter and other \"faster\" ways of communication.",

I understand that a lot of people here have taken forum as a side job that makes a few bucks to help them make ends meet. I wouldn't blame them for this but when they all end up in the wrong section then in the end they will never get any good knowledge other than just a few bucks off a non-potential altcoin.We've actually touched on this issue a few times where we sometimes give some advice so that beginners don't fall into the false expectations of many altcoin projects. Some beginners manage to develop their skills even they manage to have their own business by adopting bitcoin, but that's only a small percentage of people.",

However, let me give you heads on on this so you won't be taken aback. I suffered rejection from those I thought I was bringing the Bitcoin news to five years ago. In my excitement of the discovery of what Bitcoin was from my little knowledge, I approached those friends of mine to spread the good news. They wanted an instant show of result from my engagement in Bitcoin in terms of what I achieved financially since I was already in it. They didn't see any flashy stuff around me and so they didn't get interested because it wouldn't make them instant money. Fast forward, a few of those friends who rejected me are now coming back to it. I'm insisting on charging them a fee now if I must teach it to them.

For career path in crypto industry, if you truely want to succeed then you have to look beyond the forum as the opportunity here are limited. Signature and bounties participations should never been considered a career path. The best way to excel in the career aspect of this industry is by having a skills that you can sell as service for some cryptocurrency and I don't think the best paying ones are on the forum.
