Then why are all the sites showing Bitcoin costs $1-$3 to send. Cashapp for example hovers around $2 to get a 10 minute transaction, or $1 for a 2 hour transaction. Coinbase is a bit cheaper usually hovering around $1Since when can you send BTC for 3 cents?",

When you withdraw bitcoin from a custodial service like coinbase, you pay the fee to the service instead of paying miners directly. Custodial services usually charge you more than the fee they pay to miners. If you use a non-custodial wallet which allows you to set the fee rate yourself, you can make bitcoin transactions with much lower fees.",

There are times of the day wherein BTC fees are cheaper and you can get away with less than a few cents worth of fees, but it's not really consistent within the day so switching to ETH might be more economical before hitting send on your PC. You can use other alts for the same purpose too, but of course value will be an issue especially if the other party needs to get it as BTC or ETH and would not want an exchange to add to the equation.",

Centralized services charge very expensive withdrawal fee on users.Fortunately, if you are using a non custodial wallet, you can control your coin inputs (for each transaction) and fee rate you want to broadcast that transaction.Generally you can check average transaction fees on Bitcoin or Ethereum network with Blockchair.com's tool: https://blockchair.com/compareChoosing Bitcoin, Ethereum and unchoosing other blockchains.

This mean even though you can send Bitcoin with 1 sat/byte that will cost you only few cents, but the exchange can ask 50,000 satoshi to able withdraw your coins, 50,000 satoshi is 0.0005 BTC or $10 currently.The best way to avoid large fees is avoid to use centralized exchange and closed source wallet e.g. Trustwallet, Atomic etc. Only use non custodial wallet, open source and use segwit address e.g. Electrum or Bluewallet.",
