  "content": "Hello bitcoin community, how are you? I hope you are well. I open thread because I have a doubt, I have never mined with fpga, only with others like cpu and one or another asic, because you need a more powerful hardware to mine this currency, I would just like to know how I could mine with fpga either any cryptocurrency. I don't know how to import the algorithm, nor if it is possible to mine with a cyclone 10 model 10CL016YU484C8G. I was hoping someone will help me thank you very much.",
