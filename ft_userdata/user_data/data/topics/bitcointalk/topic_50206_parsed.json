(next 20 bytes of hash of public key), equalverify (0x88), checksig (0xac)Only in this case the 0x14 has been replaced by 00, which in scripting language means push 0 bytes.It's a tx which has been sent to nothing. Obviously someone was hacking at bitcoin or making a custom version and messed up- although I have no idea what it was doing with so much money.",
