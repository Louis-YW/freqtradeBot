But this is how I do it, if I want to take a team, I will make analysis myself to know if the team are worth going for.",

The question now is how to determine the public play, and you also need to have a high discipline because not all public play will lose, it's just most of the public play will fail, so slowly but surely, you might be profitable. I checked the website, not sure how they got that percentage of public bets since you need to subscribe if you will click that \"lock\" sign.",

It probably does since the reward is higher in case you win. You'll probably succeed betting on the huge underdog in 1 out of 10 bets - my rough estimate only. How you'll pace your bets to maximize your potential profit is the question here.I personally don't follow a fix strategy like betting against the public. I often just bet on teams that I think will win or if they can cover the spread and handicap.",

They take the history of the team or fighter and use that to determine who will win the match/fight and price the odds according to that. If you bet on the underdog every time you will probably lose money in the long run. If you bet on the favorite every time you probably will not earn that much when they win and when they lose you will lose what you just earned. You cannot blindly bet on odds you need to know the fighters or teams yourself and make a educated guess on what you think will happen instead of following some weak \"bet against public\" style bets.",

Sometimes football teams' performance are exeggerated in media after 3-0, 4-0 win against weak team. Yet no one looks their next opponent. I sometimes come up \"counter-attacker\" football teams that are underdog and can beat strong teams with wise strategy.

Betting against the public isn't the same as underdog betting tho, since you can have more information and analysis but still bet on the favorite. Probably you'll be more confident about taking handicaps or other strange bets like corners, etc. Probably a fine example of betting against the public is on AJ vs USYK I, IIRC public favored AJ more since he's popular, however, many boxing pros know that he's only a bodybuilder lol.",

In applying this technique, it is necessary to keep the risk of taking a threat. You have to think adversely when the team is in good condition. On the other hand, it is very difficult to support the opposite team in a match that is adversely but you have to obey. Strategy and luck both are needed to win in any betting.",

You can also comment if you some reliable sites. Most crowd sourced betting starts at the odds that bookmakers are marking up and could potentially allow for narrow extra profits because it takes out the \"buffer\" that sportbooks add in to guarantee longer term profit. I'd also argue with one of the first ideas that comes up in the second section, every bet does not always have one of two outcomes. It can have three or more, if you look at soccer (or many other sports) one of the most common bets offered is Win / Lose / Draw. You'd be surprised but crowd sourced wisdom is probably more reliable over the long run, although it can definitely make small mistakes along the way - which are more to do with the occasional upsets where the underdog wins that every sport can have.",

I would agree with the article that a lot of people bet on what they would like yo happen, and not what is the most likely scenario to happen. When it come to sports there is a lot of emotions and rivalry involved. Some fans would never consider betting on any other then than their home team, which means that the odds for the big teams with a huge fan base should be skewed. Trying to exploit this inefficiency and betting on the underdog should be a good strategy. The only problem I see is that there are a lot of different bookmakers out there which all place their own bets. So it might take some time to collect all the data across all betting platforms to see which are the most popular and where is the majority getting the odds wrong. Would be nice to run the strategies for a few different leagues and compare where it is the most profitable.",

Say we all had $100 to bet and my friends would usually split it in 2 and bet 50 on each of the 2 teams they liked the best and expected to win, while I'd bet $20 on 5 matches, always betting for the underdog. The results were sometimes funny as they'd lose 1 and win 1, winning maybe $20 on the whole thing, while I'd lose 4 and win only 1, but I'd still get ahead, getting $50 out of it even though I lost 4 bets. Try it also on MMA matches putting all money on every underdog in a single event and see how it goes. Often a single win will get you far ahead.",
