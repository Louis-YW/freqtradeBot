  "content": "Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Adriano Espaillat spoke Friday morning to push for a pathway for migrants to more easily start working as one way to ease the social burden of the city’s influx of migrants.They were met with a loud crowd and were forced to shout.“They are prevented from getting jobs, they are prevented from employment and that is part of the strain on our public systems,” Ocasio-Cortez said over protestors. “So the faster that folks can access the work that they are asking for, legally, the better we can solve this problem.” why would you let people come into the country and not even let them work? it doesn't make sense. hopefully they are giving them some type of universal basic income while they sit and wait to work. that's all i can say!  there's too much red tape if someone is here in this country they shouldn't have to prove anything to anyone to be allowed to work. anyone agree?oh, i forgot the link to the story: https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4206566-house-democrats-confronted-by-protestors-over-migrant-crisis-in-nyc/",

Only offering a potential explanation as to why NY might prohibit illegals from getting jobs. I mention wages are driven down -- it's mostly unskilled wages that are driven down because of cheap labor. But who benefits from cheap labor? The consumers. The doctors and lawyers of NYC don't need to worry about this. The uber drivers do.In other words, if you're a skilled worker, it's within your interest to allow cheap unskilled labor to flourish. If you're an unskilled worker, it becomes an issue.Yes, the illegals could educate themselves and benefit the local economy. But that's not what happens in actuality. Illegals generally take up low skilled positions and stick to them.",

And obviously immigrants will have it more difficult, because of their status and economical situation. It is not impossible but less likely to happen. And if democrats forge a plan so inmigrants can increase their chances to become professionals, then they should do the same for the American people who nowadays are supposed to drown themselves in debt, in order to study anything beyond highschool.",

I am very aware of the current state of Twitter after all this time it has been under the administration of Elon. And I must say it is a pity, hopefully he will step down and leave someone with more experience with social media to handle the direction of X. Anyways, obviously the Southern border is dangerous, there are cartel members there and also human traffickers, but politicians are supposed to face those situation in order to solve the problems and challenges of the country, that is why they have got security teams, whose salaries are paid with taxes. I would be very constructive if the leaders of Democrat party actually visited the border, but they do not seem to care of such problems, as long as they stay far away enough from Washington.",
