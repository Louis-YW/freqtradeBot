      "body": "It might be too early, but the regular season is almost over, so I guess it's a good time to predict who will be the NBA Champions.As for me, I already did my bet since March 30. I already put my bet on the Warriors because I think they are still capable of winning the title again.They might be playing very awful on the road which is kind of a question mark for me, and to others as well knowing that they are performing very well on their home. They're playing very great on their home while it's a complete opposite on the road. However, if the whole roster of the Warriors will come back, and will play better on the road like what they did last year, I think they're still capable of winning it.They have the pieces. Splash Brothers + Poole Party + DiVincenzo on the offense, Looney, Green, Kuminga, GPII, and even Moody on the defense, and rebounds. When Wiggins come back, I'm not really expecting too much on his comeback on the first games, but we know how he played last playoffs, and how he has been a big factor on their title run. I believe that he can do it again because he isn't injured at all. I pick the Warriors to get the title again.",

They're the second team favored by the bookies and I expect them to reach the finals once more and actually win it all as long as they won't lose any players throughout the playoffs. We've seen unexpected injuries happen during the playoffs and know how the situation can quickly change for the players and the team.",

The odds is really tempting but they already sacrificed a lot of their good bench players which is responsible for their strong second half last year just to maintain their first 5 line up. Current GSW has a very weak defense and can be destroyed by the team with balance offense and defense like Nuggets and Boston. GSW might have a good run but this year will gonna be a lot harder compared last year due to their current roster and every team on West is very strong with their complete line-up.",

I agree. I think Giannis is the most unstoppable player in the league right now and I don’t think teams like Boston or Phoenix can guard him. Maybe the 76ers or the Lakers could keep him from taking over but I’m not sure either of those teams will get the chance. I also like Denver’s chances as I think they’re the best young team in the league.",

Ofcourse \"mainstream\" teams would still be leading despite of the fact that unexpected teams are leading the brackets such as with nuggets. Bucks I guess would more be able to sustain their lead up til finals. Lakers and other bigger fanchise or names are wuite having trouble with their line ups. They might have the larger number of all stars but atleast chemistry are with those teams which are quite having a good run this year. There are also unexoected trades between different teams which causes line ups to be shuffled but also, makes it hard for bettors out there.New players are also monsters; centers hitting 3s. Odds would be hard for sure to determine given that it is still too early for championship. Regardless, bucks are a more balanced team IMO.",

Well, that was for the West but on the East I think it's either Bucks or the Celtics.Clippers consistency is good so far and getting a win streak with Westbrook on their team showing that he's a good match to the team, if their teammates will support him then provably we can see more intense Westbrook in the playoffs. But I think they might struggle to achieve championship knowing teams in the west have good upgrades made on free agency so for this they cannot made their life easy on top teams on the west. I vote for Bucks this season knowing they are pretty much consistent and Giannis still a dominant player which can lift his team to championship.",

In the ordinary league they just go and reach the playoffs but once they reach it and playoffs starts they are an entire new team. Also i think Denver might surprise us this year also for me the favorites are the Boston Celtics.",

I only watched Clippers defeat Lakers yesterday and Kawhi is on fire. As for GSW, they also look on fire although knowing that this is GSW, I have a lot of questions on their defenses. Most of the people I know are leaning towards Clippers moving into the finals, but I might need to watch a few more games before I could tail that bet and collect a payout (hopefully.)",

They have been in this kind of situation before and it seems that they are more healthy this season just like when they won the ring.And Giannis is putting MVP numbers, he might not be the favorite as Jokic and Embiid are the front runners. But as far as experience goes, I like their chances, Khris Middleton is 100% now, Holiday just had a career high 51 points. So they look solid. Also, others might not agree to me, but I'm not seeing any solid team in the West that can win the trophy for this year.",

I thought that they are going to be eliminated, but then when Steph comes back from injuries, he bring the team to above .500 and now are able to maintain it. They still have Wiggins to comeback, and the last time we heard, he will not be back in the regular season, but it doesn't mean he won't be playing in the playoff. And with GPII back in the lineup, it will be very difficult to whoever teams are going to face them in the playoff, and in a series. Sacramento is a good team no doubt, but if by chance they are match against the Warriors in the playoff, it will be very difficult for them.",

How sweet will that be?  That's my prediction for now and I think I will still bet for them at 8.50.But the actual time when it could have been profitable was before the season started. I am not sure how much they are giving away at that time because I took the bet for the Pelicans just for fun and because they are giving away x33 if they become a champion. Looks like the Warriors and the Bucks are winning the poll. Nice. But I want to see a new champion.",

Even a fully healthy Lakers only has slim chance of winning a chip. I would even consider them lucky or let's say improved in a way when they get pass the 2nd round. I'm rooting for the healthy Suns this year. Base on the Suns game played with Durant on the roster, they seem to be difficult to handle for any teams in the West. I feel like the combination of CP3, Booker, Durant, and Ayton are more lethal than the GSW with Durant. That's what makes me so excited in this playoffs this year. Can CP3 finally have his first ring ever as well as Booker. They had like back to back disappointing playoffs year, now with Durant on the roster, they're an inch closer to the goal than the last couple of years.",

Plus they have been in the finals before, they know the feeling of losing and they don't want that to happen to them once again.
