So that makes me to create this thread here for them to be aware on the latest development on Remitano. Network Congestion Issue in RemitanoIt was about two weeks ago when the exchange informed the users of the platform about the maintenance that was going on which they freeze bitcoin deposit and withdraw. And yesterday they came back to inform the users that they  are back through the channel of email communication. But they warned the users that they should not use the old bitcoin address of the exchange and every user should create new address for deposit and those who has not seen the former thread in the local board and heard the information deposited bitcoins to the exchange and the exchange locked the coins. And this brought back the popular saying, \"Not Your Key and Not Your Coins\" if you are using exchange because you don't control the coins once the coins are deposited to the exchange. Those who are using Ramitano for buy and sell, transaction and transfer should be aware of the latest development of the exchange so that you will not be a victim. One of their warning of their returning back from the maintenance process is, once you deposit your bitcoin in the old address, you might not get it back. So be warned.",

They likely moved their funds to entire new wallets and they warn that if users send coins to old wallet addresses, they will lose coins.However, Remitano will still have access to old wallets but they just waive out their responsibility to support their users. Some exchanges can support you but with expensive support fees and with this announcement, Remitano simply warn that they will not support any user with mistakenly sending to old wallet addresses.I note one thing. If you go to their Wallet page, click BTC (Deposit), you will no longer see your old deposit address. There is only a button, Create a new address. So if a user goes with this process, no chance to make mistake.",

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.If this is true, this is nothing more than a scam. Not your key not your coin.Not your key not your coin.It is not good to backup your exchange address. Anytime that you want to deposit into the exchange, go to the exchange and copy the address from there. Do not leave your coins on an exchange. Convert to bitcoin to fiat and deposit it in your bank. Or convert fiat to bitcoin and send it to a noncustodial wallet.Remitano is not an exchange that I can recommend. They are poor in satisfying customers.",

Remitano is not an exchange I can bet on owing to their poor customer care system and network, if I am to use a centralized exchange for my transactions I will prefer binance to remitano despite it been a Cex it's with a better security system over the year than remitano and any other Cex I can think of. But that being said, never leave your coins in a Cex the risk is risky in all dimension, take responsibility of your keys and be in charge of your coins by using a noncustodial wallet.",

All the both threads have been corrected. Remitano would have still giving more weeks for the support of the old address. And if Remitano have access to the wallet then those coins that are already locked it frozen are not save because they can transfer and withdraw them as will. Therefore, those who are sending coins for instant transaction should be careful with the address. Now that they have gotten the information, they should always Chey the address before sending coins. But I still don't understand why the old address was stopped to be used. This changing of address might make some user to lose coins unaware because this email messages that was sent to all users is not enough because many users might have lost there email accounts to hackers and some of them have forgotten the password so they might not get the email.",

However, freezing assets for withdrawal and deposit is a standard practice in certain updates/upgrades. Even non-custodial wallets could do that when need be. The only difference is that you might be certain that you have the key and no one would steal your money. They (Remitano) are fair enough to communicate promptly and to guide properly which is the most important thing here. \"Not Your Key and Not Your Coins\" will always prevail but we can't still do without these custodial arrangements if we need the best services.Just don't save your assets there.",

Every time I want to deposit on the exchange, I go to the exchange and copy the address from there for more than one reason: First, I am afraid that there will be a change in the address, and the other reason is that I am also afraid that I have copied the wrong address. Therefore, we should not be negligent in such sensitive matters.This is a clear example of such cases, due to laziness some users send their money to the same old address on the exchange and now maybe their money is lost because the exchange stopped supporting the old addresses, even if they had access to the old wallets they probably won't return the money to the users because they put a warning before that.",

Quote from: Coin_trader on August 31, 2023, 11:37:47 AMUsually, Withdrawal address is the one being save on the exchange to acoid (avoid) withdrawing on wrong address but deposit address on exchange should be done manually to ensure that you are using the correct deposit address. Exchange like Binance and other big exchanges do this kind of terms if they update their wallet.  Probably this is a new development because since when I join cryptocurrency ecosystem,I have not heard of aan exchange changes depositing address of bitcoin. And as I said changing depositing address is not really good because the depositor might mistakenly send coins to the former address. So preferably, if there is a way funds can't be sent to the old address whenever they send coins to it, there should be some kind of restriction.",

And yesterday they came back to inform the users that they  are back through the channel of email communication. But they warned the users that they should not use the old bitcoin address of the exchange and every user should create new address for deposit. Finally they have said what's in their mind and what they wanted to do from the very beginning, I have always advice people to stay away from this exchange but yet they're gaining momentums and becoming more popular among the Nigerian community, this isn't the first time they won't be putting their customers needs above theirs. What stops them from following Binance exchange footsteps in allowing users to appeal for their funds to be recovered if they mistakenly sent it to their old address. It's heartbreaking because many Nigerians use them for their (supposedly) peer2peer exchange and many users will be losing funds because of this. We all know they still have access to those coins that'll be sent to the old address but I guess that's a way of compensating their pockets before performing an exit scam.Quote from: Mate2237 on August 31, 2023, 10:47:00 AMThose who are using Ramitano for buy and sell, transaction and transfer should be aware of the latest development of the exchange so that you will not be a victim. One of their warning of their returning back from the maintenance process is, once you deposit your bitcoin in the old address, you might not get it back. So be warned.Those who will be mostly affected aren't on the forum but the millions of Nigerians (and others) using the platform daily for their transactions and not aware of this change because people are uneducated on the matter of not storing exchange address and always going to the exchange to copy the address whenever they want to use it. Many users aren't used to the fact that address can change, they're still with the old mentality that you have only one Bitcoin address because that's how it started for most user that got involved and started from the wrong side (like using centralized exchanges and wallets giving them online one address). Many merchant already have their Bitcoin address sent out and for most of them, it isn't their personal address but that of these exchanges (all in the name to reduced expenses on fees). Remitano should just consider the number of users that'll be affected by this and provided a solution as Binance did. Sending out emails isn't enough although I know they they have done what typically is expected of them to do (send out notifications).",

In my opinion, the exchange is not really a very smart exchange, and it is not even very popular like some tier one and tier two exchanges like Binance or Kucoin. Also, I believe that anyone using any exchange should always be looking out for updates so that they will not end up losing their asset. Just like the recent update about Binance warning investors to exchange their BUSD for other assets. If it's someone who doesn't frequently check for updates, that would really be an issue.

It doesn't matter how many times you send a particular address out to someone or how many times you copy it, whenever you want to copy again, copy directly from the wallet.
