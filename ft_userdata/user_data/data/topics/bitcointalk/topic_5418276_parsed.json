For me, it's not worth the investment anymore and I doubt they will be one who will dominate in the future because of the developers' closed ears while the old investors are shouting for a change. I made a profit by selling their coin at an early stage while the hype is on and not from the NFT pets.If there's a future Metaverse project I think Gala games will be the one on top of my list.You can pick your game genre by checking their website. https://app.gala.games/",

If I've got free money and I want to spend it, I'll choose to buy the AXS and will stake it on their katana since APY is quite high. I'm more aware of that token than the others. YGG is a guild token and that guild is focused on P2E projects I don't know if they've made their own game but probably haven't.While for Apecoin, it's from BAYC project and AFAIK, they've got some problems now against SEC.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on October 25, 2022, 11:54:51 AMAlso if you are ask to name your one to five play to earn with the metaverse project which ones will you pick?

Also if you are ask to name your one to five play to earn with the metaverse project which ones will you pick? The only coin worth holding on to for the long term is bitcoin. So forget to hold the coins for the long term but only for the short term and after the price increases very high, immediately sell the coins and focus on looking for others more worth holding again. I don't know any metaverse project that can make money for you because I prefer holding other coins like bitcoin, ethereum, bnb and others. And if you want to keep holding the metaverse coins, you better be careful because the metaverse is still in the development stage and we don't know what it will be.",

I pretty sure there are new games that will come to beat Axie.  I have not seen any game interesting enough to make people from bitcointalk will be interested. So far the ones being discussed was Sandbox and Gods unchained but they still look like a game for the board gamer. They can't just replicate a popular one similar to Counter Strike or any first shooting game with tokens to win after challenging.",

Axie infinity itself was just play to earn game that is nothing caused by high inflation that has destroyed its play to earn token called SLP. Metaverse are still experimental and don't you see even decentraland and sandbox have only a few users? In my opinion none of them will dominate the mateverse in the future but im sure about meta from facebook but not metaverse from crypto project",

We know that Sky Mavis \"the developer of axie infinity\" has a big problem before about SLP minting and I see that Axie Origin was the key on solving that. As far as I know they have released a sneakpeak of future burning mechanisms that can help the overflow of SLP in the market, They are releasing those burning mechanism slowly and now we can see it is effective. Axie still has a future and could shine next bull market, We will just need to wait for their developments.   We learn so much from play to earn games last bull market and I hope that we learned out lessons and not jump on a hype projects. There are a big chance that metaverse project can be a big thing in the future, I hope those newbies entering wouldn't jump on projects again because the hype.",

Game projects don't live long in terms of popularity, because the community is always looking for more profitable ways to make money on meta universes and p2e games. Axie Infinity was good last year, but tokenomics problems quickly destroyed its popularity. These coins are good to buy at the beginning of their journey and sell at the top of the hype. Don't be under the illusion that meta-universe and gaming projects will behave like bitcoin and rise in value over time. It won't.",

The hype was huge on this project and that's scary to think if something new comes out and becomes hype again.Most investors have learned the lesson that they shouldn't be hype anymore with these projects. Because if they're too popular and it's not maintained by the developers, it's going drop to its own pitfall.Imagine before a good axie can cost from $500-$1000, now, you can build a team for just $6.",

If I were you I will stay away from both play to earn tokens and metaverse coins, the play to earn model is flawed and there is no way around it, so while at the beginning if they generate enough hype the model could seem to be successful as time passes you can realize this is not the case and then the coin will crash and eventually disappear, and metaverse projects are even worse, even with all the resources of Meta this is a risky bet for them, so it is impossible for me to imagine a small project will beat Meta when it comes to the development of the metaverse.",
