  "content": "Conclusively, \"nothing more than sales transactions made Bitcoin fall recently.\" The crypto dropped from the high of above $25,200 to below $21,700 last week before managing to start a minor correction today, and this raised my curiosity about what happened. A lot of reasons might cause the traders' sentiment to be negative on the Crypto in the last 7 days as nothing so fundamental/economical was recently released to warrant such a fall.In a nutshell, the fear that the FED might still raise the Federal funds rate is part of the reasons the sentiment shifts to the negative side. Investors were smart to start the sales at a reasonable high of above $25,000, which includes positions liquidation. And as you might have noticed, Bitcoin is strongly correlated with the US stocks and equity markets, and almost the same principle applies to every risky asset class at the moment. Due to inflation, the FED has made its intentions known on rate hikes in 2022. It had raised the interest rate by 225bps already, yet another 125bps is still expected before the year ends. I believe speculators regard this more than some other factors at the moment, which slips Bitcoin into selling due to sales. Nevertheless, the year low of $17526.00 in June is still well protected, hope there won't be negative economic factors that will breach that level soon.Bitcoin will always bounce back, no doubt about that. But one should also be conscious of the economics and investors' sentiments around them for proper guidance in trading or holding it. This made me put this piece together. Mind you, this is my opinion, you might want to let me know yours constructively. Thanks!",

There's still the case bitcoin probably feel in some ways because some people got bored of holding it (because it was going sideways or because there hasn't been much news on it).Overall, I don't think we've yet broken away from the pattern the chart has been forming over tha past two months though (it's possible we could do but at the moment that looks to be quite a positive thing to take note of).",

Gold and silver weren't appreciating in value during eras of inflation concern, the way most expected them to. There were reports of COVID shutting down factories in china for weeks in 2020. Before the affects were finally felt in US stocks. Bitcoin price trends haven't made sense in awhile. Even commodities prices aren't making a ton of sense.The history of this dates back at least a decade. Back to coca cola complaining about aluminum prices affecting beverage can manufacturing. Aluminum suppliers were able to create artificial scarcity in markets by delaying shipments of alu. Which would in turn elevate the price. The opposite is also true. Artificial excess can be created by flooding markets. Since then speculation has become rampant. Bitcoin was ignored by speculators for a time. But once large institutional investors got in the game, things have definitely changed.",

Thanks!Well just to make things easier without the worries of short-term crashes and surges, it is always better to just invest for the long term.  This at least saves us the worries of all short-term what-ifs of bitcoin.  In honesty, knowing the market sentiment is exhausting since it changes from time to time with a small time interval.  Since we share the same opinion that Bitcoin will bounce back, once we had our Bitcoin I think there is no need to worry about the market sentiment since we already know that Bitcoin will bounce back if ever its price crashes.",

Thanks!I wonder if the recent announcement that the lead developer and one of the few people with access to the Bitcoin github account has announced their retirement is anything to do with it. It has to shake a little confidence because ultimately the people in charge of the development side can do a lot of damage if control was passed over to the wrong people. It seems inevitable that the crypto market will continue to fall as the rates go up, as you might find that a large portion of the money pumped into Bitcoin and altcoins was funded in large part by super low cost loans which governments around the world were trying to push to stimulate economic activity.",

Consciousness of the economics and the investors is needed to influence your trading decision, but IMO it shouldn't affect your decision to HODL. Hodling bitcoin is a choice and decision you have to make that you must realise will not be an easy ride, so you just have to really decide to or not to. Taking full consideration of the economist and the investors can slowly affect your strong resolve to hodl.",

No, I agree - it can be estimated in terms of spent energy, mining equipment, etc. But these are COSTS. Values, I'm talking about the real value for the market, economy, industry, for this product, at the moment - no!3. Blockchain technology is not the same as cryptocurrency. Blockchain is a TECHNOLOGY that has real applications and real value. Do not confuse cryptocurrency with blockchain technology!Considering 1 and 2, we come to a disappointing conclusion - this whole market is controlled speculation. There is no increase in real value, there are manipulations.",

Nonetheless, you should know that my point on this thread concludes that sales transactions made Bitcoin sell last week. This might start the selling, speculations would always be the aftermath that will make it slip into more bearish mode. In other words, sales and profit-taking activities could crash Bitcoin and speculators would detect this and react promptly. This would then aggravate the negative bias. I hope you understand.",

Speculation is normal here in crypto so all are used to that already.Why are contradicting yourself? You have carefully differentiated between sales transactions and sales talk, so why are you concluding that the speculation is not the reason why Bitcoin fell? See, many of you are just writing what you don't know. Both buy and sell transactions and speculations are the heart of the financial market, they can cause spikes or dives since they are what they use mainly for the market sentiments. And if speculation is normal as you indicated, can't it crash the market? So why contradicting yourself both in favour and against it in just one post?",
