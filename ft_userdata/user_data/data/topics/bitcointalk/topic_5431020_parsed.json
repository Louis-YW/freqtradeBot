Yes there is some escrow services existing but i think it would be better to create one that is much better and everybody Will trust this service.I figured that crypto can be perfect way to make it safe aswell and no third party distrubtion.I think i can work allmost 24/7 enough to make this thing to work.The more experinced and smarter guys here then i am could be the judge here over my idea.",

It's better for these establishments to just let their customers trust them and have their transactions agreed upon each other.Especially if the company or establishment has an office located in a certain area. The customers has to go first and let them have it checked first before thinking of paying the service or product they want to purchase. But if you really want to be into that service, just like the escrows in the forum, you need to built up trust and reputation.",

Aren't you the third party? Or do you want to create a DApp that will serve as an escrow service? Can you describe how it should function?No no people don't want really those difficult solutions and words like DAPPs.My idea: You want to sell something let's say u send by post to receiver so the buyer will transfer money to escrow If both sides agree all good i'll realese the funds.So i'll be doing like investigation over the deal probably art deal i could organize even experts to visit real life location and verify that the art work is real becouse it's huge problem there is so many fake ones.And If i do good Job my reputation will grow fast and people will know that whatever deal they have in their mind they can use my service.I see that the way that they could trust me with anything Even with some confidential type of deals.So one ESCROW that everybody knows you can always trust 100% hughly pro and confidential.In future any employers who been hired will need to sign the very strict contract so If they share info about deals or clients they get punishment.Once again you think it's not good idea ?",

I don't want to break the party, but the forum has quite a number of escrows with very good reputation, especially as they've handled huge number of bitcoins in the many years they're in the business.The main points of escrow are trust (ie reputation) and experience. At least on this forum, sorry, but you are too new to even discuss about trust.The only open point remains \"bringing customers\" for this escrow \"business\". But at least here, from what I know, the people offering escrow services are being contacted (privately) and they decide they can handle all that's needed to be escrow or pass.In your case (furniture), the problem can become very ugly. Let's say you are... somewhere in the world, preferably on an island with nice climate  and the furniture selling business went bad.You will have to get track of the furniture that may or may not exist, that may have been received or not by the other party (and hidden) and see who will get the money.What if the furniture has been delivered and the buyer doesn't admit it and the transport company doesn't give you any papers on that (you are not a law enforcement authority and have no warrant)? What you do?As Welsh said it very good: being escrow needs skill and experience. And your example for a \"job\" was something that I'd expect any sane crypto escrow avoid.So no trust and imho not enough experience. Hence I'd recommend you think this all over again, much better.",

I don't see how you could be trusted \"third party\" in this scenario; wouldn't that just make PayPal and banks the same sort of middleman again? This is exactly what crypto is trying to avoid. There are no middlemen; the buyer and seller interact directly with one another via a blockchain. It's actually much easier this way!",

What you think you know now, might just be garbage. Just don't be too hesitant to thrash it if need be.I've tried to pitch my tent on your wall of text but, its not making an all round sense expecally at the last line with the smart guys and you being the judge. About being an escrow, it seems you just know the word and perhaps have an idea of it but not certainly how it works. You don't just come up and want to be an escrow. The cryptocurrency is a field that functions based on trusts and blockchain verifications. Escorts must of all comes into play when a buyer and seller don't have trust in themselves hence, they sort out some trusted party to act in that regard and clearly, you don't just fit the bill.The first part of being an escrow is being trusted yourself. Find your path to being trusted and then, you could hope for escrow services.",

Why use Escrow services when sellers and buyers can see each other face to face. Even if online transactions occur, buyers can use the payment method if the goods are already at their doorstep by cash on delivery (COD).One of the advantages of the cash on delivery payment method is that it can minimize the buyer's losses, besides that COD can reduce the risk of the ordered goods not reaching the buyer's hands. For example, the seller is not convincing in selling his goods or there are indications of fraud.",
