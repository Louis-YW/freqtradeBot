Should I sell part of my BTC BTC for ERG? Big words for a $70M marketcap coin. I have nothing against Ergo, in fact i sort of like it, but calling it successor to bitcoin is a stretch. There has been several neat non ico try outs and sooner and later they die because devs have lives and actual work to do where they get paid. So development of hobbyist is a little different then paying for 24/7 job to develop.It isn't in the radar of nearly anyone. Maybe one reason is that it isn't offering any real competition to any other crypto out there. Charles had a thing for Ergo for a long time now, and i guess he sees something in it that he likes. Maybe it's the fact that it didn't need ICO, which has pros and cons. One of the main pros being that i don't think there's a change that it ever could be a declared as a security.",

I'm thinking risk-reward here. BTC is much safer than ERG, true, but this also means that potential rewards are lower. I think that I will just buy some ERG in the end and keep the BTC that I currently hold.For anyone who's interested: I've done a bit more research into ERG and what seems to me the most interesting possible catalyst for growth is that they are developing a bridge (currently live in beta), which is called RosenBridge, which enables sending and receiving coins and tokens between Ergo and any other blockchain with supporting multi-signature transactions or threshold signatures (e.g. BTC, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum etc.). What's nice is that the bridge is capable of serving as a hub for interoperability as it allows, for example to send and receive coins and tokens from ChainX to ChainY (e.g. from Cardano to Ethereum) using Ergo....",

I've only heard of normal bridges before, where we can send tokens between 2 different networks but one of the networks still has to come from the main network (eg BEP-20). Then, how can we send tokens using the Ergo network (ERG) but one of the destination or origin of the bridge is not from Ergo (ERG)? This is interesting, can you provide references regarding this interesting feature in Ergo, I'm interested in reading it further.",

In Ergo miners have advanced governance control, easy soft-forking; and the community even has some novel ideas for things like chain-agnostic decentralized mining pool infrastructure. (Lithos Protocol) You can even do things like FIMOs (Fair Initial Mining Offerings), where users can mine ergo native tokens, enabling tokens to launch with PoW-backing.Ergo's built everything from scratch with no VC funds, in a market polluted by them. It aims to make resilient P2P financial tooling available to all.",
