      "body": "your idea is quite good to build a website that focuses on selling coffee using crypto as the main payment method. but after looking at your website and trying to order, it seems you only accept payments via coinbase and within the us only? i think it will be quite difficult for you to run a business like this because not many people want to pay for crypto through their coinbase account and your reach is also in the us only. maybe putting more payment options and international shipping could be a good option.and there are still many parts that you need to put on your website, such as photos, real locations (if any), and videos, which explain the taste and appearance of the coffee you offer. so that potential buyers can be confident about the coffee you want to sell to them.",

I think people that have alot of crypto will like to order a coffe with crypto since there is already a history relating coffee and bitcoin. Meanwhile, your idea of business is best fit for people you know in person. I mean real people with real location. I might be posting from a lake in the Chad which is thousand miles away from you, so I might not be of a help to you and your business.Ask your neighbourhood what they really want and how they want it. It is from there that you can improve your services.",

      "body": "Is your products just a placeholder? The price and pictures are similar, and I don't understand what's the difference between each of them other than the names. Maybe the coffee is different, but it is hard to tell if you don't put it up front unless I'm not part of your market. As of now, it just looks like you use popular influencer names to create your products.I second the opinion that targeting the global market is quite a stretch for your product. Even if the local coffee market don't accept crypto, I don't think they will go out of their way to use your service just because you accept BTC, especially if the shipping cost, taxes, et comes into question.",

      "body": "1st: (Assume I'm your customer) the packaging design isn't attractive at all, I can't differentiate between the existing variants. How do I ensure that you sent me the variant I ordered?2nd: question, is your product licensed? Some consumers in certain parts of the world are sometimes very resistant to unlicensed products.3rd: I agree with several other opinions above. Consumers don't really care about payment methods, so you have to highlight product advantages on your website. Also, I'm not sure about the target consumers globally, coffee isn't a rare commodity in almost all countries. I think you should start intense marketing only in your town.",

      "body": "You've clearly got talent to exploit, your site is clean, well done, funny, original and creative, well done.  However, I agree with what was said above:-either you have to develop your idea, work on your products (I agree that unique packaging inspires distrust as a consumer)-If you're interested, you can find out more on the forum. I think you'd have everything to gain, and so would your customers. Replacing the banking system with another banking system with a BTC aroma is unfortunately not going to help the cause.-or perhaps to position yourself in a market that's less saturated?lol in Europe, a lot of ecologists describe coffee as a source of enormous pollution (rightly or wrongly, I don't care as I don't drink coffee), I can just imagine them sweating in front of their screens with the BTC + coffee combo!  In any case, I sincerely think you should keep trying to do something in this way, you seem to be talented but IMHO you may have just chosen the wrong project. Wish you all the best!",

And would be nice if you added more information about the company like the location.I feel the price is high, $20 for a coffee bag is high for my local market, i used to pay $4 here in the local store, and is a great coffee. Another recommendation is to add Paypal, i know is great to give the options for the users to pay in Bitcoin, but to add Paypal you only need to install a plugin and you will open your doors to the Paypal market which is huge.",

You need to use btcPaySERVER https://btcpayserver.org/ and then you will be able to easily accept and keep Bitcoin deposits, as I think that selling them would not be a smart idea. However, if you want to start from scratch and the project focuses only on I do not expect you to find activity in Bitcoin, especially if you consider it a main project and not a side project. The idea is nice and I hope you continue it, because it is good to find places to spend Bitcoin outside trading",

I don't think creating NFT is going to help with your project in one way or another. The community has a mixed feelings about it and I don't think it is a good way to tie your project with Bitcoin at all. If you want to monetize it further, you can offer other things such as merch or use payment system that don't cost a lot like what have been mentioned above. In short, there are other ways to interact more with the ecosystem other than printing NFT that has no value.",
