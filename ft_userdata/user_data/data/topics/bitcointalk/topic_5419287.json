So lets trust the timelineWell the crypto market reacted if I'm not mistaken, we went below the $1 trillion market cap.And still very volatile up to this day, it went as low as $20,0xx-$20,3xx. And so we are not out of the woods yet. And I'm not surprised if the price goes below that $20k support again. And with that, I don't think that we completely decouple with the rest of the traditional market even in the bear market.",

      "body": "Maybe, but the bitcoin price never reverted from bearish to bullish while the FED kept rising the interest rates and this bear market year is not that much different from the other, so if the script is followed we should see a sharp fall by the end of year/start of January that should be the bottom under normal circumstances. We even formed a descending triangle very similar to the one formed by the end of 2018,and its break down market the bottom of that cycle. This time we might see a fake-out to the upside first, though, because of the World Cup, like 2014 and in a lesser degree in 2018, I think because of people getting into bitcoin for bets.Also, when the btc price decoupled from the sp500 for bigger gains was when there was too much money in the market and people decided that traditional markets were boring and they could make more with cryptos. Now the money is going out of the risky investments.So far the bear market is going as expected, but by the start of the year one thing will happen for the first time: either the price will keep finding lower lows for more time than in the other bears markets or for the first time the bitcoin price will decouple from traditional markets while the FED interest rates keep rising and during a recession.It is going to be uncharted territory either way, but so far and I bet until January it will be business as usual in my opinion, with the exception of a possible bear market rally triggered by the world cup, more or less like the one since the $17600 local bottom, but it will be hard the price to break 25k and almost impossible to break the 30k, but the alts should shine IF it really happens.",

      "body": "There could be instance that it will decouple and then some that all markets works in unison.And so we couldn't conclude in the end, the thing with crypto is that it's open 24x7, so that alone is a big difference from all the other markets so that we can see some variance. But since the price is very volatile, and react to any negative or positive news, I would say that bitcoin mostly will decouple and then have it's own run at the price at compare to other markets wherein it might be experiencing a downturn.",

Depending on different effects, they will react differently, both are part of the world economy so they will be linked in some way. If overall, both are down since the crisis, that's a correlation.Quote from: Jating on November 03, 2022, 07:55:11 PMThere is no beginning of the bullish market, it's just a short lived pump to $20k. And cycle wise, we are still in the bear market. We are not even half way of the bitcoin halving which is the catalyst for a bull run.We've only been through a third of the bear market and rallies like this have happened a few times this year. Many people expect too much from a bull market, so just seeing bitcoin start to green a bit, they immediately think a bull market has arrived. But that's not a sign of a bull run, I would call it a trap. How the market will go up, when the crisis is still there and the catalyst is the halving event has not happened yet?",

Maybe this can be said as the beginning of the bullish.If the global crypto market cap is one trillion then what about the stocks and other markets? I think their market cap are more higher than that since they came here first and many people have a trust on them compare to crypto.Many people think that stock and other markets has a relation to crypto because this is what they observed before but now that they witnessed btc move on its own this time I think their beliefs now are slightly going to change. If only that small pump that we feel last time continue then maybe we can assume that the bull run is coming but since it didn't happened then most of our impression is back again to bearish.",

      "body": "It's really easy to explain. The majority of big corporations and hedge funds were here at 2 crucial levels. The first level was 60k. When we went above 60k they were hoping for a new high, but bitcoin did the unexpected and instead of going 10x like in 2013 after the first peak we barely went up. When we fell below 60 again they pressed the dump switch and you could see that giant slide from 57k all the way to 42 in one day.The second level they were watching was 30k because that was the area when bitcoin found support and went on another rally. When we fell to 26k they through everything out the window and we crashed to about 21k, but then the laggers (also called lagtards) came in and dumped it to 17k. Who are laggers? People who don't watch the price daily but are in for the short term. They check it once every day or once a few days and keep their money offline. They act like they're in for the long run, but usually they have their floor levels. Many of them bought at 30k, saw it go to 70 and decided to hold at least until 100k. When it suddenly went from 30 to 20 they got schocked, but had to get home, move their money to an exchange and it took them a day or two. That was this secondary ripple wave that pushed bitcoin below 20k.Now that the institutions sold above 20k, you could see that at 19k there was almost no volume. Only small fish hodlers and day traders were buying at these levels. These people usually don't have loans so they aren't affected by rate changes. Powell can huff and puff and they'll remain unaffected.I live in central Europe and we have our own problems here, but US FED doesn't bother me. I don't use USD and I don't have a loan, so I'm buying and holding now as I was doing in May or June.",
