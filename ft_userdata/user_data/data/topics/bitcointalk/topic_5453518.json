But I realised that the last statistics on the various number of post per month stopped on November 2017, any reason why? Also the most users online are brand new member's with no post is that normal?",

I think this is the reason too why the stats is not updated anymore because of multiple source available.https://ninjastic.space/Bitcointalk Merit Dashboard https://bpip.org/https://loyce.club/I think there’s more but the most common website being use to get data in the forum. Credits to the respective owner of the websites I mention.",

Maintaining forum stats after the merit system became difficult for the admins, hence user stats as well as most general forum stats were no longer updated. As posted above, there are forum users tracking some stats of members, you can check their websites to follow them.Quote from: She shining on May 21, 2023, 11:10:49 AMAlso the most users online are brand new member's with no post is that normal?Bot accounts.",

As a matter of (apparent) fact, part of the forum stats were disabled on or around 2017-12-13 (last reading). This thread from that precise date depicts a seemingly DDoS attack on the forum on that day, leading to some features on the forum being disabled. Part of the Forum Stats (not all, just those in the table \"Forum History\" of the Forum Stats) seem down since then.QuoteAlso the most users online are brand new member's with no post is that normal?Yes ... old post of mine:Quote from: DdmrDdmr on July 13, 2021, 07:41:28 AM<...>Quote from: LFC_Bitcoin on July 12, 2021, 09:22:37 PMI wonder how many of those accounts haven’t even made a single post <...>As to the number of accounts themselves, I haven’t got any recent data, but in July 2018, 72% of the accounts were brand new, meaning bot created, nuked, or simply created without posts. That fact is important to understand when we discuss the number of created accounts on the forum (active accounts are therefore way less).",
