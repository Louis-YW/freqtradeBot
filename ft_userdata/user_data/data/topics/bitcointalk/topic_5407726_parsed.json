      "body": "Affordable is ever changing. What a person 'A' can afford, it won't be possible for person 'B', their lifestyles, jobs, payments are all different therefore at the end of the day this can be used as a variable term. On the other hand Cheap precisely means that the market price is essentially lower than the market price of same things. Manufacturing plays a long role as well in that, items made in china are known to have a cheaper price around the world, items made from Germany are comparatively better Hands down, therefore it's more related to manufacturing and the price as well.",

Affordable signals to the customer that this is a good product, it was just made in a way that would lower the cost to the end consumer. I  reality, affirdable can also be poorly made.",

Cheap or affordable both would also depend on the capacity of the buyers as these terms can sometimes be used on those kinda expensive items like mobile phones. No matter how the advertisers say that the phone is cheap and affordable, there are still extremely poor people that can't afford to own one of those even on their lifetime. For them there are more important things that needs to be prioritized first like food. Indeed that marketers need to be careful on the terminologies that they are using as a small mistake can matter a lot to some of us and this could discourage us to patronize their products.",

The simple definition you said above is self-explanatory. That the term or slogan Affordable and Cheap is an attraction to label a price for goods that you can get at the price of goods in general in the market. But once again, this kind of slogan also does not fully reflect that the type of goods is really cheap to buy one type or in the form of a complete package.",

Even the 'cheap' varies from people to people, the same as the 'affordability'. In marketing techniques, these terms are important. These are attention grabbers and make people think about the fear of missing out. So it makes people urge to buy or sell before thinking.",

And they would adopt any strategy or terminology to convince you to buy their products. Sometimes most of these marketers are not well grounded in the English language, hence you would always experience misuse of some terminologies. A product is cheap when it is sold with little or no profit. Sometimes cheap products are sold below the cost price. One can also ascertain if the product is cheap when the price is compared to other competitive products. If the price is below the cost of alternatives, then it is cheap.Affordability is relative. It is based on the buying power of each individual. The rich would be able to afford more expensive products than the poor. To the poor, a product might be expensive because they cannot afford it, but the rich would gladly acquire them because it is affordable for them. It's always good to always go for products you can afford and not for cheap ones. In my locality, most cheap goods are either close to their expiration date or low quality.",

Not only goods, but the same can also be applied to services: providing cheap services often implies a low quality of outcome, and people who use those cheap services should expect that the end result may well be different from the desired one. Affordable, on the other hand, means that the price of a good or service not only should seem reasonable for everyone, including the poor, the middle-class, and the rich but should also be perfectly justified. An affordable good should be of high- quality, made of high- or at least medium-quality materials, and should have a reasonable lifespan, whereas an affordable service should bring a desired outcome to the customer.",

To a billionaire a yacht is affordable but to most people it is so expensive it is unattainable.  However cheap can be much more relatable to all people and used in similar contexts, like if the aforementioned two groups of people saw a 1oz gold bar going for $10 they would likely both say it is cheap - because that is a bargain price.",
