You cant wait for a candle closing if it wicks to your liquidation price before you can even think of closing the trade (on 2x lev as well on alts). And make sure you have a good source with you in hand for all the future news, becz no matter how well a TA based strategy is, news and fundamentals play a major role!.",

If he is trading constantly either in the spot or futures, that might not work well because this bear market is well affected by many outside factors like the government trying to fight inflation, war, and CBDC replacement for the cash.Some say this recession is not just causing this bear market to extend up to 2024. Trading strategies will not work well if the market is very much manipulated.",

Still, systems have been developed to take advantage of the market and profit from it, so some strategies are proven to work in some time, but the market still dictates what would happen.If we are talking about efficiency and constant use of strategy, I think the best way to do that is to use a trading bot like Gunbot to be consistent and manage the risk accordingly. In terms of the market, we need to adapt to what specific demands we are having now, so I think the best way with that is also to learn what different markets are there and what appropriate strategies are needed to put to work.",

All you need to do is buy low and wait until the price reach high then sell it.So the complications occurs when you do it more often and trying to reap more profits like 2x, 3x or x amount of returns in short time then you will be trying day trading and in natural the price of cryptocurrency is highly volatile and speculative so its impossible to find the price movements accurately so the consistent in making profits will never be possible.",

If you can analyze every market condition, you can enter the market at any time and determine when to buy and sell to make a profit.

By creating a rulebook, You can guarantee that your trading strategy will always follow on the format that works on your trading style rather than trade base on your feeling or thoughts alone since decision making can be affected by emotion so even if you have a good strategy but you have a weak feelings control then your decision will always vary to a inconsistent result.I guess you are suggesting that improve strategy base on what is working on current market condition but adjusting your own strategies will take time to to calibrate since market volatility is high and unpredictable. Having a fixed strategy is still the best and just rest in case the current market conditions doesn't fit to your current strategy.",

Because achieving efficient traders with successive profits is not an easy thing to achieve. There needs to be synchronization between your understanding and what you trade. Even reliable traders are not always in a profitable position, those who have mastered all types of trading often deviate from the profit target in the market. Therefore no trade is truly efficient without involving losses.",

Everything that matters in trading is pure luck and good knowledge. If you are able to make good calculations and estimations then definitely you will minimise the risk of losses. I know some strategies reduce the risk of losing, but thatâ€™s very rare. So yes in order to trade you have to give time to the market and analyse it correctly. At last invest that you can afford to lose. Hope this helps you OP.",

The only downside of it is that you won't also grow or gain anything. If you are the one that formulates your strategy then you will know its effectiveness. Having a strategy is better than trading randomly. That won't differ to gambling anymore.Yes, there is no such thing as 100 percent winning rate strategy.
