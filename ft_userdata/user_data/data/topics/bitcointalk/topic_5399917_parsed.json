  "content": "The crypto market isn't essentially or intrinsically affected by the situations of other financial markets. The reason it is being dragged along is that many investors trade on multiple markets (together with many other factors). They usually move assets here and there but sometimes, they scrape off multiple assets into their pockets all at once. Some of them treat their crypto assets as a lifejacket, which keeps them afloat when the rest of their assets are sinking. Dependence on crypto usually entails increased sell-offs.Just when we thought things are starting to quiet down and getting ready to swing back, the Federal Reserve announces that they will raise interest rates and tighten their monetary policy to combat inflation, landing another strong blow on the already beaten financial market. And we're likely to see more interest rate increases in the future until they bring inflation under control. One expert says that if economies don't hold up amid these hikes, Bitcoin's price might plunge further to about 70% of its current price, which is around $8000.But of course, the Fed is careful not to trigger a full-scale recession that will take years to reverse so they'll jack up rates slowly to allow economies to grow simultaneously. Aggressive hikes are out of the question. Raising interest rates helps slow down the economy. When the economy reaches a point tolerable for both consumers and providers, it will start increasing its pace again. This will hopefully prevent any unwanted trends in the crypto market.But like every bear market we've faced in the past, this situation is temporary. No matter how low Bitcoin's price goes from here, it will recover. That's because the only significant issue big investors have with Bitcoin and crypto, in general, is that they are, in the words of ECB chief Christine Lagarde, \"worth nothing.\" And this can be solved by creating an ecosystem where people get used to using cryptocurrencies for transactions and are confident they will hold their value, which can be achieved with additional technological advances. If there's one thing humans are good at, it's creating technological advances. And if there's one thing that won't slow down or stop from advancing anytime soon, it's technology. So we are heading that way no matter what.",

From then on, the price of bitcoin only dropped by about 25% for the next 8 months, reaching a low of just below $6k. Only around November did the price of bitcoin really tank, and this coincided with the splitting of bitcoin cash, which could have had its effects.Predicting a 70% drop in bitcoin as a result of this increase in interest rates, although the highest in a while, is still mere speculation, with no concrete correlation with the bitcoin market.",

Bitcoin price is still volatile, but not volatile if compared to the past time. Bitcoin all time high in 2017 was around $20000, it falled to around $4000 in 2019 and 2020 before making it up to around $69000 all-time-high in 2021. If the volatility is calculated to be around 5x before the last halving, it is less volatile than the past. The volatility should not be more than or up to that of last halving during this times.Quote from: BOAEDAN on May 24, 2022, 08:53:40 AMBasically, krypto is a risky asset that is classified as the most volatile compared to other assets such as gold and stocks, the price of bitcoin is also easy to influence the sentiment of its supporters, but even though the price of bitcoin drops like raindrops, I am very sure investors will take the opportunity to buy bitcoin when the price goes down, including myself will buy bitcoin, because I also believe the price of bitcoin will definitely increase someday.We should not compare the price of other cryptocurrencies to the price of bitcoin, altcoins are more volatile and riskier. Although, bitcoin can be more volatile than gold, but it reached all-time-high and that still also makes it a store of value in long term. About stock, bitcoin price is less volatile than many stocks.",
