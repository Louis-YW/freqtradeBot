  "content": "find duplicate words in text file online The invasion of Russia to Ukraine on Feb 24 looks to be the beginning of a 3rd world war neither of them bargained for and this action could cause a possible end to civilization. News had it that prior to the invasion, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping had a meeting together on Feb 4, the date coinciding with Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations and Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The product of this meeting was a 5000 word long carefully drafted document which seemed to announce the partnership between the two countries.Putin still believes that his actions towards Ukraine are not birthed by brutality, but a means to silence neo Nazi agitators. Meanwhile, it has occurred to Xi Jinping that his 'partner' has gone rogue and quickly pledged solidarity with French President, Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz in their peacemaking efforts. Now I'm curious to know, so I thought to ask; is there a solution the NATO can provide other than taking the option of fighting the war for Ukraine as this could escalate into a WW3 since negotiations can't cut it. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2022/03/15/commentary/world-commentary/world-war-iii-risk/",

It is obvious no amount of peaceful dialogue can tame Putin sorry for using that word but he does not care about the Civilians been killed due to his self-centered driven ambition. Should i say NATO remain calm it will result in more lives been lost if they take over the war it will result in heavy damages. And it is obvious sanctions aren't working either because many countries depend on them for oil and thus the can device means of fighting their economic disaster.  At this point is to hold on and patiently wait for the outcome of the French President, Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz in their peacemaking efforts.",

I think that the UN should take this matter more seriously, this cannot be allowed to continue because every day thousands of people die from this war",

The world getting to doomsday ?helping peace between Russia and Ukraine can be done by supporting the negotiations between the two countries through diplomacy in international forums.. there is no need to carry out unimportant lobbies and even support Ukraine with various high-class weapons which will worsen the current condition,, because no matter how many weapons NATO gives Ukraine, it will not be able to defeat Russia",

The world war 3 may come to us anything time soon and we have to be prepared for any effect from it. The way I am seeing it looking at the Russian and Ukrainian war that is causing serious inflation in the world right now. If the world war 3 come to us then their would be severe thread to food supply and inflation will increase.",
