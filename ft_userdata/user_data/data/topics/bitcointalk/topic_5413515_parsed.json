You can just download electrum and use it offline if you want, what web wallets can not do. I am not saying electrum is not an online wallet, but not being a web wallet make people to have a choice to also use it as a cold wallet if they know how and want to.",

Bitcoin was made for purely peer-to-peer transactions without a middleman. Not be mined by watching ads to get a sure reward. It's an excellent idea but probably not going to be possible. This was just a thought But in essence, I think it would be hard, and it can be compromised. Maybe a hot wallet of some sort.",

Some people did not want to install web browser extensions because it is very risky to use, --but why you are looking for a browser extension instead of a trusted software that you can download of course --you can verify the legitimacy through GPG signatures.",

MetaMask happens to be lucky that it has a strong commuity that not only maintains it but actively publishes a phishing list, phishing warnings and so on. But most other wallets do not have this kind of luxury, to have devs who are also sentries.In the Chrome Web Store there are so many fake copies of legitimate wallets which swipe your coins if you enter your password. Also there are malicious extensions that imitate real extensions but do not look like wallets - these also steal coins.",

Not to mention that there were already safer options available that people were able to use. I think if you were to compare, Metamask was probably made for people new to the scene, testing stuff around kind of thing, while better wallets are for people who are pretty experienced and are holding a pretty good amount of coins in their wallet.",

I guess 10 seconds of downloading a wallet is too much work for them. Or perhaps if something happens they want to have someone to blame other than themselves? Of course nobody will be there to help them, so I guess its the illusion of customer service that they prefer? Electrum is the best wallet so far, in my thinking.And of course its decentralized, like every other wallet. So making a web version would not make sense anyway. If you have internet, you can download the wallet. Just hope that the site you download from has not been compromised.",

If there were people asking / talking about it more people would be writing them and we would be discussing them.I would not really want to use one for real amounts of money, but for keeping small amounts, under $25 or so, it might not be the worst. If you are only using 1 PC and occasionally want to get something with BTC having a high risk, vulnerable hot wallet with that amount give or take could be handy. No going for the HW wallet, or anything else. Obviously everyone would have their own amount of BTC they would be willing to risk.-Dave",

So wallets like Metamask is not really safe. This is good for micro transactions but if you are holding a good amount of money in your Metamask wallet, it is not really recommend! Probably that's the reason no developer has yet created a secured browser extension like Metamask. It is always best to use a desktop or hardware wallet if you are holding some good amount of bitcoins. Electrum is quite good and used by a lot of fellow forum members.",
