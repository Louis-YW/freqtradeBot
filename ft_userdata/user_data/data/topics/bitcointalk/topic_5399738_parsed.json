I don't know where you get your \"topics\" from, but something looks very wrong in that \"world\" of yours.Monkeypox is nowhere near the first waves of COVID; monkeypox doesn't have the potential for lock downs and more drama.Even more, one has to have very badly broken inner compass if he wants to see his money grow, no matter if people around him are dying.Plus, you are newbie, so I will not be as harsh as you'd deserve (maybe I'm also in a good mood because of Pizza Day), so I'll just say that Bitcoin price goes up and down with or without worldwide problems. If there will be drama on monkeypox, sooner or latter it won't matter for bitcoin price.",

If we do have shutdowns again it might be due to some covid variant instead of the monkey pox.Either way. I don’t think any stimulus will come. If there is more stimulus then we will be in a nasty inflation period for years to come. I don’t think the fed wants that.",

I don't think there's another stimulus that would wreck the economy again. I doubt it would create something like COVID did, but it's not a competition. We should still be cautious with our health and standards with it.Unless the WHO does something about it, the market will crash but recover, just like what happened with COVID.",

We've been on that horrendous situation where lockdowns and quarantines do happen which did really took 2 years of our lives and now we do have this new monkeypox?Seems like it does turn out for this situation to become more worst as we do go ahead on future years upcoming.In speaking with market conditions then im not really that a fanon attaching news and fundamentals but eventually it could really give out some effect but basing on experience it could really go to opposite way or simply talks aboutno correlation from time to time.",
