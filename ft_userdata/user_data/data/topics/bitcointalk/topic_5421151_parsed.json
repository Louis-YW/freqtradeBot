  "content": "CargoX Token (CXO) is a Utility Token that powers the document transfer for the CargoX Company!Originally the token is ERC-20 on the Ethereum Blockchain, but the high fees pushed the team to use the Polygon Chain for the document transfers.Since 2021 CargoX is the official partner for a minimum 5-year period to handle all the imported sea freight documents for Egypt! In January 2023 the air-freightin Egypt is also integrated into this solution. In short, the tokenomics are:For every document CargoX handles to the Blockchain CargoX will get 3.00 USD from the document uploader. The Company buys 0.60 USD worth of CXO Tokens fromthe open market to enable them to upload this document on the polygon blockchain.The document gets \"published\" via Relayers(it's like a staker/node provider) who are in charge to publish the documents for the CargoX Clients. In the process of relaying the document the relayers get CXO worth 0.30 USD and 0.30 USD worth of CXO is burnt for eternity. Over the years this will lead to a fast-shrinking token supply!What should I know if I want to run a Relayer?The reward for publishing the document to the Blockchain, will be 0.30 USD worth of CXO Token, if your reward account holds 250.000 CXO token. If your account holds less you will get less reward. The Relayer covers the Matic fees, so it is highly recommended to run a Relayer with more then 100.000 CXO token to get the fees back for the relaying to the Polygon Blockchain.Many people will tell you that the communication of the Company is really bad, and it is true to some degree! The focus of CargoX is not the Token. You will not get much marketing in the crypto world from the Company, but you get a Company that is trying to digitalize a whole industry. Going from paper to paperless is a huge project and for me personally, I like these abroach more than if they are just strong in crypto.What is the potential?Many Countries like UK and India are working to integrate electronic trade documents into the legal framework. Right now, CargoX handles only documents for the Egypt government and some pilot transfers. The vision is here in 10 years to handle a big chunk of the world's trading documents - they are millions of millions of documents every year! It is one of the most important parts of our global trading companies.Good sources for the Community are:- Telegram(Unofficial Channel): https://t.me/cargoxcomments- Telegram(Relayer Channel): https://t.me/CargoXRelayers- Discord(Unoffical Channel): https://discord.gg/2nYA2rvYSome Infos on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCefJ9pq_jf8bwjLk7vEjbiAHow to buy: https://www.reddit.com/r/CargoXio/comments/uc5i9e/how_to_buy_and_sell_after_kucoin_delisting/Tokentrackers(How many documents are created per day) :- https://cargox.els-aplikacije.si/- http://www.cargox.watch/charts#indexPools for Relayers(Run by Community Members):Poor MillionairePool URL: https://cargoxpool.els-aplikacije.siPool Telegram Group: https://t.me/elscargoxpoolchatBeastlyPool URL: https://relayer.moePool Telegram Group: https://t.me/cxo_relayer_pool",
