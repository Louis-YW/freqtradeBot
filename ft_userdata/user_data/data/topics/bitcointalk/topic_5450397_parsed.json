From what I have read through here seems you had a dispute with the betnomi casino which did not go down well with you all I believe that was the reason you called them cheat. Anyways everyone here is entitled to his or her own opinion and I can not do or say otherwise.I actually do not get much clues about your questions but I would suggest you look at stake casino and see if you could get the answer to your question or you do a research for it.",

It's about who offer VAR.I did not have any idea that VAR could be a good betting market too. In fact, card market, foul market (hope it exists too) are also easy to manipulate. The referee team team can have a good contact with a gambling agent and manipulate it easily. The results of these kind of events do not make much impact in the match (Not all the time)",

Well, not familiar with other site but if you are not comfortable anymore with Betnomi then its good to look for other options. Sportsbook seems a problem to you as well based on your trust rating.

It's not always good to spread FUD about Casino's and Sportsbook without any proof and being punished in accordance to the company's T&C when you fault it doesn't make them cheaters.You got tag for such, it wouldn't be nice should you continue in that step, at least avoid and hope to clear your name.If there are any Sportsbook that offers VAR market, there isn't any that I have seen neither do I think there are any out there, locally and otherwise. How would they even spell that out?Focused on the nature of event; Goal, Offside, Penalty etc. Somehow, there is always a VAR review in every match and I don't think the Sportsbook would like to go on that. The odds won't be attractive as well.",

Where do crypto sportsbooks come into play here? You are correct. VAR is a technology that has been implemented in football matches to assist referees with decision-making on the field. It is not directly related to sportsbooks or sports betting. However, some bookmakers offer betting options related to VAR in football matches. For example, they may offer odds on the number of VAR decisions that will be made in a match, or the likelihood of a decision being overturned after a VAR review.

If you know your teams and referees well, you can take advantage of these betting markets to make smart wagers. It's like any other sports betting - with VAR-related options, you'll need to weigh the odds and make your predictions based on the info you have.",
