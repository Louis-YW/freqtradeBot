There are many times that such have been manipulated to fraudulently enrich some sectional people, we have to be careful about what we hold at any point in time.According to Coinbase, the all-time high of USDT is $1.22, while its all-time low is $0.572521 according to CoinGecko. While the all-time highs and lows of USDC are $1.19 and $0.891848 respectively according to Coindesk.This means that anything could still happen within these ranges and even achieve another record.",

The reserve that's stuck in SVB represents about 8% of USDC reserves. That's why USDC lost its peg, currently trading at 0.94 against USDT.",

      "body": "The more stable coins are listed as trading pairs on the exchange, the greater the liquidity. Eventually, a market will begin to form where the value of one stable coin equals one US dollar (USD). However, there are still a number of hurdles to be overcome before this can happen. For example, most crypto exchanges do not buy coins for the full value of their trading pairs.Overall, the crypto market is slowly gaining ground again. However, the dangers of USDC and TUSD are still growing. In general, traders are becoming more aware of the issue so we can expect increased volatility in the coming days. However if Bitmex changes the USDC:USD price equation it could become even more volatile.I remain negative on stablecoins because I believe the whole idea is flawed because of their adherence to fiat. Until cryptocurrencies are fully compliant without regulation or escrow, it will not be widely accepted by the market.",
