  "content": "I am not sure if this was already posted but it will give especially the newbies some idea on how bitcoin grown in over time, and how it looked like before. So, based on the image below it was the last prizes for the participants of Starcraft tournament from fifth to eight place got 25 bitcoins each. The tournament held in 2011 where the price of bitcoin was still low where it's like from $0.3 to $3.For context: Tournament's Last-Place Bitcoin Prize Could've Made Starcraft Losers Millionaires. I wonder if any of those players that have won bitcoin kept a few or if there's a source where they've given statements on how they've kept or spent it after wards. If you'll ask me, even I, I might sell those if I saw it went up to $50 or $100 earlier in those years.I'll be just giving the estimates for the last ATH and in today's time but we can conclude that most of them were sold already too early.25 bitcoins * $69,000 = $1,725,00025 bitcoins * $24,500 = $612,500Right now, we usually see prizes coming from crypto casinos and I rarely see it become a prize to any tournament whether it's an actual physical sports or e-sports.Link to another the same and interesting story of getting paid bitcoin earlier(2013): A painter received $50 worth of bitcoin on June 2013.",

I agree with what you said though that maybe the ones who got those Bitcoins aren't involved in cryptocurrency at all, and just focused on games.",

In that year, blockchain and cryptocurrency was smaller than now and Bitcoin is like a shit coin in eyes of the crowd. I am sure if you had sent bitcoins to someone in 2011, most of they would have either not cared about it or sold it instantly to get a few bucks.I am so sure that if I receive 25 BTC in 2011, I would not care to save it, its private key and likely I lost it in the air too.

Bitcoin was once treated as a cheap digital innovation. The demand was not strong. Only a few people knew about it and were willing to buy with a good price. So it was assigned as a last prize. It was even given away. In fact many Bitcoins were forgotten for not having enough worth. If we look at how Bitcoin grew from a prize for the last placers to worth tens of thousands, it was so quick.

This is even greater information for posting the actual thread of the said tournament and having them named, those players that have been in that placed.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on February 20, 2023, 10:24:09 AMAs a matter of fact, many people have been placed with this early days opportunities having bitcoin that could have amount millions of dollars by now, but the question is, even at this present days, people investing or earning bitcoin now may not all wait till after about years to past before they sell them out, which means people hodl and once they realizes little from their investment, they sell out, an average investor will only buy and hodl within the period of four years but it's rare to have someone holding for two halving to occur which is about eight years then sell, it would have turn a huge amount indeed.No doubt on that, we even got the faucets that have distributed 5 bitcoins for the early claimants. The value wasn't a lot during that time but yeah, that's it. These earliest days for bitcoin and people who have known it have given the opportunity. But if we look at that opportunity, majority of them wouldn't have thought of keeping it. Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on February 20, 2023, 10:24:09 AMSome sell because of fear whenever it's going dip, while some sell whenever it got a new ATH, but the fact is people still don't hold for that too long, they sell and buy again and the process continues,if you had bought at $30 and sell at $100 then i think you have realized something good, but after then, it may went down and still surge high to about $230 for instance after like 7 years, you may now be also saying, you would have hodl all these while, but getting in is never too late for bitcoin investors begin it will always have value.I don't think it's about the market's up and down but it's more of about uncertainty that since it's the early time for bitcoin. No one is expecting it to grow as much as it is right now. So, as long as it has a value and price to be sold, I'd definitely sell it. It's not about being naive or unbelieving but it's about the reality on those times.Quote from: worle1bm on February 20, 2023, 01:26:15 PMThis is very old one and some users have posted about it earlier also but we can't regret or keep saying that it was lucky time for them if they have received btc as winning even on the last position also but we don't know if any of them stored their coins or sold them with few dollars only so maybe it was normal for them.Like we have faucets giving away 5 btc so if we were aware at that time and still hold it we would have been at different level.But still we can go to some profitable situation if we hold it long term.And we really can't say if all of them have held for a long time, it's really likely that they've sold just as after they've received the 25 bitcoins.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on February 20, 2023, 01:55:30 PMOh yeah, the Starcraft tournament...

But knowing that they're gamers, I myself is a gamer and don't really think of matters like this. Those gamers might be younger back then and all they want to have is to play and never think of investments or assets like bitcoin just as they've received them. And as for those people that have completely forgotten their wallets and still wrote back then their seeds, they probably never expected it to grow in today's time or even for the past years.Quote from: kotajikikox on February 21, 2023, 12:16:07 AMHow I wonder what would be my life if I find this tournament that time and participated and become last place  what would be the feeling of that least winner if he find the value of Bitcoin today considering if he forgot the bitcoin and just recover it today.this would be the biggest prize ever given if being held today in a single tournament ._______________________________25 bitcoins , lol even if its 1 bitcoin is more than enough to take home today .Just like with what I am saying, you're likely to sell those on that particular time. Nobody knows what will be the future would like for bitcoin. Yeah, 1 bitcoin is more than enough today and how much more for 25 bitcoins but that's back then and the value was lesser and only about two digits.Quote from: Cantsay on February 21, 2023, 12:30:19 AMIt's unlikely that they kept their coins theg must have sold as soon as the price rose.

Nobody cares on how to keep their private keys but salute to those that have kept them for more than a decade and bought it wisely before it's grown a lot. We even sold on $1k, $10k, $20k not knowing that by 2021 bitcoin would reach another milestone and ATH of $69k.Quote from: Pandji02 on February 21, 2023, 02:57:31 AMYeah, I remember that.

The same as the other contests held in the forum where a lot of bitcoins were given away and just as I've said with these receivers of 25 bitcoins, no one has ever thought on how quick the phasing and growth will be. Quote from: Fundamentals Of on February 21, 2023, 08:47:45 AMI have already seen this. I think not here but on social media. The point is very clear. It is the growth of Bitcoin through the years. Bitcoin was once treated as a cheap digital innovation. The demand was not strong. Only a few people knew about it and were willing to buy with a good price. So it was assigned as a last prize. It was even given away. In fact many Bitcoins were forgotten for not having enough worth. If we look at how Bitcoin grew from a prize for the last placers to worth tens of thousands, it was so quick. There must really be something in Bitcoin.It was even thought and said for many times as a scam currency. That's why many have heard of it as much as the early adopters but never obliged because they've heard and followed the rumors that tend to spread negative vibes so, they've missed the opportunity of their lifetime.Quote from: kryptqnick on February 21, 2023, 10:47:56 AMI didn't know about Bitcoin back then, and I haven't heard this story, so thanks for sharing it. Of course, very few people could imagine where Bitcoin would end up in a matter of several years, but it's cool that someone tried giving BTC away as prizes, even if it was for the last prizes. It might be among the very early cases of using Bitcoin. But like the op and some others, I don't think I would have had the patience not to sell the minute it starts costing something measurable.You're welcome, this is just one of the many old but gold stories in the community. Props to the organizer or donator who have given it as a prize as I think he's got one goal for that time and that is to give some exposure for bitcoin. And many in our community today is doing it so that many people that are still not aware of bitcoin will have an idea to search for more information about it.",

      "body": "Players at that time were likely not interested in BTC but given this is 2011, they were probably using the paper wallet to award the prize of 25BTC each. It was $41 If they still have them in 2017, they will be scrambling to find those paper wallets inside thier drawers. In 2011, I think there are only a few exchanges and one could be GOX, so if it's on GOX then they probably sold or lost the BTC already.",

      "body": "Not only them, but anyone in their situation who is given 25 bitcoins as a reward will spend it right away. Even if they intended to keep it, when the price must have risen in two years, they will sell it quickly. This is just one example of how bitcoin has grown in the last decade. Bitcoin enthusiasts are confident that it will grow even more in the coming years. This news should serve as a guide to learning how to hold for a long time, but it will only be applicable to the bitcoin community's optimists and courageous members. Those who do not believe in bitcoin development will still sell everything and prefer to keep their money in fiat if they are paid in bitcoin today.",
