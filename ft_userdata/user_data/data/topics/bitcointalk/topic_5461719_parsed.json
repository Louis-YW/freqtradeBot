Lesser supply that's it. Just as the counter part of it should be more demand. We don't know yet if this is going to cause more demand for it. But much likely it won't.",

I'm even shocked that it was able to stay in the top 100 for this long when the LTC founder gave up on the project years ago. I think everyone just hoped that since Bitcoin has the halving event as a major cue for the Bitcoin price to grow. Somehow people wanted the same for LTC.Binance Fud earlier today made it more difficult for LTC halving to have an effect on the price.",

So, do we expect some positive response from the LTC halving? If yes, to what extent can this impact on the general market condition? There's going to be some change, just that it differs from what you expect. It wouldn't make big waves compared to the XRP SEC case (that's a different thing altogether really) or like BTC's halving since they're on quite a different scale. In the first place, if you look at the past halving LTC had, there wasn't really much in terms of price movement. It went up a bit, but that's about it. It even went down a few months afterward really. And iirc, it pumped up during the start of pandemic, aka when new investors were coming in, hence you can't really say the halving would be able to do anything to pump it. At most, a few percent increase in a few days or maybe about a week. Then we'd see regular levels after that.",

Until Bitcoin and other markets also pick up the bull market tenacity that is when you have a general bull market,  so those holding litecoin have to hold for a the and wait for the market to pick.",

So, do we expect some positive response from the LTC halving? If yes, to what extent can this impact on the general market condition? Expect the unexpected because not all the time halving event would really be meaning out that there would be some pumps because there are moments on which it doesnt really give out any impact at all when it comes to price and this is why you should anticipate whether it would be making out some pumps or not. So better not to make yourself that too optimistic because it could neither happen or not.Therefore, on the time that you would be making out some buy positions then it would really be something risky to take but knowing the reputation and popularity of LTC which is one of the most oldest coins in the market but still kicking on present times then cant really be denied that demand and recognition is still there. It  would really be vary if these things would spiked out on the time that halving would happen.Unlike on Bitcoin though which everyone is really that been focused or really interested into.In overall, when bull run kicks in then LTC and most coins in the market would really be having that pumping period or moment but of course it would really be just that selective.Some would fly out and some would really be left behind and this is why it would really be that recommendable that you should be wise on taking up some investment decisions.",

I bought LTC with the expectation to rise a month ago and now I'm in loss. Watching the charts, what I realized is whales bought off LTC up from $40 to $90 and than the news about LTC halving got its pace. I know it's a publicly available info but not everyone just keep looking for what is going to halve in the next 6 months. People also say that it takes 6 months after halving for the price rise to be visible and I'm too keeping my LTC and hoping for the best.",

So, do we expect some positive response from the LTC halving? If yes, to what extent can this impact on the general market condition? What should we expect from the halving? Nothing. All I see is hype all across the crypto/Blockchain space. Prices will rise albeit for a short period of time. For Litecoin to become a valuable cryptocurrency, it's going to need to do a lot more than just cut its reward in half. It needs innovation. Something that would attract the masses and keep them from moving away to competing blockchain networks. Between BTC and LTC, the only difference is the supply, the PoW algorithm, block time, and the Mimblewimble privacy protocol. Perhaps, adding smart contracts functionality to LTC would make it rise all the way towards the top 5 ranks in market cap. After all, investors are deeply interested in all things \"De-Fi\" (NFTs, smart contracts, tokens, etc.). No one can predict the future, so lets hope for the best. Just my opinion",

Just mentioned this in another thread but litecoin halving does literally nothing in terms of momentum building for any market.  It's price movement is directly in line with what the overall market is doing.  The only coin to drive markets is and always was bitcoin.  Once bitcoin moves one way or another everything else follows.  It's not hard to see the cycles.",

This is not a Bitcoin halving anyway so expect less in the short term but if you’re a long term hodler, then this halving can be a big update for you. I also have LTC in preparation for the next bull run, actually many investors are looking forward to the bull market and not just on the halving, better to think for long term effect of this one and expect nothing for this year.",

But the project don't have much development going for it. According to the official Litecoin repository 1. the last update to core functionalities of the network were made years ago. Litecoin was a big deal back in it's early years but majority of the people that pushed it's narrative like Lee who was the founder sold off their bags. Right now, it's just \"there\". I had expected the price to make some positive moves but turns out, no one is feeling litecoin right now or maybe all preparations are geared for Bitcoin's halving event instead.
