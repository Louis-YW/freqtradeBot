      "body": "I do little graphic designs myself, mostly related to my main service offered dito sa forum which is Bounty Management. Most of my clients are Foreigners.Here are few of my insights.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM1. How do you talk to clients online? You mean in what manner? Politely syempre. I usually ask them what they want in terms of the overall designs and when they say na ako na bahala. That's the time that I work on what I can make to please them.Once the initial draft is completed, I send it to them for approval, and once approved, ipa-finalize na. Most communication is done either through e-mail or telegram (bibihira 'lang through discord/whatsapp).Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM2. Do you sign papers for online clients? or wala po? if wala whats the scenario or anong ganap na dapat professionally ?Mostly, no. But there are also instances that you'll be asked to sign some papers, send in invoice, iba nga may pa NDA pa. hahaIf walang required papers, you just ask for their final confirmation that you have the green light to start making the designs. Don't ever offer to make a design without proper confirmations, baka masayang 'lang oras mo.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM3. If you are hired by a design firm what the process is? do you have papers to sign from the design firm? What's my move as a hired graphics designer?Haven't experience this before so wala akong maisagot. Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM4. Do you ask for a downpayment?Yes. Mostly 50% of either your overall rate or weekly rate (weekly sakin, for bounty management). Just to seal the deal.There will be times that clients will even send full payment upfront especially when they are in a hurry to launch something or just purely trust you based on your rep.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AMAno po young mapapayo niyo sakin and mga things and dapat kong alamin na hindi ko po na ask?Always have patience when dealing with clients as some of them will be very keen on what they want the designs to look like. May clients na pinapa-ulit-ulit yung designs hanggat 'di nila nakukuha yung gusto nila so be ready for that.",

How do you talk to clients online? Noong nagsimula ako, Telegram ang ginamit ko pero I quickly learned na they can easily cover their tracks kaya I switched to this forum [you can use any platform that doesn't give involved parties an ability to alter the situation].Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM4. Do you ask for a downpayment?If you're just starting out and you want everything to be done in a professional manner, you have to go through the escrow route but once you make a name for yourself, you can go down that path [asking for a down payment of some kind].Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AMAno po young mapapayo niyo sakin and mga things and dapat kong alamin na hindi ko po na ask?Learn to say NO [don't sell your soul]!Don't offer an unlimited number of revisions [not worth the trouble]!",

Do you ask for a downpayment?Hindi ako graphics designer/artist pero may mga task akong ginawa na easy lang at related sa graphics. As in wala akong alam pero tinuruan ako ng naging short time client ko. Hindi ako nag ask ng downpayment pero siguro swinerte lang din kasi fully paid agad ang ginawa na kahit na random person lang ako sa internet eh nagtiwala agad siya.Pero mostly sa freelancing communities, mahalaga yan sa side mo bilang isang graphics artist, mag ask ka lagi ng payment upfront o downpayment at least 50% tapos yung next 50% ay pag natapos mo na yung pinapagawa. Lagi mo lalagyan ng watermark para sure ka pa rin na hindi mapapakinabangan kapag nabulilyaso ka at hindi ka binayaran.",

      "body": "Foreigner client ko specifically Indian. Part time graphic designer ako since student pa lang din ako and mostly yung company nag ooutsource ng client for us. Kapag meron ng client, ipapakiusap sa department namin kung ano yung specific design na kailangan mostly for ICO or NFT marketing and advertisement purposes.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM3. If you are hired by a design firm what the process is? do you have papers to sign from the design firm? What's my move as a hired graphics designer?Sa case ko walang paper na need kasi company ko pa rin naman nagpapasahod sa akin, 'di ko lang sure sa mga freelancers.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM4. Do you ask for a downpayment?Kung nasa company ka like me walang ganon, pero kung freelancer ka, dapat as much as possible meron para may accountability for both parties. Pwedeng non-refundable 50% up front payment tapos may certain number lang na revisions, extra fee kapag naman lumagpas na. Learned it the hard way kasi dapat in the first place articulate na sila sa kung ano yung ipapa-design nila sayo, that way maiiwasan yung maraming revision na akala sobrang daling gumawa.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AMAno po young mapapayo niyo sakin and mga things and dapat kong alamin na hindi ko po na ask?Since tatanggap ka ng BTC or any crypto, dapat alam mo na pasikot-sikot ng mga wallet and exchanges. Basic wallet handling pagdating sa security is a must. Kung may budget, buy yourself a hardware wallet preferably Ledger or Trezor so you can save yourself from headaches. Also, remember na sobrang volatile ng crypto in general, so kung diyan ka kukuha ng pambayad sa cost of living mo better have options for receiving USDT or any other reputable stablecoin.More importantly, 'wag mo gamiting wallet ang exchange LOL.",

Portfolio is really a huge plus para ma-impress ang client.If mag s-start na kayo ng deal give all your conditions if ano ang chargeable/non-chargeable revisions para mid-way walang misunderstanding which might portray a bad image sa service mo.Quote2. Do you sign papers for online clients? or wala po? if wala whats the scenario or anong ganap na dapat professionally ?No, just provide quotation of the details they'll provide and if both parties agree sa quotation, next step is the agreement of the project this include payment, major revisions with fee, cancellation fee, compensation, etc.Quote3. If you are hired by a design firm what the process is? do you have papers to sign from the design firm? What's my move as a hired graphics designer?Ask their conditions/agreement, make sure you understand it very well since para kang magiging employer. Then decide once you read all the agreements if it'll okay on your end.Quote4. Do you ask for a downpayment?Yes always, especially if hindi trusted member ng forum. I always do 50%(mandatory) or 100%(optional) as payment  if they are comfortable.EDIT: 50%/100% upfront na ilalagay sa escrow.",

How do you talk to clients online?When it comes to talking with your clients online you should be professional and courteous at all times. Listen to the client's concern and address them in a constructive manner. You can use tools to talk with your clients like video conferencing and screen sharing to have a better communication, be transparent and honest. Also provide regular updates your progress.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM2. Do you sign papers for online clients? or wala po? if wala whats the scenario or anong ganap na dapat professionally ?There is no such thing like online signing of papers specially here. Just communicate and if you come up with a deal then that's it, but before going to a deal you must give your conditions if you any.I'll pass no. 3 since like I said don't have experience with that.Quote from: Jaycee99 on December 30, 2022, 06:33:37 AM4. Do you ask for a downpayment?Downpayment is a must for me. You can have at least 30%-50% of downpayment. Don't offer you services for free, they may not continue on your agreement at least with downpayment your service will be paid somehow even if they don't proceed.",

You can ask people you personally know kung meron silang kakilala na kailangan ng graphic designer.Pwedeng mas mababa sa market rate yung offer mo since less experience pa pero, gaya ng sinabi ni @cydrix, never do it for free. While free service looks advantageous, baka isipin ng client/s na hindi ka bilib sa sarili mong gawa/kakayahan kaya pinapamigay mo na lang.",

Doon palang ekis kana pwede na agad mag hanap ng new graphic designer si client kasi mag mumukha kang mukhang pera. If nag dadalawang isip ka, then make sure na gumawa ka muna ng background review para dagdag lakas ng loob lng. For me ang mapapayo ko lng is focus on value and not sa money. Wag mo munang isipin yung papasok na pera sayo, isipin mo muna yung value na mabibigay mo kay client kasi once na na appreciate ni client yan, mag tutuloy tuloy na yan then money will follow na. Pwede ka niya irecommend sa mga kakilala niya na kung saan pwede kang mag karoon ng iba pang mga clients.",

My previous client only required me to sign NDA form since at that time, 'yung concept ng kanilang project is new, like the very first sa crypto-industry, so understandable naman na ayaw nila ma leak 'yung info and other sensitive data prior to the launch. I think that's mostly what NDAs are for, keeping things in secret para maiwasang masilip ng potential competitors. I don't think it has something to do with your salary/payment, ibang usapan 'yun.",

Since you are a graphic designer, mag bigay ka ng portfolio mo. You have to convince other people that you are the best graphic designer. You have to look for ways na makakapag separate sayo ang isang normal na graphics designer kaya dapat meron kang unique skill na hahanapin nila;Second, if wala ka pang portfolio, then you may consider doing your services at a discounted rate to increase your trust and/or experience on this field. Remember na madami kang kalaban din dito kaya if you need the funds badly, consider mo din gawin ito; andLast, always be courteous and polite in dealing with clients. Minsan, ito yung deal-breaker sa mga clients if nahihirapan silang kausapin yung kanilang potentially na hinahanap. Be straight and be professional in talking to them kasi minsan, sila din mag rerecommend sa mga kaibigan nila papunta sayo.",
