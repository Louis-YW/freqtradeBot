But this was rescinded for bitcoin because of the loan El Salvador wanted from IMF. I saw it absurd but I think El Salvador got no option as they need the loan would be what that caused them to do it.But it is also important to know that bitcoin is still a means of payment in El Salvador which can still be kind of regarded as legal tender. Just that merchants may decide not to accept it anymore. IMF are stupid and they have their own selfish reasons. Because in El Salvador, merchants must accept bitcoin if anyone wants to pay them in bitcoin, but the system is in a way that they can immediately choose USD in a way that the bitcoin can immediately be converted to USD and this will be done in just few seconds. In short , it is indirectly before in El Salvador that the payer can pay in bitcoin but the merchant accept USD. What is IMF problem?Quote from: BADERO on February 01, 2025, 09:53:37 AMAnd the question now is: will this impact the value of Bitcoin both instantly and in the long term?It has no negative effect on bitcoin.El Salvador is not even a country like United States which such news might cause decrease in bitcoin price but which also will later be followed by bull run.",

Just that merchants may decide not to accept it anymore. IMF are stupid and they have their own selfish reasons.They are not stupid. They are following their master's (which is BlackRock and other investment giants) directive. It is us (Bitcoiners) who need to be smart and never let them play us.I don't know if you're aware that they are also behind the issue Binance us had years ago. How they spread fud through one of the US TV programs called  \"The Daily Show\", and after they filed for BTC ETF which was when the BlackRock CEO started saying positive about Bitcoin.I believe they are also pulling the same strategy and doing everything possible to cause FUD in the market for their selfish gain. I hope just every Bitcoiner will start prioritizing the use of a self-custodial wallet from now on because they will play a lot of tricks in the market just for them to dominate and be the king.These and more are the reasons why IMF loans always come with selfish conditions.",

It's obvious that there are pressures from the IMF itself, however, what's ironic is that they still uses Bitcoin as currency still because the loan is  $1.4 billion in a credit facility. But I think it doesn't mean though that El Salvador is not going to used Bitcoin or El Salvadorian cannot invest on Bitcoin itself.Although it has been reported that their official Bitcoin Wallet apps, Chivo will be sold or closed.As for the effect on the Bitcoin prices, if it has negative connotations then it might bring the price down. However, I do not think that it will have a long term effect though. Sooner or later investors are still going to pour their money no matter what the news are.",

They prefer Bitcoin to be an option, not a requirement, and that was a big condition for El Salvador to get their loan.In the end, it doesn't really shake up the Bitcoin market much. El Salvador's strategy has been more about buying Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, and the IMF isn't too bothered by that. So, it's all good as El Salvador gets their loan, and businesses can decide for themselves whether to accept Bitcoin or not. Forced adoption just isn't the goal; Bitcoin's here to be an alternative to fiat, not a mandate.",

Moreover Bukele emphasizes students to learn bitcoin because the concept is much easier to understand than fiat. No need to worry because El Salvador will not simply limit bitcoin transactions in a short time. As long as Bukele holds his vision, he has the authority to raise the limit higher. The IMF feels that the flow of money in El Salvador is more dominant in bitcoin than in fiat.",

Legal tender is just a nice story that they clearly failed to sell to the world, and paradoxically, BTC was more accepted in some countries where it is not legal tender even today, than in El Salvador. What El Salvador failed to do when they discovered BTC was invest in it much more aggressively, because if they had several tens of thousands of BTC in their possession today, then they might not need the help of the vultures from the IMF.",

This just means one thing; the IMF aren't really I support of the fact that El Salvador declared the use of Bitcoin as legal tender but I thought that with the number of Bitcoin the country has accumulated over the years should have been enough to fund their projects? The way I see it is that President Bukele had finally bowed under pressure from the IMF who feel that the use of Bitcoin as legal tender poses a lot of financial risks but I think the man knew that before he took that bold step right? I guess that's their own means of negotiation in other for them to grant the loan. The IMF for a long time have felt threatened by El Salvador's decision to use Bitcoin as legal tender cause it has taken the potential power they (IMF) have alongside the banks that support it and countries who have received the intervention of the IMF are always not better off than the ones that don't so what's the assurance that El Salvador would get back on their feet after this.",
