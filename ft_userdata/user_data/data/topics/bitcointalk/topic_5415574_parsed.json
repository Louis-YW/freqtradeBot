I do not break any rules and they do not provide reason for blocking me. I only play tennis and Cricket Matchs.Thanks Alot",

I think odds are just a method to attract people's interest and even then the win is uncertain, although at there odds is higher but the scenario of your money lost is also higher. A trusted site will keep you safe and comfortable, and that's even better.You misinterpreted what did @OP mean here, he asking about other casinos which have similar or same like 1xbet since 1xbet has an edge about the odds. He's not asking if 1xbet is trustworthy or recommend other people to play on 1xbet lol.Based on odds comparison it seems either Cloudbet and Betcoin.ag are offering good odds among other casinos when it's about tennis and cricket matches.",

It's either they will block or reduced your betting limits to the minimum just to exclude you from betting. I don't know exactly what you are doing for having such kind of experience but casino will always finds you as problematic player if younare always having a perfect winning result to ypur betting history.Duelbits provides a better odds on sportsbook. Maybe you can try this casino as it is known that it can provide good odds.",

There crypto counter part casino is the only part of them that has a very shitty reputation but 1xbet in general outside here is doing well and not scamming blatantly there players compared to 1xbit and other casino connected on it. I think this is the main reason too why many user still using 1xbit if they still didn't read comments here since they are looking on 1xbet reputation when they are playing on 1xbit until they get scammed. 1xbet is one of the longest running fiat bookie that I know before I become a member in the forum. They have an established reputation for non crypto user so it's very hard to warn user to not used them unless they experience being scam personally.",

If you really want to have the same odds, you will have to choose a platform that has the same provider. betb2b is that. Then you also have the advantage that you have high limits and also on the smaller divisions with all kinds of sports. The platform can usually be recognized by the same layout, only the colors may differ slightly.
