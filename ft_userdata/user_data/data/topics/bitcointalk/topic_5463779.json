      "body": "Hey everyone,This is one of my very first artworks and a favorite among bitcoiners. Every time I attend an event or conference, I bring one piece with me, and it always gets sold right there on the spot. Another number SOLD: 3/12 is gone, and 5/12 is reserved.This artwork now includes an AR layer. You can see the animation by opening the Artivive app and scanning the piece. This design will also be featured on clothes and postcards, soon! It’s a really special one, and I’m incredibly happy with it.I would love to collaborate with one of the collectors to create a unique frame, maybe something vintage with museum glass. If you’re interested, let me know! Thank you for the amazing support!I’m also open to suggestions and ideas, so please share your thoughts. This artwork speaks to each of us on an emotional level, including everyone in its story.Thank you again for your incredible support!With love,Mx12Art",

      "body": "I have added new images of number 6/12.This piece is going to London for the Domain Summit 2024 on August 20-21, where I will have a private exhibition and share the orange pill experience ). This is one of my favorites, if you take a photo from the front, your face won't be visible, only your body, giving you the feeling of being Satoshi Nakamoto. I created it for this reason. Fun fact - this artwork marks the beginning of mx12Art and has been my avatar from the start, serving as my logo.Oh, and number 5/12 SOLD at a small citadel in Germany and will be displayed publicly soon!",

This is a huge move for him as a collector, and it’s an honor to build this connection with him. I’m proud of the relationship we’ve built, having such a strong connection with me, one of the earliest Bitcoin artists is truly special. Let’s keep pushing forward!Thank you for being part of this journey. Once all the pieces are sold, there’s even more coming! For collectors, an Augmented Reality update will be released, the original animation will remain, but a second, longer animation with more details will be added. I’m here to stay and keep building There’s big news on the way, and I’m giving it my all to take this to the next level. With all the connections I’ve built in London, I’m ready to bring this art to new heights!  BTC",
