Tel Aviv were the better side and with this draw they have already secured half of the round. When you play away games, a draw is probably one of the best results for the away team. We can say that they will win at home in the rematch and go through.In the other match of the day, KAA Gent beat Pogon 4-0 in the first half. I think they secured the round from the first half. They played a dominant game in the first half of the match and we can say that they did not even give a position to their opponents. With 4 goals from 6 shots on target, Gent is playing with a good percentage.",

We represent our country in this cup with 3 teams and 2 teams really have strong squads that can win this cup. Of course, first of all, it's necessary to pass the play-off rounds and stay in the groups. No matter how much our teams give importance to this cup, it will be positive both for our coefficient score and for our real strength in European cups.I think that Beşiktaş and Fenerbahçe have a serious say. These teams are among the favorites of the cup with their transfers and squad quality. The opponents should be taken seriously, it's very important to pass the play-offs. I hope everything will be fine.",

Furthermore Villa may find it difficult to secure a 4th to 6th spot in the premier league hence I feel that they’ll target a Europa league spot by winning this competition and thus they’re my favourites from the premier league to win this competition.",

It seems like that i would like to take the second leg rather than first leg. im very unfamiliar with so many clubs in the third qualifying round of conference league. The risk is very big to lose. Gent was able destroying pogon with very big scorers in the first leg. Im sure pogon has zero chance to beat gent. Gent will be dominating the second leg soon. 5-0 was a very big score for the first leg. Pogon is not lucky enough in this season caused by it faces strong club.",

I think, Tel Aviv will use second leg advantage to defeat their opponent, since they were able to drew the match with AEK Larnaca in their home, I believe there is a hope for them to use all their home strategies to embrace more goals to achieve victory at the end of the match. I don't think, Tel Aviv manager will allow their fans to experience any fear in their next match, because he knows where the fault came from and he is ready to solve the problem before their next match.",

Because the game Pogon played in this match was a complete disaster. The Pogon goalkeeper was like Gent's number 12 player. The defensive line was almost nonexistent. If only Pogon had come into the game with 10 forwards, they would have been less infamous. Losing is always possible in football but losing has its etiquette. To lose or to be disgraced? The Polish League Ekstraklasa needs to make progress. Of course we can see the Polish teams in better positions in the next years with the right decisions. I can say that i watched football in the form of a friendly match. I hope the Pogon technical staff understand that it is necessary for the Pogon goalkeeper not to go to the goal in the next match.",

Beşiktaş had a comfortable match especially with the effective game in the first half and 2 goals scored.Again, Aboubakar showed his finishing. Salih Uçan, on the other hand, had one of the best matches he played. He showed that he is an important midfield player with both assists and assist passes. As long as he performs like this, Beşiktaş's offensive organizations become better.Muleka, who made a good start this season, also scored again. Gedson played his usual game. Despite their shortcomings, Beşiktaş shows us that they are on the right track. They will pass this tour comfortably. The 3-1 score in the first match made the rematch much more comfortable.",

Especially Center Back and Left Back are a must for the team. Masuaku is very good, but Umut Meraş is insufficient in that position. Colley can be a good duo with Amartey when he returns, but that's not enough for the next tours.Again, Aboubakar showed off his great finishing. Likewise, Muleka created the goal out of nothing. The team is getting better, but it should be better. Because the goal is to win this trophy.",

Their opponent Genk is really experienced. But considering their effort so far they can also get some decent result in this away match maybe.",
