      "body": "People can legally get around loads and loads of government regulations, including cryptocurrency regulation, if they would only use the Private Membership Association (PMA). What is a PMA? It's a formal, private club.Your family is private. As long as you aren't doing anything harmful at home, you can do all kinds of things that you can't do in public. You can even get away with doing harmful things if nobody tells government that you are doing them.A PMA is like that. But it is formal, with paperwork explaining what your Association is formed to do. There are loads of \"gentlemens' clubs\" in the US, that are essentially taverns that get around the smoking laws because they are private. People can smoke in these clubs, and drink in ways that are illegal in public taverns. They are PMAs, even though many of them don't have PMA listed in their name.Another very common form of PMA is a medical practice PMA. It's like a club where the patient becomes a member with their doctor. The doctor can do procedures that would never be allowed by the public medical... such as ozone therapy or hydrogen peroxide therapy. And as long as he doesn't do something crazy or harmful, the medical doesn't have anything to say about it... can't do anything to stop it... because it is a private thing between the patient and the doctor. The only thing that must be done is, the PMA must be written up regarding what the \"medical club\" is doing.If someone developed a new cryptocurrency with the PMA paperwork written right in the white papers, and if everybody who used the client to trade tokens for this new crypto, literally signed paperwork regarding this new crypto every time he used it (written right in the client for automatic signing), government could not regulate it. Possibly even PMA forks of some of the present cryptos could take them out of the realm of government control.The people at Pro Advocate - https://www.proadvocate.org/knowing-rights-benefits-private-membership-associations/ are probably some of the most well versed regarding the PMA. But there are others.Search on \"Private Membership Association\" for further information - https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=private+membership+association&ia=web.",

      "body": "In this expose, you will find links to documents that show motions, depositions, and sworn testimony provided to us by whistleblowers that documents the gross negligence, willful ignorance, withholding of evidence, and conspiracy between multiple government agencies - The Security and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) supported by the Federal Court System. All working together to weaponize the legal system.The reasons?
