  "content": "Hey thereI'm recently reorganising my BTC and wanted to send some BTC from my Armory wallet. I was facing issues with this so decided to sweep the keys into a different wallet on Electrum. This worked, partially, and Armory now shows that I still have some BTC in my wallet. I checked the address on the blockchain explorer, which confirms that my BTC are still there. However, I can't seem to sweep this particular private key (Electrum says no input found), nor does the send BTC button work. I click it and nothing happens :/Just wondering what I can do here to get things going here? Any insight would be most appreciated",
