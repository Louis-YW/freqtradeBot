The only similar one I could find is https://medium.com/@harsha_90164/blockchain-based-p2p-betting-dapp-with-chainlink-356bfee0aa6cWould be interested to find out:- if you used such a service- how much would \"NO KYC\" matter to you ? - did/would you feel confortable connecting with metamask to it ? or just send coins to a certain address that would belong to the bet you want to make- how long would the withdraw period be for you to feel confortable with it- would you use it if it did not have a nice looking UI- would you use it if you only had 2-3 football matches per day where you can ONLY bet the result of 1 of them at a time ?- do you think a total bet odd of 3 / 4 to 1 is enought to get you betting ?",

Since you're mention \"smart-contract\" mean that there is no single involved of human touch for the gambling activity.Since, casino need to maintain and check every player/bet sportbet they cannot do that with smart-contract. Go check a problem from Sportbet with Casino/Slot gambling activity, most of the problem we can find is always sportbet comparing to regular gambling.",

      "body": "If you use Web3 casinos, you can connect your non custodial wallets to their casinos and bet. Because of Web3, I would like to be free with KYC but in some cases, casinos require KYC for big wins or suspicious activities when you want to claim your won money.If the casino is legit, has good reputation (ready to pay their users), I don't mind if I have to finish KYC to claim my big win.If the casino is new, I am more doubtful that they try to scam me and KYC is more risky. Because even if I submit documents for KYC, they might disapprove it and I will lose both, money and identity documents.",
