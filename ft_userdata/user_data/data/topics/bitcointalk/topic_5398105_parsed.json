You've started with 2 guides that are not bad.If you would have been continuing with improving posting style while keeping it informative, merit would have been coming soon enough.But with this topic you've destroyed your reputation...Also imho this hurry to get merit kinda signals that you want it for more than just post images in tutorials....PS. If you only want to post images and you're willing to pay for that feature, coper membership is the fastest and most proper way. See https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=credit;promote (and https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385104 )PPS.

Can You Sign A Message?[Merit] Hey Bitcoiners! Can You Send Encrypted Messages?I don't check them as frequently as I used to, but if you do what you're supposed to you will eventually get a merit when I get around to it.  I hope that helps you feel a little better.",

      "body": "To add to the previous posters I am mostly a lurker in these forums posting only here and there and have managed to get fair amount of merit. So to get merit you don´t have to be very active or prove that you can use crypto for other things aside from asking it (I´m not entirely sure I would be able to prove merit-worthy in OgNastys referred threads). Meaningfully engaging with other members is enough to eventually get all the merit you need. If you indeed spent your own time writing tutorials (and you didn´t plagiarize them as some have pointed out) then I am sorry that your hard work wasn´t rewarded with merit. Still it´s a good first step in connecting with the people here.",
