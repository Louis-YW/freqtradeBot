  "content": "17 August 2023 is the independence day of the Republic of Indonesia. In our country, in order to welcome independence day, we usually carry out various activities to celebrate independence activities. Such as competitions, carnivals, thanksgiving, and others.I see a lot of activities supported by merit source so that many members are enthusiastic to take part. I request support from merit source in this activity created in thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5463180.0You can monitor this thread to see photos of activities and festivities commemorating the independence of the Republic of Indonesia or in our regional language it is often called \"tujuhbelasan\" ('tujuhbelasan' is the term for the number 17 in the local language)If there is a merit source willing to support, I would be grateful",

This is an activity on a local scale in our country. But I think it can increase member participation if there is support from merit sources.Am I not allowed to ask for support from merit sources for such activities? sorry I don't know about that",

Looking at the total post and merit flooding in their local board there's no need to seek such help because they're top 2 position in the highest merit sharing. The @OP is greedy, he want more merit especially in his thread. Maybe he want to create a shitty merit festival like pizza contest where people just posting a picture about something rounded with BTC letter and get a lot merit.",

Maybe the other people from the country have not contributed yet or they are not interested Also asking for support from merit sources indirectly means that he wants the posts to be merit by the merit sources  By the way everyone has smerits with them, and not only merit sources.  Why not Indonesian users contributes and support their own celebrations? Even without the merit source, this can be done.",

Also, if I remember correctly posting pictures with faces is not really encouraged here.",

To be fair, they are so high only because there are few external merit sources that have been helping them in the last few months.",
