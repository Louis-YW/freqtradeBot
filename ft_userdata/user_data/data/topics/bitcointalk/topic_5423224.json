Stil this is a very good rate for the bitcoin price and it is for sure not a bad starting point.If you want to avoid loosing your bitcoins just withdraw them from the exchange the moment you buy them. With that there is a low risk of loosing your funds. You can also get a hardware wallet.",

These risks in decentralized exchanges are the same as the risk of sending BTC from your own non-custodial wallet to somebody else. If you use Binance 'fake' p2p for example, Binance in this case act as the intermediary and you hand over funds to them for the trade to be completed, that is why i call it 'fake' p2p, because there is a presence of a third party, do not think it is risk free too, there is also a possibility of a 'counterparty' risk, which may not only come from the 2nd party in the trade, but Binance themselves as they can confiscate your funds anytime and ask for more personal documents from you. A friendly reminder as well is that centralized support do not solve all the problems you run into when using their service.In Decentralized exchanges there isn't any third party intermediary, you are sending funds directly to the 2nd party in the trade, that is exactly how the BTC network works, so you have to be careful and take responsibility as is expected of BTC users; before using decentralized you should read tutorials that will help you understand how to use them well. In the BTC network, lost funds are irreversible because the network does not work like a bank that is controlled by a central body, so decentralized exchanges not having a dedicated support team isn't a disadvantage because that's how the network operates, if you want to use a decentralized network and have self custody of funds do not expect too much handholding in it.",

But if you fear problems with your altcoin holdings then you should do it before they drop further. You can buy bitcoins on a centralized exchange and then withdraw everything to a non-custodial wallet, It doesn't affect you either.",

Since it seems like the only remedy.Everything that has advantages also have disadvantages. We make decisions when we compare what we tend to gain or loose from an action. Lack of support team to handle specific transactions issue might be one of the disadvantage of decentralized exchanges. That's why one needs to be very careful when using decentralized exchanges for transactions because mistakes can be fatal. But you can find many manuals on several decentralized exchanges that can guide you on how to solve certain transaction issues when it occurs. But this perceived setback cannot be compared to the risk of using centralized platforms. At least in DEX who bear the consequences of only your mistake but in CEX you have to suffer the negative outcome of the actions of yourself,  the exchange company, hackers and even the government.",

For the centralized exchange, I think the exchange being an intermediary is good because they help to guarantee your transaction, holding the crypto asset until you confirm receipt of funds and vice versa which I believe will not make one party unwilling to release their own end of the transaction after receiving from the other. As for DEX, I also believe that this mechanism is built into the system too because if not, we know humans of today, once they receive payment, might not want to release assets. Personally, I have used both and have never run into any issues with either one.",

For me every 2 weeks is really good. Or a scheduled amount (every time you save 100$ for example).You also save on fees for exchanges with less frequency but obviously the more frequent, the better your averaging.Also explore p2p platforms like bisq. Safer, once you get the hang of it.",

Since it seems like the only remedy.First thing is that, I commend you for your total departure from altcoin and your will to hold more Bitcoin since Bitcoin is relatively stable in price, and also for your not wanting to trust centralized exchanges with your funds. There is no doubting the fact that having your wallet with your keys properly stored is the best possible way to have total control over your money and aside from the fact that you will need an exchange to buy bitcoin or use a p2p service to do so. But if you want to hold other coins then you will need to buy them from the exchange and thereafter transfer them into your own wallet and you are advised never to leave your coins on an exchange most especially when the amount is big.",

I’m a pro Bitcoin but I’m just questioning your trading logic because if I’m with your situation, I will just hold that altcoins since the only way to recover your loss is for your altcoin to grow again while investing on Bitcoin doesn’t guarantee that it will grow on a percentage equals to the percentage loss of your Altcoins due to the difference of volatility.I would invest separately on Bitcoin and leave the lose altcoins in there for a long hold if I’m on your shoe but it’s your money so what you want.Quote from: Cruxleo on November 26, 2022, 07:38:45 AMHowever, in my last post I expressed my disappointment with centralized exchanges, my unwillingness to continue using them and thankfully I got suggestions mainly endorsing Bisq, of which I've taken time to look into Bisq and other decentralized exchanges and observable is the absence of a support team unlike their centralized counterpart.

Using it temporarily for buying or selling will not gonna exposed you on great danger because they are running for a long time.
