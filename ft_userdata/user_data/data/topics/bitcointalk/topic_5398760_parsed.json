If car is stolen or does not arrive because of thievery in the postal system I am not sending a new one.Read all of this and then decide if you want in or not. I am not responsible for any failed deliveries. I am sending out of the goodness of my heart and that's it.   This applied to all auctions in the past and future ones as well as the thread says. Goodluck!DO NOT SEND ME A PM WITH PRIV NOTE... UNLESS YOU WIN THE RAFFLE.If you win yes...if not no! And please send within 24hrs so I can keep track on who won what. Thanks   PLEASE PLACE YOUR INFO AS FOLLOWS WHEN PLACING YOUR LETTER OR NUMBERC KROGOTHMANHATTANIt makes my life easier to copy and pasteAnd it keeps me in a good mood too! Just a reminder for everyone past, present and future....   a) I do this for fun. I am not compensated by anyone and there is no angle in this for me.   b) I do not hodl onto any addresses they are destroyed each time I place an order.... any repeat winner has to resubmit their addresses.   c) Pass on the good deeds to others and enjoy   and keep on HOLDING!!!!  ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************Information threads made byKrogothManhattan฿BitBillsPhysical Bitcoin CreedCrypto Stamp WebsiteBitcoin Postage StampsKrogothmanhattan crypto shopBeware of Fake Casascius coins All about Coldkey cardsStorage for your collectablesMTGox yubi and MTGox OTP cardKrogothmanhattan escrow serviceBreached and Scam coin makers listHelp me name my new custom Bitcoin painting Private issue custom made Coldkey krogoth cards Past Collectable Auction or selling prices with links Introducing CYPHER STAMPS by CYPHER POSTAGEMaster Store list of Collectables section sales threadsStamps go digital-Collectable Blockchain postage stamp Free Daily Raffle Rules and posting of received free coins Unique, Rare and All Crypto Collectable Posting Thread with LINKS How to Generate a signed BTC transaction using Electrum and TrezorOffline signing your paper wallet using air gapped phone via ElectrumWanted to share my latest comissioned artwork - BITBILLS ORAMAWanted to share my new artwork called SILK ROAD by SATSLIFEWanted to share my latest comissioned artwork - CYPHER SATOSHI Testing- Submersing paper wallets printed on water proof papersKROGOTH HOLOMATIC-New invention to place hologram with precisionCollecting Community input needed>> Definitions used in our unique hobby ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
