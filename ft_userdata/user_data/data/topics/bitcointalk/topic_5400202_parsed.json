  "content": "Good day. Many time peoples try div pubkey, but unsoccesfullI will show now, how to divide.Method not complete to end solution, but show how to1.We have privkey 99, and what will be, if we div 99 to 50 ?if use android calc we see:99 / 55 = 1.8what we can do with this ? nothing you thing ? Answer - No, we can do.Now we see what will be if we div 99 / 55 in moulcalculator from ecctools:./md 99 / 55Result: 99999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5cShit, yes ? Anver is Yes and No, let seeif we see to this:99999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5cand this 99 / 55 = 1.8we will see what for downgrade range we need substract int or flot part, because we know nothing about flot part, we well subsrtact int part 99 / 55 = 1.81.98 - 1 = 0.899999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5c - 1 = 99999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5bnow we get back flot part to int part, we need make from 0.98, int numberlets do it:0.8 x 55 = 44 good, yes ?and about mod version:./md 0x99999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5b x 55Result: 2c(this is hex) = 44 decso need brute pubkey from this calculation:0x99999999999999999999999999999998d668eaf0cf91f9bd7317d2547ced5a5b x 55 = target priv and pubkey.publick key in range from 1:50what is 2 time smaler then 99.If thread well be interested, I show more dificult examples, and together we try find answer how to do.",

Well yeah, it would be helpful for the curve order to be a variable, but different values for altcoins would not be very useful until brute-force crackers are designed for them too e.g. Monero, LTC.GUI can just use Qt framework which can run on Windows & Linux (even Mac).
