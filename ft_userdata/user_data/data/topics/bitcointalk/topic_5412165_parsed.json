  "content": "Investing in cryptocurrency is a very nice and lucrative idea but this isn't for everyone. Some people believe crypto is a get rich quick scheme so they invested in it. They invested with little or no knowledge about it. They never consider how volatile the market is.

One shouldn't invest in cryptocurrency if he/she: ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰is greedy: Some people want it to be bullish always. They never learn to take profit. They keep waiting for their token to do more than Ã—100 but in most cases this turn around and go against them making them to lose all profit and part of their investment because they end up selling in panic.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰is impatient: They invested waiting to make money within days/months forgetting it may sometimes take years to make good profit. Most end up selling their token in little deep. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰is too lazy to learn: You must be ready to learn to make it big in the space.

Many people prefer shortcuts, and this is why many new investors lose money because they don't want to learn and conduct additional research before investing. Instead, they choose to follow signals from unreliable sources of information instead.Being willing to take risks is important because they are a part of every business. The risk associated with investing in cryptocurrencies is particularly high because it is possible to lose money in a short amount of time.",

It depends on how you perceive the greed or how the greediness affects another person. If I am giving 3 options to chose and the three are; 0.5btc, 1btc and 100btc. Do you think I will go for anything other than 100btc? Will you say I am greedy. Greediness in crypto is not bad, but observe the rules. \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful \"Quote from: odunybiz on September 02, 2022, 07:13:46 PMðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰is impatient: They invested waiting to make money within days/months forgetting it may sometimes take years to make good profit.

If you hold a shit coin, sell off as others are selling. It could dump in your hand and never return forever.Â  So, be guided.

There is varied business related to crypto, it doesn't refer to investing and trading only. Even if you have no money, you can join bounty or airdrop to earn money in crypto businesses. We also can provide a service related to crypto activities, both for the activities in this forum or outside of this forum. For example: Escrow service, art service, promoting a new project service through social media, or so on. So, people have many options to join crypto businesses.

The #1 reason why people lose in trading is because they believe they are special, gifted, have talent for trading, have luck and so on. Typically it happens when they make some money in a bull market, simply because all coins are growing. Then the bear market comes and instead of cashing out they double down on looking for profit to compensate for some unrealized gains, and in the process they lose everything.",

This applies not only to the cryptocurrency business. Patience is an important virtue of learning. The OP is right.

It is like a treasure for people like this. Actually Bitcoin investment is perfect only for extra investment purposes and not for full time because its volatility is very risky that is not worth it to use as full time source of income. I personally just allocate a portion of my salary on my job to crypto in addition to my signature campaign earnings and leave it as is for future investment purposes. I have health and life insurance while I use Bitcoin as my future savings insurance by storing little by little every month without selling any sats on my crypto savings balance.

And it's no secret that only about 3-5% of people manage to be profitable in these things, which is also the case with cryptocurrency trading. There is nothing wrong if someone wants to try crypto trading, but they just need to follow the golden rule of not investing more than they are ready to lose. If after some time a person realizes that it is not for them, they will not be too sorry for the lost money and time, unlike those who lose all their savings, which leads to serious problems in life and even suicides.The best option for the majority is therefore a long-term investment, but in something that has purpose and meaning and will not disappear in one or two years. Be smart, don't believe false promises - they are mostly the way to your failure, and someone else's profit.",

Actually, it is very risky to jump into this generalization especially when talking to newbies. They might get the idea that crypto is a sure way to make money, which isn't really the case. As a matter of fact, while there might be amazing crypto success stories of a small investment amount that grew into a huge wealth, the big majority of crypto investment decisions are probably a failure. And even if a crypto investor isn't \"greedy,\" \"impatient,\" \"too lazy to learn,\" and doesn't \"lack risk tolerance ability,\" it doesn't mean that he/she isn't anymore exposed to the risks of crypto investment considering that perhaps 90% of these investment opportunities is probably a fraud.",
