      "body": "By signing a message with the wallet, if you're referring to a Bitcoin wallet then you can just sign a message proving that you truly own that wallet but for other network like Ethereum and the rest I'm not sure if you can sign with them because I haven't seen any message signed with them although that doesn't mean it's not possible .And by the way Op why do you need to prove to people that you're the owner of a wallet? And why would someone else be using your wallet address?Edit: Quote from: JustAsk on February 23, 2023, 02:03:47 PMHuh.. But we can both signing from my wallet...*It's not a real situation! It's just a model!What type of wallet are you using? And how's that even possible to sign a wallet them being I possession of your private key? Just as @buwaytress suggested just ditch the wallet and create a new one this time use a more reputable wallet like Electrum.",

It is necessary when you need to make a trade, your trade partner will ask you to sign a message too.",

There's no need to prove anything to anyone; otherwise, what's the point of anonymity?",

Explanation being that ownership of an address comes down to who knows the private key and I guess in legal situations who used the key… If you both have the private keys then you can both use them. I don’t think there’s been court cases yet where people dispute the ownership of an address and both have the keys. The only court cases I’m familiar with are the ones where someone is trying to claim ownership without having the keys.",

EG buying coin on an exchange and withdrawn straight to your wallet whereby the exchange has KYC evidence that you bought the coin(though the thief can just claim you donated coins straight to them when you withdrew from the exchange) but would require the thief showing equal proof that the funds were intended for them to spend EG needs conversation logs of you saying you will buy coin and send it to them direct from the exchangec. by having proof of means, method, opportunity to have got hold of your seed phrase/wallet.dat file. EG you ca link the hacker/thief to a piece of software that trojan horsed your computer with wallet.dat stealing capability or a phishing site that requested your private key/seed",

If all is not available then we cannot prove the true owner of that wallet.That at least what I think to verify the true owner of that wallet.I also agree with buwaytress to forget about the wallet if ever that is already emptied out by the owner or the hacker and never use it again because it is already compromised.",

If you must claim a wallet belongs to you then the first thing you can prove with that is is presenting your seed phrase or secret keys but if in a case there are two holders of the secret keys trying to claim ownership then it will need some extra efforts to do so.  I believe there are some remarkable events attached to an occurrence for which the real owner of the wallet must remember to explain, some events can lead you to explaining the process and how it began. In a situation where by two people are dragging ownership of a thing, I believe from mere explanatory you could tell who the owner really is. Looking at this, as a wallet related, the owner must have had some experience to some of the token on his or her wallet with some memorable occurrence which can not be easily forgotten.",

The other person will still own the private key, and that cannot be changed.One possibility that comes to mind is being able to demonstrate the priority of using a particular address. For example, if you have made a public record of the address or have used it to deposit funds, and you can prove that the transaction belongs to you.",
