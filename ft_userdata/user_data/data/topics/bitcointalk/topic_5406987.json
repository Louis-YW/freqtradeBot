Satoshi started. Let's mine some tasty blocks, I'm sorry, at least I wish I hadn't left this world. No BitcoinAlthough it is worthless, what did you see? MaybeBitcoin fantasy for the helplessBTC",

Keep in mind that any coins mined on it are eventually supposed to be either donated/returned back to the Testnet coin faucets where they are originally generated. For example the one ran by mempool.co Testnet and its coins exist for the sole purpose of testing mining software - not for mining and accumulating Testnet coins. It is expected that after testing is done all coins generated are returned to their source. Folks mining Testnet coins and then hanging onto/selling them is why it's up to v4 or such. To stop that each version makes the older ones unusable on Testnet.As for making a clone coin it also must be said that you would be creating yet another worthless altcoin - it cannot/wouldNOT be \"Bitcoin\".BTC is 1 specific crypto coin and in-turn 1 specific protocol and blockchain, period. \"Bitcoin\" not a generic term for any other crypto coin including those that do use sha256...That said, coming up with your own coin just for the heck of it can be fun. Something like five thousand or more altcoins have been created just for that sole purpose. Heck, a couple including of course Dogecoin are even worth something.Given that fact this thread belongs in the altcoin areas of the Forum or at best the General Bitcoin Discussion area - not here in the BTC-only areas- so expect the mods to move it.",
