When a user creates an account I use getnewaddress and that data goes to the user table in the database. If the user sends money, the transaction can be spent from any address with a balance and if a transaction comes to the user address then the balance gets an update in the database.I hope this information helps you with the project.Quote from: LoyceV on May 30, 2022, 04:10:37 PMAllow me to stop you right there: why would anyone want to use this? Giving someone else access to your Bitcoin is a terrible idea!I agree with you, but sadly a lot of people prefer online wallets like https://www.blockchain.com/wallet, and that site is now a millions worth business.",

You have full control of your private keys, not the company.I remember something about them having two wallets; one custodial and one non-custodial, but I may be wrong and it could be a different company.Anyhow, there are issues with wallets like this, even if they give you access to your seed words. For example:Quote from: https://www.blockchain.com/learning-portal/how-it-worksWeâ€™ve Got Your Back(up)Your encrypted wallet is automatically backed up to our servers.Can we trust this encryption? Can they extract our keys? If they stole coins, we would notice, but what if they only stole our xpub to deanonymize us? Many uncertainties that can easily be avoided.Quote from: FatFork on May 31, 2022, 08:59:54 AMOP's question gives me a bad feeling in my gut, and I would strongly recommend not going this route, unless he is planning some kind of online service where a cutodial wallet is absolutely necessary.Yes, it's 2022 - if they need an account-based deposit system that's one thing; but if they plan to build an online wallet in 2022, they're years behind the widely accepted state-of-the art. Ordinary people use non-custodial, open-source wallet applications on their phones with or without a paired hardware wallet - they don't need online wallets (anymore (?)).",

Specifically an all in one site; where i can purchase my coin, and transfer to my wallet right away as waiting 7 days is just ridiculous. I have never used Coinbase nor do I plan to. But any good exchange (besides Coinbase) should allow you to withdraw your coins anywhere you want and when you want to. You can try with any of the better ranked ones from https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/. But be advised that almost all centralized exchanges require you to undergo KYC.If you want to avoid that, you can always opt for Bisq, a decentralized exchange. No KYC, non-custodial wallets with seed phrases, no locked or frozen coins.https://bisq.network/",
