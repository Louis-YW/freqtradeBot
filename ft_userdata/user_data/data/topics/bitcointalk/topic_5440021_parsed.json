The bitcoin adoption is still extremely low which is why I usually use \"1%\" for adoption. Keep in mind that awareness is different from adoption. A large percentage of the population has heard about bitcoin and have even seen advertisements from centralized services (eg. Binance) but that doesn't mean they have adopted bitcoin or are willing to use it. Many of them are still brainwashed into thinking bitcoin is a scam or is dumping, dying, etc. Specially younger generation in developed countries with governments who are too scared of losing their power and control over them.",

Bitcoin sounds latin and strange to them as they are likely not aware of it and another thing to put into consideration for their quick response to taking money is because it is what they have seen at hand. If they were being told about bitcoin and given proper education and enlightenment about bitcoin before the question of choosing between bitcoin and a $100  came up, I presume they would have opted to take the bitcoin against the $100 note because they already had the knowledge what was brought before them hence the phrase \" education is knowledge\". Just as you have said, education is very vital and important. If someone is educated about something, they would have idea about what you have educated them on. Educating the people about bitcoin would definitely bring about massive adoption and awareness of bitcoin.",

If I haven't heard of Bitcoin yet and I were also given the same choices, I would have also chosen $100. Why they're not aware of it especially at this time, I don't know, but it's not surprising either; it's not as if Bitcoin is already that popular. What percent of young adults all over the world have actually heard of Bitcoin? To those who have encountered Bitcoin already, how many of them actually know what Bitcoin is? Perhaps what was surprising in those two youngsters, which could be representative for the rest of us, is that rather than asking what was that other option is, they just went ahead and chose $100. They could have asked a couple of questions like, \"what is Bitcoin, by the way?\" or \"how much is that 1 Bitcoin worth in USD?\" or \"is that Bitcoin thing worth anything at all?\"",

Maybe they don't realize that there are bitcoins that can give them more profits. But maybe once they learn about bitcoin, they'll regret choosing $100. They saw a $100 bill in hand, so they chose it. This is psychology and it happens in many other places as well. They should find out on the internet instead of just spending time having fun with their friends.",

Even the Western young generation unaware of it is really unbelievable.100$ or BitcoinIn this case there are many factors ahead that could be the fact that hasten up such decision, first think about the age of the young boy, he doesn't have enough experience about life neither does he understands what bitcoin means, secondly also considers the $100 worth and the rate of the bitcoin amount being intended to be given, you were not specific on the exact rate or amount worth in btc, so it may be worth $10 in btc or abit lower or higher but lesser than that $100 in fiat, so expect the normal that he should go for the cash, except if the amount in btc is equal or more than the fiat rate, this can be the major reasons that bitcoin choice would be more preferable to fiat.",

While the quality of life has increased and more people afford to study at school, college and university, that doesn't actually mean that everyone is getting smart.

Btw these videos don't represent real values, they are created in order to generate money through clickbait content.

You will get opposite results and make sure that the location of the survey plays an important role.I agree that most people still don't know much about btc, but this process is gradually increasing. How do you propose to educate people? Run up to everyone you meet and ask \"why haven't you bought bitcoin yet?\" It doesn't work like that.
