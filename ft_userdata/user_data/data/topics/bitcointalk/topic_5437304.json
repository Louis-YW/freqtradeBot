  "content": "Is it possible that AI currency can change your life? Since the ChatGPT platform has been trending recently, that's why in this topic anyone here will know the top 10 AI crypto coins, this is based on the Forbes Advisor article.But before we start let's find out what AI is.Answer: It is a technology such as a computer or applications to perform tasks that can be done by intelligence being like people.But it is not hidden from the knowledge of the majority that they do not notice that we use AI technology daily. Just like on Facebook, there is AI here to predict the things you want to know, so sometimes when you think something comes out here.It's the same with google, it can also predict your next words or type, and many other applications that use AI.QuoteTOP AI CRYPTO COINS1. The GRAPH(GRT) - An indexing protocol, what is this? A way to easily find a particular one information, just like the indexes in the bookeasily find a topic or information you want know, well it's listed alphabetically from A-Z then there is another page where you can read it. Instead of reading, If you read the entire book, the index will help you, your search.GRAPH can also be compared to GOOGLE, searching here will give suggestions as to what you are searching for. But here at GRAPH, it's on the blockchain works. So it will help a lot to be easy to know specific data in a network. One of it's because of the problems in the blockchain suffer in certain data or transactions, although public this is it. But most of these are not decentralized as in The GRAPH.2. SingularityNET(AGIX) - A blockchain platform, where everyone is allowed to build, share, and monetize AI services. It has an internal marketplace where users can pay for services and browse using its native cryptocurrency AGIX. If it's DEVS can make money from the AI solutions and models they sell for use in AI applications.3. Fetch.ai(FET) - A blockchain-based AI learning platform. It is also about automating business tasks such as data processing and trading.This platform also provides tools to developers, to further optimize other industries such as smart homes and transportation whose native cryptocurrency is FET which is used to pay transactions in the network.4. Ocean Protocol(OCEAN) - an open-source protocol that allows individuals or businesses to exchange and monetize data securely and transparently.Developers can also create applications. Like securing and accessing data from multiple sources including public and private repositories. It also has a marketplace for data owners and buyers to buy, sell or trade data assets securely.Users can also create a smart contract to implement the exchange of digital assets between two parties using the decentralized nature of the ocean.5. iExec(RLC) - an AI platform that empowers users to monetize their computing power. It can also support fields such as health care, rendering, and Fintech.6. Numeraire(NMR) - this is an AI blockchain network that is like a hedge fund, which uses AI and machine learning to invest in the stock market globally.It is also the first cryptocurrency created and released by a hedge fund named NUMERAI.7. dKargo(DKA) - a blockchain that uses AI technology to resolve trust issues within the logistic sector by providing credible data using blockchain technology.8. Phala Network(PHA) - this is an AI-augmented blockchain platform about cloud computing, but with a strong focus on privacy. It can be compared to traditional cloud computing services such as amazon AWS or google cloud. But Phala is a decentralized alternative.9. Covalent(CQT) - this is a network that leverages big data technology from various blockchains such as Avalanche, Ethereum, Polygon, and others. Developers can use this multichain data to develop apps and solve problems in finance, retail, and more.Its other use is in taxes, the data can be easily accessed like those in decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, and because of this, you can easily track your taxables in crypto. It can also be used in DEFI or NFT projects that require specific data actions.10. Cortex(CTXC) - it is an open-source decentralized peer to peer blockchain platform that supports AI model to be developed and executed in a distributed network.With the Cortex platform, AI democratization can be achieved where AI models can be easily integrated into smart contracts and the creation of AI-enabled decentralized applications.FINAL ASSESSMENT    At this time the crypto market as a whole is doing slightly better, bitcoin is up 10% and Ethereum is up 2%.Regarding AI technology we can't deny that we use it in our daily lives, such as our cellphones, laptops, apps, and even on the internet, it's there even if you don't notice or know. And in our world, we are always doing something to make our lives progress even more by using technology. AI technology has not changed, but in the future, its use will be more active, and potentially many jobs will be lost due to this technology. there are jobs that AI can do. There is also news that an AI bot has been installed in a medical licensure exam in the U.S. it is so advanced that it may be even better than humans in the future. But it's not that perfect yet, there are AIs that we use but there are AI priests that we use that are still in the test new phase to say that they can replace a person, of course, it's not like that. So I think AI is probably the future of our world. But it is also not guaranteed that everyone who invests here will grow because the new technology that is coming is also failing. We still do not know what will happen in the future.That's why it's still good to be mindful in investing here, knowing the risk we're going to take.",

      "body": "I remember when Defi games started in 2017 and the community in the crypto space didn't pay much attention to it, because at that time ico projects or crowdfunding were trending. But when 2018 entered, if I'm not mistaken, it gradually became a trend until axie infinity exploded, and after this event, play-to-earn games, and metaverse suddenly started trending.After that, web3 came in, and now it's AI that seems to be just like Defi and metaverse too, which was ignored when it started, and I think it will gradually be noticed because it will be trending eventually, for sure this is just my opinion. That's just the time for the trend to explode.",

AI will be more interesting in the future and I bet many projects will utilize its power for a variety of aspects such as building scaffold-blockchain, marketing or writing advertising content. I will certainly learn more about AI and see what we can do with those new inventions of human Thank you for sharing knowledge. I will definitely make a further research on these coins",

It was only those who took the advantage of ICO, crowdfunding that got something very special during the wave. Although the rate at which scam projects were launching then was becoming much alarming, boiled down to DeFi and many more. IA project will be very much useful in the future. I think the above list project are very potential and interested to take part among them, maybe just investing for long time.",

I doubt that the token holders of these projects will use artificial intelligence technology and somehow promote it. It will all come down to the banal pump and dump.",

The current capitalization is around $11 million, so despite latest growth(50% from yesterday, 100% in 7 days), IMO there is still a lot of room for growth.",
