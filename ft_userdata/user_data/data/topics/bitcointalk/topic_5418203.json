It is deflationary right now due to its fixed supply.Quote from: tranthidung on October 25, 2022, 01:12:20 AMYes. It is deflationary *eventually* due to the end of mining and the random loss of private keys.No. It is inflationary.Quote from: bitmover on October 24, 2022, 10:26:50 PMNo. It is disinflationary rather than deflationary.

Conversely, Bitcoin and gold are inflationary while their known finite supply is still being mined. (Hays, Demelza) Why Bitcoin is Technically an Inflationary CurrencyAssertion: Deflation is when supply reduces over time. It is not a finite supply metric.Quote from: bitmover on October 25, 2022, 04:39:25 AMAgree: Since deflation is \"negative inflation\" then inflation of 0% doesn't count as deflation. (O'Sullivan, Arthur; Sheffrin, Steven M. (2003)). Economics: Principles in ActionDisagree: Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services [supply reduction being one possible cause]. (Robert J. Barro and Vittorio Grilli (1994)), European Macroeconomics, chap. 8, p. 142.Other: Hoarding/holding decreases the usable supply, so fixed supplies are naturally deflationary.

(Nakamoto, Satoshi) Re: How divisible are bitcoins and other market/economic questionsNo: \"Dust\" (small values) can't be traded on the main network due to high fees. (Coppola, Frances) Why Bitcoin Should Be Priced in Sats (and Why It Has a Divisibility Dilemma)Assertion: Bitcoin is neither deflationary nor inflationary.Quote from: bitmover on October 25, 2022, 04:39:25 AMAgree: Because it has a fixed supply its ultimate state is neither inflationary nor deflationary.Disagree: It currently demonstrates inflation while being actively mined.Disagree: Even when fully mined the loss of private keys results in decreased supply, causing deflation.Disagree: Even without loss of private keys the act of hoarding/saving decreases active supply, causing deflation.Assertion: Inflation is correlated with human decision making.Quote from: tadamichi on October 25, 2022, 04:51:41 PMCounter-example: Ethereum is inflationary by design.Counter-counter-example: Ethereum's inflationary rates have demonstrably been changed by community consensus; similar to governmental monetary policyDebate: Has Bitcoin shifted to store-of-value over being a medium of exchange or unit of account?Quote from: cottenio on October 25, 2022, 12:09:11 AMNo: It hasn't made a \"full transition\" to store-of-value.

Quote from: pooya87 on October 25, 2022, 06:19:56 AMYes: Bitcoin is too volatile to use as a currency, and Bitcoin payment processors are just spot-pricing fiat.

Fiat is made to last a century or two and then it goes into hyperinflation and needs to be reset, but what if you had an alternative to your fiat money that can be hoarded and also spent, but spending it would be incentivized somehow. What if businesses that want you to pay with bitcoin lower the prices. What if there's less tax on bitcoin payments? What if Bitcoin users become VIP clients in certain places?We spend fiat money because we know it loses value so you choose investments, but investments block your ability to spend. We can't sell bonds, gold or real estate fast enough to be able to fill our gas tank or book a plane ticket. You could say people will never spend their bitcoin knowing that it deflates but what if it stabilizes and starts to deflate 5% a year? It's going to feel safe enough to hold as an investment while being spendable without regrets.IMO bitcoin can work as a deflationary currency especially alongside another inflationary currency.",

If TX fees were natively better than credit cards it'd be competitive in that way, but it's not. His brilliance was in PoW and the timestamp system itself, not necessarily in prophesying economic design patterns.What I see today is that Bitcoin has made a full transition to store-of-value and speculative investing. And, since there's a deflationary model waiting at the end, it feels like we're just going to see a repeat of what happens in the other closed supply virtual economies we've seen over the last 25 years: crashing and burning.I'd like to be wrong and would love to see more data/research on why \"deflation\" is a good idea; not just anecdotes about hyperinflation risks.Are there any economic analyses of Bitcoin by academic researchers with economic backgrounds that believe the deflationary model is good in the long run?",

But the fundamental laws of economics about supply and demand probably affected Satoshi's idea when he designed Bitcoin. He envisioned Bitcoin to be used as a peer to peer currency. The demand won't go down because its money. And because the supply is deflating, the value of Bitcoin is expected to rise over time. But let's not forget that this is all an experiment. Satoshi must have also deeply studied the fatal flaws of fiat. And its inflationary system is one of them. So far it seems Satoshi is right.

That some people assume that in the long run, more and more and more people will start to lose their private keys is a mere assumption that may turn out to be a reality or may not. We easily can assume exactly the opposite: the scarcer bitcoin becomes, the higher the willingness of people to keep their private keys in safety will be, which automatically will sustain a fixed supply. QuoteWas the whole premise of starting Bitcoin under a deflationary model based on an economic fallacy in the hopes it would encourage valuation?Are you trying to attack bitcoin or what? All bitcoiners know that value is always subjective, and the perceived rarity of something may impact positively the valuation from different individuals. And by the way, Satoshi wanted bitcoin to become a peer-to-peer decentralized currency,  the main goal of which is to give people a way to peacefully opt-out from the traditional financial system to transact with whoever they want, permissionlessly. He never talked about speculation or bitcoin price and didn't sell a single bitcoin.",

Money declination in value, and persistence rise in price of goods and services.Assuming all bitcoin are mined, bitcoin reached all-time-high, followed by a significant bear market. If people invested in bitcoin at the time, they may later make profit after several months of unrealised losses. But as they lose, is bitcoin not inflationary at the time? It is, but deflationary in long term. That is why bitcoin should be considered as a speculative asset in short term, because you can invest in it for a short period of time and lose, or make profit from it.Not only supply of newly mined coins that would result to inflation, also as more people sell an asset like bitcoin, the price will reduce.Quote from: cottenio on October 24, 2022, 08:41:46 PMHow much did the deflationary model contribute to Bitcoin's shift to store-of-value?Very simple to understand. You can read more about the pizza day, how much bitcoin was worth at the time and compare it to now and see how to large extent bitcoin price has increased. Also you can check every halving, check the lowest price of bitcoin and the highest price, or be checking the highest price of bitcoin in each halving, you will understand that bitcoin has been a store of value after each halving or every four years.Quote from: cottenio on October 24, 2022, 08:41:46 PMWas the whole premise of starting Bitcoin under a deflationary model based on an economic fallacy in the hopes it would encourage valuation?Maybe, but said to be a decentralized p2p means of transferring money which can be central authority independent.Quote from: bitmover on October 24, 2022, 10:26:50 PMBitcoin is not deflationary.

For instance, has the British Pound been subject to hyperinflation? Has it been reset?Quote from: darkangel11 on October 24, 2022, 09:34:39 PMbut what if you had an alternative to your fiat money that can be hoarded and also spent, but spending it would be incentivized somehow.What incentivizes spending Bitcoin? It doesn't decay if you don't use it. Doesn't it incentivize saving/storing it as an investment for future yield?Quote from: darkangel11 on October 24, 2022, 09:34:39 PMWhat if businesses that want you to pay with bitcoin lower the prices. What if there's less tax on bitcoin payments? What if Bitcoin users become VIP clients in certain places?These are interesting use cases, especially the latter - which is more of a social construct based on exclusivity.The second part is possible in jurisdictions like El Salvador where they've made Bitcoin legal tender and might have such an incentive.The first part has been demonstrated before.A caveat: I used to help e-commerce businesses transact with Bitcoin but the transaction fees made that untenable. Yes, we have solutions like Lightning today, but that only means that Bitcoin's original vision as having low-fee transactional utility isn't feasible. Unless that wasn't ever Satoshi's vision (but it sure seemed like it, given he also believed mining would be more democratic \"across laptops\" and hadn't anticipated mining pools yet).Quote from: darkangel11 on October 24, 2022, 09:34:39 PMWe spend fiat money because we know it loses value so you choose investments, but investments block your ability to spend. We can't sell bonds, gold or real estate fast enough to be able to fill our gas tank or book a plane ticket. You could say people will never spend their bitcoin knowing that it deflates but what if it stabilizes and starts to deflate 5% a year? It's going to feel safe enough to hold as an investment while being spendable without regrets.A caveat: those who buy Bitcoin before each major price movement may feel cheated when their \"spending\" looks foolish in hindsight, and they should've \"held on\" which, over time, leads to less spending and more hoarding.Quote from: darkangel11 on October 24, 2022, 09:34:39 PMIMO bitcoin can work as a deflationary currency especially alongside another inflationary currency. I think the evidence is in front of us that it does work as a deflationary currency, alongside other inflationary currencies.A caveat: just not the way it was possibly intended? How firm was Satoshi on Bitcoin as having low-fee transactional utility vs. being digital-gold-store-of-value? I've read a lot of his emails and work but it always felt like he was adapting to the changing climate as mining hashrate spiraled out of control. Happy to have contrary sources - or, a clear timeline of what \"his vision\" was and if/how it changed.",
