The first possible \"culprit\" would be your signature campaign. There's a very high chance the signature campaign money comes from the casino you're advertising.2. One good way to get rid of warnings from \"local wallets\" is to actually install and use a proper wallet instead of using custodial web services where you have an account and they call it wallet. (Also I advise you use hardware wallet if there's a meaningful amount of money there).3. You should read very good the ToS of the service you use (i.e. \"local wallet\") because there's a good chance that if they don't like casino money they may like even less the mixed coins.4. I know that it can look biased because of my signature, but ChipMixer is mixing for free as long as you pay attention to the help page and send the correct amount of coins. Of course, this means also that you will have to download and use Tor browser. Also make sure you go to the correct address (see chipmixorfly address in my signature or look for CM's announcement topic).Of course, it's up to you which mixer you use, if any, but I recommend stand alone wallet (maybe with hardware wallet) as the main step.",

It looks like you're looking a much more trouble than the previous one. If this local wallet of yours is requiring KYC probably they don't want any of their users have a transaction from a casino, it's prohibited even in binance and kucoin or other exchanges and most probably a transaction from a mixer.Since i joined some gambling signature campaigns that rewards were deposited on gambling accounts. What I usually do is to send it first to my non-custodial wallet then send it my local wallet or exchange such kucoin. So far i never receive any messages regarding me violating their rules even in kucoin too.For mixer's list here[1] made by LeGaulois [1] 2022 List Bitcoin Mixers Bitcoin Tumblers Websites",

I have not heard of anything like that on Binance and many other exchanges. I do not think many exchanges have such rules as long as they are not from countries like US and Muslim countries that ban gambling.",

So, you have to be careful if you are going to use them. At least, do not send directly from the mixer to your wallet.As suggested above, chipmixer is with no doubt the best and most reputable mixer out there.However, and since it seems you don't wan't to pay any fees, you need to know that the smallest chip is 0.001 btc.

Moreover if your exchange/wallet prohibits this kind of transactions, I honestly doubt he's accepting transactions from mixing services.A simple alternative to mixers, is to send your funds to another exchange and to convert them into another cryptocurrency there before sending those coins to your local exchange/wallet. If it is only accepting bitcoins you will need to use a 2nd exchange, to convert back the altcoins used in bitcoin before sending them to your wallet.",

I guess they are tracking their customers transactions. I recommend to use non-custodial wallet than mixing the coins every time.

It might work in that way if you will try this option, it's ideal if you're looking for the cheapest transaction fee.  But if not, find an exchange platform that didn't prohibit transaction that comes from gambling wallets or better read the terms of service to avoid such violation.  This way, it's easy to transfer your fund to your local wallet using altcoins like XRP and convert it to fiat.",
