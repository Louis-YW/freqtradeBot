I checked Theymos' post history and looks like the last ad auction round was 353 from July 2022.Has the forum officially ceased selling ads? Can anyone explain what was the logic behind that decision (or just link me to relevant post)?Is the forum only generating revenue from donations now? Doesn't seem like a viable business model.",

The ad sales is probably ended forever. There are basically three reasons for this decision-1. Time-consuming to check out if the service is legit or not.2. Ad processing complexity3.

      "body": "If you check last post of that thread you linked, you see the reason.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407725.msg60976136#msg60976136Note that I've decided to suspend ad sales. These auctions will probably be permanently ended, and I'm not sure whether or in what form advertising in general will be continued. Maybe some ads will go up again fairly soon, or maybe there will never be any more ads; I haven't decided yet. The main reasons for this decision are:Firstly, I'm finding it too difficult to determine which services are legit/safe and which are not. It takes me 30+ minutes to research each new service to reach at least some level of confidence in it, but at the end of this I often still don't feel fully confident. Bitcointalk.org is meant to be operated \"as a service to the community\", so it's very important to me that bitcointalk.org not be seen to be putting profit above the interests of its users. (I've been kind of shocked at the crypto-related ads that are shown on TV, which are often way beyond anything I'd accept here. And I'd like to tighten our standards.)Secondly, there is a high amount of friction in the current process of auctions and manual ad processing. I often feel that it's more trouble than it's worth on bitcointalk.org's end. I also think that the revenue is substantially less than it could be because the market of advertisers willing to deal with this difficult process is much smaller than the market of advertisers who would be willing to advertise here if only they could do so effortlessly. So I think that we're \"leaving a lot of money on the table\" due to friction, which makes the other issues feel even worse.Finally, bitcointalk.org has a large reserve of BTC, so we're able to continue operating without ad revenue for many years. It's not even necessary to cut expenses or find replacement sources of revenue anytime soon, and I currently have no solid plans to do these things. I do regard it as less than ideal to be operating at a constant loss, especially because it constraints any desired future growth in expenses. Improving this situation will be on my mind in the coming years, but luckily it need not be a high priority.",

Can anyone explain what was the logic behind that decision (or just link me to relevant post)?People shared the announcement from theymos to stop forum advertisement banners but they forgot or did not know when it likely initially considered by theymos.Forum advertising DeFi totally-not-scams. Read a reply from theymos.Quote from: theymos on December 02, 2020, 09:52:08 PMAdvertising Phore itself definitely wouldn't be allowed. That's why I initially rejected their bids in the auction. Phore is definitely an \"ICO-type-thing\", which is explicitly banned from advertising: buying these sorts of tokens is something like buying shares in penny stocks, but even far more risky. However, I interpret this ad as advertising a product of Phore, namely the Graphene ecosystem and apps built on top of it such as their Marketplace. By analogy, I see this like Nikola advertising their fuel cell technology and their maybe-soon-to-be-available vehicles, not Nikola advertising NKLA shares.Quote from: theymos on December 03, 2020, 02:29:50 AMPhore only paid about $500 for this ad. It wouldn't make economic sense, especially since many advertisers would have to be checked for every one ad that is accepted, wins slots in the auction, and ends up paying. By memory, I'd guess that in the last 3 years there's been only 2 or 3 ads pulled after acceptance due to something I missed. Bitcointalk.org ads are far more high-quality than eg. AdSense ads are. If even this low level of risk became unacceptable, then it'd make more sense to just not sell ads. (Not selling ads is something that I've considered, since it's a lot of trouble for not really that much return, but without ads the forum's cashflow would currently be way too far in the negative. I'd have to come up with an additional source of revenue first.)This case seems to be a difference of opinion on policy rather than an issue of something I missed, though. I just see very little potential for harm from this ad, even if Phore's tokens are risky. It seems very unlikely to me that even a single person is going to view this ad and/or read the linked article, develop a desire to invest in Graphene despite the lack of any real suggestion from the ad/article to do so, do the research to figure out that they need to buy Phore tokens to get Graphene tokens, and go do that. Rather, the purpose of the ad seems to be to improve Graphene's reputation as a platform for dApps, not to attract investment. The state of the ad auction was such that rejecting Phore's ad would've resulted in no loss in revenue whatsoever; I allowed it as a matter of fairness/consistency.It takes theymos about 2 years to decide suspending ad sales.QuoteIs the forum only generating revenue from donations now? Doesn't seem like a viable business model.Forum is not a business, it is an organization (.org).Theymos stated that forum does not need new donation when forum members asked for reduction in 50 BTC donation in order to have VIP badge. I can not find that post of theymos at the moment so I quoted the below one instead.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on May 10, 2020, 04:40:30 PMIn any case, I thought I recalled Theymos saying the forum's finances were such that no more donations were needed",

But it doesn't look like there are any ads at all currently. With the auctions, there were always some takers, and I think a fair portion of them were legit businesses operating for quite a while (i.e. some gambling sites). It seems odd that none of them managed to strike a deal with Theymos directly.Quote from: dzungmobile on March 31, 2023, 12:46:23 AM(...)Theymos stated that forum does not need new donation when forum members asked for reduction in 50 BTC donation in order to have VIP badge. I can not find that post of theymos at the moment so I quoted the below one instead.This kind of makes sense. If the forum is sitting on a big pile of reserves, which cannot just be distributed to Theymos himself, then there's no really a need to increase those reserves. Especially if Bitcoin keeps going up long-term. Then it's theoretically possible that those reserves will never get depleted.As for the lowering the BTC50 donations, it could be seen as unfair to those who actually paid the BTC50 to get their badges.",
