If coins become removed from the supply (i.e. lost), then all other coins become a little bit rarer and therefore a little bit more valuable. In the words of Satoshi:Quote from: satoshi on June 21, 2010, 05:48:26 PMLost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more.  Think of it as a donation to everyone.Note, however, that a lost private key does not necessarily mean the coins are permanently irretrievable. Only coins which are provably unspendable, such as those sent to OP_RETURN outputs, can be said to be truly lost.",

If this happened that literally everyone lose there private key then the price will turn into zero since you are the only one holds. I’m assuming that exchange is also lose there private key and only your Bitcoin is on active circulation. Probably Bitcoin will fork to the coin so that everyone who lose there Bitcoin will regain it on new Bitcoin Fork since this the only way to save all the previous records on the blockchain when it encounters damage.But if you are assuming all the holders Bitcoin already loss not exchange then the price will be skyrocket for sure.",

When bitcoins decrease, then the available supply will be less, but the price will not increase unless there is an increase in demand. Therefore, unless the demand increases, even the decrease in supply will not be sufficient.at least most of us will not arrive to confirm this answer. I do not know, but who among us will live until that year?",

The price would go to the moon considering you are the only one that holds the remaining bitcoin. But in that particular story, its quite impossible to happen right, yes there are some who loss their private keys but not to the point like half of them have negligence on that kind of important thing.",

The bitcoin prices can never be determined by a single person or group of persons as the whole thing depends on economic factors of demand and supply so what if you all holding coins don't have any buyer so it would drastically decrease the prices or if there is huge demand it will give boost to it.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 10, 2022, 12:36:29 PMPeople have been creating forks of bitcoin or \"new\" bitcoin or bitcoin 2.0 or the next bitcoin killer etc. etc. for years.
