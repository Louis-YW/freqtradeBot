Its not an outlier nor an exception. I think by this point its fairly well documented even though no one seems to have heard about it.",

In addition, it was stated that if this happens, then such computers will not be owned by individuals, so that there is no possibility of misusing them. This could reassure many cryptocurrency holders. But some time passed and the power of quantum computers began to grow quite rapidly, and experts also predicted that quantum computers would become dangerous for cryptocurrencies in the next ten years. The article referenced by the OP does not in itself indicate the danger to cryptocurrencies from quantum computers and therefore is unlikely to be a reason for a sharp drop in prices in this market. I agree with the opinion that, most likely, there are several such reasons, and only in sum they give such a negative effect.",

Quote from: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2305646-quantum-computers-are-a-million-times-too-small-to-hack-bitcoin/Webber’s team calculated that breaking bitcoin’s encryption in a 10-minute window would require a quantum computer with 1.9 billion qubits, while cracking it in an hour would require a machine with 317 million qubits. Even allowing for a whole day, this figure only drops to 13 million qubits. This is reassuring news for bitcoin owners because current machines have only a tiny fraction of this – IBM’s record-breaking superconducting quantum computer has only 127 qubits, so devices would need to become a million times larger to threaten the cryptocurrency, something Webber says is unlikely to happen for a decade.",

Sure there are some negative news out there, but we were at 60k USD last year. And with the big swings we are seeing daily I wonder who are all the people selling now?

Moreover, I am of course still very minimal about it. So you can correlate it with the current price drop.Moreover, on the other hand, it is mostly related to US inflation data which reached 8.6% above market expectations of only 8.3%. Excessive inflation clearly brought the US economic slowdown, so that it entered into the so-called recession. We have seen 2 quarters of economic growth in the US minus back to back. Our local stocks also fell because of the impact felt by the US, this seems to be a domino effect for other countries as well.",

And it was occasionally brought up every time they wanted to question the security of Bitcoin or if there are some improvements or development on that technology and wanted to FUD Bitcoin in terms of security aspect.  But every time, the claim was always been refuted because the Bitcoin layers of security are too complex for the current quantum technology to decipher.[1] Quantum Computers Pose Imminent Threat to Bitcoin Security  date published November 8, 2017",

      "body": "I will now ask a question, please do not be offended, I am in a good way and with good intentions Can you tell me what quantum computing is? Let me not waste your time and readers, but very simply explain why these two events cannot have a reasoned and logical connection! And so, very briefly the difference between ordinary calculations and quantum ones.Now in the world there are essentially 3 main types of computing systems:- analog (discard, not suitable),- digital, these are our computers, cryptography in the field of blockchain and the like- and of course these very quantum ones!I won’t talk about analog ones - if you are interested, you can find a lot of information yourself.But what is the difference between digital and quantum. In digital \"computer\" is a kind of processor that can execute a set of instructions and manipulate memory cells. Modern computers do this very quickly, even at home. And there are even supercomputers with wild petaflops performance! BUT. Even in multi-core systems, the calculations in each core go sequentially, and to calculate, for example, a new function value, they have to go through the entire cycle of the algorithm that describes how to count again.But quantum computing is different. There lies a completely different physical principle of calculations, I would say - there is a completely different arithmetic. I recommend reading specialized articles, it's really interesting, but it takes a long time and it's not immediately clear  So, what is the advantage of quantum computing. For what I will write further - now quantologists would kick me with their feet for such an explanation, but it is the simplest and at the same time not entirely accurate, but it explains the essence well So, the key advantage is that in a very short period of time, such a system immediately gives out ALL ANSWER OPTIONS. You will say - well, that's it, the cryptography is hacked, they will easily find all the necessary keys, and everyone will be stolen ... It seems that everything converges, it seems like a nightmare ... But no The first reason is the amount of computation, limited by the number of qubits. And if it is easy to make a million-core ordinary computer, then a 512-qubit computer is still impossible to implement. You will laugh, but the first quantum computer was created in 1981 (1 qubit, if I'm not mistaken), and today, the largest ... as much as 66 qubits! (Zuchongzhi). And yes - it calculates specific tasks in minutes, while an ordinary supercomputer takes decades. But these are specialized calculations, but what about ordinary ones? But here everything is difficult. Very difficult ! By the way, I also recommend reading specialized articles about quantum algorithms - I promise a boiling brain  Well, now the easiest part. Suppose that the owners of a 66 qubit superprocessor have written an algorithm for calculating private bitcoin keys. And received in a couple of weeks... or months.. or... (it doesn't matter, believe me), ALL PRIVATE KEYS! What do they have to do next?0. Take the first private key. Use it to calculate the wallet address (X).1. Send a request to the bitcoin network, show me the balance for the wallet address calculated in step 02. Get an answer.3. If the amount is greater than 0, then send a request to the bitcoin network: from wallet X (with a private key) to address Y.4. Repeat it all .... And here we turn to the theory of Bitcoin: Bitcoin private key (in WIF format): it is 51 base58 characters, starts with \"5\". Those. essentially 50 characters of 10 numbers and 28 characters. Or a little easier - in HEX format it will be 64 characters from the range [0-9A-F], and this is 16 characters. And now let's find out how many iterations there will be? And the options will be... 2^256 or 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936This is how many times it will be necessary to repeat the algorithm, but already on real digital technology, in order to steal bitcoins...I will not even ask - what kind of storage system is needed to store so many keys.In a word - everyone can sleep peacefully, bitcoins are still under reliable protection!",
