Hodling is not a new word and especially here on the forum, users are advised to hodl and it will prove rewarding ( for those who plan to sell) when the next bull run season approaches. A necessary advice given by the Op which I think is quite important because there are still those who fall victims of hodling their Bitcoin on CEX which might be cool but not until the exchange gets closed down without prior information (exit scam) or even be victim to hacker attack.To ensure you don't fall victim of stolen coins or missing funds, it's best to store your crypto in self custodial wallets, that way you are the only one with access to your funds and while it has its perks, it can be risky if you misplace your private keys you might as well be kissing your funds buh bye!",

Plus the last 20 posts on this forum are about shitcoins, so you can see he didn't HODL so much finally. This thread in comparison is much more serious and many newbies would do well to take note but I fear that most if they find it will be after they have made the mistake.",

I do say this that it's never too late to start bitcoin investment, but it's better never to have started than to carelessly handle your wallet security keys or make use of a centralized exchange in holding your bitcoin for long, if anyone is found under any of these category then he has higher tenderness of loosing his entire life savings in bitcoin to scam by hackers, this makes it very important to understand why we should take care of what we have and value them even if it will cost us because bitcoin hack or scam made are irreversible despite they are traceable, but we cannot recover the lost fund back, isn't it better to make prevention than care.",

Some of these wallets might have a vulnerability, and I believe they cannot be non-custodial.My hope is that many beginners will be smart enough to do their own research before downloading any wallet to store their Bitcoins. People these days think that everything that has an app is open to everyone, so they just open Playstore and search for crypto wallets, but not all of them are safe.It's inevitable that some people will fall victim to scammers' traps when they get involved in crypto and not all of them will be able to find their way to Bitcointalk forums.",

It's against the BTC principles, yes, but it's probably much more safer and efficient in terms of time and fees. Short-term holders are generally not the type of people who would spend a lot of time learning about all the security risks and safe storing. The risk of messing something up with setting up wallet (or cold storage) for the first time is greater than the risk of reputable exchange going belly up.",

It's always advisable, to use wallets that are widely know and recognize by the general public. The idea of hodling Bitcoin isn't complete, without knowledge on how to fully secure your Bitcoin and prevent loss of funds. I usually advice people to download these apps from official store or directly from the website. Alot of hacked software are out there and if one isn't careful enough, you end up downloading a phishing app and after funding, you are left with nothing.

I am talking about hardware wallets because those are the safest ones in terms of HODLing. So if anyone has the ability to buy one, never be late. Then comes software wallets. I have done some research here on this forum and also in other places. Everything suggested me towards Electrum wallet. I have used it and it's quite good as it said in every review.
