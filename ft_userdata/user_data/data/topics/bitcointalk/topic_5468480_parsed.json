If you're asking about who to trust in Telegram, you shouldn't trust anyone there. And if you're going to ask about reputable people from the forum, there are plenty of them and you can figure that out by checking the trust feed back. They also offer escrow service and are trustworthy but not that random guy you've mentioned and those that were vouching for him.",

Try that somewhere else.But a general recommendation for Telegram. It's not a safe platform to conduct trades with unknown individuals because either of the two parties can delete the complete conversation history whenever they want. You do it only with people you trust, maybe not even then. And you never trust someone claiming to be a reliable person on Telegram. Always check that information by contacting them via other verifiable means.",

Regardless of the fact that Telegram is full of scammers, the idea is fundamentally wrong.Financial transactions and trust do not take place through Telegram or social media.

If you want a financial service, you must complete it through the official website, and it is better to use decentralized services.",

If anyone needs to use the escrow service, don't deal through Telegram, though you may just chat with real Telegram.
