  "content": "Assumption : The Bitcoin Football Club qualified for the Champions League next season, and you're signed the Manager,  Who would you include in your 22 man squad ?The image above shows how my first team would be like... My Team B would be;  Ronaldo, Lewandoski, Messi, Thiago, Modric, Ndidi, Cucurella,  Van Dijk, Umapecano, Arnold https://startingeleven.co.uk/:  Link can be used to create your own team A.Some reasons to my first team selection.Goal Keeper; Mendy, I'll be a bit bias here coz he's African.Defends: J Cancelo and R James are both pacy fullbacks, a little bit agressive and good handler's off and on the ball, as they are both great attacker's and good defender's, modern football deserves this to inject your attacking plans offensively.Alaba and Rudiger will form a great partnership, one a bit agressive and one a bit cool.Midfield:  I think my middle Is perfect,A dribbler,creative player, And a skillful DM. Pedri reminds me of Xavi Hernandez, he drops deep to receive passes. As you'd always find De Bruyne in Space, that's one thing great players do.Attack: should be very creative, and not selfish I think I like them young and very talented. Haaland should score 40+ goals from my squad lol.Share your thoughts, and let's keep this fun please.  Correct me if I'm wrong!",

They are sharp, calculative and can capitalize on any mistake of any defender.Midfielders: These midfielders would stabilize the team. They have the capacity to absorb pressure and they also have attacking capacity. They are also skillful and have uncommon strength that makes them tireless.Defenders: My defenders are chosen because of their capacity to outsmart any attacker. Defender like Robertson is pacy and tireless. They are bold and fearless.Goalkeeper: Oblak is experienced and energetic. He is confident and fearless in the goal. Coach: Jurgen Klopp",

It was a midfield quartet to complement each other.Defends : It was a very vicious defensive formation. opposing teams should try hard to score a goal",

Must the team players be selected from real live players from any club or should be a mixed up from forum members? Because I would like to use active forum members here to create my own team based on my own ideology.

It would really nice, if we somehow find out, that some of those footballers are involved in the crypto industry, by HODLing coins and/or endorsing various crypto projects(no NFT/token scams, of course).

For a whole group, yes.access the web to make creative arrangements... but if it's related to bitcoin, I just heard about it, bro.if so, maybe i'll look for some threads for this. but if it's market/financial company sponsorship in team t-shirts i've heard of it.Enjoy and have fun.

They were also champions in La Liga. That's why we can't ignore Real Madrid. I think we should include names such as Courtois, Modric, especially Benzema, in the best squad.",

Although thanks for your information and inputs preciate it.@Harkorede Your team prolly playing an all attack game I see. With Salah Messi and De Bruyne we should expect loads of goals from your squad.Benzema not been innit ? Same way Mourinho would choose Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Pep Guardiola would choose Lionel Messi that's how I picked the players I think would suit my team.
