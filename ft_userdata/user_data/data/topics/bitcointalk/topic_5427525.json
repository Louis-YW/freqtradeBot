Investing in bitcoin is fantastic, but you must also take into account the danger involved. Although many are fed up with banks and need to pay their bills, I don't believe bitcoin is the best option for someone struggling to pay bills because after buying might end up selling them.",

Profit is not assured in crypto industry; price changes from time to time and that would challenge investors to endure market downfalls.

Why generalize?Also, that's not true. State officials won't accept that cryptocurrencies are better than fiat. Evidence? Cryptos are still not supported to many countries. What I mean by not supported is not being endorsed on the public, but that doesn't mean that people are prohibited to use cryptos on transactions, especially to countries wherein adaption is neutral.",

How do you expect people struggling to pay bills to invest in crypto that is very volatile in nature? Secondly, are you also encouraging people to get loan from banks and start the crypto journey? That is very suicidal in case you don't know. It's a decision not to be taken. Your idea of doing away with fiat absolutely is not only unrealistic but impossible. There's fiat before before crypto. The earlier we know that, the better. No matter what, Crypto has come to stay and it is getting more popularity day by day but we should not discredit other people's means of livelihood because of our love for crypto. We made our choice to be on crypto side, let respect their choice too.",

They have made the people believe that it is only bank that can save their money. They have made the people believe that it is only the government that can create money and any money that does not emanate from the government does not exist and will lose value within a given period of time. With this particular mindset everyone would want to save their money in the hand of the government whom they trust to keep their money for them.

There are lots of people in the UK who are already aware of the importance and advantage of blockchain technology but still prefer fiat simply because most businesses still don't accept crypto.
