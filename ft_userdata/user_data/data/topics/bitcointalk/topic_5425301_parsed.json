The servers have some of the best price-to-performance ratio in the industry. I think only Contabo has better price-per-performance, but they don't accept crypto I think, but my provider does.Quote from: dansus021 on December 07, 2022, 11:51:19 AMIm using vultr and I have been paid multiple times using BCH everything was good they using bitpay service Vultr flagged my account as fraud because I didn't complete KYC. If you want attractive bonuses then you should probably be using AWS.",

If you want attractive bonuses then you should probably be using AWS.KYC? Were you paying with a credit card? I had a few servers with them at some point and never had any issues.I didn't pay Vultr anything, I literally just registered an account and they asked for KYC 24 hours later.I get that hosting providers want to see at least a temporary copy of your passport so they can protect themselves from credit card fraud (Hetzner and OVH do that too) or they just reject risky CC payments altogether, but alleging the fraud already took place goes too far for me.",
