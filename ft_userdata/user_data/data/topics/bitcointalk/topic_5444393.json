Do OP have to know about how Micheal Saylor hold his bitcoin before he can start to buy and hold bitcoin too? How can he know the total amount of the bitcoin that is owned by Michael Saylor, you know bitcoin can be a privacy coin is used in a privacy way. It is simple, he can read about cold storage, multisig wallets and how to use full node with tor, or he can start to learn about bitcoin privacy and how to secure wallet than bringing Micheal Saylor topic about how he is doing it. I do not learn about Micheal Saylor before I know all these.",

I would be interested to know what you think what their setup could look like.Best regardsthere are many whales, accumulated billions of dollars in bitcoin,some of the whales store their coins in hardware wallet or cold wallet (ofcourse) , also may be in multi sig wallets,https://ibb.co/1JzHyJghere you can see the biggest whales store all their bags in one cold wallet, some of them are exchanges wallet and some are personal cold wallet, it is riskier to store all your bags in one cave,and many of them stores them in many wallets , maybe they are cold wallet or digital wallet , many of whales hold lot of bitcoins but i don't know why they store in many wallets, you can see here, https://ibb.co/WWwbsN4there are lot of coin in individual wallets with specific amount of coins,maybe be they store like this, because of security purpose or to hide their funds from blockchain(why anyone will hide from public may be i am wrong )you may think that they are listed in order so the wallets have same amount of funds, but they are have only one transaction,andmany of them are created in same date or the owner of the wallets make an new wallets everytime he or they DCA,you can research on bitinfochart",

      "body": "I think Michael Saylor, likely uses a multi-layered approach to secure his Bitcoin holdings. This may include cold storage in offline wallets, which reduces the risk of hacks or thefts from online wallets. In addition, he may use hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor to store his private keys and sign transactions securely. Saylor may also utilize multisignature wallets, which require multiple signatures from authorized parties to initiate transactions, providing an extra layer of security. Running his own full node to verify transactions and ensure the integrity of the Bitcoin network is another possibility. Finally, it's possible that he has purchased insurance coverage to protect his holdings from loss or theft.",

And after what happened with FTX and the other exchanges, I don't think a whale will even conjure the thought of storing in an exchange. And besides if they refuse to tell the public how they store their coins, what strategies they are using then it's totally understandable because, them leaking their storage method will pose a danger to their holdings.",
