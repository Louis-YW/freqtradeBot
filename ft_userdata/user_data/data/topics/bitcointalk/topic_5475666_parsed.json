You were never trading with them in the first place; what you did was give your money to a scammer to trade for you, and this money has already been long spent, and they added some figures to your account on their website, which can't even be withdrawn because there is no real money backing that up. You have been scammed. Your first mistake was trusting someone with your money, someone you met online, and you were also after a high ROI, which was the reason why you failed to realize it was a scam all along.",

The best thing that you can do is to hold your coin and not give it to anyone to do an investment for you. If you so much want profit, you can learn how to trade yourself and start handling your own trade. You can rest assured that you are in control of your decision. If you lose the money, you know you have lost it and you know how everything went, rather than handing over your hard-earned money to someone who did not even suffer for it, and at the end of the day, the guy next screen is rejoicing for being able to scam you.  Even leaving your money on a centralized exchange is also not a good option to start with, incase you also want to consider that, any platform that requires you to deposit your crypto and they will do multiplying for you, avoids them.",

Your case is similar to other case reported in this section some days ago. You can also read below thread and realize that how scammer will use this trick to force you for depositing more fund. Quote from: Losarima on November 18, 2023, 04:12:16 PMI was given 72 hrs. to deposit a 100% equivalent of my assets ($74K) to verify my account which is obviously a scam. Instead of asking me to provide proof of source of income, theywant me to add more money.",

And so someone gave this link to you by a unknown person? that is already a red flag mate and again, this is one of their modus operandi. They will even offer to help you out in the beginning and give you a good profit and you feel that it's real. However, when you are about to withdraw, just like in your example, you are going to require you to deposit for more.Just used logical thinking, they want you to top up more than what you are going to withdraw? Doesn't make sense right?So just forget about it, don't deposit any and stop talking to that person again. Some classic scams if you met that person in a dating app: https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-romance-scams-dont-fall-for-these-dating-app-swindlers/",

That's going to take them down and will remove them for any direct keywords researched for that website. And next time, when a website or service asks you to deposit again for you to withdraw and the amount is enormous, that's a sign that they're a scam. There are services that really require some threshold amount for you to withdraw but usually, it's on the casinos and exchanges but they're not a lot and the amount's like just $5-$10 or $20.",

This happens when you link your accounts or posting them on other social media handles, sharing your most of online activities on socmed. With my years here in cypto, i never had been messaged in my main fb, twitter accounts, or even on telegram. If there is i know that those were obvious scams offering shitty investments, asking for help like stuck funds on an exchange, etc. Or the most absurd thing is from an account with a pretty profile pic asking these kind of schemes.Good thing OP asked first or there's another day for an easy money to scammers.",
