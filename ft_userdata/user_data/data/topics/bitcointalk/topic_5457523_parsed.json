In order to make sure that it was shut down, it was suggested to me to use CLI to make certain. So I am trying to learn how to do so I can start learning to fix my own problems.Also, I use the same computer to run other labor intensive programs and I need to stop Bitcoin Core in order for things to run more smoothly. Once, I have an upgraded computer, then I might be able to keep it running all the time.But you are right, I do try to make things more difficult than they should lol.",

What happens is I lose internet connection because of my internet browser, usually from a website that is too much. I don't know if it is a wifi signal thing or if my network adapter needs to be replaced, but I guess that is the next problem I need to tackle. probably for another website forum though. idkthanks for bringing that to my attention",

      "body": "Since you're issuing the CLI commands as a different user than the \"user\" (system) running the process, it'll look for the credentials of the user in the user's home directory.  The same thing happens on Linux, it's not just a Windows thing.  On my Linux servers I run the bitdoind process using a system user with no home directory, password, or the ability to log into the system.  Safer that way.Also, it could be that your bitcoin daemon isn't reading any configuration settings, it's just running on defaults.  When starting bitcoind, did you include any command line options?  Did you specify a configuration file?When running a daemon it's more practical to have two configuration files, one for the daemon to start all the services you want the daemon to run, and another in your home path that specifies the user's preferred settings, like wallet location and whatnot.  To me it sounds like the daemon isn't configured with rpcauth.A practical way to set the authorization string it by using rpcauth.py, you can find it in the bitcoin master tree under share/rpcauth/.So, if you were to use the example in the image above, you would add the following string to the daemon's bitcoin.conf file:Code:rpcauth=username:c02d625224be734104c3515c3fd274e7$f3a29a147dc1322a99bf820328d9918fc5bc626598049b12a0d654f860e952c8And in the user's bitcoin.conf file you would add:Code:rpcconnect=127.0.0.1:8332rpcuser=usernamerpcpassword=R7eq4jQVYcFvbRUJEGwPX7QOfRBwtp-8cPMdOiF0944=",

Which means you can simply run bitcoin-cli stop without any additional arguments or configuration.",

I tried to do everything in testnet3 folder, but I already built a part of the testnet in the main folder. So I'm wondering if it's possible to make work my configuration. Maybe you can have some ideas. I don't know. I can move it if it's not in the right place ^^Also, when I'm trying to run bitcoind from the fodler testnet3 with : ./bin/bitcoind -conf=bitcoin.conf -walletdir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/wallets -txindex=1 -testnetI have this in the launch : 2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file: /Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file arg: blocksdir=\"/Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/blocks\"2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file arg: conf=\"/Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\"2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file arg: datadir=\"/Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin\"2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file arg: settings=\"/Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/settings.json\"2023-12-21T16:07:06Z Config file arg: walletdir=\"/Volumes/Crucial X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/wallets\"Which is not what is specified in the bitcoin.conf file into testnet3 : [test]conf=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/bitcoin.confdatadir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3blocksdir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/blockswalletdir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/walletsaddnode=testnet.blixtwallet.comsettings=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/settings.jsonI don't understand why the node is not syncing on the right conf file...",

So, it's not necessary but cool for the next ^^In that case, you should put your bitcoin.conf file inside bitcoin's default data directory, put the datadir for mainnet and testnet in that file and remove the conf files from the separate custom datadirs.In MacOS, it should be in: ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/bitcoin.confThat way, bitcoind will automatically load it without needing you to specify the paths. (the GUI will still use the one set in the Welcome Screen though)Or set the --datadir in the command line arg for testnet and mainnet and remove the --conf and --walletdir args.Then put a bitcoin.conf file for testnet (still with [test]) and mainnet in those separate datadirs.In both cases, you do not need to set blocksdir, walletsdir, settings lines in your bitcoin.conf file or command line.Because those aren't necessary if you intended to save the settings.json, blocks folder, wallets folder inside the custom datadir which is already done by default.Also, you may consider fixing the paths in testnet (if it's not intentional) because-in testnet, it'll automatically create \"testnet3\" directory in the specified 'blocksdir' and 'datadir'.For example:Quotedatadir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3blocksdir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin/testnet3/blocksThese configurations will result with this folder structure:Folder where the datadir will be saved: \"......./Bitcoin/testnet3/testnet3\"Folder where the blk and rev files will be stored: \"......./Bitcoin/testnet3/blocks/testnet3/blocks\"If the intention is to save the block in the testnet3 directory and the datadir is set, you can remove it from the config/args.Lastly, if the datadir is to be set in \"......./Bitcoin/testnet3\", the datadir for testnet should be: datadir=/Volumes/Crucial\\ X8/bitcoin/Bitcoin",
