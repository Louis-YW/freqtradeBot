  "content": "Hello. please help me understand the situation. 07/09/2022 09:19:43 I sent BNS coins to the probit.com exchange, unfortunately they did not appear in my wallet, support did not answer my questions. I checked the address several times, I didn’t make any mistakes, I sent everything to the address that was indicated on the exchange. I contacted the admin of the BNS group, he checked my transaction and confirmed that I did everything correctly and there were no errors, he also said that he would contact the admins of the exchange, let them check the contract. Today, probit.com just turned off deposits. in response, they wrote to me that I should check the contract, and if it does not match, then they can’t help me with anything. tell me how to return the money?",

I don't know since when, you shouldn't make a deposit because your balance might really not be credited.

The worst thing is if you may not able to get your money again but i hope that if your problem can be solved very soon.
