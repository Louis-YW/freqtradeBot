      "body": "First of all, this board is completely irrelevant for the topic you have created. You should have created this topic in Altcoin Discussion. From your conversation with their customer support, i assume that there was a misunderstanding. Of course if you import Ethereum private key in TrustWallet, you won't find your USDC on the Tron network.Beside that, i'm also confused about what they say, isn't Blockchain.com a custodial platform? that means you can't get a private key to directly access your assets, right? if what i said is true, the only way to get your USDC back is to ask them to manually send the USDC to your wallet address.Additional information for you, if you want to deposit USDC on the Tron network, so far only a few platforms support it, such as Bibox, Bitmart, CoinEx, Cointiger, Gate.io, Kucoin, LBank, MEXC, WhiteBit, ZB and Huobi.",

The only solution is, to send back the USDC on one of your TRC20 wallet.Last, you should be very careful when sending crypto transfer, always double and triple check things (wallet address, supported coins on any exchange, right address for every coin, etc.) before you proceed.",

OP probably interact with somebody who doesn't really understand the difference between how their network works, or the support page is inaccurate, so that's that. CMIIW. That being said, OP, by \"nothing\", did you mean you already add USDC (Tron) token and it does not show on your wallet, or did you just use the default tokens list and see nothing there?",

Hey made a transfer of TRON directly to his tron address of the Blockchain.com trading account, and everything was fine. Without taking any extra precautions, he then transferred USDC TRC20 into the same TRON address not knowing they don't support it.In otherwords, his mistake is similar to someone who sends unsupported tokens to an exchange. The person behind customer support seems to be clueless, but it's only blockchain.com that can help him recover the funds if they want, since they own the private keys.",
