Especially those who have bought DEWO tokens and got rugged?The crypto space is full of scams and scammers. Sometimes I think the government guys are right. Crypto needs heavy regulation. Yes it will kill the innovation but it will kill the scams also. I'd rather get a scam-free environment than getting an environment where 99% of the devs are scammers and only 1% of them gain success.I haven't bought any DEWO tokens because this is the first time I heard about it and I am glad I haven't before.",

This is why many people are still hesitant in crypto market because of so many scammers. I won't blame them for being too cautious in this market.",

It is a well-planned trick. They just want to pretend that they are legit and trusted platforms in order to gain trust from the community and fall into their trap. It was found to be unusual before but for now, it was a common tactic that these scammers do. Well, it is sad to say that many projects turn to scams whether unintentional or intentional during the bear season that is why we need to be wise when investing this time. Only invest the trusted and known coins, not new projects.",

Anyone who doesn't have morals or care about scamming people they will never see in person can just write up a smart contract, use services like those available here on these forums, wait a little while, and pull the rug to take off with some free cash.

Hmmmmm a classic rug pull and there's nothing new about it.With how many rug pulls that we saw in the past years, I don't know if it's only me but I see this as a normal thing already with crypto as long as there is no regulation that is being made.It's quite unfortunate as always to see investors losing their money because the token that they bought just got rug pulled but.. it is what is and that is why Crypto-Youtubers always say this famous quote \"Invest what you can afford to lose. This is the reason why investors are very hesitant when investing in crypto thus, it slows down the adoption of it. Scam projects everywhere, projects going rug pull etc. It would be better if investors will just focus on the top market cap coins.",
