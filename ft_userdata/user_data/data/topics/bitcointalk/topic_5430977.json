It is good you registered your presence here. I was able to go through your website but I find it kind of irritating. The user interface is very poor to write about, no much insight about your activities on your website. I suggest you work on your website and I would want to know about your means of operations. Are you limited to just the three countries mentioned on your website or they are just there as example of places you deliver transfer to? And lastly, it would be nice you answer thisQuote from: JeromeTash on January 06, 2023, 06:42:47 AMQuote from: skripka on December 29, 2022, 12:52:26 PMWe are grateful that you brought this to your attention.It's really very similar and I think it needs to be fixed.
