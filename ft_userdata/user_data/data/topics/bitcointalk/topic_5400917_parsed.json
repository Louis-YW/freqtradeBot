Anyway I am not going to jump into any final decision right now, I will wait and see how this turns out on the long run.That's stupid in my opinion, what Nakamoto does may not necessarily have the same impact as what he does, remember BTC is already full of a community that supports its continued development but Shiba Inu will still depend on what he does. Everyone who sells it is currently in a loss position, hopefully there won't be a crash market again because of this strange behavior.",

I say unknown because 90% of people who bought it thought it was a real stablecoin of course it was a scam but my point is Shiba and all the memecoins are not even pretending.I love centralized coins when they do things like this,,, teach everyone a lesson.",

He is covering his tracks by deleting everything and probably is in India right now with a fake death certificate. Stop investing in fly by night scams and get some real world changing projects, like XRP and ICP. Don't be a pets.com investor when you could have owned the next google.",

And the project itself was initially a parody on DOGE, what to wonder That could be the scenario, as long as SHIB is still here then you have nothing to worry about. Its just that, SHIB can easily be abandoned now and you know that it’s also possible to happen and that’s why many are panicking already because this might be their first attempt to leave the project. I don’t know what’s the real agenda here but it’s better to be safe now than to say sorry later on, if I were you try to asses your SHIB holdings and see what can you do to protect that money, reinvesting to other project should be one of the option.",

I do not know what we are doing right now, I feel like we should be doing something a bit more public so that everyone hears about it. If people never hear about this situation then how could they end up selling their shiba and getting out? They won't do that and we would be ending it with a situation that would be both bad for shiba and drop, but also bad for investors who wouldn't know why it dropped. I do not think that it would be wise for people to be unaware of this situation.",
