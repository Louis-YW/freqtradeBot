  "content": "The invention of new technology has given the people a means of living more comfortably and efficiently than before. But unfortunately scammers make use of such opportunity to thrive and take advantage of people by scamming and stealing their funds away. The invention of cryptocurrency offers transparency and freedom from financial constraints through solving problems encountered by traditional currencies (fiat) and allows one to be in full control of their investment. Due to its decentralized framework, scammers use this opportunity to trick people into making them believe in them and steal their bitcoin away which can likely not be recovered back once sent to them.Many things have changed over the past few years when it comes to perils being pose in cryptocurrency today. Many have fall victims of these scams especially beginners who have no knowledge and are unaware of these scams that appears to them to be real. This post will serve as a guidance and precaution for beginners to watch out for potential red flags when involving in any cryptocurrency transaction. All important informations are simply explained and straightforward in each subject matter. 1. BlackmailBlackmailers have gone so far that they use anything against their victims to lure them into sending them money usually bitcoin. They intimidate their potential victim from any angle and however making them trust and believing in them by gaining access into a very sensitive information about them. They leverage on that information into threatening to release them online if you don’t send them money, an information or something important that you don’t want anyone to have access to or see. Some tell you they had access to your computer after installing a logger software to access your webcam. This kind of Microsoft software is known as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) which gives them access into interfering into the graphical interface of your computer. One of the way to avoid such scams is by being careful with the type of login credentials you select online, who have access to your information and sensitive informations you fill in a form online. Using different security method in your computer system is highly advisable such as a two-factor authentication (2FA) to avoid access into your computer’s privacy.2. Fake Exchanges Many exchanges nowadays keep scamming people as they make people fall into their trap by giving them astonishing offers. They have no difference with the legitimate exchanges and their activities are the same. They invite users (traders and investors) by given them offers such as very low transaction fees, buy low and sell big within a period of time, getting to earn bitcoin at a very cheap rate, also posing to them a competitive market. These exchanges exit scam after disappearing and milking their traders and investors off there money. You’ve to be aware of all such exchanges and be wary of red flag when an exchange poses that.Bitcointalk has a very good track record of busting scams in the past till date. You can always ask in the forum when you suspect an exchange or any other services that poses scam. 3. Fake GiveawayThis is another way that scammers lure their victims and scam them off their money. They promise to give you something huge in return to what you’re been asked to deposit. For instance, you might be asked to send 0.2BTC to get 3 times of it back (0.6BTC). This can also be done using other cryptocurrencies not only bitcoin. When you see any news from a platform - social media (mostly Twitter) or websites online asking you to deposit little amount of funds and get more than that in return you should stay away from such offers as they’re scammers. No legitimate giveaway will ask you to deposit money first. Some go beyond asking you to deposit funds, but also asking you to provide sensitive informations like your private key before you’ll be entitled for the giveaway. If you succumb to them and send it you’ll lose all your money. Because the word private means only yours to keep, not to be revealed to others. If such information are been given out it is no longer “your keys, your money” but “not your keys, not your money”.4. MalwareSome malware programs are infected into your system after clicking on a link or after downloading and installing an app online into your system. Some malware software once installed into your system will steal your private key then send to the scammer. Scammers have gone far this days that they make you send money directly to them without you noticing. One of the common malware software is the copy-and-paste malware, where the address you’re sending the money to will be automatically changed into the scammers address. To avoid such occurrence, you should always double check that the address you’re sending the funds to is 100% accurate. Constantly scan your system security, be wary of software that you’ll give full access to into your computer’s administrator, get an upto date antivirus into you system and scan for threats regularly.5. Social Media Scam (Impersonation)Scammers are everywhere now, they impersonate people such as a well recognised person into scamming people by giving them giveaways and such similar offers. They impersonate the original person by using fake accounts and directly messaging you that there’s an offer, if you’re interested you follow up by following some steps and guidelines. There activity and mode of operation is the same as that of the person they’re impersonating. Don’t fall for such scams when you’re been messaged or seen a red flag. Always confirm from multiple sources before falling prey for such tricky scammers. Most times, people of such caliber always have a blue tick on their social media accounts. So be careful when following up for any giveaway on social media.6. Phishing EmailPhishing email is one the lucrative and effective way for scammers to lure their victims. They send you emails which looks real and can’t be differentiated from fake ones, they prompt you to take action immediately to the email sent. They might be asking you to provide some sensitive informations about your accounts, like updating your password if you still want to have access to your services, updating your account also. All these are done to gather credible informations about your login details. Some go to the extend of sending links through email, which such links contain some sought of malicious software or redirect one to a scam website. In order not to fall prey of this type of scam, always contact the main source of the email from the contact information they provided via their websites.7. Ponzi SchemePonzi scheme is a very lucrative way scammers use to scam their victims. The operation of the scheme works in such a way that the money of new investors are being used to pay the older investors. When the scammers don’t get new people to join and scam, then the project fails and money stops coming in. Bitconnect is one example of a Ponzi scheme in the past. Try as much as possible to avoid any project that guarantees high profit in return of what was invested. Don’t join any project that depends on new members money to pay the previous members in the project, the result of this is always people losing a lot of money at the end.8. Othersi. Hackers Hackers are also potential scammers that will infiltrate into your computer system thereby getting access to your funds saved in there or sensitive informations to have access into your wallets. The best way to avoid such scammers is by using- Two-factor authentication for all your accounts - Using of firewalls- Installing an upto date anti virus software - Use strong passwords and yet easily accessible ones for your convenience - Stay away from malicious links or attachments you come across on the web- Make sure your private keys are well stored and in hard wallet- Make sure your passwords are not vulnerable online to attacks i.e don’t store passwords online or any website.Research have also been found that web-based exchanges and wallets are constantly hacked, and your money is never saved in them. Most hacked exchanges are unable to compensate their customers for the money they have lost. When such exchanges are hacked or compromised, you lose all of your money (sometimes claimed to be hacked). Exchanges like Cryptopia and Mt.Gox have been hacked in the past. KuCoin is another example of a hacked exchange, although they have since strengthened their security. Cold storage wallet is the finest place to keep your money. Any money that are not under your control should be considered a risk because they can be lost at any time. When leaving money in an exchange for an extended period of time, you need to be cautious.ii. AltcoinAltcoins are never worth to be invested in. Most altcoin are scams, they’re unlikely to survive the market in the long run, and their value is likely to plunge to nothing. Altcoins carry a high risk of investment because of their volatility nature, as evidenced by studies. Bitcoin is the head, the leader. It has no affiliation with other coin and will continue to stand on its ground as the best cryptocurrency ever existed. Developers of such coins manipulate the coin's market price and make appealing offers to entice individuals to join their society. Early hodlers (developers) will be able to boost the coin's price by pumping it and then dumping it once they've made their money. Be wary of all these shitcoins; the majority of them are fake. Most of them are centralized and have no smart contracts. iii. Celebrity/Influencers An influencer/ celebrity who is well known would use his/her influence into luring people to come and invest in a particular coin. Some of these influencers already own some percentage of the coin already and are looking to invite more people for them to increase their profits. Some of these type of projects work like a referral contest, where you gain more profit by inviting more people into the project. Some developers pay influencers/celebrity to help them advertise their project, thereby bringing in more people into their community and the celebrity/influencer is being paid after the adverts. Because you’re a fan of such person, shouldn’t make you fall a prey of such project.In cryptocurrency, don’t invest in a project because of what a renowned person says about it but find time to do your own research and know the future potentiality of such projects.v. Personal Research Learn to do your own research before investing in any project. Many projects entice people by offering money watering offers that can’t be easily let go off. These offers are just there to lure you into investing in them. Before you must join any project no matter how truthful it looks and their activities, learn to do your own research and ask questions from (only trusted)  experts who are into it before you. They're professionals on the bitcointalk forum who are willing to guide you and answer your questions about a certain project. If it's critical to join a project in which you wish to invest your money, confirm its validity from multiple sources. A person who is continuously asking questions will never be lost or misled.There are more examples to this that I have compiled, but these are some of the more common ones that newbies fall into. This will assist, guide, and educate newbies so that they do not fall victim to any of these bitcoin frauds. As we all know that “prevention is better than cure”.",

It's a mindset of a greedy person and then will eventually fall for the ponzis and other the same scam.",

Rate of crypto scam is really something to be concerned about so lets be careful not to fall victim to any of these scams. I think the high volume of scam we see in crypto is one of the downsides or cons of a decentralized ecosystem, in an community where individuals are absolutely free to carry out transactions anonymously, it should be expected that some bad actors in that society will want to take advantage of that privilege to scam or defraud unsuspecting victims.This is why it is advised to always be security conscious in this space, always be skeptic of everything and everyone because nothing and no one  can be fully trusted, when buying coins other than Bitcoin and maybe Ethereum, it is advised to always do a proper research, know when to go buy and also know when to sell, as we are advised to always be patient with our investments, it is also imperative that we do not allow patience turn to greed, for many have made millions in crypto, but lost it due to greed.",

If they manage to convince them, the hacker is granted with a SIM with one's telephonic number which is eventually used to reset the access to emails and exchange accounts.In that case it has little to do with malware, it is possible though that the hacker uses malware to steal personal information which would be used to trick the company operator.",
