So I guess those we attack bitcoin is very selective and it could have an effect to some investors that's why they are hesitant to try and get themselves involved. Nevertheless, we can't do anything about it, they could be late to the party though as maybe in the next bull run, we might see 6 digits.",

Why? Because they want to buy bitcoin at cheap and then promote it to make a profit soon.There are 3 types of people, like you, that knows about Bitcoin and other people who are interested to learn about bitcoin and the last is someone who knows that bitcoin investment is a scam they always think that investing in Bitcoin is likely the same as a pyramid scheme.",

It's the global currency of the internet, separating money from governments.It's just the people that will require some time to get used to it.There are two kinds of hesitant people I believe. The ones that still live in fiat because they haven't studied what Bitcoin is, and the ones that want to get rich quick in crypto, so they try to buy alts instead.Those two groups of people eventually will end up using Bitcoin.It will be a gradual thing, forever.

Reasons could be technical, meaning it involves the very features of Bitcoin. There are also reasons relating to how fiat is falling down and how governments seem to not care about it. And if one is lazy to scrutinize Bitcoin's fundamentals, perhaps it is enough reason for them that huge banks, billionaires, top companies, respected investors, financial advisors and managers, and many others around the world are recognizing Bitcoin's potentials. If one is doubting, then many could vouch for Bitcoin through their actions.If that's not enough, at least they could take a look at Bitcoin's price history and perhaps be convinced that there might still be a huge room for its growth in the future.",

Governments and banks calling bitcoin \"an asset\" or \"regulated financial services\" (whatever that means!) is not something you can be happy about, adopting bitcoin as a currency is which is not something any of them are doing (except El Salvador, etc.).As for the market itself, we haven't really been in a bear market for months in my opinion considering that price hasn't fallen any lower than $17.5k ever since it was reached months ago. Instead it is in a sideways market which resembles the accumulation phase before the bull market starts.",

For us experienced ones, we understand that today's market trend is the best opportunity to accumulate more but even with how positive we are, we can't force others to do the same just quickly.For me, just let them hesitate. Just let them miss the \"opportunity\". Just let them ignore bitcoin or what. Just let others think negatively. That's their own will and we should stay away from that. If we want to spread knowledge about crypto, then just do it. Once the interest of other people is now there, they will do the research on their own.",
