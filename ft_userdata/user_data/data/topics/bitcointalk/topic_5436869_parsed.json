If it's another ICO then that's most likely not going to get much attention. And not jus because that Aptos is pumping and there's like a hype that's happening with it, I don't think that you should ever compare it with other project that gets you interested with.",

ICO will be only available for people who have been contributing a lot and listed as a part of community access program. You can read article that I have mentioned below to get more information about that. https://sui.io/resources-sui/community-access-program/I bought aptos when the price was dipping. It was around $3.2 got 10k aptos after converted some of my assets to the aptos and making 6x easily. It's better if you are joining the sui discord too for the more information.",

What is Charlie Lee without his pas work at Google when making Litecoin ?",

And from your own research.By the way, there is no guarantee. If the previous or other ICO/IEO is success and the next one is also success, you should know that and always with some risk management.",

People are too lazy to join and ask admin about the possibility of the ico to happen. You're also lazy too. Why don't you go to the official site and then try to join in the official group to get the latest news about sui? so many people these days are so lazy. I have even mentioned about the possibility for sui to launch ico.",
