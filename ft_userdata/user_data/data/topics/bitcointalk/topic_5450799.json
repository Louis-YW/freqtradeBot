In trading the term profit taking is used when traders exit from the market there's always a short-time dump in the market. Whales always play with the sentiments of weak hands. For example last week we saw a very volatile market and you know what whales took a lot of the Bitcoins from the market sold by the weak hands and now they gonna give them back to us at high prices.The point is Whales always win because they are the strong hands of the market, they use to grab each and every opportunity for the accumulation of Bitcoin. A very common piece of advice for the new ones from the seniors is the control emotions such as Fear and Greed and in my view, you can call the whales master of emotions. According the to report the recent market panic made whales more strong as the holders of Bitcoin from 100 Bitcoins to the 10K Bitcoins accumulated around 64K more Bitcoins.To prevent such type of a crisis you can consider these tips.-Go for DCA-Set realistic profit goals-Stay Informed of Events-Use the technical indicators",

      "body": "I wouldn’t say bitcoin has whales like the ones in Alticoins rather this are opportunists that believe in bitcoin and it’s potential. In Alticoins whales are just a few circle of people that control the network just like the Highest stakers in ethereum POS system. But in bitcoin they are hundreds of investors with that large amount of bitcoin in their possession, and as the number of large holders increase around the world it would be hard for a particular whale to control the market price. There are many things that control this market price and this supply and demand is just part of it. With bitcoin it is easier to get your hands on large number of the coin not like Alticoins. The only thing is the risky of losing, so there aren’t whales in bitcoin I would say since everyone has the same chance of getting bitcoin not Alticoins.",

But at the same time, people like you can me need to be careful with the market and always need to be aware of the whale's moves because we cant afford to lose more and moe.Also, Whales never get into FOMO and Panic situations they stay consistent and Hold when they are in Loss because their Financial power allow them to Hold for a Long period of time.Quote from: Doan9269 on May 01, 2023, 09:01:05 AMGood indicators to always follow, they will help towards achieving the best results when you're investing.

It won't grow in minutes or days.Bitcoin's 4-year cycle is the greatest gift to middle-class people by Satoshi. Learn and understand it, you won't regret it.",

The whales are not the one in charge of bitcoin price to rise and fall,bitcoin is a volatile asset and can only be affected by demand and supply. Whales can pump in as much funds into the market or make a sells of their investment, it wouldn't shake the market. However, if it is even possible for the whales to manipulate the market,it will last for only a short period of time.Bitcoin is decentralized and the price can't be manipulated by anyone. If bitcoin price dips,it is beneficial for both the whales and small investors because if you know the market analysis, you won't panic to sell. You will see it as an opportunity to accumulate more coins. The whales also sell of their investment too,bitcoin is a risky investment and whoever is involved in it can make profit or loss,it depends on the individual understanding on his bitcoin holdings be you a whale or a small investor.",

You are somewhat right as the whales can move the market in Altcoins but in Bitcoin they do not hold that much power to manipulate the market. The Bitcoin market is highly volatile and many of those whales will also lose their money if they try to pump it. There is no one who can exactly predict the Bitcoin price and if those whales are long term holders then they won't get affected as Bitcoin's price will reach all time high one day.QuoteWhales always play with the sentiments of weak hands. For example last week we saw a very volatile market and you know what whales took a lot of the Bitcoins from the market sold by the weak hands and now they gonna give them back to us at high prices.This is the way of the market and I agree with you on this point. However, the whales have already accumulated enough Bitcoin when its price went below $16K because most of them were aware that soon Bitcoin will cross $22k mark and that event happened sooner than their estimation. The ones you're referring as weak-hands are also making profit with scalping. Everyone earns differently in crypto market, but I would only call those people week-hands who sell their Bitcoin at loss.QuoteThe point is Whales always win because they are the strong hands of the market, they use to grab each and every opportunity for the accumulation of Bitcoin. A very common piece of advice for the new ones from the seniors is the control emotions such as Fear and Greed and in my view, you can call the whales master of emotions. According the to report the recent market panic made whales more strong as the holders of Bitcoin from 100 Bitcoins to the 10K Bitcoins accumulated around 64K more Bitcoins.That's true indeed, those who can't control their emotions in crypto-trading world will always lose because of the volatility. The greedy ones who want to get rich quick are always the ones who will sell with losses rather than getting any profits. Their greed turns into fear when they see the red candles, they want the green candles but without a proper trading plan and a well developed strategy they shouldn't even expect the green candles.",

Not all users who are bought Bitcoin is for trading, they're keep accumulating Bitcoin until they earn decent profit during bull market or hold until they die. Some people use Bitcoin to store their wealth, not for making quick profit.",

I think Traders can also consider diversifying their portfolio, investing in a range of cryptocurrencies and assets, to spread risk and reduce the impact of market fluctuations on their investments.",

We are just too far away.",
