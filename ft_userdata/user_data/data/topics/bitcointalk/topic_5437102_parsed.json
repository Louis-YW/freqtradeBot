Which is why we are here for, to see it through.To set the record straight, I am not against cryptocurrency in generals. What I'm against, and --borrowing your words-- have bad attitudes for, are scam projects. Speaking of which, I'm happy to prove your project are not what we think it is. Unfortunately, you're still unable to give me materials to prove it wrong. If you read through my first post here carefully, you'll be aware that I'm more concerned for the absence of your whitepaper instead of your medium-load-due-to-enormous-graphic.So, when can we expect it?
