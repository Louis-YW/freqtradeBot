Speaking of skill there are various ways or skills you can have in connection to Bitcoin or Crypto-currency in general that will be beneficial for you.You @op are the one who doesn't understand how bitcoin works. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, so it is very normal for investors who derive benefits from their investments in bitcoin to speculate the price of bitcoin at any point when there is a news or anything that might influence the price of bitcoin. I would have agreed with you if bitcoin was a stable asset whose price doesn't need to be talked about all the time.This is a forum for users to discuss everything about Bitcoin, including it's price. Therefore, you should learn to get used to it because you definitely would need the information to help you put up good strategies on when to buy, sell and hodl further.",

Bitcoin may go to zero or a million next year nobody knows that but with every passing day bitcoin stays above $0, the chances of $1 million happening is getting stronger. That’s the only thing I know about what’s going on.Don’t get too obsessed with the current pricing. Have a long term plan and keep DCA’ing. In 3-5 years you’ll thank yourself.If you think about the prices too much, you’ll make mistakes that’ll cost you serious money.",

If you feel it is not necessary to discuss then you should ignore it and try to see the board related to what you want. I actually feel that people who don't want to discuss Bitcoin are people who will not be successful in the future, and most of these people are people who don't have a good understanding of Bitcoin, so they think that discussing Bitcoin is not important. But in reality, people who discuss Bitcoin are usually smart, rich, and know about the future of Bitcoin, so they don't get bored talking about it, some of them are like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Michael Saylor, Changpeng Zhao, Donald Trump, Robert Kiyosaki and many others. They even discuss Bitcoin price predictions, so if you feel the discussion is unnecessary, then I think you need to reconsider it.",

Make Money without waiting by your skills its good and long term investment That all ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️That's what you call passive income. You accumulate Bitcoin overtime and wait for it to grow in the bull run. And yes, it's better to go and DCA and slowly building up your portfolio and look for the bigger picture. As it is the best method to make money. Of course you can also trade short term, but you need skills and capital and it's not very easy for beginners.",
