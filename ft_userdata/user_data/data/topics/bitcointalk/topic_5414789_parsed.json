  "content": "Is there a Coup going on in China? Over the past hours there have been rumours of that; it is said that president Xi Jinping is under some form of house arrest, there is no concrete evidence yet about that, but hardly is there any concrete evidence of anything that happens in China because of how their government is run. There are some reasons people believe something amiss is going on in this period in China, you will see some of the reasons in the link i will share on the story.I don't personally think there is a Coup happening in China, Xi is a very powerful man and it is very unlikely that his government will be removed from power through a coup, i know some or many of you have seen this news, what do you make of it?Is there a coup going on in china: https://www.outlookindia.com/international/fact-check-is-china-having-a-coup-and-is-xi-jinping-under-house-arrest-here-is-what-we-know-news-225623/amp",

Turns out that wasn't entirely true as there were some flights over Beijing. They said public transportation was also canceled but I haven't seen any reputable news agencies confirm whether that was true either. Looks only to be twitter speculation.You'd need a lot of firepower to remove Xi Jinping.",

Seems like a lot of Asian countries have high compliance from the government so it doesn't really matter. I think why China was so successful with their lockdowns was this urgent sense of compliance. Their population conforms to whatever demands the CCP has for them even if they're treated as inferior. The Western way of doing things, or so at least I thought until COVID happened, was a giant middle finger to the government when they engage in tyranny. The West caved in like a house of cards to the government's demands in 2020 so I don't have as much admiration. It took something like 6 months until they finally began to resist.Quote from: tvbcof on September 25, 2022, 05:25:03 AMJust incorporate and plan to collapse the CCP from within.How would Taiwan do so?",
