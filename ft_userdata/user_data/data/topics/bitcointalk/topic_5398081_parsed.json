Just check out seclog, there are hundreds of accounts that wake up or reset their passwords each dayI know it might have been a hard day for you and the user might have been so annoying but you might need more evidence to pin the userJust wondering, who would want to buy a newbie account with little activity and no merits, yet they can simply just create one?",

First, your reference link is off-topic (kuddos for proper use of the Anchor though).Someone's opinion on address reuse doesn't warrant negative feedback. See:Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.Quote from: death_wish on May 10, 2022, 07:19:59 PMcryptocoinex is a bad person.Quote from: cryptocoinex on May 09, 2022, 08:27:39 AMQuote from: BlackHatCoiner on May 09, 2022, 08:10:31 AMGenerally, don't reuse addresses.Nothing to hide (and you can`t find any information other than i have couple of bitcoins since 2014 on multiple address). Nothing illegal done with them. You, personally, are scum worse than a criminal.You are a cancer to Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and all that is good in this world.  You are the reason why decent people have no privacy, while criminals enjoy as much privacy as they want.  You are a mouthpiece spewing poisonous propaganda to benefit the worst criminals on Earth.How did you go from cryptocoinex saying he has nothing to hide to the worst criminals benefiting from him? Many people (including myself) have posted different addresses on Bitcointalk, that's okay. Many people say they have nothing to hide, which I'm sure is incorrect. Everyone has things they prefer to keep private. Don't take it too literal.",

Looks like we have bunches of newbie know better than the old timers who are here form years about what is happening recently in the forum LOL",
