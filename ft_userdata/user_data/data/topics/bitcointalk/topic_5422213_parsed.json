A cryptography expert, or a software engineer with expertise in cryptocurrency projects?Quote from: riqo on November 19, 2022, 03:01:04 PMThe project is about the Internet Listing Service,or ILS an online real estate search database, showing properties and units that are for rent or sale.As I usually respond in this sub-board: you'll have to be more explanatory. What, how, why?What's the service you want to setup? Point me the problem you're about to solve with cryptocurrencies and a real estate database.",

What will be the difference with your service, asides payment made in cryptocurrency?",

Or at least you plan to have that as one of the aspects. Gotta say that what you are trying to do is very ambitious and not easy at all so good luck buddy.",

Second part is true as well, they use tokens based on Ethereum and each house they mint separate tokens. Anyway, I think that it is good for your business that there are already successful projects around doing something similar, meaning there is the interest for it and even maybe a chance to learn from them.",

And another problem is the taxes, each country have it own laws about this topic, and that makes it complex for this kind of sites.",

Therefore I am looking for a team to be able to develop ideas and implement them into reality.Especially people with entrepreneurial visions who are experts in cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, in order to create a solid team and change the world.The project is about the Internet Listing Service,or ILS an online real estate search database, showing properties and units that are for rent or sale.What we could do to improve that system? Implementing just sales,buys and trades via crypto.Thats is just a tinny part for the startup project!If you are a crypto programmer or a cyptomaniac feel free to private message me and join us for this rideRespectfully RiqoGreetings Rigo and welcome to the world of crypto project development!I do not want to sound negative or bring down your mood but before you start looking for people for a project you need to make your pitch convincing. Otherwise why would anyone be interested in joining in this campaign? Imagine yourself in the shoes of the opposite side. Why would you join this project? The first question that would be good to ask yourself is: Why does your project need blockchain or crypto? Can it be done without? What are the use cases? How much funding are you working with? What are your experiences with starting crypto projects?If these questions are hard to answer then you will find that people will not be interested in joining your team.",

      "body": "Hey Riqo,Your idea to implement crypto and blockchain technology on Real Estate listing site is really seems to have good potential, as most business are already adapting crypto into their business.Let me write the overview of this project, based on your requirement.1. Real estate based Listing Service(eg zillow), where user can list their properties with property information and their wish to sell or rent...etc2. The listed properties will be shown to the users in the property list page, here they can choose any.3. The Buyer of the property pays in Crypto (BitCoin Or Ethereum or any, we can either do this with Centralized wallet or decentralized.4. We can also implement escrow service, where the buyers fund will be staked in a smart contract(admin), and will be released to the seller only after the paper works are properly done.5. We can have auto-debit service for rental properties6. We can implement map like GIS (Geographical Information System), where any one around the world can access to the look the properties based on it's geography.7. I think we can make an MVP first and then scale the product with additional ideas to make the business efficient.I'm a fullstack developer, working along with my team,can help you on bringing this project to life, if we have more accurate plan and scope. We are more into crypto based development such as Dapps, DeFi, DAO, NFT, Smart Conract Development...etcYou can check my git here: https://github.com/TrasherTravisIf you wish to discuss further with me if you are interested, please DM TG: Travis_BZ , Discord: Travis#9295 | email: trashertravis@gmail.comThank you!",

I don't think that you are presenting all the details, but for example, the financing of the entire project is a very important thing.those who would participate in the development of such a service, surely want to know how they can benefit from everything. Whether through a later partnership, payment after fundraising or whatever. it's not a bad idea for a business, but in addition to the development of the platform itself, there is still a lot of administrative work and arrangements, and many good ideas got stuck because of the bad setting of the whole plan.",
