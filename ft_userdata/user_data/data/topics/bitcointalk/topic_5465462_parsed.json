I did thought of creating the same topic on our local board, later on forgot. Good to see you created this topic on our board as there are a few topic that I think missed the recognition on our board. I am planning to post those topics on that thread. I am quoting the rules from the that thread. If anyone is planning to report a post on it please follow these basic rules.Quote from: hugeblack on August 31, 2023, 02:23:03 PMRules:  - Follow the format below. - This is for Local boards only. - Maximum 10 links. - Add only topics/replies with 0 merits. - You are allowed to add topics/replies from any user as long as they are in the same local board. - You may get Merits if the links you shared here are useful. - You can participate once per month, if you repeat the participation more than once per month, added links will be deleted and you may get natural trust. - I have the right to add new rules, not to send merits, and to delete replies.",

Yes, there are a lot of submissions by the Nigerian board that does not mean he won't look into your post. As per the last update he is out of Merits for now and will get them in 5 day's time. You can submit your post with max 10 topics on that thread. Do check the rules and the format before submitting.",

(6 out of 10 submission received merits) now just 19 merits needed to reach full member.I just wanted to remind you guys that you also should include your posts or others whichever you think deserves merits and didn't get any so that we can manage to maintain the merit inflow to our local board, especially our merit source Heisenberg_Hunter is not active.I insist you guys to do because it seems more members back and engaging in the discussion recently so that we will get back our Indian community to further on bitcointalk and used to be like years back.",

I was going through the thread of hugeblack and found something encouraging written there.Quote from: hugeblack on September 19, 2023, 12:32:55 PMMost of the contributions were from the Nigerian LB, which I believe that after these solutions they obtained enough merits. There are a few contributions from other LBs, but if there is any LB that suffers from a problem in the distribution of merit, I hope that a trusted member to PM me.I am going ahead and sending him a DM to take a look at our board.",
