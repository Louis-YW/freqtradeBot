Doing freelancing is also a work but with a different context. Some would call it a hobby since its not their profession, but if you do something and earn fiat ouy of it then might be considered a job. If you are getting crypto and can convert that into money then its almost the same. But not the typical job of course.",

By being official, it means there are documents and contracts signed. There are full benefits and rights and everything like the normal employee we knew as prescribed by our laws. Even some informal workers have signed contracts too but no full benefits and they aren't long-term.You can include forum work experience to your resume but only when you believe it is beneficial to the job you are applying for.",

If you have solid services to provide, you can make your Service announcement thread there.For companies, their representative usually creates an account on the forum with username that is matched with their company. In addition, they don't have enough time to wait and build up their account up to Junior member rank in order to display images in their posts. Therefore, they will buy Copper Membership to get some privileges exclusively displaying images.Remember to do thisQuote from: theymos on November 11, 2017, 06:01:16 AMOnce you have it, you get the choice:QuoteWould it be considered as formal work even though I think it's more like freelancing?

This can include either written contracts or verbal agreements between the employer and employee. Formal workplaces may request that employees wear a specific uniform or follow a dress code. Employees may work in an office or in another formal workspace. This means that a formal workplace is typically one where employees usually:    Wear professional attire    Keep regular working hours    Work in the same place every day    Earn a regular salary or hourly wageNo one need to wear any professional attire to join signature campaign, you can post without any clothes or pants.There's no specific rules that we need to post in x hours etc, you can post at any time.You don't need to be in the same place to make a post, you could even post when you're still take a bath.It doesn't met the criteria of formal work, so signature campaign isn't a formal work.",

Signature Campaign management is just above posting in threads and getting payment, I believe CM have additional experience in data gathering and analysis, skilled in computer knowledge include spreadsheet, basic computer skills, design, programming including Microsoft Excel charts.

Besides, this isn't even a formal place of work. You can loosely say it's a place people can earn, and then mean it to be informal. Whether people make a living here or not, I would say they do.

I'd say it's formal if you have expertise in providing services to other users like creating logos, code signature, creating ann thread, campaign management service, creating website or something like that. But if what is meant by formal is being a participant in the signature campaign, I don't think it's the right choice.Being a participant in a signature campaign doesn't mean you have a job. Of course it gets you results, but I wouldn't say it's work. But perhaps that mindset can differ among other signature campaign participants.",
