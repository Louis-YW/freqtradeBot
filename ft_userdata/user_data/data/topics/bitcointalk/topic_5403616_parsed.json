It's looks like changing the default font face \"verdana\" to other font when clicking the option which solves nothing coz it's there to be changed.If there's something need to update in that posting tags option, i guess its the \"url\" tag, make the \"=\" as default there and looks like Code:[url =][/url]since it's needed and its one of the used tags.",

Usually, red can be use for text, not for highlight (glow) effect.Paint your text or highlight it should be used when it is really necessary. If it is over use, just like capitalize text, it will cause side effects and make your post is very annoying.

      "body": "I am trying to remember a post that uses the glow affect, but honestly I can't do it. I have no doubt that people are using the code though, and I agree with OP's suggestion. If given a choice between using the red or the yellow color, I would rather pick yellow. It looks more pleasant with the background color of the forum and isn't as aggressive as the red one. Even the pink and orange ones are easier to look at. The only ones worse than red are the navy blue and maroon options if your text is black. Yuck.",
