PM or whatever is easier to use, can even phone me if prefered. its not a trite and youll see why.  Dont know who to contact, have attempted, no reply. Since its the most serious of matters i found it only fitting to please my request here.. I dont ask for much but i am now for this .... thank you.  Contact theymos or Cyrus. If your matter is serious enough both will reply.Alternatively try DMing one of the mods from the list of all mods available if the admins dont reply quick enough. The mods may help you if they are capable of or forward your message to the admins above..Edit(1st dec.): Did someone take your matter into account? Curious to know what exactly happened..",

      "body": "Sorry about the late reply..  thank you for pointing me in the right direction. I was able to confirm what i already knew occurred and this will be a legal matter ..i dont want to spill into other areasI did ask for help from a mod 5x and did not answer me.. besides that having my claim and key to be used , then doubted has made me weary on whom to trust. i just need someone who wants fairness and can validate ... not belittle and try to obscure the facts. I dont know if i should  go the police or federal or what.. I will poke them both now and ask for a phone call .. it was something wonderful that i am sorry turned into this and taken under the guise of help.. Again thank you ed really.how is that so hard you guys ..more so i have to post here since i dont want a circus and not be irrationally blamed or nonsense assertions.",
