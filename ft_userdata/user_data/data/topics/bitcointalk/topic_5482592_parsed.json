Bitcoin has used the ETF new and the up coming halving for the market hype, which was among the factors that contributed to the price of bitcoin going up due to the high volume of accumulation that people were acquiring. Now that the ETF has been approved, the market has reacted in the opposite direction, which was not what many expected, and many have also sold out their holdings, taking profit from what they bought earlier before the market went up, so the market is just trying to correct itself before we can start seeing a real positive price again. Adding to the fact that miners are on their  selling mode  in the past few days, the market have every reason to drop down for now we might even see more of this in the coming days.",

I think what's happening right now is partly this pattern. Of course there's still the effect of the sell-off brought by the decision of the SEC approving Bitcoin spot ETF applications. The rest is probably caused by the reaction sellers, those who sold because there's a sell-off. This is indeed a good time to buy especially since the halving is fast approaching.",

Because of massive anticipation, price already soared a lot in four latest months in 2023.Now, it makes sense to have correction, even big correction after four consecutive green months and just three months before Bitcoin halving in April 2024.This correction so far is still smaller than what I believe it should be.Bitcoin historical corrections from all time highs. They are corrections from all time highs but you can find similar big corrections from peaks.",

      "body": "Nothing wrong with DCA as we go, but a lot of people don't take into account that \"buying a dip\" is a varied mental calculus. For example, you might measure that \"dip\" against your volume targets and apply accordingly. Looking horizontally, I have three positions left that I'm looking to add to vertically to hit my remaining volume targets.  Anyone in a similar circumstance might look at those total-sum decisions rather than \"just buy the BTC dip\". For example, is this \"dip\" actually worth going apeshit over? Are you going to buy ten percent of a BTC when at 40k the same ten percent is only a grand more to scramble for? When, by comparison, your 3800 bucks right now could create volume in something like XLM or ADA where your current portfolio is striving to amass 115,000 coins? Or LINK where you were striving to amass 1,115?My point?  Unless all you buy is BTC, buying the dip should be allocated according to the dip. Using the \"10% of a BTC\" example, your 3800 bucks might get you further on a higher-volume project at this time, especially when you'll still land that 10% of a BTC within reason even at 55k a coin.I'm not saying that any of the mini-thesis here in the thread are wrong, but rather just giving some total-sum thought to consider in the mental algebra for anyone who read it.",

During the Covid pandemic, bitcoin rose in price as governments printed money to save the economy and online investing became trendy at the time because people had no other jobs when the pandemic hit. During the pandemic, not only bitcoin but other financial markets such as stocks and foreign exchange also grew well.For news ETFs, this is good news for the market in the long term, but in the short term, the \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" effect is happening. Furthermore, bitcoin's correction is completely reasonable as no market goes up forever, and bitcoin has been rising for months so it's no surprise that a correction is happening now.",
