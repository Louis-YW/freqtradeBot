In fact, I believe I've only ever seen around 5 Electrum plugins or so in total.1. Would it have to be integrated with a web service that provides CJ addresses?2. How many transactions would be required to make for a safe CJ?3. If not using a web service, how to coordinate the address receipents so that you eventually get the BTC back in your wallet?",

ElectronCash (fork that works for bcash) had a mixing option but I never checked the details though.",

Electrum client simply send list of address to Electrum Server and Electrum client use clearnet by default.I'm guessing then that the more immediate problem of \"make Electrum servers at least talk using self-signed generated certificates\" needs to be solved first before attempting this one, right? That is assuming that Electrum Server impls need to be patched to support CJ feature.QuoteAdditionally, answer to your question heavily depends on what kind of CoinJoin you're talking about. You might want to read about WabiSabi protocol at https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/blob/master/protocol.md.That will be some good reading for me.",

In fact, I believe I've only ever seen around 5 Electrum plugins or so in total.I remember that Electrum wallet had Chipmixer plugin few years ago, and I am not sure if that is still working today but I would like to have something like this available.However, that doesn't mean scammers won't try to attack people with this in similar way like they are attacking clearnet website all the time.Quote from: NotATether on May 09, 2022, 07:08:05 AMWould it have to be integrated with a web service that provides CJ addresses?Making something like this for Electrum would probably end up working similar like Wasabi wallet, and that could put Electrum developers under heavy pressure.How about doing something totally new for bitcoin privacy, instead of inventing wheel all over again when we know already know results.Quote from: pooya87 on May 09, 2022, 10:46:14 AMElectronCash (fork that works for bcash) had a mixing option but I never checked the details though.I saw how that is working and it would be unusable in Bitcoin network because fees for that would be much hire than with Bcash.It does sound cool that you can just click a button in your wallet, leave your coins and get them back broken in smaller chunks that are not connected with original address.I think they call it CashFusion, but problem is that other wallet are not supporting this",
