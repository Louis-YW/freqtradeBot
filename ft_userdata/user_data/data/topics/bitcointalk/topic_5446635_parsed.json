  "content": "Some clarification is needed to this board due to the recent incident with ChipMixer. To all advocates of anti-anonymous Bitcoin and Internet tools: Bitcoin mixing is NOT money laundering, per se.Definition of money laundering:Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_launderingMoney laundering is the process of illegally concealing the origin of money, obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, embezzlement or gambling, by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime. Definition of Bitcoin mixing:Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_tumblerA cryptocurrency tumbler or cryptocurrency mixing service[1] is a service that mixes potentially identifiable or \"tainted\" cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source.Unless you think that every potentially identifiable coin is obtained illegally (which would be false), Bitcoin mixing does not equate with Bitcoin laundering. While it is possible to launder, hereby conceal the origins of money from an illegal activity, it is not a money laundering service, in the same manner that while it is possible to terrorize with the assistance of end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer protocols, such a messenger is not a terrorism service. When you mix coins, not only do you just not want from the rest to know your business; you want them to know you want to conceal it. It can be a completely conscious decision from any person; criminal or not. If you don't respect this dignify-respecting technique which strengthens individuals' privacy, say it, but say it right; \"I don't want that much privacy\". Prepare to receive an infinite amount of deprecation from privacy advocates afterwards, but clear it up.P.S.: You can't have privacy without money laundering due to the nature of humans-- by the way, the opposite does not necessarily hold true.",

      "body": "Bitcoin mixing (Bitcoin mixing or Bitcoin tumbling) is a technique used to hide the identity of Bitcoin users. When using Bitcoin, transactions are publicly stored on the blockchain and can be tracked by anyone. The use of Bitcoin mixing helps to mask users' Bitcoin addresses and makes it harder to track transactions. However, the use of Bitcoin mixing can also be used to launder money and the funds are used to fund illegal activities. Therefore, the use of Bitcoin mixing completely depends on the intended use of the user. If used correctly, Bitcoin mixing is not money laundering.And unfortunately our behavior is at the root of the problem, I find that people love to blame products when it is the user who is responsible for that behavior. What I find funny is that the law enforcement agencies keep pretending that they only see the wrongdoing of these products and blame it.",

It is usually a key operation of organized crime.This is not part of what we are discussing, but why Wikipedia is referring gambling as an illegal activity? If gambling is not legalized in some countries, that does not mean that many countries do not support gambling. In fact, there are some countries that see bitcoin and other crypto to be illegal, but that does not mean cryptocurrencies are not legal. Most countries support bitcoin and many countries are supporting gambling. Gambling is legal.Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_tumblerA cryptocurrency tumbler or cryptocurrency mixing service[1] is a service that mixes potentially identifiable or \"tainted\" cryptocurrency funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source.That is why some criminals that know about mixers are using it. But the point is that not only criminals are using mixers. Even some people that are using mixers took their bitcoin from a platform that is centralized and mix it before sending it to their wallet. Some people may prefer to use a mixer after dust attack. There also several good reasons people are using mixers. Some people do not just take their privacy to play. Some people do not play with privacy because they see it as a way of having full freedom.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on March 28, 2023, 01:25:43 PMUnless you think that every potentially identifiable coin is illegal (which would be false), Bitcoin mixing does not equate with Bitcoin laundering.

I have not read anything like that also from other countries.This is what they are doing, they look for any illegal mixing and expose the mixer, but no country is going against mixers in any country without valid evidence of illegal mixing.",

Thank you for making some clarification between the two so that those who are not clear for the two different concepts will understand it well. What Happened to Chipmixer is that the company's owner was involved in money laundering and that was why the company was seized and not the company was involved the money laundering. Money laundry can never be a service but it is an act which carry out by individuals while mixing is a serve render to serve humanity. Therefore, nobody should misconceptualize what happened in Chipmixer to another bitcoin mixing companies.",

If they follow it, that means they are no more mixers but another thing else.But I am wondering why mixers are allowed on sites like bitcointalk and no regulatory ban.Just like I said, gambling is not legalized in all countries in the world. Cryptocurrencies are not legalized in a countries of the world, there are over 10 countries in the world that completely ban cryptocurrencies. Because something is not legal in one country, that does not mean it is illegal in another country. We can just take it that mixers are not illegal. But if they see it having illegal mixing, there is possibility that it would be taken down.",

So using Mixing service will not allow them achieve their goal and as such they will definitely be against the service which they can't render a direct attack to any mixing platform since they are not registered or licensed by any regulatory authority, all they just want it a reason to attack mixing platform and that reason is to link it to money laundering and if they can validate any proof that a crime was committed using the platform then they have all they need to attack.  Which is why most people are seeing mixing as money laundering platform because of the Fud the Fed's and others Bitcoin haters are spreading regarding Bitcoin. A real Bitcoiner will definitely know that mixing primary goal is to protect holders privacy, and has nothing to do with money laundering.",

      "body": "There's a lot of contradictory statements coming from governments when it comes to mixing.They claimed that chipmixer helped to launder \"money\" but most governments don't count bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies as money. Their laws don't protect bitcoin theft the way it protects money. A good example of this is insider trading happening with bitcoin all around the world, recently Binance was accused of doing it. If something like this was done with fiat money or stocks you'd see the agencies coming for you very fast, but since it's crypto they barely care. The only reason they're going after CZ is to make it harder for Americans to buy bitcoin when the banks are in trouble. They think that scaring people away from bitcoin will be beneficial for dying banks and should prevent a bank run. If bitcoin is not money and you can trade it like you trade gift cards or game tokens, why were people put in jail for money transmitting without a license? How come some politicians treat it as gift cards or game tokens and others want you to apply for licenses and forbid you to make it hard to trace? IMO mixers have the right to exist and be used by citizens of a country, especially as long as bitcoin isn't a recognized and accepted currency in that country. If it becomes fully regulated they can make it clear whether it is money and if that money is allowed to be made untraceable by people who want to use it for open, legal, payments in the country.You either regulate and accept it, or you don't accept it and we do what we want with it just as we play around with game currencies and casino chips.",

Concealing is not yet laundering.Let's say you have money from a legal source but you don't want your spouse or family to know about it. You get a friend to lend you his account, send money there and get him to withdraw money at the ATM and give you cash. All legal, but the money has been mixed.Making it harder to find the source of money, by moving it through different banks and multiple bank accounts is not a crime, as long as the money wasn't obtained illegally. Quote But whatever the case, crypto by nature does have the anonymity aspect to it and the origin of the coins matter less and makes it difficult to define money laundering in this context.It does, as long as you don't use a centralized exchange or a service that sends money to your bank account. Here's where it becomes interesting and you have to realize 2 things:1. Mixing crypto is not illegal. 2. Fiat money belongs to the government. When you exchange crypto to fiat, it's like accepting government's ToS. You agree to use THEIR money and you must obey all laws regarding it. As long as you get crypto, for instance by gambling in a casino, participating in a signature campaigns, giveaways, raffles, you can freely mix it. You cannot be sentenced for using a mixer! What is illegal then and when can you be taken to court?It becomes complicated the moment you exchange bitcoin to fiat money. When you do it, you sell your mixed coins that can technically (but don't have to) come from illegal sources, into fiat money, that is supposed to be clean and legal, and doesn't belong to you. This is the important part, a fiat owner is just a user, but the government is in control, unlike with bitcoin where you're the user and the owner. By exchanging (potentially) dirty laundered coins into fiat, in the eyes of the government you're tainting that fiat, THEIR fiat.",
