It is not Satoshi's key, the name and email address are just entered by the user and not validated. Then they signed a message that says \"I created Bitcoin, I am Satoshi Nakamoto - Craig Wright\" -- that's what the BEGIN PGP MESSAGE part decodes to.Because they're incompetent with PGP or trying to be intentionally confusing they didn't use the clearsign option, so you have to decode the message to see the text being signed which is probably contributing to confusion.

It does not expire so theoretically he could come back and prove he's still around with it if he wanted to (though peeps would be rightly skeptical w/o additional proof).",
