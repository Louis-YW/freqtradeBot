Depending on the lenders prefrance, maybe someone is comfortable giving 0.01 or 0.02 im down with both.Well those are some pretty wild accusations, should have made this a self modarated topic !!!!  No Im not farming a scam strategy. Although It will be good to get some trust feedback here.@Drivewfcker12345Please dont spam my thread with profanity,those reviews on your profile are 100% accurate, you are very nosy in others bussines.",
