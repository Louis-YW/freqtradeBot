      "body": "Welcome to the board! Most of us here are Bitcoin investors. It's great to see that you were able to convince your parents to invest some cash in Bitcoin. I know it wasn't easy to convince them. However, just make sure that your holdings are secure with a non-custodial wallet. Do not store your funds in any exchange or centralized wallet. It would be better if you could afford to get a hardware wallet. I am not sure if you can make money until the end of December since Bitcoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency. But, if you intend to hold for a longer time, you will definitely be a gainer. We will wait to hear from you during the next bull run",

While I give you applause for doing that, but it made me sort of worried about what you've said guaranteeing your parents telling them by December you'll have more, and they gave you additional money to invest again.I think this is a wrong approach to say that you're guaranteeing and giving timeframes on when you shall profit because nobody knows how and when the bull run will start. The market is volatile and no one can predict accurately if by that time it's going to be a better month for bitcoin. Although in the past, we've seen runs that have been so good at the end of the year. But as said, we don't know if by that time it what will be as you've expected. Explain to your parents also the risk of investing in bitcoin and what it is with volatility and you should be patient while waiting for that time to come. Nevertheless, if you're short term and you're foreseeing out of the market by December I think that will change.",

First, I had to say congratulations for successfully investing in Bitcoin; you are now a true member of the Bitcoin community. You may have been aware that Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and perhaps it is good to be hopeful for price appreciation, but price movement is not regulated by anyone, so telling your parents that you will make a big profit before or on December is not really guaranteed. Bitcoin investment is really a good investment because if you hold until the market is bullish again, you will make a profit, and perhaps you should plan to hold till next year should the price you expect to sell at by December not be what you see. Good luck! Also, endeavor to make your security a priority and beware of scammers.",

I suppose you are holding for a long term so that you could make big and good profit from your holdings but I must tell you this, you should not keep you coin in third party exchange so as not to loose your assets if there be any occurrences. Store your bitcoin in a safe hard ware wallet so that no one can access it and also do well to write down the private keys to your wallet so as to get it back if your device get lost,stolen or crash. This would help you more. Remember \" not your keys, not your coin\"Safe guard your bitcoin.",

You are welcome to the Bitcoin Investors' League. You made the right decision because Bitcoin is the most valuable and consistent coin. I would have been disappointed if you bought another coin. Enjoy your celebrations QuoteI have tried my best to be part of the Bitcoin investors because I have read a lot of news and heard some little stories where Bitcoin blesses a lot of people, so I decided to be one of them and now my parents also gave me money to invest in it because I told them from now till December I will have more than what I invested so they agreed and gave me some money to invest also. You said you heard stories of how people make money from Bitcoin and you decided to invest. I hope you know that most of these stories are incomplete. Some of them bought Bitcoin when it was very cheap and they made some profit after selling them. Some of them also lost when they sold below their buying price. You should understand rhat It is not a get-rich-quick scheme because it requires patience and risk-taking. You can't predict the price of Bitcoin in December because it is volatile and unpredictable. You need to go and explain to your family members that you might make a profit, or loss or remain neutral by December. You have no guarantee that you will make a profit. Your investment plan is short, some bitcoiners have up to above five years plans.",

I hope you intend to hold for long and not selling of so soon,because if you hold for long,you will make a better profit in the bull run than if you are investing on short term since you said December.Welcome to the cryptospace and you should be careful to keep your coin under your control and not in an exchange. Your parents are open to adopt new ideas for them to give you some money to invest. A noncustodial wallet is the best to keep your coin safe. Also remember that not your keys,not your coins.",

Good for you, I think your timing is right to invest right now, I know that the price might be too expensive for the majority of us including me. But you can start small, or at least what you can afford to lose.Quote from: rachael9385 on April 06, 2023, 08:46:17 PMI have tried my best to be part of the Bitcoin investors because I have read a lot of news and heard some little stories where Bitcoin blesses a lot of people, so I decided to be one of them and now my parents also gave me money to invest in it because I told them from now till December I will have more than what I invested so they agreed and gave me some money to invest also. I will advise you though to become a long term holder, and not just in December. We are waiting for the most important activity in Bitcoin which is the halving. I urge you to research about it as well. And based on history, halving is the catalyst for a bull run, so the growth is expected to happen between 2024-2025. So might be better to just HODL.",

They might change their views on Bitcoin if it fail to increase by that December. I agree, it is better to wait for the result before telling someone that you got profit from your investment.  Although Bitcoin price might be higher on December, possibly because of the hype of the incoming halving, it is still unknown area whether the price will go up or down by that time since we all know, Bitcoin price and market movement is unpredictable.  So you could have keep quiet until your investment shows profit.Anyway, congratulation on your first Bitcoin investment.  Just wanted to let you know that exercising patience in one of the keys of successful investment in Bitcoin market.",

Congratulations to you my friend as you have taken your first step into a wonderful journey you want to embark on with crypto, as advice by other members it's not advisable you leave your coins in any exchange platform as you are not the only one with the keys to the funds because exchange platform are somewhat control by a central body and once they experience any breakdown your coins will be affected too so it's better you save it in a platform where you have total control over it e.g a non custodial wallet like electrum which most forum users here use including myself.",

Welcome into this volatile world! We do really need up that recognition and adoption in speaking about Bitcoin or entire crypto space because we know that if there would really be more demand then it would really meaning about having high value or prices of Bitcoin itself.One thing that you shouldnt really do is to give out guarantees specially into someone when it comes to value or earnings because we dont know on December whether the value of BItcoin is low compared on what we do have now on which you would be having problems on what you would explain into your parents.Never ever make up some guarantees.",

Just keep getting more of it and keep holding it until you are ready and able to spend it, likely when it is worth many times its current value.",

It is always a good feeling whenever we get to buy our first bitcoin, the excitement is always real, so I say congratulations to you mate..But an advice I believe you might find out it's important is that, don't expect much from your bitcoin investment, you did not state the amount of bitcoin you now own, but still, don't expect much if your target is from now till December this year, as you said in the op, bitcoin investment always has a higher chance of paying off if you make a long term investment, but for an investment that is targeted to be withdrawn by december this year, don't expect much from it for it can only pay off if there is major bull season before that time.",

Nice to see you happy just own Bitcoin, but think as an investor it must be logical, so If the price didn't come as your expected you have to accept it, because as far as I know many newbies come in the Bitcoin world just follow his idol or friend, so that if bitcoin price dump, that newbie got scared and sold all asset unthinkingly. This is I see happen many times because they aren't real investor even they said with sure and confidently like you.",
