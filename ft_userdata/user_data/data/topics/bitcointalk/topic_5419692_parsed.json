It belongs to Reputation board.I'm pretty sure the topic is about humorous parts of members' profiles in general, not coinzat's in particular--so I think this thread is right where it belongs in Meta.There are only a small handful of avatars I remember, with one of them being Vod's and the boob-licking thing.¬† It isn't laugh-out-loud funny, but it's amusing and he's been using it for years (and maybe even since he registered, I don't know).¬† Another was Phinnaeus Gage's avatar, which isn't so much funny as it is interesting.¬† If any of you don't know the story behind the real Phineas Gage, take a look at the wikipedia article on him--talk about one hell of a bad ass, taking an iron bar right through the skull and carrying on like a boss.Yet another avatar I find interesting is MPOE-PR's.¬† I don't know who the hell that woman is, but I always found her sexy as hell and for some reason whenever I saw posts from MPOE-PR they always seemed like they were coming from that chick (and I don't think she's who's behind the account).¬† Anyway, that account got banned years ago for some reason I don't recall.",
