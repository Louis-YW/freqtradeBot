I sincerely believe that writing a reply or creating a topic with the aim of obtaining merits is the best way of not receiving any for the post in question; this is often obvious and is not very appreciable. The primary purpose of the forum is the exchange of information and useful advices, Bitcointalk is not intended to be a race for merits to obtain X rank or enter in a signature campaign quickly.Just take your time!

Now you just look forward the posts and if you think this post is special or helpful or contains something unique you may give him merits.

There are those who think getting merit is very easy, there are also those who think getting merit is very difficult. Why is that? It's all caused by the mindset and knowledge of each member in this forum, which is very different. All of that can be seen, in outline, from the rank it has. So, for you to get merit it might be very difficult, but for other members, getting merit is not necessarily difficult and some even get it very easily. So if you are in a position like this (find it difficult to get merit), you have to learn more, especially definitely about crypto/bitcoin, and have to learn about grammar/writing. Because if you keep learning, and are very understanding about it, maybe it's most likely to get merit, it won't be too difficult. And don't forget, all of that you have to do happily, and don't feel forced to do it.",

They're many attributes to it, and not getting merits doesn't mean a user is not learning in the forum. A good learner may not be able to construct quality contents in the forum and they'll end up receiving lesser merits, since their content may not meet the criteria required to keep the clearn like word structuring, good descriptions etc. Hence, we get the merit to rank up, which shows the person behind the account how useful they've been to the forum, and if not satisfying they can decide to add more flairs to their writing or upgrade their bitcoin knowledge, by mastering other parts of bitcoin.",

The 55 merits that you have earned are the result of your hard work so far in producing quality posts. I think you haven't released all the potential you have, try to try harder to go to Full Member.

All it takes is to produce a good quality post in both form and content. The most important element is that you do not think about merit points while writing a post because you cannot anticipate the reaction of others, and it is not permissible to request that from anyone.Believe me, the most difficult period to obtain merit points was the period following the announcement of the launch of the merit system as an additional condition for upgrading membership. At that time, there were no merit sources, and no one had a significant number of smerit points to send. I remember I was Sr member at the time and only got 3 smerit points.

Some members that lack merit in my view focus on their local boards and most of these boards don't have merit sources that can distribute merit there. But I have seen many members being rewarded with merit for answering questions, contributing to posts, and starting quality threads. For me, the best option will be to contribute to the forum as much as you can and don't focus on getting merit while making your comments. Your focus should be to add value to the forum and gradually merit will come.
