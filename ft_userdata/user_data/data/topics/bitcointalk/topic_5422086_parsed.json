The question is always relevant, but people's answers look like a conversation with the void. Whoever created this thread has been blocked. Some dumb newbie recently brought up some old threads and all the users gleefully started pushing them further, completely oblivious to the date of the first post. I complained several times about necroposting, but posts are being deleted selectively.Does the forum need such topics? And how do we stop their discussion? Is it fair to complain about someone who quotes the author, knowing full well that quite a lot of time has passed? Is anyone interested in answers to a question that was asked a very long time ago?",

For example, an old thread can be revived if new relevant information surfaces, in which case I believe it is better than creating a new one. That's not to say that all old threads are worth re-opening; some topics have been done to death, and no matter how much \"new\" information is posted, it won't make a difference. If a thread is so far off topic or filled with spam that it qualifies as beating a dead horse, then reporting it to moderators may be the best option.",

In some cases such posts will be deleted, and the thread will be locked by the moderator.As long as it's fairly substantial, and contributes to the discussion it doesn't matter all that much. The problem is, we've got several threads being bumped that were posted back in 2013, 2012, 2011, and with no actual contribution whatsoever. Contribution doesn't just mean being substantial, and not be classed as good quality, but it has to add something to the conversation, and typically this isn't done a lot when you go a certain amount of time back. However, there's plenty of examples of users necroposting correctly. It doesn't always warrant a new thread, although I'd say in the majority of the cases it's probably the better idea.",

Urgency and something important I should consider instead of creating a new thread for the same discussion.There are a lot of old threads bumping by newbies lately, I know they are useless because something they post is not substantial. All user need to avoid it, because chances are that if this newbie post gets deleted for being reported then the post below it will also be deleted.",

This is correct for most of the cases, although there would be outliers where the conversation was rightly bumped up and users are contributing new and relevant pieces of information to any who is still interested in the topic.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on November 18, 2022, 10:07:46 AMDoes the forum need such topics?

Even I had some experience that their post didn't deleted after the report for s while or it just left unhandled so it depends on what mods decide about the topic and bump from random one worth to be discussed further or not.",

      "body": "Personally I think it all depends on each case. In my view, it is not the age of the topic that dictates whether it is relevant to be talked about again or not.Most of these cases, the topics that revived, were found in some Google search. The question now is: why was an old topic found and not a new one? Because maybe a new one doesn't exist. But, if the person searched in order to find this topic, it is because the content of this topic is relevant to that person.If it's relevant to that person, why do we have to say that it's not and that it's all been said? Or why does that person have to open a topic on the same topic, if that topic already exists?As I said, it all depends from case to case. But I don't think it's correct to associate the riviver with an old topic, like spam or just for counting posts. By the way, for counting posts it is much easier to pick up topics that are created every day and talk there, than to walk in the depths of the forum.So, I think the first thought we should have is: is the subject being posted again associated with the OP? Is it connected to the debate that had been going on? Of course we can say, that it might make more sense to start a new topic. Because this even allows analyzing the idea from a different perspective. But, I see no problem reviving topics, if what is being debated remains in the same line of reasoning.With this I just want to say, that I don't think we should generalize these cases, because each case is a case. And it shouldn't always be considered spam or for the purpose of counting posts.",

I'm just wondering if there's an old topic that keep discussed, but someone want to reply it after 3 months later. It's can't be said as necro bump since there's no warning message, technically the forum still allow you to post and wouldn't consider it as necro bump.But IMO 3 months is already long, 1 month is already long too since those thread will be on few pages especially an active board like Bitcoin discussion.",
