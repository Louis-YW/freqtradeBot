Bitcoin ETFs will increase the price but it will attract more people to centralised platforms. People might not be exposed to the true nature of bitcoin because they will assume that third parties are indispensable. It is great to see many financial institutions having an interest to put in more money into the bitcoinspace but it will also give them some level of influence to manipulate the market. As we celebrate the profit that these centralised platforms might trigger due to their investment, we should also be prepared to shield ourselves from their excesses. But I don't think Bitcoin ETFs is taming bitcoin because they are not changing the coin but the process of investing in it. Within a few years, the imperfections of these services will be exposed and investors will gradually learn and switch to decentralized platforms.      He also spoke about the pseudonymity of bitcoin and the need to improve privacy which points to the fact that mixers and tumblers services are important. For the few years that I have been following the Bitcoin conference, the current one has some speakers I respect.",

      "body": "I don't think that Bitcoin ETFs will tame Bitcoin because so far more people are more interested in \"real Bitcoin\" than Bitcoin ETFs. However, it should be noted that the increasing influence of centralized platforms on bitcoin investments makes them more capable of increasing prices and manipulating the market to their needs. And with this, the potential for people to become familiar with Bitcoin ETFs increases and perhaps the potential for Bitcoin ETFs to tame Bitcoin may exist. Therefore, before this happens, we as Bitcoin-enthusiast must better educate people that only invest in Bitcoin, not Bitcoin ETFs, because that is the only genuine investment in Bitcoin.",

But I think he's saying what's obvious. It's clear that institutions joining in the Bitcoin game implies lack of privacy. These are centralized institutions; registered, licensed, compliant to the laws, and so on. The people's freedom as to how they would like to use their Bitcoin, itself a currency that supposed to represent freedom, would be significantly diminished or even gone when they're within a centralized entity.",

Even if ETF can pump Bitcoin it's just a matter of some time, the hype will wash off as Bitcoin will still do it's thing, it's all about the chart, not some ETF approval. Let's not focus the mind on ETF approval, if it never happens it could be a black swan opportunity, imagine they come out in the open tomorrow and announce that the ETFs are canceled till many years in the future, it could cause panic and massive sell off, maybe it could bring Bitcoin back to 12k who knows? These people are manipulating us, and I don't believe anything on the news anymore.What if Gensler is acting on the order he was given? What if all those public video of him in those hearings are acting, to put up a show? As if they are against him, as if Gensler is to be blamed? And maybe that's why he is still in the office today, they should have fired him already, and I believe all these dramas have connections.",

Our only hope that an ETF would bring positive things besides an increase in price — being, the fact that people will hopefully realize that self-custody is almost necessary.You're right, we have almost no choice, we can't stop or avoid ETFs, so whatever consequences ETFs have, we need to adapt to them. Like we told the government, if they can't stop bitcoin then join us and now we need to apply this to ourselves too. Most people's goal is profit, so let's hope that when the SEC approves ETFs, it can help bitcoin prices skyrocket giving us profits. I think even without ETFs, but once large institutions and companies get into the game, it's inevitable that bitcoin will become more centralized.",

Could they ever agree on one thing and act on it?I highly doubt that. There are always young to be different goals for each company and these companies would always act in their interest at a particular time. I don’t expect or hope to find a forum that would bring these companies together.Also, there isn’t a guarantee or any chance that would mean, you using Bitcoin ETF companies would mean your coins have got to stay there. There are chances for withdrawals and the majority of hodlers out there and traders will always be more than a combined company would have, I think.The more exposure that could come out of ETF programs, the more people would seek to be more private and decentralized on there transactions which would result in not having to stay on ETF centralized companies.",
