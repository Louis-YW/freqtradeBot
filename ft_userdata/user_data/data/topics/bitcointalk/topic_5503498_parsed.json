To see so many people who are pro-bitcoin and pro-privacy, but then they are of a left-wing ideology that basically believes that it is the government that needs to intervene to make sure that things go right (with CBDCs for example), rather than leaving the freedom to individuals to self-organize, as with bitcoin.",

Whether Democrats or Republicans, the technology of bitcoin is for everyone and not built on political ecosystem.",

Whether Democrats or Republicans, the technology of bitcoin is for everyone and not built on political ecosystem.The political system affects Bitcoin and crypto in general, so it should be politicized. Imagine an anti-crypto Chinese and US governments all fighting Bitcoin at once. The price would drop below $20k and many investors would be discouraged. Recovery for the industry may take years. What we need is governments and politicians that support the technology and its use while preventing illegal usage without clamping down on associated businesses.",

Hopefully once the election is over, there will be some relief given to the Bitcoin users in the US. I appreciate the attempt to raise funds for the republicans but if nothing changes after they come into power, then all goes to waste! Politicians are the last persons on earth to be believed!",

There are always pros and cons to bitcoin and as we can see, on the one hand there is support coming while on the other hand there are also cons. We never know which one can be trusted, but a better hope is what we want for the growth and development of bitcoin. If the US had been in favor, I think bitcoin would have gained more interest around the world.",
