      "body": "Yes, that makes sense.  I realize it's a major gamble, but wondering because of the election and all the attention Trump is getting right now, if it could make this one relevant?  I'm probably going to throw a couple dollars at it, under the guise of \"diversification\" and the hopes that people hype in.",
