I.e. it has never been online, nor will it ever go online. Even better if you didn't even put a WiFi or ethernet card in it so it physically can't go online. If not, permanently airgap it then format it and reinstall your distro of choice.After that, the set up I would use would be to run Core on your main online computer and run an Electrum server on this computer as well. Then run Electrum on your airgapped laptop, set up a new wallet, and create a matching watch only wallet on your online computer (which syncs only via your own server). You use the online watch only Electrum wallet (which does not contain any private keys) to monitor your addresses and create unsigned transactions, and your airgapped Electrum wallet to sign those transactions (after transferring them back and forth using either a USB drive or a QR code).You could also skip Electrum here and do the same process just using Core, but lots of people find Electrum easier to use. You can also use your Ledger device with this set up, and interact with your Ledger via Electrum on your online computer, again routing everything through your own Electrum server connected to your own node.",

You can as others have said use one of the prebuilt images, but if you want to be sure you can do it yourself. Which ones you use is more of your personal preference. C-Lightning vs LND or one of a few electrum server options and so on.Everyone has a preference but it's better to find what you want / need / like rather then listen to others. A lot can get lost in the signal to noise ratio of people talking about C-Lightning vs LND instead of us saying try both, play with both, and use the one that works for you.-Dave",

Then you prolly would need some programming skills to set up the software on the computer including your own custom coded bios system. You could use Linux as a operating system because that is open source. The perfect setup is (green = exists, red = does not exist): 1. Open source hardware (does not exist) 2. Open source router 3. open source bios (heads I think is open source) 4. open source operating system 5. open source wallet software Everyone on this topic prolly relies on Intel or AMD for their graphics processing. A few will use raspberry pi. None of these are open source hardware and there will always be a risk of back doors in these. If you build your own computer you are still relying on these companies for the hardware you are just putting the parts together totally different to manufacturing it.",

I like the idea of hardware that is verifiable safe and I hope there is developments in it but at some point it does seem like you will need to trust someone along the chain of creation. It probably is dream land to think we will ever get open source hardware. The hardware will always be holding us back because as from my color code list all the software has already been achieved and fully converted to open source and is a good standard. The only thing that has not is the microcode that is used to interact on a hardware level which might be the next step for extra transparency but then we still have the problem of the hardware itself.",

I then export the xPub key to Sparrow Wallet which is connected to my own node running an electrum server. When I generate a transactions, I create the transaction on my desktop and partially sign it, I send the PSBT to either hardware device and then sign it and then send the fully signed transaction back to Sparrow to be broadcast. It takes a while to fully get this setup but everything only costs about $500 plus the cost of my computer. I think Sparrow might be able to be run from a RasPi with the latest update but I have to confirm that.It's a pretty solid setup. All of my keys are offline and have never been exposed to a device that has ever been connected to a computer or internet. If I need quicker access to funds, I would send some to a new wallet that I would consider having on my desktop but only if I feel the need to have something ready to go quickly. Since it would be on Sparrow, I could CoinJoin right from there. Hope this helps and good luck on your self-custody journey. That sucks you got burned on FTX.",
