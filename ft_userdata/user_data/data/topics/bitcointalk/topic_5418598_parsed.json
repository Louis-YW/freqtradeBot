The house always wins when taking an averages of bets, it might come out a bit different with a strategy like this (it'll likely come out similar to placing a small number of larger bets with low odds - like a 1-1.05 bet or a 94% win chance).",

      "body": "Just as I said (OP *) there was a Topic something very strange with an unexpected profit here (BTT, another thread, which I will not quote the reference is not worth it) at 2%. (Dice)The casinos usually always have the minimum bet preconfigured, which on average it is $0.00001 to $0.0000001, (I have used the Fiat value corresponding amount approximate for each value of the Token) and the winchance of 50%, the reason to avoid errors.I don't think this player didn't know that such a thing was going to happen, if I explain myself, I think it's a farce to say that it was a mistake, in fact that same user has a timeline post something questionable in its line of thought to gambling, that is, it really a fish, or is it a troll, who likes to attract attention, but it does not seem genuine to me at least that so-called profit by mistake, creating false expectations.I have seen bets, there are guys on the Internet betting thousands of dollars on Dice and they make it appear (real but, that is fake) that it is possible to put $100 and double it in a single bet.Well things don't work like that, that's maybe luck in the game, but  it's cheating who shows it as a great triumph or a mistake that went well. This is my Thread in response, please all games have statistical information to determine the future of your money, do not be confused, the game is clean in terms of its profitability, know what you do if you think you are going to double $100 to wC:50%, no, it is not possible.Thanks to the user who answered several of the questions, in effect that is the value of bets.For this example below, which does not correspond to the OP's continuity the Win#1 happened at bet 4936 , so the reality is that the event happened at 0.02% something that happens, it is normal of reality probabilistic, How you correct, well! the more bet you make the closer you get to that WC value of 0.05%, it is the mathematical probability.it is the classic long term, that you may not have life to make all the bets you need to correct.You can start a series like the one I showed in the OP, numer of bets 116k and have a profit of $2.48($2.45) given the expectations mentioned, It would be a good time to stop.where to put your \"stop on win\". I don't know, it might happen in the bet 10 million as in the 10k bet or 116k.Example Visual:Expectation:W#1: number of BEt: 1 (expectation between 1 and 1980)Reality:W#1: bet number:4936If you look at the image there is a bet difference of 8 (Lose) the reason is this:The bet was stopped 8 bets later, but it can be stopped exactly by giving the correct \"Stop Win\" value. This data for the unsuspecting, not because they don't know how to place \"Stop Win\" but the information that it is processing does not correspond to what I am saying.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on October 28, 2022, 08:17:17 AMI wish you success, but honestly speaking, I expect you to lose money. The house always have mathematical advantage against the players and in the long run, it's very unlikely that you can make profit.I can't make any guess on the amount you will lose without knowing the house edge.

Given that you have made $2.4 profit, I guess that you will lose $1.12.That's right, that was one way to determine the value of the bet.I also gave additional data where it could be calculated: Major loss $3.51 and Biggest losing series: 8,775.As for your wager and loss calculations, it should be $400 (exact) and estimated loss $3.96(-) e.g. for a million bets.That is a scenario(1), in fact a very good one at best. But losses exist for various scenarios depending on the event, for example; Scenario (2): Wager $400 and loss estimates greater or less than $3.96, we do not know this value until event 1,000,000 occurs, but we have those expectations.Scenario (x): Wager $400 and estimates of =>$0 => $0.7916(0.783684) => I don't know until the million bet occurs.I need 505 win and I have 63.So there are x scenarios, each complex within your expectations.What is real, what is feasible in this example is that there are:The bet: $0.0004HE is 1%The game is Dice.WinChance is 0.05%Win: 63Lose:118468The expectations is to make a million bets and reach the minimum of Win 505 (442)What do we have or what do we carry in the reality of this case:Profit:$2.48 Wagered:47.4124 Win:63 Lose:118468Quote from: rhomelmabini on October 28, 2022, 11:26:50 AMQuote from: famososMuertos on October 28, 2022, 07:38:38 AM...

      "body": "On the way to finalizing this Topic:Can't make a million bets from day 28 to 31(oct, 2022), at least not in the casino in question, there is only one casino where you could make so many bets in such a short time, but it was not the point to know that another casino could, it was that time was not enough.Q1: I will reach the million bet before 23:59 hours UTCday31: No.Q2:How much profit will it be? If you think there are. I already gave my explanation.Q3:How much will the losses be? If you think there are. I already gave my explanation.Q4:Win: you can say with certainty that it will be the following: 505<=W>505Q5:According to the data provided, how much is my betting level?It was answered by a user who curiously (I think) is not a regular at Gambling.I'm going to leave the post open until I get the million bet.Considerations: I have not been able to make continuous bets greater than 30,000, it even disconnects every so often from thousands of bets and unlike other autobets that would continue, this must be restarted manually.These are the graphs:Game sections: 1.Bet: 195,738Win:100 (405)OP:63+37.Game sections: 2.These two graphs show the bets closest \"Win\" in this round of betting.These following show the time spread of bets.Lose: 82528 and loses: 82792, a difference of 264 bet, which is equivalent to 1 min and 20 seconds, the time it takes me to click on Stop. You Do not expect this appreciated sound very often. Anyway...With this data you can get an estimated time of the continuous duration of bets, which for this case, Game (Dice) and Casino varies a lot, I think that for the first case there were almost 30,000 bets in a row without stopping. The Bet/T factor was a variable to consider, But, no matter what you bet the house always takes its percentage. At the end of the million... bet is what you need to know.So...:Bet: 82843Win:51 (354)Section 3:It was what last night's autobet left me on my desktop PC, I'm not doing this on my cell phone or my laptop, life goes on while you make a million bets.  Bet: 3263Win:3 (351)Total Bet:281,844 (718,156)This Topic closes on the bet one million or W=505 whichever comes first.I hope you all have a month of November full of profits, wos! 2022 flew by I hope to finish before 2023 catches us. Quote from: famososMuertos on October 28, 2022, 07:38:38 AM*That is a point if you want to comment, but in reality I would also like to give scope to my conviction to make 1,000,000 of bets, time limit is October 31........//...,,,,,*If you find a similarity of the title with another post that is out there, that's fine, it's the sense of being alert we can't just give the reply.No one here gave a single answer, that is, the background of the matter was not seen.
