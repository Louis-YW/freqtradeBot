  "content": "I would say it is AptosLaunch and here is my reasoning: - Devs deliver more than expected all the time and are very experienced.(ALT already listed on 3 great CEXs, Spaceport Hackathon for example)- Great community, 80k+ Discord users, great Support and lots of Volunteers- Smart concepts and plans that make sense, many outstanding innovations- Other projects might need many years to gain traction, a Launchpad will be needed veryearly on and gain traction fast.- #1 Launchpad and one of 12 Projects that have been with Aptos since testnet.Thatâ€™s how i discovered AptosLaunch, was doing research on these 12 projects.Please let me know which project you favor and why.",
