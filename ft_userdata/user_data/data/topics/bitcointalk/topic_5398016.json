  "content": "Tanzania is on the move to introducing a central bank digital currency CBDC for payments.  WARY OF CRYPTO, TANZANIA SHIFTS CLOSER TO OWN DIGITAL CURRENCYQuote“It’s important for us to provide a central bank digital currency as a safe alternative because many people are being affected by cryptocurrency speculators,” Bank of Tanzania governor Florens Luoga said in an interview in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital. The bank can’t ignore the technological advancement of money, he said.Luoga spoke in reference to introducing a CBDC for payments similar to Nigeria, which was the first African country to start using the digital cash in October. China, the Bahamas, the Central African Republic, Kenya and Zambia are among the other nations that are issuing, piloting or studying consumer-facing digital currencies.The news is not completely unexpected though, because: Firstly, in 2019, the Directorate of Economic Research and Policy at the Central Bank of Tanzania (BoT) issued a circular titled: STUDY ON THE CRYPTOCURRENCY AND ONLINE FOREX TRADING IN TANZANIA  This is the official document: Secondly, on June 14, 2021 during her speech, the Tanzanian president Samia Suluhu Hassan had already instructed the Central Bank to Prepare for Crypto adoption. TANZANIA'S PRESIDENT URGES CENTRAL BANK TO PREPARE FOR CRYPTOQuotePresident Samia Suluhu Hassan said the Bank of Tanzania should \"be ready for changes and not caught underprepared\".\"I know that throughout the nation ... they have not accepted or started using these routes. However, my call to the central bank is that you should start working on that development,\" she said.Her speech took place after El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.Attention will be focused on other countries that spot an opportunity in crypto to boost economic development and stabilize financial instability.And five months later, specifically in November, 2021, the Bank of Tanzania governor Florens Luoga already gave a hint about their preparations for them to have their own central bank digital currency (CBDC) during their 20th Conference of Financial Institutions (COFI) which was quoted on their central bank’s Twitter feed. While this is a good move I am of the opinion that as long as it tied to the fiat it will still be affected by many external influences, inflation, taxes, Federal Reserve policy etc. Hopefully, we'd hear of the big announcement soon enough.Tanzania CheatsheetTanzania on WikipediaTanzania on CIA World Factbook",

It is good for the system to monitor what is happening with the currency exchange market and to avoid to make things to be easy for brokers having exploiting or scamming motive for others. It will be serious to the exchange market that scam will be out. It is not new to hear this but it is adding to the list of other countries doing this regulation.",

Although the good thing with that is they're for crypto but, they can alter that decision and just make a law that other cryptos are ban.In reality, CBDCs aren't really cryptos at all as they're just trying to put a string to attach on it so that citizens that are not into crypto will easily understand that's how it goes based on how the government's introduction for it because it's popular and known.",

They are currently focusing on developing traditional to modern fiat. When it comes to adopting crypto, it's a completely different story. If in the announcement they will adopt Bitcoin. Despite all that the fact that the CBDC will still have the same threat as their banknotes, namely inflation.",

This is just riding the crypto hype but has nothing to do with it nor does it hold to the same core concepts that drove early crypto developement. But I think peopke see through it.",

Well, Tanzania really see the growth of digital currency and in order for them to stay in control with their people, they come up into this decision but the good thing is the central bank was instructed the possibility of adopting cryptocurrency which i think is way better than to create your own digital fiat money.",

There was an admission that the research is not yet done, so why prematurely conclude that cryptocurrency is not safe? It is obvious what will come next. They are conducting a research with a biased mind. I'm also surprised that in line with the research there will be \"interviews with randomly selected individuals who may assist to gather information to be used to guide decision-making.\" How on earth would you be able to come up with an informed study on cryptocurrency when instead of inviting experts on the matter you will be interviewing randomly selected individuals?",

And also most countries that have created digital currency with their fiat currency has nothing to talk about.
