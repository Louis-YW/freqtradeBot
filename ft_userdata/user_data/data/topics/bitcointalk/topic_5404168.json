However, you must keep in mind that not only did crypto market but rather even the stock market and real states has been affected with the bearish trend. Also, these kinds of cycle of bearish and bullish trend is normal with bitcoin and other cryptocurrency as they are volatile.",

It is obvious that currently price fluctuations, as well as manipulations, are way too high for Bitcoin markets but eventually this will come down. The winner is only the person who entered the market at the correct time and then HODLed his bitcoins or a person who is a very good trader and can make money in the market no matter what the type of market is. Weak hands always get wiped off as they do exactly the opposite of what should have been done in a certain situaton.",

Isn't it time to buy during the correction you saw a few days ago?The only person who wins but you mention more than one. Perhaps the sentence is more precisely one part of a unity. Not all speculators win or profit. If they are just making excuses without any basis for calculation, then they are gambling on the market. Just guessing that you buy even though the Bitcoin price is green. Hmmm",

I think you need to understand that bitcoin is volatile and considering previous years price speculations one will deduce that lots of factors makes it hapoen part of which is the demand and supply, now that we are within the range of $21k mean nothing than the tendencies to begin to rise back to the ATH to break record above $70k anytime sooner or later, yet someone like you will still come out to call bitcoin which is a digital currency and generally acceptable a ponzi scheme, think twice to know what bitcoin is and it's difference from altcoins.",

Well, I’m willing to get scammed by Bitcoin.Seriously, you just need to understand the trend and know when to buy you can have a good price to enter and a good target price to make profit. This breakout might be little and still weak, so better to wait for other confirmation before buying. Bitcoin hits the oversold area and maybe this is the start of the pump but a dump after this is still possible, to avoid this kind of thinking better to continue analyzing the market.",

It is better to buy Bitcoin for its intrinsic, unique properties, but it seems to me that you have not considered that. The most successful strategy with Bitcoin to date has been to accumulate to the maximum, being able to spend a little or sell at high peaks, to savor profits, just as you can also buy now more than usual because it is cheap.",

The only guys that won are speculators/traders that pumped and dumped and miners, the rest got wiped out ...It starting to feel that \"Bitcoin game\" is a scam ...a big ponzi ...In short term, There's really a possibility that a short term outbreak will occur since Bitcoin already consolidated above 20K for multiple daily candle which is a good sign that bulls is already in control but those shills stating that Bitcoin will go to 100K with just current short term pump is surely playing the ponzi game that you are describing.You can have a profit by playing smart and know when to TP but this is a pure gambling because there's a bunch of trader that doing do it so make sure to set target limit when buying the dip.I guess it could be good or bad for the market, the $100k projected really did pump the price but only up to $69k. And that is the max that we can in the last bull run. I guess the shills will continue to predict it though till the next bull run.Of course, playing smart in this game is the key, this is not a sprint, bitcoin trading is a journey and a marathon. And remember that we have a cycle to work.I won't comment on the Ponzi Scheme argument because clearly it is not.",

Those of print them benefit the most from increasing the supply. Those who are heavily invested, and/or require financial aid, receive a form of \"dividends\" when required (think 2008 crisis). Those at the bottom, suffer from the continued inflation.Whereas with Bitcoin it doesn't matter if you have 0.1 Bitcoin or 1K Bitcoin. If price goes up or down 10%, the result is the same for everyone, not better for those at the top of a pyramid or worse for those at the bottom. If anything it sounds like the OP mistook this for a pyramid, thinking that if he invested 6 months ago, or 12 months ago when price was at $60K he/she would benefit more than those who invest today at $20K. Sadly for them, Bitcoin isn't a pyramid, so it's not necessarily a case of investing early means higher profits that those who invest later. Oh well.",
