I support you on your advocacy if it means that the new president will change the current rotten system on your current government admin.",

And, of course, we all hope that Nigerians elect a leader who cares about the country and its people. But, how do you expect the rest of the world to help out with that? No country should interfere in the democratic processes of another country when electing their leaders.",

Every nation enjoys it's territorial integrity and sovereignty, which  means that no other country can directly decide on the outcome of the election. It is possible that some developed nations that has interest in the economy of Nigeria might want to manipulate the elections but the ball is in the court of Nigerians. They must decide who they want to govern them for the next four years. You must go out and cast your vote for your preferred candidate and ensure that your vote counts. Africa and the world is keenly observing the political developments in Nigeria because the country is a big player in the world's socio-economic space.",

Election is the only way in which citizens use to vote out bad government, therefore, I believe that Nigerians can see this election as an opportunity to vote in a good leader who cares about the people.Election is over in Nigeria but the collation of results is ongoing. There is a tricky act displayed by Independent National Electorate Commission (INEC) that is alarming. Before the election INEC promised that immediately the voters have casted their votes that the result will be sent to the database in Abuja but they didn't keep to their words. Up till now the results are still unable to reflect on the database. This kept me wondering that it is not Nigerians that cannot vote out bad leaders,neither is it the politicians that are rigging elections by vote buying but the body in charge of the exercise to make it a free and fair election is the problem of Nigeria.",

Nigeria is a corrupt country and the country cannot make any way without being doing something that is illegal, from the electoral commission of Nigerian people that is where the corruption started so I believe that there's no way that corruption can be amend in Nigeria electoral system so for culpable person to win in Nigeria there must be a war which after the war the person will not take over through a military",

This look very funny to me because I am still confused what you want the world to do for you. You need to fix your country and don't bring the world to it. Any persons that choose to be corrupt will be and the world has nothing to do about it. We know that corruption is everywhere but we need to know that it has a level of gravity. Stand up and talk to people of your country to fix it not the world. Normally the world  is corrupt already.",
