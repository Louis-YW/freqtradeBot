Yes, the extra word will change the seed produced from your seed phrase.For the number of words... I think something considered as a \"strong password\" is the best option.You don't necessarily have to use actual words since it's not actually extra words but a \"passphrase\" (not your wallet's password),so a single 13th 'word' like Au%73t61BH!w6g4d82Edqwdqj#jhd633t is good enough.",

All it takes is to look at the code to see what RNG it is using and how.QuoteIf you agree, how many extra custom words should you add to your seed? The bigger concern is keeping a backup of that extra word(s). The more random and long they are the more you increase the chance of mistake. But considering that brute forcing the extra word is rather expensive it doesn't need to be too long. Not to mention that the actual security is provide by the entropy used in the seed phrase not the extra word.",

You are correct, replacing words in the seed phrase is not recommended.  In fact, it's very likely that would break the checksum of the seed phrase (whether electrum or bip39.)  But, I think the OP is referring to the seed extension (Bip39 passphrase,) not the seed itself.",

Electrum works with different word-lists with custom number of words instead of the fixed 2048 ones. That means as long as you also keep the word-list you can recreate your wallet (and its checksum will be correct).P.S. as you pointed out, I also don't think this is what OP had in mind though.",

Please correct me if am wrong but if the random number generator is flawed isn't all the attacker can do is to regenerate the twelve words of the seed? How can he know the passphrase you set manually (not generated by the flawed rng)?Actually, this particular case shows how important the custom word is to secure your coins.If the wallet is fake or have some malicious code (ie. keylogged) then that's a different matter.",

How can he know the passphrase you set manually (not generated by the flawed rng)?No, you are right. If the attack which is happening is limited to only a malicious RNG spitting out predetermined entropy and therefore a predetermined seed phrase, but you use a long, complex, and random passphrase, then your coins will still be safe.However, this depends on the wallet file actually using the long, complex, and random passphrase that you enter properly. If someone has released malicious software which is generating predetermined seed phrases, then chances are they have also taken steps to mean that if you do use a passphrase they can still steal your coins. This might mean that any passphrase you enter is simply ignored, or maybe that the wallet only uses the very first character of any passphrase you enter, so it still generates a fresh wallet but one that is trivially easy to brute force.",
