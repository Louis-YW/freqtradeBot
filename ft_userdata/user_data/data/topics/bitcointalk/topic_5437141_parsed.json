  "content": "As I've been trying to get more educated on bitcoin, I came across this wiki link on seed phrases. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Seed_phraseSeed phrases, like all backups, can store any amount of bitcoins. It's a concerning idea to possibly have enough money to purchase an entire building with the key just sitting on a sheet of paper without any protection. For this reason many wallets make it possible to encrypt a seed phrase with a password.The password can be used to create a two-factor seed phrase where both \"something you have\" plus \"something you know\" is required to unlock your bitcoins.This works by having the wallet creating a seed phrase and asking the user for a password. Then both the seed phrase and extra word are required to recover the wallet. Electrum and some other wallets call the passphrase a \"seed extension\", \"extension word\" or \"13th/25th word\". The BIP39 standard defines a way of passphrase-protecting a seed phrase. A similar scheme is also used in the Electrum standard. If a passphrase is not present, an empty string \"\" is used instead.Warning! Forgetting this password will result in the bitcoin wallet and any contained money being lost. Do not overestimate your ability to remember passphrases especially when you may not use it very often. Also, the seed phrase password should not be confused with the password used to encrypt your wallet file on disk. This is probably why many wallets call it an extension word instead of a password.It got me thinking...1. Why doesn't every hardware wallet support the use of a seed phase + password?  It seems like a really simple way to add a layer of protection in case the seed phrase you've written down is discovered. Right now, written seed phrases are like writing your bank account and log-in credentials on a piece of paper and hoping nobody finds it.2. Do modern hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X, Trezor, etc. already support applying a password to seed phrases? Is it just a feature that's hidden and not promoted that much?",

Losing your password is one more vector to lose your coins, but then again having someone find your seed phrase without a password protecting it leads to the same outcome. I've just never hear anyone talk about adding a password to your seed phrase when dealing with hardware wallets.That said, I did come across this thread that shows it's possible to add a 25th word on the Nano S, for example.

      "body": "I've not read that particular wiki page before, but it is very poorly written.It interchangeably uses the words password and passphrase. Better to define them and then keep them separate. When talking about extra words added to your seed phrase, most people would call that a passphrase, and reserve the word password to mean the password you type in to your wallet software to unlock it.Also, passphrases do not encrypt your seed phrase in any way. Your seed phrase remains entirely unencrypted and readable in plain text. What they do is change the process by which you derive your root seed number and then the rest of your wallet from that seed phrase.\"Something you know\" is just plain bad advice. You should not rely on remembering any passphrases you use. You should back them up on paper separately to your seed phrase.If a passphrase is not present, PBKDF2 does not use an empty string. It uses the word \"mnemonic\" in the case of BIP39, or the word \"electrum\" in the case of Electrum.But on to your questions:1 - Most good hardware wallets do.2 - Yes. Both Ledger and Trezor devices support the use of passphrases.It is a very good feature and I make use of it on almost all of my wallets.",

Just a heads up so you don't mix these things up.Barring privacy concerns, there isn't much issues with using TrustedCoin as 2FA. But even that is a pretty weak argument; using Electrum alone already means sacrificing a huge part of your privacy. It still does provide some security to your wallet, albeit not as significant as a cold wallet.Most people associated 2FA with a rotating token which narrows the window for your attackers to act with that window. None of the wallet allows this without the participation of the third-party. Additional passphrase doesn't really work because no one should be required to remember anything related to their seeds, potential risks includes $5 wrench attacks, loss of memory, etc. If you want to secure your seeds properly, consider splitting them up into multiple locations. This would prevent the attacker from being able to get your entire seed without going through multiple barriers.",

For the sake of avoidance of confusion it is better to call it a passphrase and not a password, regardless of its actual length or composition, in order to differentiate it from the local passwords you use to unlock your wallets.Further, calling it a passphrase helps to make it clear that it shouldn't just be a single word.

While, that shouldn't be the determining reason of what a good, and bad hardware wallet is, I'd expect any of them that are at least somewhat security conscious, would have it as an option. Now, depending on how it's implemented that could mean additional risk as pointed out before, and that won't immediately be obvious to all users. So, I'd like to see warning messages on enabling or disabling any security feature on a hardware wallet through their software. However, that's really only possible with software, since the actual hardware itself is limited usually, and I believe some operate without much software at all these days. Also, just to clarify what I mean by software is traditional software run on a separate computer to the actual hardware wallet itself, obviously the hardware wallet itself will have its own software running, but due to limits in size they usually can't include much documentation or information through that device.",

I only say this, because of course a passphrase could actually be a good way of doing it, but most humans wouldn't go for a random passphrase, and come up with commonly thought of passphrases, which is obviously problematic. Although, I do agree generally there shouldn't be any limitations on what characters can be used or the length. While, this isn't for hardware wallets, I've come across websites including banks which limited characters like \"*\", \"(\" and \"@\" which is totally unacceptable in my opinion.",
