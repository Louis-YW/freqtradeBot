Well encouraging censorship immediately undermines his 'contributions' imo. Ok I understand he has contributed to btc it is just this attitude that I am worried about and it frustrates me that we have people who are known in the community for their contributions encouraging censorship. It worries me it could leak into development Some day I hope people realize how disgraceful it is to limit a certain person because of political motives.

Banks controlling everything and still processing transactions. I do not know why people are obsessed with businesses and processes which censor the end user. Any one suggesting we censor ourselves does not believe in Bitcoin for the right reasons and I think they are probably in it for other motives that are not advocating freedom.",

This to me is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is supposed to offer the world.I wonder where this kind of questioning will lead us, I also wonder if one day there will be a question of analyzing transactions in the mempool in order to cancel them (like double-spending before validation in a block) when they include blacklisted addresses. I must admit that I wouldn't be surprised if someone proposed this, but I would be extremely surprised if it was realistically feasible. As I know, only the sender can do double-spend, so it shouldn’t be possible no ?It would clearly be harmful, if not fatal, to the decentralization of Bitcoin.

There have been a couple of short lived attempts of mining pools doing this in the past, but unless such mining pools achieve 51% of the hashrate, they are powerless to stop other mining pools from picking up and mining these transactions which they are choosing to censor. And any individual miner with any shred of decency will not continue to mine for any pools which supports censorship.",

I can sort of understand the reasoning behind him being concerned. He suggests that it isn't worth risking the jail time or fines, but he doesn't necessarily support censorship, because lets face it for the majority of people they don't want to risk jail time or fines over something like this. I know there's an argument that being scared into complying, and then using his position to convince others is support censorship. Given his position as a Core developer though, it's a odd one.

Whether, that's Bitcoin or something else. China, is known for censoring certain social medias, and news sources. It's no different for the US.

This to me is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is supposed to offer the world.Technically, if mining is illegal in the country that they reside in; yeah, it would be illegal, and therefore they could be held liable for breaking the law, if they are validating blocks. Although, I'm not aware of many countries that have outright banned mining. However, it's potentially something that could happen, obviously it wouldn't be right, but usually censorship isn't anyway.Quote from: pooya87 on March 04, 2023, 03:02:15 PMIf someone is living in a dictatorship that would fine or jail people for running a bitcoin/LN node then maybe they should be the ones running their node through TOR or stop using bitcoin altogether.

The thing is; if there isn't enough people that care, and kick up a fuss it'll likely lead to this. I don't know if the government would be threatened enough or if they'd just prefer to regulate Bitcoin so that they can profit from people using it, but tighter restrictions will likely be put in place around the majority of the world.
