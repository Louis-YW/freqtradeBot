He is conservative with his assets but with Berkshire Hathaway, I guess that someday there will be a change of mind of his when he gets enlightened with how it works. I'm sure that wherever money is, he's going there as well. With his influence and intelligence with money, he might help to push Bitcoin going $500k-$1M with his words and affirmation.",

All this were left for his own personal decision to be made, if he thinks he is one of the richest today and cant invest on bitcoin, others are coming to overtake his position and he will be a thing of the past, also, if he changes his mind today to invest in bitcoin, that alone may not have any significant impact on changing the market for a bullrun or bear, just as we have seen nothing changing when others like him eventually changed their minds towards bitcoin after several attacks.",

I don't know if he could change as he has a deep hatred for bitcoin as if it's standing against him and his business success. Whatever decision he wants to take is on him, and I don't think his turn around if he decides to buy bitcoin anyday can bring any turn around to the market, so I don't care about his decisions; they are among the people making Bitcoin an interesting topic.",

He's sooooo close, yet so far...Schiff is a clown. All he does is repeat the same story over and over how bitcoin is a bad investment. He used to say that at $10k and he's saying that now at $60k.Smart people see their mistakes and if they tell you not to get a job and you do and start earning a lot of money there, making a career, they'll admit that they were wrong. Schiff does not act like that. He's the kind of guy who will be in denial, no matter what happens. If they say there's going to be rain tomorrow and it's sunny they'll take an umbrella with them and say that at 12:30 they felt a few drops land on his face.",

Warren Buffett, Born on 30th August 1930 i.e. he is 94 years old according to calculations. Having spent most of his life hating Bitcoin, I don't think Warren Edward Buffet will spend the rest of his life loving Bitcoin. But if famous people like Warren Buffet adopts Bitcoin and adopt it as one of the main tools of business, Bitcoin will be pumped, albeit temporarily.",

Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Well, I think Warren Buffett will continue to dislike Bitcoin and he would never change his mindset and buy Bitcoin like the others that you've mentioned in your thread. He's a firm crypto hater and he'll continue with his own approach rather than supporting Bitcoin or any crypto related technologies. He's someone with a mindset of traditional investor and he doesn't really understand the importance of a digital asset like Bitcoin. Still, if we assume that he somehow changes his mind and starts promoting Bitcoin then there's chance that the ones who follow Buffett may invest in Bitcoin and that could really impact the value of Bitcoin in a  good way.",

Warren Buffett has been greatly known to be a value investor, and he's different from other successful businessmen out there. I still remember when he invested in Coca-Cola a few decades ago. He said that he sees value in it hence, he invested millions of dollars back then. Now he's getting dividends way more than his initial investment. He's investing based on the value, and not just because many are investing into it.Buffett don't see any value with Bitcoin hence, I don't see him investing into it AT ALL. Of course like you said, anybody can change like the ones you said, but for Buffett, he can change anytime, but what are the chances? I don't think that his stance with how he sees Bitcoin will change. Maybe if he sees Bitcoin reaching $100,000 then that's the time where he will change his view about it and then who knows. He might invest into it, but right now, I don't see him doing it.Will the market pump if he suddenly change sides and invests into Bitcoin? Nah, I don't think so... or maybe we will see a temporary pump and then the market will go back to normal.",

One day when he passes on, who's to tell if his inheritors won't adopt Bitcoin and change the naretive of his perception. I believe that Bitcoin is mainly for the younger generations who understands more about decentralization that brings about privacy and freedom, something that these older generation don't understand. If Warren Buffett, were to change his mind today and directly owns Bitcoin, it'll impact on the price for the short term and I believe that after then it'll be business as usual for Bitcoin.
