It is so sad that his grandfather died too at such age, Bob Marley died at thirty-six. In all things he died because of an asthma attack. There must be other underlaying issues that is involved with his death that is not disclosed. His soul is resting with his grandfather ‘singing sweet songs of melodies & pure’.",

      "body": "Terrible news, poor young man. May he rest in peace & his family be comforted by God at this awful time. 31 is young, such a tragic loss. It seems a really bad time for public figures dying at the moment. Recently soccer legend Pele died, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood too. Obviously no life is worth more than any other due to fame etc.All we can do is pray for those who have left us & hope their families are comforted by God. Mourning is one of the worst times in life, I wish the families have all the strength possible during this time.",
