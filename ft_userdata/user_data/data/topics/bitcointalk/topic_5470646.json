Do you mind posting the URL?I would go with mempool.space, Blockchair, or Blockchain.com. Just make sure the TXID has your address.",

You need to provide more information, use either mempool.space or blockchair.Or you can provide the transaction hash here but your privacy will be a bit affected with that",

You mean invalid/unconfirmed!Or you are talking about BTCB (BTC on BSC network), then it's not actual bitcoin, it's BEP20 token, and you may receive that only if the funds were sent to the BSC address.",

Also BscScan is not for bitcoin. OmegaStarScream has listed some of the explorers that you can use, but blockchain.com is a wallet, it has an explorer which is https://www.blockchain.com/explorer. There is another one called https://blockstream.info/ which is also a bitcoin explorer.You can post the txid for us to help you confirm this. With the txid, we would be able to know if you are referring to bitcoin or an altcoin and if the txid is valid or not.",

A number of proper block explorers have been posted by the members on this thread. The two you mentioned are for two different blockchains. Please make sure you are on the right one.A remote possibility is that OP landed up on a scam website that shows people that they have received coins and on trying to withdraw that, they need to pay a fee which is scam because whatever you pay them, that money will be stolen and the coins are never yours.Please enlighten us OP.",

You must know all Wrapped Bitcoin tokens are tokens, sort of altcoins, and they are not Bitcoin.Bitcoin is on Bitcoin blockchain and you must check Bitcoin transaction hash with Bitcoin Block explorers.Wrapped Bitcoin tokens can be on many altcoin blockchains like Ethereum ERC20, Binance Smart Chain BEP20, Solana and more chains. You must check transaction hash of Wrapped Bitcoin token on altcoin block explorers.List of Bitcoin block explorersWrapped tokens (Coingecko.com).Wrapped tokens (Coinmarketcap.com).",
