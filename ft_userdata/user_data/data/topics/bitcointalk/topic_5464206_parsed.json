So I need a working example in order to achieve my goal.",

Pooler’s cpuminer compiles on recent machines and has optimizations for various CPU architectures. Give it a try, I found the C source very informative. https://github.com/pooler/cpuminerTo solo mine you’ll need to point it at a stratum server configured for solo mining. Public-pool is a good option; https://web.public-pool.io/ but there are several others too!",
