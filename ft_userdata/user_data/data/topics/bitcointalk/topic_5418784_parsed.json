  "content": "So I found a post a few months back about a fuel saver, so I decided to try it. After all it didn't cost too much to build, just time. Then tried it on my old tractor, which used to continually smoke even after it warmed up. After I used the device the exhaust smoke increased for a little while and then gradually became clear over hours of use. Now the only time I see exhaust plumes is after startup, when the engine is still cold or when the engine changes speed (RPM). The rest of the time the exhaust is relatively clear. Fuel usage also decreased by a fair bit also. I am not going to tell you by how much fuel I have already saved as I don't want to give any false impressions as different engines and applications will see varying results. After all, anyone can try it out for themselves if they are interested? The information is free in the off topic section around page 12 for now. The best part about it is that it treats the fuel, not the vehicle. This means one device can treat millions of gallons of fuel at once (fuel holding tank) or multiple vehicles... in theory? So fill up stations, delivery tankers, personal vehicles and holding tanks all can use this device but the best way to use it would be personal vehicles as you don't want to have two fill ups in a row with this treated fuel as water in the engine oil tends to increase slowly and that is not good long term. No guarantees are made of any kind with this experimental device. Any person or group licensing, patenting or otherwise taking credit for this device should be considered a total fraud. It is free to use by everyone and should remain so.If you want to help get the message out? Post below after you have tried it out for yourself and share your fuel savings information before and after results. Share the device with your neighbors and friends. Maybe even advertise it locally in poor communities around the world if you feel like it? Call your congressman. Setup free treatment centers in parking lots using multiple devices at a few minutes per vehicle. Make sure to build something so the devices you use don't fall in someone else's fuel tank! Leave directions on how to build the device at truck stop bathrooms doors. Tell them to take a picture of the directions. Just kidding on the last one.  The last thing you want to hear is cameras going off while you are in the stall. Don't do it! Not legal!Rudolf Diesel's innovations should not be thrown away, as they can be part of the solution for the world's energy and transportation needs well into the future. Cleaner air and cheaper fuel prices should be on the way.",
