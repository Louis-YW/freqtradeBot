You really don talk am finish, and I really dey very happy say at least you are not a lazy person, but a person with a consistent hustling spirit, which is what made you test most of these skills, and today you are already into tech and Bitcoin-related. Because most times one of the big mistake post of our students make is relying  only on school alone,  forgetting the fact that in this present era, your ability to earn higher is a factor dependent on how many skills wey you get. Hence, while starting life, eh dey very good to learn one or two skills",

Until you become very patient with all the hurdles of life, you can hardly live a good and healthy life.Constituency is key to success was another popular proverb that was shared amongst us when we were young people while growing up and after some years down the lane, I now understand what this means in a clearer picture because consistency is specially rewarding to an individual as well as an entrepreneur.I remember the days when I used to play around Canva for the sake of fun. It got to a level I gradually started getting little jobs for basic designs. Today I get more advanced and professional jobs such as Billboard and Digital Signage designs, Inforgraphics, Basic Ux/Ui amongst other specific and good paying jobs.
