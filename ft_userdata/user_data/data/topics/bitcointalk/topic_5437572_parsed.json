That's just it. Not sure what this has anything to do with a bull run. Always remember that the person that has access to the withdrawn coins can just as easily send the funds back to the exchange.",

News of that reaching the media creates a wave of other people withdrawing their coins from exchanges to their own wallets.That's mainly what we've been seeing. It has nothing to do with bullrun, etc.If anything more coins should move to exchanges during bullruns since trading volume goes up (more people trade) hence more coins have to be there.",

They move their bitcoins to their personal wallets to guard against unwanted things and so they can keep full control over their assets. The bull run button will be pressed when the time comes. You just need to wait for that moment while preparing your bitcoins to sell at peak prices. No need to worry about anything because bitcoin will rise on time.",

For those who have whole lot to invest, the current price is not too bad if they are going in for long term, and most of the whales keep buying throughout the period when the price was dropping or even going up since they can benefit from both sides.Quote from: mk4 on February 01, 2023, 03:02:23 AMNot sure what this has anything to do with a bull run.But, remember the situation where more bitcoins are being deposited into exchange wallets, we do have bear market and then why not we assume about the reciprocal now?",

Last year FTX crash,made so many investors to know the the major disadvantage of keeping their btc is exchanges which affected them directly or indirectly. This has nothing to do with the increase in btc price,demand and supply is what controls bitcoin price. So stop thinking about the whales and exchanges,instead think on adding more btc to your wallet.",

They can do it to mislead investors and traders too and if you follow those transactions, to find reasons and make your decisions with trading or investment, you might be manipulated by whales.Don't time the market and don't let whales manipulate your decisions.

I guess you're seeing those whale alert tweets and that's making you wonder that they're really a big thing. But no, you observe again when there are huge transfers from exchanges to an unknown wallet or from an unknown wallet going to an exchange. There's nothing new with these and just set your mind that these are normal occurrence in the market that has to be done by anyone else. Before I was like that and I give meaning with such moves but then, as the market matures, you'll get to see that these transfers are just normal and nothing significant to think of. Because whether we're in a bull or bear run, this happens.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on June 03, 2023, 10:56:02 AMIf you are a bitcoin investors, learn about its halving and four year cycles and use your money to DCA it.Right, what we have to mind is the cycle and the upcoming halving. I guess if someone is looking for a sign then that's the sign that we're nearly gonna see the bull run again and that's every time Bitcoin halves or after it.",

Most times maybe the bitcoin owner might have gotten a better secured wallet than that which he was using,for instance an exchange wallet. He can transfer his bitcoin to a noncustodial wallet for him to have total control of his funds,since these exchanges cannot be trusted. We have seen and heard of such information but the price of bitcoin hasn't been affect for this transfers.",
