Are there any old mods that could review previous passwords, if I can provide multiple previous passwords but not the latest one, and without access to the email?Alternatively, did you signed a message with your bitcoin address or any other address before on this forum? Or any address you have used to participate in a signature campaign can also be used or any unedited post that you referred to you address can also be used. You can use that to prove the ownership of your account.Recovering hacked/lost accounts",

I like my old account and am interested in having access to it again.I can provide several previous passwords, but not the last password it was changed to. Please DM if you can connect me to anyone that can help.Thanks!I don't know the major reason for the recovery you wanted on your old account but i will advise if it's just because of the unique unsername that seems precious to you has been the reason why, then i will advise you to save yourself the stress and open another one that has a similar username as the old one, another reason why you may not need to do that again is if the account is still a newbie rank account whereby not much activities had been carried out by it, maybe it has been inactive for long and has not much activity records, so why the stress, except for if all these aren't part of your reasons then you're fine to go ahead with the recovery.",

If anyone can provide me with Theymos' contact details or if Theymos can be shown this thread, I would be very happy, but I think I did this once before. I emailed Theymos proof of my ownership of a very old account, if he can see previous passwords used in account creation from the original forum.ThanksTry your luck to send a private message theymos regarding this matter, only admin or mods will help you out with this account that you've said that you wanted to recover.  Follow the link that was given above and create a thread of account recovery with the right format given.Just a few questions, is your hacked account still active right now?  If yes, then let us know because we can temporarily leave negative feedback so that the account will not use any activities here in the forum like joining the signature campaign.If you've staked your Bitcoin address use it's very easy to recover your account.",

Wow, that's not old mate… it’s antique… I’m sure now you need more than just “old passwords” to prove the ownership. What if an old account was shared among trusted users with known passwords? but only the owner had email access?Would love to know which antique account are we talking about?",
