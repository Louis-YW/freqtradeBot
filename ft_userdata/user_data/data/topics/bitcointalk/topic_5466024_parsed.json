  "content": "Has anyone check out the socketscan explorer? This is a product by socket project which work like a normal explorer but instead of showing trransaction of swap or transfer, it will display your bridges on different platform such as stargate and other liquidity bridges.Im amazed with this feature at least youll see your history of bridges transactions.Try it out guys. They also have a season rewards (optimism tokens) for the bridges youve made maybe not including before launch since I didnt have reward when I checked it.https://socketscan.io/rewards",

Anyway, I have checked my address and it seems to pick up some transactions but not all of them because Merkly reported that I have more transactions than Socket Explorer is currently keeping track of. Apparently, the rewards are actually rebates from the bridge fees and some rebates as well for the gas fees for those bridge transactions.

Refuel would be a game changer if only it has minimal fees compare to other bridges out there tbh and they got a decent chains currently being supported.",

Yes but I think past transactions werent counted since I have some and I did not get any rebates for that maybe during the launch of their socket reward programs only.Maybe if I did now. But I do hope they got segregate rewards or so to say airdrops for one used their platform before. Hoping for a snapshot for users. But Im not expecting though, I used those bridges for some other purposes anyway.",

Socket itself might not conduct any airdrop since it's more of an explorer for bridge transactions rather than being a bridge itself. So my expectations are low onnthat front. But given the fact that it provides a way to actively quantify our bridge transactions, it should be a good tool to help with keeping an account active enough to be eligible for drops. In any case, it's good to have a service like Socket but I have little expectations for the rebates/airdrops directly from Socket.",

So better not to expect anything.Â  They havr bridge product the bungee so there still chance in my opinion.Quote from: nelson4lov link=topic=5466024.msg62821710#msg62821710In any case, it's good to have a service like Socket but I have little expectations for the rebates/airdrops directly from Socket. Probably bigger transaction could get more free OP from that. Yes Id really like what socket did and its perfectly a good service. Now everyone can have an estimation of liquidity or transactions they already spending.",
