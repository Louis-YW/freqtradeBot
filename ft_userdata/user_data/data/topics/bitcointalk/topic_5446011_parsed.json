There are some members that do open an offer on service board. This is just one. I too if I like I can open a thread about this too if I think the chance of getting one is high. Who also tells you that people against mixers and gambling on this forum? That sounds new and odd to me.",

I think he is specifying the kind of service he currently wouldn't want to promote and he has the right to choose the product or service he would like to promote. I also feel that @UchihaSarada is not really insinuating that OP is against gambling and mixers but he was just recommending these two projects to OP because they are neither related to mixers nor gambling. But @UchihaSarada didn't choose the right word because that word 'against' is not appropriate. However, I wish @OmegaStarScream good luck in his quest to get a deserving and suitable contract.",
