For the peace of mind, it is important to comply with tax rules of your country whether you deal in crypto or not. I am not sure how the metric is taken, may be they have taken the trading volume of exchanges in India to the present volume and reached a conclusion that everyone who traded in these exchanges moved to foreign exchanges, but the overall trading volume in all the exchanges are low after the market went down. Even though the tax rules are not favorable it is better to comply with the rules rather than getting into trouble.",

Well, if it is India's intention to shoo away that huge crypto volume, they are successful. 81% of domestic trading volume is already lost in as quick as 4 months. If this is a way for India to discourage crypto, however, they're failing miserably. The domestic crypto industry might die, but it certainly doesn't mean Indians stop getting involved with crypto altogether.But it seems there will be a review on the flat 30% tax on profit and the 1% TDS. A better version might soon be implemented.",

Most likely they want to keep people away from investing and then make some profit from imposing heavy taxes while blaming the investors if they lose their money.it is a very confused policy in a large society like India.

This should serve as an example to other countries how a policy could actually backfire if it is not well-studied. People are very surprised if you explain to them that tax reduction policies generate more revenue, but in order to balance the accounts they have to be accompanied by reductions in public spending, and in a world addicted to debt and spending and spending, this seems impossible.When you want to make it impossible for people to do what they want to do and tax them excessively, people look for ways to avoid paying and to free themselves from your yoke, and in the case we are seeing of cryptocurrencies the same thing. With a policy of tolerance and low taxes, many people who do not declare them and/or have moved them abroad, would declare them and move them in their country, benefiting the local economy.",

Bunch of greedy bastardsYep.  However, in the US I think taxes on capital gains are higher than 30% if I'm not mistaken (and I'm thinking of the stock market), and it depends on whether you've held the stock for a year or less.  Either way Indians are obviously not happy with the change, and good for them for their rebellion.I have a question, though.  Why does it matter what exchange Indians are using?  Wouldn't they have to pay taxes on their capital gains regardless of where the exchange is located?  I'm assuming the answer to that is yes, and by trading on exchanges outside of India they're just dodging taxes.  Does that sound correct?",

I am against tax evasion, of course, but sometimes government policies are the reason for citizens evading paying taxes.Here in my country, for example, taxes sometimes reach 60-70% on some goods or professions. In such cases where taxes are high, some citizens will try to evade high taxes by many methods. This is due to the stupidity of the government.",

For the peace of mind, it is important to comply with tax rules of your country whether you deal in crypto or not. As much as I am all in on paying taxes, a 30% tax on crypto is inconsiderate. I made a topic recently about the government making favorable policies. This is not favorable at all, at least not to exchanges, traders, and investors. This just seems like a move to discourage people from using crypto. taxes can be imposed on crypto but they should be reasonable.I can't blame people for finding alternatives in these situations. It's tax avoidance, which is not illegal. They've not done anything wrong by using foreign exchanges. It becomes illegal when its tax evasion.",
