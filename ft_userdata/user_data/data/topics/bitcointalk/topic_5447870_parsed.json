Will bitcoin also loose value because the dollar is worthless? yes, there would probably be other things to mind like world war, full panic, no internett and so on. But set these things aside. How much would a sack of potatoes cost, and with what could I buy these potatous witth(gold/bitcoin/chickens/etc.)?Any ideas? and any ideas on how bitcoin could be independant of the dollar, or other fiat? I see a lot of good ideas here.The reason for this thread is to explore if there are some other ways to value bitcoin. Like many of you said, it would probably just hop over to the next largest currency. But do we want the bitcoin to allways be dependant on another currency and its inflatory politics? Many of you also said that the dollar will never go to 0 and there is no reason to worry about this. But every currency in the world is loosing value everyday. Therefore bitcoin is also loosing its value. it may be a stupid question, but would it not be better to have another way to value bitcoin so you could allways buy 1 sack of potatoes for 1 satoshi for exampel?",

Dollar's acceptance is also greatly overestimated. Even in the EU you'll going to have a hard time finding someone to sell you stuff for USD. You'd have to use a currency exchange, or overpay by a lot to get someone to trade with you. What if it goes to 0? Other fiat currencies will explode because for it to go to 0 people would have to be selling it and the gold reserves of the US and its economy would have to be insufficient to pump the price back up. I don't think it's ever going to happen. They FED will see it coming and make a tactical retreat by changing a name of the currency and relaunching it as the digital dollar or something similar. They're going to make the reset without the people knowing that it's the reset. Their whole job is to protect the currency, even if it means sending the military to steal some gold and secure an oil deal, the way they did in Iraq.",

Well, let's just say that imagination ends with imagination. If not, there is no way a country's currency can probably turn to zero value; the only time this can be possible is if the country is no longer in existence. If, however, the currency is still being used for day-to-day trade, there is probably a value attached to it. If the dollar happens to be devalued and nothing is attached to it again but other currencies still exist and value is being added to them, it will only affect the BTC price for some time and not the value. BTC value is being placed upon the high or low demand for it. So without the dollar, BTC can easily adjust to other globally accepted currencies and pair with them. BTC is not tied to the dollar, and as such, the fall of the dollar can't be the downfall of Bitcoin.",

Let assume an  event where the dollar or other fiat currencies goes completely bust. Very unlikely to happen and if that does happen, we will see a global economy collapse, which we really don't want right now...But we are assuming if that might happen, people might actually turn to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since they're not tied to any government or central bank and completely decentralized. In that case bitcoin and most of the crypto currencies might become more valuable since there are limited supply. For the sack of potatoes you want to buy, you probably have to determine how many potatoes you will get for 1 satoshi (the market will eventually decide based on demand and supply).Quote from: kickea on April 06, 2023, 10:42:00 PMany ideas on how bitcoin could be independent of the dollar, or other fiat?

It seems to me that you have no idea about economic issues. Coins almost never go to 0, they lose value until they reach almost 0 compared to other currencies, but they don't go to 0 overnight. And in this case, the dollar even less. When enough time passes, any fiat currency becomes worth almost 0 relative to its original purchasing power.Quote from: kickea on April 06, 2023, 10:42:00 PMBut set these things aside.

Owning bitcoin is a good way to protect yourself, but not the only way, and you should stop worrying so much about hypothetical scenarios.",

The value of it will crash hard when they print it a lot and also in case of dollar when the world abandons it and all the supply goes back to United States itself but it will cause huge hyperinflation not drop down to zero.The effects of that on bitcoin is only a massive price rise because bitcoin's value doesn't magically change because of value of dollar ergo as dollar value dumps if bitcoin value remains the same it has to massively rise in \"price\".Of course the market is so much more complicated than that. For example when the price rise starts it also attracts more investors hence increasing the value and price a lot more.P.S. keep in mind that there is a difference between price and value. Price is measured against fiat and has different ups and downs in different fiat currencies depending on the value of that fiat. For example when Bolivar dumped, bitcoin went up against it while remaining the same against dollar. When dollar dumps it will be the same, bitcoin will go up against dollar while remaining the same against other fiat currencies (of course as I said it could attract more investors which leads to its rise against those too).",
