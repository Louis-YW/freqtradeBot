Suppose your favorite online casinos don't offer any Black Friday bonuses, would you try other casinos that do or stay loyal to them?Bonuses don't play much of a role in my decision to gamble, so ultimately I will go to place bets where I feel my money is safest from scams or other fishy behavior.  Sure, it's nice to get a bonus, but I'm a bit too cynical to think that casinos are offering them out of the goodness of their hearts.  More likely it's just another way to advertise for them and I'm sure this section of the forum will be flooded with various Black Friday offers.  However, I would say to pay attention to which sites are the most trusted, instead of looking at who has the shiniest lights outside of their building to attract customers...  A lot of the time it's the users who end up paying for these various bonuses in the end as nothing is free to develop and implement.  More important to me is knowing my money is safe.",

Black Friday seems an interesting day for those who are seeking for more bonuses and extra reward if there is, just look at the good site if you are still new and follow their instructions always so you can qualify for their bonuses.",

The word loyal is not my own personal habit and if I see something good I usually jump up but if the casino gives me satisfaction while gambling, I usually stay. Hopefully, gambling casinos will not restrict these bonuses when it comes to withdrawal, the reason could the highest required fees and wager that you have on such casinos.",

So technically, if the sites I’m playing with have this bonuses, will grab it since as a gambler getting some bonuses might increase your odds to win since some bonuses allows you to play more. Haven’t see any promotion yet with regards to Black Friday, do you mind to share sites who have this already?",

As said, bonuses too could be a trap. Just because some platform is providing special promotion and bonuses should not make deposits without analysing its operation. Always find the platform with good reputation. Bonus is just a way to keep the gamblers happy even while facing losses. On special events receiving bonuses will let gamblers play and have fun than just watching others bets.",

But until now, I've only seen one casino that offers a promo regarding this black Friday and I see that it's normal because almost all casinos do this, namely a deposit bonus, maybe this Black Friday won't be too much attention with promotions because there is a bigger event going on being the target of the casino, namely the world cup, is just my guess",

Suppose your favorite online casinos don't offer any Black Friday bonuses, would you try other casinos that do or stay loyal to them?I would definitely consider trying out a different casino for the purpose of taking advantage of the bonuses offered by Black Friday.Given that Black Friday only happens once a year, it is considered one of those events where discounted prices of all products are being offered. Along with this promotion, gambling websites would definitely offer cash-out bonuses, rewards for referrals, etc. in celebration of this event. Assuming that my go-to casino does not have any offers, I would be somehow compelled to check other casinos if they have any offers.Though that may be the case, I would also reconsider my decision if the gambling website would be stringent in asking for KYC documents. I think I am more comfortable sharing my KYC into just one gambling website.",

This is natural for those of us who want to try to get new experiences at the new casino. But we must be careful trying it because we don't know the performance of the new casino yet and we still have to see whether we can be comfortable staying or moving to the new casino or staying loyal to the old casino. And towards the end of the year, like now, more offers will be given by each casino, new or old, to invite more gamblers.",

They make the rules so that it is almost impossible to win anything from the bonus. Even if you do manage to beat the rules and win something, very likely they do add some restrictions on how much you can take from the bonus winnings. Most high rollers, don't actually care about those event free spins and bonuses during events. They look for casinos that they are comfortable playing with and has good programs that rewards them for being active gamblers.",

About the black Friday deals, I think it can also happen on many other casinos including on the existing casino that we are playing. Why not stick on them instead? And for sure the wager requirements are also low because this was a special event. It is like thanking the customer for their continued support in the company.",

Ofcourse it would be an advantage for players on that date but I doubt it would be advantageous to the gambling house as well;, more players means bigger profit for the gambling platform. Not being obvioud it is a give and take scenario not to mention players who could be attracted to their gbling website and would choose to say, that would be their bonus. So for gamblers out there, enjoy promotions and bonuses that will be offered by gambling sites not only this coming date, but even afterwards. Keep an eye on the profit if you are really into it. And for those who are just doing this for fun, you'd definitely enjoy it more whenever events like these happen.",

Judging by the experience of previous years, it is unlikely that there will be any gifts in connection with Black Friday, but there will be other promotions (however, they are held regularly all year round). I will not look for new casinos with profitable promotions, it seems to me that the profit from them is minimal compared to the waste of time and risks.",
