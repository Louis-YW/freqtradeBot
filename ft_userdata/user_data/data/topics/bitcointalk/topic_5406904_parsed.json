I was following a guide from bitcoin magagazine on setting up Sparrow with your node that includes that line and it's not necessary since I'm not using upnp. By enabling UPnP in bitcoin's config, you'll have to enable UPnP in your router as well for it to work.Although that's not necessary if you're using port forwarding or not aiming for inbound connections.",

And if you need it open and something else has to change to do it then it can be a scramble to replace their router with yours and so on.-Dave",
