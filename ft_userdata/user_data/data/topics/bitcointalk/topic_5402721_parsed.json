  "content": "Hit left and right with sanctions by nations as their own means of protesting the callous treatment of Russia against Ukraine, it would not come as a surprise that the EU have decided to hit them where they least expect by placing a partial ban on their importation of crude oil. This act alone has caused a major strain on their economy as this avenue is one of the biggest nation growth propeller. Meanwhile, Russia had stopped the use of and acceptance of the dollar as means of payment in a bid to grow their currency, the ruble. Although 36% of Russian crude oil is being purchased by the EU, they believe that by putting an embargo, it will weaken the hand of Putin to think twice. Unfazed by this turn of events, Russia believe they can find a replacement ASAP. The question is, will this sanctions weaken them to the point of forcing them off the market? https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.csis.org/analysis/european-union-imposes-partial-ban-russian-oil&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjXwe37tq_4AhUK-4UKHQZ-CIcQFnoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw3apBBht84rJo12tg3T9JiB",

I think the socioeconomics of Russia before any of this didn't look very attractive though and it's quite obvious to see (possibly for the Russian military too) that a lot of former soviet countries have done much better out of being away from Russia than their country has (not sure about other issues but I remember healthcare being documented a few years ago in Russia as being quite inaccessible).",

Of course, oil will be sold at a discount, but there will still be profits. So the refusal to link oil with the dollar only plays into the hands of Russia.",

If there is an embargo, ban or sanction it should be an immediate execution but so far it is looking like Russians are buying enough time to strengthen their economy the report from the  news  states that after December 2022 the seaborne imports of Russian crude  will be ban and by February 2023 a ban of  petroleum product imports which gives the Russians enough time to source other point of sale terminals.",

They are already in business with Russia and buying up crude products at least 20% of it. India is also one of the new found friends with Russia. The India crude demand is also high taking the population into account. I think the EU partial ban on Russian crude won't really have much effect.",

China, India and other African countries would be ever willing to buy cheap Russian oil and make profit from them. It was noticed that India was helping Russia invade sanctions by serving as a middleman between Russia and other countries. They buy from Russia and sell to other countries making profits from the transactions. Russia is a key player in the oil and gas sector and for now no nation can replace them. Forcing them out of the market would be disastrous. Hungary would also sabotage the European Union effort to suffocate the Russian economy. The capturing of major ports in Ukraine was a calculated attempt to weaponize food and the world would have succumb to Russian pressures to avoid food crisis. The only path to prosperity is peace through negotiation and compromise because these sanctions might not deter Russia.",

But for the EU, they bear more risk amid the onslaught of skyrocketing prices due to not receiving payments in dollars. Russia wants to grow the ruble even further and their target is only to focus on crushing prices in the market so that they want western countries to comply.The United States does not move freely, dealing with inflation is certainly more important than dealing with the increasingly strained internal relationship with Ukraine. Now who cares about the colonized country when everyone is preoccupied with the declining foreign economy?",

Russia is losing, mind you FOREVER, the oil market of the EU and most normal countries. India and China are removing the last from the impoverished Russia, which has not long to live. Yes, you do not know that China is definitely buying at a price of about $40 per barrel, with almost a 70% discount!!! Otherwise, China will not buy, such are its conditions. I am sure that India also buys oil for a penny. But this price, and even with the artificially \"squeezed expensive ruble\", will form a huge budget deficit! I recommend that you read at what price of oil and at what dollar rate the budget of Russia was drawn up, and then recalculate the lost income.For one thing, Russia is also losing the EU gas market. I think China and India are also buying up these resources on the cheap, very cheap! And given that hydrocarbons generate almost 50% of imports and foreign exchange earnings to the budget of the Russian Federation, this will be a sequel to \"USSR2. Russia. Decay in just a couple of years\"",

There is no guess as to how long sanctions will last so no more wars, or proxy wars, from Russia within the next 20 years minimum. Ukrainian war has the potential to last a decade if Russia wanted it to. They just need to hold the occupied territories in eastern Ukraine.",

(It is everyone for themselves..... and India and China has proven this during these times)  If you do not delve into the topic, then of course everything seems so. But there are nuances that for some reason are not customary to talk about  At a minimum, China (I'm sure that India too) buys illiquid oil at penny prices. According to information from traders, the price in deals with China is about $40 per barrel of Urals oil. Secondly, logistics costs have increased many times over. Now oil must be transported by tankers not to the EU, which is nearby, but at least to Korea, and reloaded onto Chinese supertankers. After the full launch of the embargo, China will still order Russia to lower the price. Why ? And where does Russia put oil that no one buys? And there is no place to store such volumes. Secondly, for your information, the Russian budget was drawn up with a fixed oil price (in the actual deal) of about $75 per barrel. Total losses are already at least 2 times less. The USSR also squealed \"What do we need your sanctions, Mr. Reagan!?\", and where is that USSR now?",

If valid, Russia might be able to stop US interference in its life, simply by making Americans angry at not having power.INSANELY VULNERABLE: If Russia cuts off supply of enriched uranium to US power companies, America’s nuclear energy reactors will close within a yearQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-15-russia-cuts-enriched-uranium-nuclear-reactors-down.html#Former Department of Energy (DoE) Under Secretary Paul Dabbar and Columbia University energy researcher Matt Bowen have published a report warning that America’s energy crisis could soon get a whole lot worse if Russia stops selling enriched uranium to nuclear power plants.If supplies get cut, they say, then many United States nuclear power generation facilities would be forced offline within a year. The result would be much less energy availability and sky-high prices even beyond current inflation figures.Nuclear power accounts for more than 20 percent of all U.S. electricity generation capacity, and nearly half of the country’s 56 operational nuclear power plants use enriched uranium imported from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Although Russia only mines about six percent of the world’s uranium, it controls about 40 percent of the global uranium conversion market and 46 percent of total uranium enrichment capacity.Not only would the U.S. suffer in such a scenario, but so would Finland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Turkey, all of which rely on Russian state nuclear giant Rosatom for uranium mining, milling, conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication to the construction and servicing of state-of-the-art reactors.If Russia cuts off uranium to America, the latter will only have itself to blameDabbar and Bowen are urging Western leaders to “immediately consider their exposure to Russian nuclear exports and to take steps to reduce it or face another energy shock at the hands of [President Vladimir] Putin,” based on the current situation.Not only that, but the two also want the federal government to provide assistance and incentives for U.S.-based uranium conversion and enrichment facilities to help rebuild the country’s dilapidated and in many ways failing nuclear fuel supply chain....",
