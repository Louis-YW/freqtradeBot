Namecheap isn't even responding lol Hostinger keeps on asking for additional evidence even though ponzi scheme is illegal in all jurisdictions.These offshore hosting providers really don't care and these replies by them is hurting my little ego lolI guess this is where they thrive, providing services to scammers. Guess I will create a bot to feed their sign-up pages with fake data constantly and try to DDOS them next week. When I have more time.",
