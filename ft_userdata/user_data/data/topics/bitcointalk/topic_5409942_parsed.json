BUSD token can be traded anywhere on platforms or swap services. The weird thing is i also received airdrops of phishing tokens i looked on internet and knew it's a trick where they sent an airdrop of 211 token which worth arround 300$ the tricky thing is that alot of swap services can easly fool you. The phishing token has a price and is accepted for trade. But once you pay the gas fees for swaping them to bnb you get robbed and all your tokens in the wallet disappear. Thank you @maus0728 for your informations",

      "body": "What you are describing is similar to this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5350998.0I'm not sure about the technical know-how, but essentially, in order to trade a token, you must first interact with the token's smart contract. This leaves the user vulnerable to having their wallet drained. However, keep in mind that this information can be inaccurate in some way, so take it with a grain of salt.In the end, don't engage with them nor exchange them in any way for your safety. You might also assume that your wallet has been compromised, particularly if you frequently receive shitcoins. It can mean that your address has been shared/sold to elsewhere.",

And I’m wondering how is that possible and who sent me those tokensThis is the transaction link  I think this token is left alone, and does not need to be transferred to your important wallet, I'm afraid that without you realizing it you are exposed to a trap created by hackers. But if you are really curious about the token and want to move it to another wallet, it's better to move it to a new wallet that you have never used, to make sure that the token is really safe.",
