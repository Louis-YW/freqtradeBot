How common are private messages offering invitations? I post in English & Arabic but he contacted me in Arabic. After I replied he didn't send another message. I've translated them.Subject may peace blessings of God be upon youMessage Precious brother will you allow me to invite you to something?I didn't reply immediately. I've included obligatory customary blessings.Message and upon you may there be peace blessings of God. Brother how can I address your invitation without knowing anything about you. Please explain what you want from me.There's a question I'd like answered. His account's active he didn't reply so was I target or did he send private messages to others? If invitations get sent privately what's usually the senders intentions if they don't want public reading them? He could've been attempting to scam so I'm confused because I don't know why he sent it to me.",

If it's the former you can simply just ignore the message but if you're curious to know what he's inviting you to then you can continue the conversation with him/her but you should be extremely careful whenever they send any link to you. If the account is established then you probably should continue the conversation because they might be inviting due to something you normally do here on bitcointalk and thought you'll be fit for a certain job, but you should also keep in mind that the account could also be controlled by a different person entirely who has some malicious intentions for you.In whatever decision you choose to go with just make sure you're extremely careful and any slight sign of a scam make sure you report them to the forum so as to alert others that were also contacted.",

I've received a DM from a random stranger back a few months ago, and he is offering an idea of his with regards to trading, and the reason why he DM'ed me out of nowhere is because I just shared my opinion with regards to trading. I didn't entertained him that much because he went to ask me some private information that makes me uncomfortable. A few weeks after that happen, I saw some negative trust from him because of spreading malware. Anyway, blocking the user, just ignoring it, or simply report would be the best options for you OP.

So far things of this nature has happened in the past. My friend was telling me her friend's experience years past when she received a message of invitation not knowing that it was a different game all together and it almost got sour but thanks to the security around that premises at that particular time for their quick intervention. One needs to be very careful and take caution when handling such situations of unwarranted messages of invitation from unknown numbers and contacts. Always do well to confirm or call te contact to verify from them and take note of their voices and manner at which they respond to you do you could be able to decipher what they are up to.",
