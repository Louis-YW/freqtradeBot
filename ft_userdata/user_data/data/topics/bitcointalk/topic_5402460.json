  "content": "If you are a sportsbets bettor on fortunejack, you might not want to place bets that are similar on this website, and avoid a mistake I've done myself. In fact, this gives them the right to cancel your bets even after the sports events are over and your bets win. In that case if you want to place additional bets on the same event you might want to place them on a different website.As an example, I've had 4 bets on a combination of 2 events, with a possible win of 200,000 euros. Fortunejack accepted my bets, waited for all of the matches to begin/end, and when my bets won, they cancelled 3 bets and only considered the first bet as \"valid\", and ended up only paying 95,000 euros. You can checkout all of the details here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5368279.0I would have been 105,000 euros richer by now if I had made those last 3 bets on another website.The root for this behavior comes from their terms and conditions, that you can find below.Though it's good to know how in practice fortunejack does enforce these terms:-For them, identical bets are not necessarily bets that have the same meaning. In my case, they considered \"full time result\" as an identical bet to \"which team wins the rest of the match\"-They will wait for the outcome of the bet before deciding to cancel: if your bet wins, they cancel. This is what exactly hides behind the meaning of the right to cancel identical bets. It means not all of identical bets are cancelled, but only some of them (the ones that win) This topic is for you fortunejack sportsbettor: if you found this topic useful, please comment below!On the other hand, if this is not your case, please do not post off-topic comments.",
