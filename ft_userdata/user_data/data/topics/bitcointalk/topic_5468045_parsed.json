  "content": "I saw a thread made by @Coin_trader and i thought id share a scam i have seen popping up again aswell. This has happened 4 times in the last 2 weeks, so im guessing the same group/individual is at it again.What it looks like:A account will contact you on one of the social platforms or apps. (For me it has happened on Twitter, Telegram and Discord). The account will often have a tag or something related to the casino they \"represent\" and act as a dissapointed employee/mod.They will approach you and say something like this: Hey, i have seen you on gambling telegram or in a casinos chat room and i have a deal for you. They offer you an \"exploit\" that would allow you to win easily but they want 30% in return. They often offer screenshots etc of admin panel and so on.They then give you a link to a casino and ask you to deposit there. BUT in reality, they control the casino and once you deposit, the money is theirs. And you have been scammed.This happened to a friend of mine aswell a few weeks ago, and he fell for it (small loss luckily). As he went to withdraw, they asked for his KYC aswell. So not only can you loose all your money, they get your ID aswell.In short, be careful out there. Crooks are getting creative.",

And you have been scammed.On some casinos, you will have to gamble with the money you deposited before you can be able to withdraw, but if you win, the scammers can be smarter and withdraw before the victim will think of withdrawing.There are some casinos that you will be able to withdraw all your money after you have deposited even without gambling. I guess the scammer will let people to deposit on casinos that the scammer will be able to withdraw the money even without using the money for gambling.This scam is easy to avoid, but some people are greedy and thinking they have something good coming, not know they have been dealing with scammers.",

I believe only those newbie that doesn’t have enough casino experience or users that doesn’t know forum to deteemine trusted casino is the only possible victim on this scheme since you will think twice on depositing money on an unknown casino if you are regular player of trusted casino no matter how good the offer is.But there’s really potential victim on this scheme since many newbie still being attracted on bonus and sure money rewards despite uncertainty on casino reputation. Sadly, we can’t educate everyone on how to deal with scam.",

      "body": "I want to add:Quote from: KTChampions on September 25, 2023, 11:12:11 AMNo, there was nothing about this, but I assume that this is exactly the scheme there. Do you really know nothing about the scheme when you are offered to bet on a “fixed match” and the commission (payment for your help) is very generous (up to 50%)? Moreover, you won’t even bet your money - the required amount will be transferred to you. The problem is that these coins are stolen and the scammers don’t care how much you pay - if you win, they will receive 50%, but with the white money that you receive from the casino, you will also receive the winnings, but also subsequent problems with the police (you provided your account, which means there will be questions to you). This is money laundering where you are left with dirty money in your hands.Even if the scammers themselves offer you money, you should not deal with them. Not many people understand the entire algorithm, so they may fall for this more “advanced” scheme. As has already been written, free cheese can only be found in a mousetrap (and only for the second mouse), so never try to make money where you do not understand the whole topic.",

      "body": "\"Crooks are getting creative.\"   So true. But this is the first time I have heard about something like this. Directing gamblers to their gambling site so they can scam them there. For me, it's kind of difficult to make victims out of it because of trust issues but I guess the promise of 30% profits will be their ace to make it more attractive. Wise, but still I think gamblers will be doubtful especially those who first look at security.Another story that I've heard is targeting those VIP ranks in a known gambling site. He told his story about an e-mail that he received after he just won something big and shared some of it through tips and some trivia with prizes. The content of the mail is about receiving a bonus and he was shocked because he already received the bonus for that month as a VIP. Luckily, he shared it in chat and a mod told him to check first on where the link would lead him without clicking it. There he found out that it was a hack/scam attempt that he avoided.Truly, they are getting better at this and we must be aware of any possible scenario by sharing our own experiences or from others.",

You’re right. Strangers offering you some instant opportunities are indeed too good be true. Note that people will never give us an edge if they can’t take advantage on us first. That’s why they need our funds first so they can fulfill their promises as well. And if you are greedy enough, you will surely bite this kind of offer and easily believe that you will really get rich. And when you fall on their trap, that’s when you realized that you were taken advantage and get scammed.",

If the deal is so lucrative that you feel that it is easy money for you, then there are more chances that you will get scammed.For sure, if anyone asks you to give us money so he can gamble and share profits, we will refuse instantly but gamblers always come up with new ways to scam us. This is a more advanced technique where the scammer has his own gambling site and whatever we deposit on that site actually becomes the property of the scammer.Now the big question is how can we save ourselves from these scams. The first is that we should not be greedy. This way, we can avoid many of such scammers attempt offering us easy money.",
