Exchanges as staking platforms have shown themselves to be the worst, constantly changing even the fixed staking rates. Convinced by my own experience. Sending to staking through official wallets seems reasonable, but I'd like to consider options where there's a large selection and you can track everything at once.I've only used Beefy and didn't have any issues, however, I've recently heard that they're struggling financially, which isn't a healthy sign. Currently, I'm using Binance savings, it provides 10% APY on BUSD for up to $2.000. So far, it hasn't changed rates. Their locked staking options aren't too bad, but they are rarely available or/and have a tiny available quota.I moved my funds there after the Terra incident, due to it being the easiest and most prompt solution. It's certainly not the best, but looks okay for the time being.",

For services that provide passive income to users, risk would be higher. Because these services have their risk of imbalance between inputs and outputs on their platform finance. If their finance is broken, you will likely lose your money there.You can end without any compensation from them too if in the end, they go to be bankrupted.QuoteIt is better to buy coins when they are cheap and sell them.

I would hate to remind you how wrong something like this can go.Even in Bitcoin, you have zero guarantee whatsoever, who knows if and when it'll recover? In my opinion, 10-15% profit margin is a good profit because you will not find such an APY in any traditional company. But when it comes to investing, there is no such thing as a 100% safe investment, even bitcoin. In the current situation, a series of lending platforms are collapsing, and this is a warning that we should avoid staking at this time, holding will remain our top priority.",

It should not be an exchange all the time.I tend to agree with the bolded part above and that's why until now I didn't try staking even others tell me that they have earned on it. The reason is that I didn't see any potential crypto exchange platform to trust my fund in a long run, all of them are CEXs and we know from time to time they'd have a right to change the terms, or worst, they will become bankrupt and shutdown.This is what is also in my mind \"Not your keys, Not your coins\" which is staking you didn't hold your wallet key, it's on exchange. Sorry OP but I didn't see any good and adequate staking exchange platform.",
