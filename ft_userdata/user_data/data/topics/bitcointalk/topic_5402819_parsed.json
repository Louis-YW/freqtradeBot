But already did some transactions. But mostly I just used some dapps inside the metamask app. Do you think they would consider that options as criteria? But technically it is not really a metamask usage right but the dapp itself like the uniswap and 1inch platform.",

I still remember 2 years ago or so when Uniswap basically did the first of those airdrops and i also remember that some users got an extremely high amount of tokens and basically become rich overnight with that drop because they did not only trade but they also provided liquidity. Absolutely crazy.If Metamask is really doing an airdrop then i would guess that this would probably be one of the biggest airdrops in history because Metamask has so many users. I am using Metamask for many years now and i also used it to stake, for transaction and so on, so i would guess that i would also be eligible this time. We will see.",

All of us are metamask users and an airdrop coming from the industry considered as the number one wallet is worth holding, I remember getting an airdrop from Uniswap, and its the best airdrop I received, Â and if metamask decides to launch one, the community would like to be part of it, developers are likely to be part of the airdrop and that includes scammers they hold a lot of Ethereum and transactions.",
