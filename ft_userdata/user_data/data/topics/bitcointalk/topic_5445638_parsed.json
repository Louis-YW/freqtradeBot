  "content": "Alik BakhshiRussia returned to the era of war communism      The Russian Fuhrer once again violated the Constitution by declaring that Russian businessmen are \"voluntarily\" obliged to give part of their income to the state. We must think that this, one might say, royal decree, will find the unanimous support of the people, because it corresponds to its mentality. Kholops are disgusted with the well-being of their neighbor, they have no desire to achieve it, they have only one desire - to destroy this well-being. Line up bitches, line up! In short, the era of war communism has returned to Russia.03/19/2023",

I do believe that Putin has religious views, that would explain his close relation with the Russian church, which is very much in favor of the attack on Ukraine.Also, I do not doubt he has friends in charge of important industries like Gas/oil and management of military personnel. Most of them, I assume, are already sanctioned.",

Like encouraging the aggression or something? Because, even though you talk about souls, I personally believe that a president shutting down temples or churches in his own country sounds rather like a political act than a religious one. I am sure that in the Unites States, the government would consider to do the same if a church ended up being the center for seditious conspiracy or something similar, which is not protected by the first amendment.",

They call themselves to be doing God's work but continue to push the narrative of the government.I recall seeing on TV one of the ceremonies being carried by one of the biggest authorities of the Russian Church and he was basically defending the actions of the Kremlin, pointing out to the alleged degeneracy of the west which was affecting the Ukrainian society and evil forces wanted to introduce it into Russia, among other things.So basically, to him the scapegoat to justify the war is to keep in check the liberal policies of western countries, which have been becoming more popular around the world.",
