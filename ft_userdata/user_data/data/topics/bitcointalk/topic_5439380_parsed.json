And I was told the PROs and CONs..very importantly. Since I've had experience already in the field, I wanted to know how returns and cash deposits are being made to the maga slots and he showed me.Secondly, during the discussion,¬† he made a statement about meeting a specific target TBH, say -- weekly target or so... He said that for the tickets to count a good number before the week runs, he needed to also gamble along...at first, that was looking insane to me but he explained how he's got to lose nothing at all if he loses to a bet.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

If they gamble, do you think they gamble on their platform? Most probably, gambling casino owners have wide experience when it comes to gambling that‚Äôs why they chose to make it as a business instead because they know exactly how gamblers would end up loving the experience in gambling casinos that would make them to keep coming back and gamble again. And of course, those who will test first the gambling experience before any random gamblers are surely the casino owners themselves so that they can assess if the experience is worth it or not.",

But the one who are gambler to their casino is their employee.It's common things, while people who working on casino are gambler as well. Sad to hear this, but casino/landbase should make some rules (All of the employee cannot betting to their casino, avoiding the payment check is back to them again).Like \"Ferarri\" rules to their employee, they don't want the money they're pay are going back again to their company by buying the car.",

Lets suppose i am the onwer of the casino and i bet on a sports match on my own site. Now if i win, i pay myself the winning amount and if i lose , my money will remain with me as when gamblers lose a bet, it is actually casino who gains the money.So does it make sense that a casino owner gamble on his own site ? In that case, he can never lose the money despite the result of the casino or betting game.",

Yes, casino owners do gamble a lot as well because maybe they were gamblers before and they may gamble on their own platform for marketing strategy or maybe they are gambling in other platform as part of entertainment. No, it is mostly because the casino owners are not gambler but they see there is a big chance to make money from the gambling industry by owning a casino.Or other reason for NO because it will be useless for casino owner to gamble in their own platform because winning or losing means nothing.",

Example is if I have a gambling site, I gamble, know that it is still my money if I win or lose. If they win, it is there money it is the gain that it would be taken from there casino. If they lose, they lose to themselves and it is their casino. Which means they do not lose anything as they use their gambling site for it. That makes me think they can not even see gambling as fun.",

If they gamble, do you think they gamble on their platform?Quite an interesting question. Reminds me of the rules of drug dealers not to use what they sell  In fact, it seems to me that casino owners are the same people as everyone else (only with greater financial opportunities) and therefore they have similar preferences. Someone is only interested in business, someone is into sports, someone is into gambling, someone is into drugs/prostitutes, etc. Obviously, if they are passionate about gambling, then they are most likely high rollers. Whether they play in their casino is difficult to say, since on the one hand it is logical (the money goes to you yourself) and on the other hand it is not (it makes no sense to win at your own place).",

They have everything in there possession so why do you think they have to bet and which money are they going to win. Many of these people are only interested in making consistent traffics to there casino so betting on the same or other casino can be very outrageous to think about. Just like the person that has a poultry will be so tire of eating eggs or chicken, same way would a owner of a casino. What they need is for them to make profits not to gamble themselves.",

I would say that there is already a shift of mindset when you are still a full gambler and now that you‚Äôre already a casino business owner. Instead of gambling your money and giving them to casino, most likely the mindset of the owner is never to gamble anymore but to invest his funds and attract a lot of gamblers to play on his casino so he can always take an edge of their funds. While gambling can also be his previous hobby, but now he is more focused on accumulating more profits from the gamblers that have been enjoying their stay in his casino business.",
