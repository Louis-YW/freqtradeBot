If you hack the complete supply chain of toyota so they think you bought (and payed for) a new car, you'll have a new car. If you hack all IRS databases you won't have to pay taxes this year...In reality, nodes are run on about every modern OS available... I used to run mine on bsd, now i'm running it on CentOS (have to switch so SLES pretty soon). I know people running them on Mac, i know people running them on Windows, i'm pretty sure you'll find people running them on AIX, HP-UX,... All different OS's behind different firewalls, running different thread mitigation methods, sometimes only available as tor hidden service...Hacking 50% of the nodes seems harder than hacking all banks, or all irs databases, or all toyota backend servers...",

And most computers having Bitcoin Core are Linux system (and afaik there are no known such exploits as you imply for Linux) and the rest do have protection installed, hence you won't touch them.So making an exploit to take over the consensus is - by far - unrealistic.Keep in mind that although there is a huge number of computers going online, way less than 1% is usually hit by a malware. I'd go by this numbers also in your scenario. And 1% won't change any consensus.",

      "body": "As well as what's said above, most miners will have their nodes configured to use different ports and places where port 8333 is taken might also do the same.Most simple firewalls start at a point of:Block all connections I don't initiate (for client based-non server environments)OrBlock all connections that look different to what my others do (for servers)And I think the second point here is what's going to cause your problem. Most firewalls (if they accept bitcoin core) are able for peer discovery because most nodes send the same types of information and the same style of packets (a message telling you the current block height from two nodes should look almost identical if the protocol is the same - such as if both are using bitcoin core).Quote from: NotATether on October 18, 2022, 11:21:20 AMStep 1 is not applicable because most data centers where you'd run a server ban port scanning, but then again there are lists of nodes on Bitnodes.Even if you can run port scanning on a datacentre, you'll probably find most will run vpns to forward their traffic so they'll just change their ports and IP addresses (they probably do this dynamically quite often too - saves an old machine you don't want to connect to your machine trying to connect back).",

      "body": "There are a bunch of problems here. First it is very hard to find the operating system of the nodes since the information is not provided through the defined P2P message protocols so you'll have to find an alternative way to figure that out.Secondly the only exploit you can hope for is in the operating system not in the full node implementation because they don't leave any room for \"remote code execution\" to be exploited. That means you are now facing multiple OS versions and types that all have to have an exploit which is not possible.Finally you can't change consensus rules since it is the compiled code that is enforcing those rules (the code) and you can't change the code at run time. You first have to close the application, change the rules, compile the code again and (re)start running the node. That adds more challenge.Assuming this attack is successful the scale is going to be small so now you are basically creating a fork where you have a minority chain that is working on an altcoin that is rejected by the rest of the network.There is also the additional problem of getting a miner to mine said altcoin blocks.",

I have nodes that are not running on port 8383, and nodes that are not directly accessible from the internet.Quote from: Delta_Freak on October 18, 2022, 07:48:04 AMStep 2:We will find out on which hardware (cpu architecture ) and operating system the nodes running on.If you haven't accomplished step 3 yet, how are you going to find this out?  Are you going to sneak into all the buildings and look at all the equipment to see what they are running?  If so, then you didn't need step 1, did you?  Instead, step one should say \"sneak into every building on earth and see if they are running any equipment that might be capable of running a Bitcoin Node. LOL.Quote from: Delta_Freak on October 18, 2022, 07:48:04 AMStep 3:Using Zero-days exploit for arbitrary code execution on each nodes we find.What if there isn't a zero-day exploit available for the system that you are attempting to attack? If you can find a node, and if you can determine that it has an exploit available, sure you'll be able to attack that one node. You aren't going to gain access to all of them though. If you can't access ALL nodes, then you can ONLY attack the people whose nodes you do gain access to, not anybody else.Quote from: Delta_Freak on October 18, 2022, 07:48:04 AMStep 4: Changing the consensus rules. (something like \"if you're translate transaction which transfer n BTC to bc1adwHq....3q (The attacker's address ) , it does not require signing this transaction with Private key or whatever  Its Something like forced Hardfork. You might be able to confuse a few people by tricking THEIR nodes to split off temporarily onto your hard fork. However, those people will quickly see that their nodes are incorrect and they will clean out the malware, fix the zero-day, and reinstall Bitcoin Core. Now they are right back on the main Bitcoin Network and you haven't accomplished anything.Quote from: Delta_Freak on October 18, 2022, 07:48:04 AMSince we have more computing power than anyone else, these rules will be valid in the longest chainNope.  That's not how Bitcoin works.  You've misunderstood.  If you have ALL of the nodes in the ENTIRE WORLD (except mine), including ALL the miners and mining pools, and you try to change the consensus rules, my nodes still won't accept your invalid blocks.  Amount of computing power does not make it possible to turn invalid blocks into valid blocks. This is why we call them CONSENSUS rules, and not MAJORITY rules. majority hashpower ONLY decides which VALID blocks are accepted when two different VALID blocks are competing for the next position in the blockchain. A hard fork requires EVERYONE (miners, pools, merchants, consumers, node-running hobbyists, wallet software creators, etc) to ALL agree on the new rules. Otherwise, anyone still running the old rules will simply reject any invliad block no matter how much hash power it was created with.What do you think about it ? Is it real ?[/quote]",
