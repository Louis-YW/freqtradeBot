Well, a lot of people think that all Tornado Cash is good for is mixing tokens for scammers, launderers, hackers and other criminals but that isn't entirely true. It's a very pragmatic viewpoint (a lot of people have this kind of mindset in Russia and China where everything is black or white). The reality is that if you don't have privacy, you don't have freedom, so we need to ensure that blockchains are as private as the coinage that we used in the past; otherwise we could be entering a real distopia where our money and lives are tracked and our money can be frozen due to saying or doing things the people in government power don't like. What if a new government party was elected that didnt' like muslims and decided that muslims should pay an extra Halal tax on all transactions? Things like this are coming if we don't protect our privacy.",

Just avoid transparent blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum and use Monero so you don't have to deal with third party mixers. These mixers and Coinjoins will continue to be haunted by authorities and it could be a matter of time before they're uncovered or unmasked.Quote from: freigeist on September 08, 2022, 05:01:23 PM.....There is a flaw here.To have a hardware wallet you need to order one andto order one you need to leave your name and email and whatever datais needed to purchase trezor hardware wallet.Thefefore you are not private any more at step 1you are fucked once the company get hacked or the data gets stolen.Is your device tied to your name or email address when you buy them?

We all know how the world of crypto developed, it's a rapid phase, so sooner or later we will all gonna heard a new mixing services for ETH similar to tornado cash but this time it is \"bullet proof\", until the government cracks it down again. Just like in Bitcoin mixing services, it's a continues development and those mixers what to stay one step of the game. So the best thing to do right now is wait.",

I don't know if this is true or not but the token is supposed to enable you to store and transfer BUCC privately on ETH.These mixers are new to me, so I can't tell whenever they're trustworthy or not. You'd just have to check on the code to see for yourself (although if such forks are a direct copy of the original Tornado.Cash protocol, there shouldn't be any problem using it). It's a good thing we have other alternatives, or we would've been \"toast\" by now. This shows us that crypto/Blockchain tech is truly unstoppable thanks to its decentralized and open source design. I don't think the US government will hunt down these alternatives, but if it does, then people should be prepared to make another copy just in case. Hosting the frontend interface of the mixer protocols on IPFS or another decentralized network should render governments' efforts futile in the long run.As much as I'm against money laundering and tax evasion, I hate it when governments take down people's ability to enjoy privacy and true financial freedom. At crypto won't be going anywhere soon. Who knows if the US and other mainstream governments give up on their efforts to try to destroy crypto/Blockchain tech? Just my thoughts",

First of all, \"could be entering?\"Newsflash, have you googled the FAFT travel rule? Money is already been traced. Old physical cash is disappearing fast and there will be MORE regulations and more automation for tracing it, not less. Funny enough reasons are transparency and government fund auditability too. There are 2 sides still on this, while we need 1. confidentiality on transactions 2. we need auditability for those transactions for weeding out criminal use cases.Crypto however is as \"private\" or pseudonymous as it's always been. Trading it against fiat money however is where you need to explain where you got that crypto from and pay taxes for it.Dreaming about going back as anon as physical cash days is a pipe dream. We live in a different world and there's a good reason for that. Anonymous physical coinage wasn't a good idea.
