Some people really need to learn how to zoom out on the Bitcoin price chart. I mean look at monthly. There is still a lot of potential for up there. Even last weekly's candle seems to give a glimmer of hope that the current weekly candle will pull itself up by its bootstraps. There is nothing in the news which would point towards further dumps and I feel like we are currently in a bear trap. Accumulation is probably looking to keep going strong. We have had many such sudden dips with no apparent cause before a quick reversal in the past. In other words, I do not trust the red candle currently forming.",

This is a good opportunity to those who are waiting for a cheaper price with Bitcoin, and you can still wait for the support level.

For sure it would really be making out some pumps.The only hard thing or most common problem for us traders or investor is on how to distinguish the bottom for us to get in or make some position.We are always that be minding about the possible bottom as much as we could on which we do really be able to utilize and make that perfect entry which we know that it cant be known or possible.This kind of condition would really be definitely be depending on how you would really be dealing up with things or situation like this.Whether you would be holding your position and wait or would be buying up to accumulate more or you would be cutting losses.",

Seems like they dumped the sudden supply in the market which made the buyers panic and sellers took their entry as well in the same instant.So haha what about the future traders they''ve got their whole portfolio messed up if they didn't follow the proper trading strategies...

This is something that we are used to. In June we had same thing happen when the price plunged to below 26k and after a couple of days, it rebounded. This will not persist though. What is happening, I think is that bitcoin is reacting to the macroeconomics situation of bonds, equities, higher interest rates, and commodities weakening. It is a complex market but there is hope. You should get your money out and buy now.",

A quick handy accumulation point for those who were still waiting. I'm also expecting a quick pullback now it seems at least 3 to 4 days market will move around this line of 26k to 27k and even you can notice a few candles dropping below 26k.Firstly it was considered and announced as Spacex did this and their selling pressure is behind this drop but now even analysts are questing this as still haven't tracked out the major outflow in the market, also if it is SpaceX then the valuation seems a bit uncertain.",

Now it isnt really that bad time to accumulate while coins are still that cheap. We know that whenever Bitcoins price or the entire market suffering from deep reds then we do really that see some recovery which is something that very typical scenario or situation that we do able to experience.If you are just simply accumulating and just for long term then it wont really be that bad on making yourself do make out some position as of this moment as this market is really that on reds now and not only limited on Bitcoin investment but other on top altcoins as well which they had recently dropped its price after Bitcoins price did experience that sudden plunge.Well, this is just always like an ordinary day here on crypto space and nothing is shocking imho.",

One of the things that you should really be getting prepared on the time that you do deal up with this market is to make yourself that wary about the potential events or things that could happen and this is where we do really make use of those Plan B or C's in regarding in our position.Some might be that liquidated and some might be on negaitve.

It can also be used as dynamic SNR as well. However, the current price of Bitcoin is around $26k which is for me is just a retracement. The market is creating higher highs and higher lows that indicates the trend is bullish.

Whether a bear flag or bull flagg just have it in the mind that bull run is around the corner and that is less than a year old and when it comes, technical analysis will be dropped off, people will not look at that anymore, they will only be concerned about the price target bitcoin will hit which is I prefered to hold than all this set up, holding bitcoin is better than trading it looking at the long term wise.The rebound will happened but not so fast, trading is all about liquidity hunting, the last crash liquidated about $1T USD of long traders, the bulls will do the same thing back and ride the market to the top to revenge for the money they have lost to the bears, it will surely rebound. Beside, it's circulating around that Space X has not sold there btc, if they publish their balance sheet to the public, the market will pump.",

It could be that they will use the money to improve their Twitter/X platform because we have seen so many changes about it recently.The move done by Space'X was big but it seems not easy for the BTC price to go below $20k.
