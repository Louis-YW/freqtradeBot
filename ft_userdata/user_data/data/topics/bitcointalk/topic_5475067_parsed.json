      "body": "Well.. I am not sure how this is interpreted as \"punishing\" the citizens of Russia. Unless Binance is going to seize crypto-holdings of their Russian users, I will not translate this move as any sort of \"punishment\". First of all, the Russian government is not very positive about the role of crypto-currency (especially since the local currency got devalued by 2-3x during the last decade or so). And secondly, there are enough local crypto-exchanges in Russia itself and the users can just migrate to any of these platforms from Binance.",

So basically Binance left Russia, but Russian citizens can still open accounts and trade on the platform?I thought that \"leaving Russia\" means banning the Russian citizens from using Binance completely.Forbidding the Russians from buying and selling several altcoins doesn't seem like a real punishment to me.I didn't understand the news about Youtube, Telegram and Whatsapp being banned in Russia. This seems like fake news to me.Telegram is a Russian platform and even the pro-Putin supporters and organizations are actively using it.Telegram being banned in Russia doesn't make any sense at all.",

They've introduced some sanctions early on and some support for Ukrainians early on as well, but it's still not a complete absence of doing business in Russia yet.And I agree with Sithara007 that it's not exactly punishment. I think these are very reasonable measures, perhaps coming too late and not being harsh enough, really. I've seen that the US has actually launched investigation into Binance for it allegedly helping Russians bypass the US sanctions.",

Every Russian has a share of the blame for the fact that civilians from Ukraine have been dying every day for almost two years. This is not done by the Putin regime. It is the husbands, sons and children of “innocent” Russians who kill, rob and rape in Ukraine. Moreover, throughout these two years, approximately 70 percent of the Russian population has constantly supported the war and the seizure of Ukrainian territory.All Russians are guilty of electing the current government, which started this most brutal and bloody war in Europe since the Second World War. If the population had not supported the war and actively opposed it, it would not have started or would have ended very quickly. We have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Russia and the people’s election of their government. Therefore, on the other hand, every citizen of Russia is responsible for the actions of his government.In Ukraine, over 300 thousand Russians have already died, been wounded, captured or gone missing, and they are still climbing and climbing with weapons in their hands on Ukrainian soil. You can stop them either by military means, or try to do it in other ways, as the Binance crypto exchange does.",

It was agreed that the process will take one year to complete so we should expect more changes. This might also be part of the deal the company signed with the US Department of Justice. There are also reports that the reason for this action is due to poor liquidity and trading volume of these coins in the Russian market. All we can do is assume because the main reasons for these steps are kept away from the public.",

Think about it, they are punished 4.3 billion dollars right now by the SEC and CZ is gone, if USA is this strong about it, then I have to say that it is going to be quite a big deal for them, and they should do something that will benefit them on the long run.I believe that we are going to end up being a lot better one way or another, it should be the case and should be their benefit.

I have sympathy for both Ukraine and Russian citizens. But not for the dirty politics and the politicians. Maybe what Binance is doing is for there on promotions and publicity.

Somehow I think this is the connection between recent accusations of some exchanges funding the war with their Bitcoin addresses and supporting the rival countries. There are also accusations that Ukraine had gotten a lot of money via Bitcoin transfers to buy weapons. Now no one really knows what is truth but we know very well Bitcoin's nature of anonymity can give that much power to it and more power to criminals. I don't know but Russia (mostly Putin) was against Bitcoin since the first. Then news broke out that Putin is again trying to implement digital fiat in their system but with a lot of complications in the project. Now, here comes the biggest exchanger Binance, it was supposed to come out of Russia because they didn't want to get stains of criminal activities.

This is all about their profit and traffic, so they want to make many gigs for themselves, and mind you, Binance already has gigs and a name for their brand, which is well done without Russians patronizing their platform.Aside from that, the decentralized platforms are very open and free, and that represents the real purpose of crypto and blockchain, which is for anonymity.
