I may accept some relevant comments about the reports, such as if the report is incorrect because of a mistake, but any discussion about whether or not this thread is worth it and the like, in this thread I will delete it.Following 1miau's suggestion I will compile the reports in a table in this OP.AccountDatePost linkBlackBoss_November 09, 2023LinkWapfikaNovember 16, 2023LinkterizlaNovember 24, 2023LinkSmartGold01November 24, 2023LinkDr.Bitcoin_StrangeNovember 24, 2023LinkJeromeTashNovember 25, 2023LinkjohnsaributuaNovember 25, 2023LinkPopkon6November 26, 2023Link",

Given that in general in the forum it is taken for granted that people write without reading, I at least think that in cases like this it is mandatory to read the previous comments, except in cases such as threads that ask about your experience (How did you know bitcoin? and threads like that) and the like.I think this is a minimum of quality that we should demand in the forum and not let people in comment 5 of a thread be responding by ignoring what has been proven false two comments above.",

I just re-emphasized it since his concern can’t be solved here while he seems focusing too much on solving his case here. I mention both AG and CG because I knew that he already file his case there. No matter shit show we do here. There’s nothing to do here unless you are part of Bc.game who can look at their records and present it here for public judgement.",

      "body": "So, it seems we have two more cases on the same thread. On Meta board where there is supposedly more quality.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on November 25, 2023, 01:17:08 PMQuote from: SmartGold01 on November 24, 2023, 12:45:44 PMWhy did you want to delete post including your accounts?To me deleting your account by yourself is a bit difficult because you don't have access to do tha, what you should do is to have those post you don't want deleted or alternatively you leave them to serve as a reference purposes to how you started here. What most don't know is how to keep records on how they started forum from little and became larger.Quote from: Dr.Bitcoin_Strange on November 24, 2023, 11:30:04 PMOP, go to settings, reset your account password, but before you type the new password, kindly close your eye and type in different letters from your keyboard. Open your eyes after then and don't cross-check the letters, then submit it and walk away. That's a way of forgetting about your account if you don't actually want to gain access to it.Your case with the answer fits right into the topic of people who don’t read posts and don’t read what other people write, but only respond to the first post that the OP creates. If you had paid attention and read a little more, you would have realized that the OP has decided on the issue that concerns him. The case of SmartGold01 I think is more serious, as he is replying to the thread in meta, without reading what the OP himself has posted in a later comment on the first page, just two comments before. The funny thing is that I reported the thread asking for it to be locked fearing that things like this would happen, and so far it is still unhandled.",

Shouldn't it be reporting the low qualities replies rather than reporting to have the entire thread locked. Obviously the mods will not go hard locking threads every other time as Theymos tends to encourage some freedom of speech as much as possible.Also, why is the Wapfika report now crossed out? Has the context changed?",

Has the context changed?Again, as you don't read it I'll quote it like this to see if after quoting it you feel like reading instead of looking two comments above:Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 19, 2023, 08:41:37 AMWapfika claims that he did read the comment. I don't think so, the way he wrote his post, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I will leave the case on the list but crossed out. Anyway, it goes on and on. The same open thread in Meta and people replying without reading.Quote from: Bureau on November 26, 2023, 02:38:44 PMQuote from: Popkon6 on November 26, 2023, 12:16:47 PMStop using your account and you forget your account username, password, email, then you will seem like account delete. It is not possible to delete account in this bitcoin forum because there is no such option to delete account. Since your account has been credited as a member, but not active, you should forget/anonymize your account password.Then the above member comes accusing before reading the problem and accused the OP for the wrong doing. This is too much to determine how much a justified post can get into the category of spam post if not read. @Don Pedro Dinero please can you look into it.",
