But for the beginner trader who needs to learn about technical analysis and see the full screen so as to get conversant with the details, screen size matter alot. There is also a small group of people for whom whether they be beginners or not their trading is not affected by the monitor screen size",

I only open or close a position using it. Ever tried opening trading view on a mobile phone? It sucks!",

I'm trading with a triple monitor setup since I'm trading with different coins. Also monitor size give you space if you're going to use multiple screen windows has that feature where you can split your screen with different tabs. It doesn't have affect the outcome of your trade but gives you more insights with the move of the market. You can use big monitor if you have a lot of budget but if you're starting on trading only you can start with only what you can afford. before I only use 24 inch monitor the basic one but now im using 32 inch wide monitor and 2 extra 24 inch curve monitor.",

If you are serious about trading and considering it as a full-time job or venture, investing in that kind of setup is essential. As for me, I use my laptop and it works for me, but I'm not a big-time trader.",

We don't actually need to use oversize screens just for trading and think such screens are helpful for our trading and positively increase our trading accuracy and profit.Our profit is from our entries and exits which are determined by our knowledge, experience and patience to keep up our discipline for position open and closing. If we don't have enough factors, only an oversize screen is useless and can not help us to increase our profit.Bigger screens potentially affect our emotion more that will cause more bad decisions and also negatively affect our eye-sights in long term.",

Is this my opinion correct or is there no special effect that trading on big screen has?A big monitor will bring you extra x2 when trading any crypto pair. I am sure that a big monitor is an element of convenience and comfort for traders during their work, as they spend a lot of time analyzing the state of the cryptomarket. Bigger monitor size = more information can fit. You can also trade behind a small monitor (look at the old movies - in those days, they also somehow traded for profit, right) and at first, it makes no sense for traders, when they are just starting their activities, to spend money on big and expensive monitors. In the end, you can always connect several smaller monitors and the effect will be close to large sizes.",

If you have a big monitor, your eyes will be relax and no need to be near in the computer just to see small details in the chart. It's also good to see multiple charts in one monitor. So it would be better if your monitor is big, that is trader's dream. However, no matter the size of the monitor it's doesn't affect your trading because you can both make analysis.

More of some details may be visible on a large monitor. For some people, monitor size doesn't matter. I think that there is not much difference, but for example, some operations are difficult to carry out from the phone. Therefore, the larger the monitor, the better for me. Also, if you carry out any analysis of graphs, then this can be done better using a large monitorIn my experience, the more experienced a person is in trading, the more monitor he has, and sometimes even several monitors - two or three for better analysis.",

Knowledge, experience, and good mentality are the big factors that can bring impacts on the outcome. Professional traders use big monitor, top hardware, and decorate their work space to make them more comfortable in trading. They must spend a lot of time to trade daily, they will make the work space to be as comfort as possible. So, it is very clear that there is nothing to do between the size of monitor with the outcome of trading.",

Same goes to those who have made a career out of trading from their homes. We see cases of traders having to customize their living space by fitting inÂ  aesthetics and furnitures that makes the environment comfortable, gamers do same too. In my opinion, the screen size has little to do with affecting trading, but it such can help one feel more atuned to the environment and easily spot and monitor different trade zones and timelines in one go.",
