  "content": "As we all know that SEC has sued US Binance Exchange and its CEO (CZ). For what they have been sued is already covered (Another Fud or Its Reality? BTC is Down Again). Now as of 6th June 2023, SEC has sued Coinbase too. Why? That's what i will write here.sourceShort story, SEC always came up with the issue concerning assets declaring as (working as) Securities and SEC wants every Security to be in compliance with them. Coinbase exchange was already alleged by SEC in the past and warned too but who knows what got into SEC this week, like they are after every exchange possible. I think its pressure from the top, maybe someone advised that dealing with these centralized exchanges might control the inflation in US (again-->who knows what got into them). Now here is why they are sued for:1.QuoteThe Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typicallyseparated in traditional securities markets—those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. Yet,Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearingagency2.QuoteIn addition, during the same period, Coinbase has operated as an unregistered brokerthrough two other services it has offered to investors: Coinbase Prime (“Prime”), which Coinbasemarkets as a “prime broker for digital assets” that routes orders for crypto assets to the CoinbasePlatform or to third-party platforms; and Coinbase Wallet (“Wallet”), which routes orders throughthird-party crypto asset trading platforms to access liquidity outside the Coinbase Platform. 3.QuoteIn addition, since 2019, Coinbase has offered and sold a crypto asset stakingprogram (the “Staking Program”) that allows investors to earn financial returns through Coinbase’smanagerial efforts with respect to certain blockchain protocols......Coinbase has never hada registration statement filed or in effect with the SEC for its offers and sales of its Staking Program,thereby depriving investors of material information about the program, undermining investors’interests, and violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”).Source to above quotesNow what impact it will make on BTC price?-->(i think not that much as of compared to Binance, yet the Coinbase market dropped 15% though but still BTC and the market facing the impact too but lesser than Binance). Who is next on the list?-->(That depends on who is against the security act). Because from that press release, one thing is sure congress has put pressure on SEC to follow the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (source--> you can find at the first paragraph of the second page of the document). From what i think is, they are trying to make entry opportunities so that they could benefit from BTC halving (just saying, as other factors are also included though).",

We'll see who is going to run out of money from these court proceedings first hehe. Maybe we'll see a settlement within 5 years.",

I believe this is a good opportunity to buy some Bitcoin right now but if a bigger manipulation is already in play then this go even more bloodier in the coming days, I do hope not because it was a big fight for Bitcoin to get to 25k to 27k range in past months.I still don't know why many people rely and trust centralized crypto exchanges more than having their bitcoin in their custodial wallets, a small bad news here and there, everyone is rushing to move their assets out of the exchange, it's a shame.",

As far as I know they tried really hard to be compliant, even tried to get a court to force SEC to give a clear answer on what is and isn't a security, but all they get is a lawsuit against them.Binance also get hit with massive funds outflow from its US business of $1.4bn since the lawsuit.

I know that plenty of people who are defensive about crypto, we love it and that's why we do not want anyone to touch it, I get it. However, we need to realize that there is nothing wrong with SEC looking into Binance, that's their job and they are paid to do exactly that. If Binance is doing nothing wrong, then there will be nothing bad coming out of this, if they are doing something wrong then they will be caught and according to their crime they will be given a penalty, some sort of fee. Just a few years ago USDT had the same thing, paid like 19 million or something. This is their job and we shouldn't be shocked about anything regarding this at all.",

One day Binance was replaced by Sec, now coinbase is. Maybe the crypto exchanges that are in the U.S. are better now, it's better to just move to another country that is friendly to cryptocurrency.",

These platforms will be under the eyes of regulatory control and thus less possibility of escaping as fraud.From now and in the future, the \"staking program\" will not be allowed in most of these platforms, and we may not see stablecoins or exchange coins like BNB, and restrictions may be placed on listing and futures trading.",

This shows that bitcoin has a solid position in the market. From another point of view, I think the SEC is aiming to buy bitcoin on the cheap? What is this succession of news?

However, the intensity of this charge could signal a play for power over a realm that's been given a lot of leeway so far. Maybe it's a reaction to the undeniable rising popularity of digital coins, a tactical move to lower the risks that could be hitching a ride on this trend.When it comes to the effect on Bitcoin's price, I'm not sold. Sure, the immediate aftermath may just be a blip, but we cannot overlook what might unfold in the distance. The mere whisper of regulation can send ripples of uncertainty through the market, possibly throwing investor feelings off balance.If I were to predict, I'd say we might witness a more aggressive tilt towards decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to sidestep these regulatory hurdles. But before we all cheer, remember that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows – it has its own hurdles. For now, it's watch, wait, and wonder in the crypto universe.",
