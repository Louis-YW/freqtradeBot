Check it out.On reddit I don't know but on the forum nobody in their right mind is going to give a $50 loan to a gambler who says he needs it urgently and is going to pay $15 interest for only 3 days, which is something like over 4,000% APR. Borrowing under such conditions and being willing to pay such interest clearly indicates financial ruin.",
