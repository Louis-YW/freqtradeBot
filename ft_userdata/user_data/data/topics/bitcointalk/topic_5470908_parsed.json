That was a clear indication of bitcoin holders' positive response to the forthcoming halving and the most awaited and talked about Bitcoin bull market.",

So even there is just 1 bitcoin left in the market, then whoever owns that 1 bitcoin and puts it up for sale will end up deciding the price of bitcoin.If you own bitcoin then you are not deciding the price, it is in your wallet and you are not selling it, how could that change the market price of it, it would not and it would not cause the price to move at all. So, the holders are not the ones that decide on the price of bitcoin, sure they buy at one time to hold it first, and that is good idea and sure it may have made it go up, but since it's long term, it is just one purchase and not really a big deal.I believe that we are going to see it go up more in the future but that is based on traders who sell and that will make all the difference. I get that it may not all that simple for the time being, but we need to end up being a lot more hyped about it to buy more and make it go up.",

Many are concerned about holding what they have and looking for means to add more to it, which increases the number of buyers in the market, and there are fewer people willing to sell at this point.I don't know if this is just the amount of faith and belief people have in this coming halving or if this also has something to do with ETF having a higher chance of getting approved, which will bring about positive growth in the market. Everyone seems to really be preparing themselves and doesn't want to be taken by surprise. If people can continue holding and no one is willing to sell, we might likely experience a bull run even before the halving time when there is scarcity. There is only one thing that could come afterward, which is an increase in price.",

While its good that there are a lot of people who would like to buy and hold, its also bad that the market is getting lesser and lesser liquid, and that could cause some trouble. Imagine if you owned all the bitcoins in the world, and you charge a million dollars per bitcoin, what happens if nobody wants it? Maybe people give up saying you are the only one and think its too centralized? At the end this is something that looks good, but only good if people keep on demanding and buying, as we can see its not even over 30k right now, so it doesn't seem to have good impact yet.",

I think a considerable portion of these coins that are not moving are either lost or forgotten. Satoshi himself has more than a million coins that are dormant. And then there are those old coins that are permanently inaccessible because of lost keys. There are also coins that aren't moving because they're kept by custodians. But still I believe many are eagerly waiting for the bull run that follows the halving. So they're not selling.",

We've certainly had a supply shortage since then. The reality is having a low supply available on exchanges is meaningless without there being a demand higher than the currently available supply. Once there is increased demand there it will be easy to see a supply shock.Quote from: adaseb on October 20, 2023, 05:17:18 AMAlso the higher bitcoin goes the more people will deposit back into the exchange to sell for fiat. This happened in 2021 where the higher we went the more of the long term coins started to move.This is precisely the dynamics of a bull market - long-term holders selling - as we've seen in each previous bull market. Ironically the fact long-term holders are continuing to increase isn't confirmation of a bull market, in fact the opposite is true, it means Bitcoin isn't in a bull market what so ever. But it does mean - or should mean - that once a bull market starts there will be much less supply available initially.You can see this more clearly from the 1Y-2Y holders who having been selling since 2022 despite 2Y+ holders continuing to hold. They've slowed down but still selling after going from 20% to around 12%.",

And now, also with the help of the recent buying, it is at $581.5 billion according to Coinmarketcap.If you plus, divide, multiply and subtract you would naturally know that 76% is not feasible since a drop from the ATH is way more than 50%. How could over 24% (100-76)% drop the market in liquidity as much as that if truly 76% ardent long-term holders are in for the entire coin in circulation?",

Yeah, they can yield more than Bitcoin in the bull run, nevertheless, it's very hard to put our faith in them as any time then can do a rug pull.So that is a huge numbers in my opinion, and I believed that it's mostly retails investors, just like rest of us. For institutions, I will not be surprised that they are going to stock pile. But for us, we should also do the same and be ready for the upcoming bull run next year.

From my point of view, it somehow does not seem very realistic that 3/4 of all BTC in circulation (which is about 14.6 million BTC) is not for sale, and at the same time the price of those on the market is not much higher than it is currently. Although this may show how small the market really is and how little demand really is.When I just remember those stories about how there won't be enough BTC for everyone who wants it, and from 46 million millionaires a couple of years ago, today we have reached the number of some 60 million people who can be called that. If only 10% of them wanted to buy 1 BTC, all this that is supposedly for sale today would not be enough",
