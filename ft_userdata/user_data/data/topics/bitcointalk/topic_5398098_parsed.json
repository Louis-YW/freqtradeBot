  "content": "How Pablo Escobar Hid His Billions From the FBIIt's not easy hiding billions of dollars in drug money from the FBI, so how do cartels do it? Check out today's insane new video to learn how Pablo Escobar and other drug kingpins have kept their money hidden from the FBI for decades!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V97apjV8zUcGood historical overview and background expositionary information on how drug cartels launder their ill gotten gains. I had not realized gold and precious metals markets were prime targets for money laundering. A decent percentage of their operations also appear to have been inside jobs. Where they had someone in the financial industry help them setup deals to launder capital.The last minute of the clip attempts to validate ideas on how money laundering in crypto might occur. I think cash, precious metals and other assets would be preferable for money laundering due to their lack of digital logging and paper trail. It is also interesting that binance is listed in their charts and graphs while coinbase is omitted.Interesting watch for anyone interested in the darker nature of money.",
