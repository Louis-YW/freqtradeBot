Firstly, it will defeat the purpose of having more threads created in the local board. Secondly, if all this are put together in one place, many vital questions will be missed out as it’ll be in the midst of the many questions that will be asked on this thread. If I have a question about mining; and the ones I can see on the first page and maybe middle and last page doesn’t talk about it, I will miss out on it if it has already been discussed on some pages I missed out while skimming through the thread. If there was sub-board in the LB, there won’t be any case of this but since we don’t have any, creating new thread about a question that hasn’t been asked before will be better.QuoteIt's  a Local board we can all relate  just table it here.Yes we can relate but it will make things disorganised more here.",

It's  a Local board we can all relate  just table it here.Great idea @promise444c5, but this type of thread about question and answer that is related to this forum and the type of wallets and all the necessary helps needed by both newbies and other members has already been created in this Local board by @Charles-Tim here Useful information for Nigerian newbies, you can go through the and see what it entails, although the thread wend down due to recent new thread creation in our Local Board, but the thread already contain useful information and also give an avenue for newbies and other forum members to ask questions for good answers and replies.QuoteNote: I'm  authorised to delete post if required  or necessary The replies you get will determine that, and this your thread serve as a reminder for the other thread to be bumped up so that other newbies can see it; therefore, I will make a reply in the other thread to bump it up for others to see.There is no point of leaving this thread open since there is an existing thread that is almost the same as this one.",
