Why stop?Copy trading is the most riskiest form of trading. I know of a crypto mentor who always make his student feel no matter how good they get in analyzing trends they will always need his signals and confirmation to make any trade and most times those predictions moves in opposite direction.Gaining good knowledge about the crypto trading system is the way out of been mislead through copy trading. Just as boyptc stated copying a trade should be a confirmation and not the sole base of making decisions on trades because in the crypto market no one always get their analysis 100%",

It says:No matter what trading system we use, we must thoroughly examine the strategy. Presently, there are many solutions that offer to analyze your trading systems for you, giving you a detailed report on the pros and cons. This is a huge timesaver compared to having to analyze the trading system all by yourself. It is ultimately up to the individual investor to perform his or her due diligence on the trading system that they want to use.The key thing to remember is to not only focus on the gains over a specified period of time, but also the maximum drawdown and risk exposure of the system. For example, if a trading system that trades during a bear market is making a lot of profits when the markets are falling, it doesn’t mean much. The trading system should also be tested during a market uptrend as well.Other factors to consider include understanding what assets to use the trading system on, and the time frame for holding the trades as well.[1] TRADING SYSTEMS – EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW",
