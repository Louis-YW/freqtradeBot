  "content": "These childboards are so tiny and imperceptibly located that I discovered them today.Why do we have child board named Chinese Students? Rarely has anyone posted in that board and Chinese already have their own local board. I don't even understand what unites the topics in that section under Chinese Students name. There should be some story about that board and why it's archival right now. That's why I am creating this thread, if you are an old member and know story (I hope), please share.Also, why is there another child board called Кopзинa? It's a Russian word that means Basket but on windows it's often used as a synonym of Recycle Bin. So, why is that childboard named Кopзинa? Any story behind this too?",

The general idea being that they had to do business with foreingers for bitcoin (as at the time only Westerners had bitcoin).When I started I did have lots of complicated rules, but that just confused everyone, so kept it really basic MUST MAKE BTC, marks given for genuine effort.The total amount earned by all companies combined was 75btc in a period of about 1 & 1/2 months.The largest being 31 btc by a single group.Next being 16btc10,8....0There were 17 companies, only 8 of them had any bitcoin at all, the rest got nothing.I had expected an internal market to develope where companies would specialise and people would be lent from one group to another for a price but nothing like this happened at all.What did they do?Apart from spamming the forum and pestering people here are some of the things that we're tried.Translating Chinese jokes to EnglishSelling Mp3's and video's about Chinese cultureMaking a Chinese cookbook and attempting to sell recipies.Having a magazine about Chinese medicineMaking two homemade KungFu Movies (which were actually very good but no one bought)Giving advice on how to enter the Chinese market, open a Chinese bank account etc.Selling traditional Chinese Medicine advice.Begging.The most successful of these was translating jokes, so successful that it convered the majority of bitcoin for the first 3 groups (two of which saw how we it was working and jumped in).ProblemsLanguage, obviously many of the students could not write a clear advertisement to save their lives.Understanding bitcoinKnowing how to use a computerHaving a computer or internet access (most students dont have).Product ideas.In roughly the above order.Of all the students involved about 20 really made an effort or took part. And it seems to be those from this group that are continueing to use bitcoin (after counting they asked for their bitcoin back).In most ways I would deem this experiment something of a failure, it was poorly executed on my part, and most of my hopes (of developing an internal market inside the college based on bitcoin) came to nothing, but there were some minor success. Most of the winning companies were in the same class, most of the failing ones were together also, it seems success and failure are contaigous.Questions?the board was then probably moved to archival after the experiment as it didn't serve any more purpose",

A quick forum search could bring you these threads for example:Why Did There Use To Be A \"Chinese Students\" Subforum?grue explained it well.Quote from: grue on January 25, 2015, 04:57:36 AMNefario taught an english class in china. he had some assignment where he got his students to do something on the forum. That's all I can remember.About Кopзинa, xandry said in another thread:Quote from: xandry on February 22, 2023, 01:33:22 PMThis is quite an interesting topic for conversation... This is all the inheritance of the first moderator, under whom the structure of the Russian-speaking subforum was created.Most of the subforums in the Russian-speaking section were created 12 years ago.There was also a whole subsection for the trashcan: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=92.0Great, right? When users lost messages in the entire forum after deleting topics, users in our section did not lose anything.",

There is only one reason for someone to create a board for Students, or Education purpose. Mainly for teaching and learning purpose so for someone to create Chinese students child board means, it is for teaching newbies who are novice in the ecosystem to be aware that bitcoin does exist. And if the purpose of the board is not actualized the archive will be the best place for it.",
