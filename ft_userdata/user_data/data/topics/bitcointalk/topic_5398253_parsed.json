      "body": "1 BTC = 1 BTC is, of course, a true statement from a purely formal perspective. However, when people say this, they somehow ignore the fact that the purchasing power of money is a crucial trait of it. There's no need to calculate this purchasing power in fiat, of course, but it's just done for the sake of convenience. If you have 1 BTC and can buy a flat with this money, it's one thing. If you have 1 BTC and can buy only a bike with this money, it's a different thing. When the price is lower, it indicates that for the same amount of BTC people can afford less than before. And while it might be a temporary thing, the price thus does matter if one treats Bitcoin as money, not merely as an asset one invests in.",

The tulip mania was fueled majorly by hype and fomo with no real utility. It was basically a bubble as we have seen in many instances.When someone says, 1 BTC would remain so, it simply means that it retains the qualities that make it valuable, despite price corrections and dips and we've come through different market cycles, and still rebounded in price.There was nothing really making tulips valuable besides the idea of luxury which it offered and once that dissipated, the bubble burst.",

People tend to forget you only lose when you sell. When you sell the. Sure then you have what’s called a “realized loss”, or “realized gain” , but neither happens until you actually trigger that event. Stop panicking if you don’t need the money right now. Things will get better! The worst time you can sell anything is when you’re down. Would you sell your home just because it’s market value is down significantly? No..same applies here.

BTC- Let the haters feel good, this is all they can do anyway.The main reason for the downfall of the Bitcoins are is that people cannot understand the bearish market, and therefore gets panic and sell their coins.This is the reason for which Bitcoins have fallen more than 20% of it’s original price.The people who are selling the Bitcoins, don’t have the knowledge that BTC will be the future.As the supply is limited, when the demand will increase, automatically the price will increase and all the holders will be come reach af.So it’s my advice to all the fellow Bitcointalk members to buy as much BTC as you can at the current point of time.Soon you will make a huge profit from this master crypto.All the best to all the traders.",

BTC- Let the haters feel good, this is all they can do anyway.I am not on the same page. Bitcoin has not yet reached tonsuch a point where we can stop comparing it with fiat and derive the value of bitcoin in some other way. Fiat is still very much all over the place and bitcoin has just started out. Probably in future we will be able to stick to 1 btc = 1 btc but for now it's simply not possible. One thing I agree is that it's not a time to sell, rather it's time to accumulate more!",

Many institutions are holding bitcoin prices. This time patern is similar to the year of having 2017. After halving 2016 BTC dropped to about 80% of ATH. If this happens this year then btc's worst estimate will cost around $11k. If the trust is agreed, it will appear a new ATH again after halving in 2024.
