  "content": "HelloWas there any chance recently for the process how notifications are triggered?There is a topic, I send my post, from that moment topic is 'subscribed' and new post triggers notification (email). Until recently all was OK, if there was more than 1 page, I had to go to the end to have topic marked as 'read' (unbold) and then new post triggered email.What I see now is that even if new post is on the page 5th, I do not read that post because I open only page 1, when I reload board page topic is marked as read (normal, not bold) and any new post triggers email.I really do not think it was like that before.",

Really? I have no idea why I have impression that now I receive more emails - for topics which statuses I did not update.Anyway, I will observe that, maybe indeed I am wrong.",
