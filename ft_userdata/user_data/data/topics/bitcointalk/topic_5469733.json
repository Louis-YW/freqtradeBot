  "content": "Sometimes ago, I read a thread on the forum, can't really remember where but it talked about fear being a motivational push to know, acquire,  and sell Bitcoin. In as much as it sounded motivational at first,  it also felt twisted and wrong cause we all know fear leads to doubts and stagnancy. So, I decided to look into it.When it comes to Bitcoin, we all know there are risks attached to it. In fact, whatever thing you decide to do, be it good, bad, beneficial, or not, there are risks attached to it and it makes the future of whatever we are doing to be uncertain.  Now the question or the main deal is, do we need to wait for fear of regretting to be our push towards doing certain things?Now, I have and I'm certain that we've all been in situations where we wanted to do something, we've set goals to solve one problem or the other and we failed to continue along the way. Personally, I think that was fear of uncertainty playing with us. Fear doesn't motivate it just leads to procrastination and zero growth where you'd find yourself saying, I'll do it tomorrow until tomorrow never comes ( been a huge victim). Confidently doing whatever you're doing consistently with the right knowledge is appropriate. If you're going to wait for motivation every day, you're not going to get anything done, learn to discipline yourself every day.The purpose of this thread is to first of all encourage my fellow newbies out there who are finding it hard to adapt to the forum or anything at all. Just keep on learning and writing until you can't keep track anymore. Knowledge is very important, don't let fear drive you away from anything, and when it's time to acquire bitcoins you'll be able to face the risks too, without fear. And with the right knowledge.",

I don’t see the relation of FUD on posting in the forum.I don't think, his purpose is to encourage newbies to make relentlessly posts on the forum because he is simply trying to encourage those, who are afraid to make or ask questions here. Who thinks that, if they will ask a question they will be judged or they will be bashed? There would be no hurdle, stopping them. And such words of OP are really encouraging for those. And if the wrong people get motivated by the words of the OP and start to make posts relentlessly and start to spam on the forum.Then it is not on OP instead, It is on that bad actor. And dear Beparanf, I did not mean to go against you or say something that would hurt your feelings, I am just asking, Isn't the OP stating the purpose of the post in the last paragraph?

Fear is good as long as it is not crippling. Fear motivates us to do a lot of things that we would not really do. This is how I see it or understand it another person may understand it from his your own perspective that fear is bad but I beg to differ. The fear of missing out is what has prompted most of us to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency we do not want to have someone tell us I told you so. That fearful thought of missing out pushed us to research and invest in Bitcoin. It is that same fear that is making people accumulate more bitcoins towards the Bitcoin halving event in 2024. They don't want to miss out on the bull run.",

That's the case of a very strong title but weak body. I had expected OP to dwell much on fear and uncertainty, maybe relate it to bitcoin investment but the Op swiftly digressed from the title or will I say that OP didn't meet my expectations. However, there's no new idea and there's no new order. Motivating newbies is expected and has being in existence. Fear, uncertainty and doubt is part of the cryptocurrency industry and there's no how we can successfully deal with them.Your ability to put the above three in control is what defines your maturity and experience in the cryptocurrency industry.",

The ops have swung out the way while trying to define fear and its implication, while also making mentions in the title of the thread, which has allowed us to another aspect of discussion but from the look of it, the ils is trying to talk on how fear can be negative to a newbie here in the forum and what it implications are, the thing is that in whatever context we put it, fear still remain what it is and can never change.We were once a newbie in the past and we all know how it feels to be a newbie and this knowledge have also helped us in both the Bitcoin market and the forum",

For example we see people panic sell because they never educated themselves about Bitcoin and its market, so at the first sight of some lies on the internet about an upcoming dump, they jump at selling themselves. Same with panic buyers, they act irrationally too. Like when they wait until price has recovered from a dip and has already gone up then start panic buying at a higher price and at a loss.Obviously when this characteristic exists amongst market participants, there will be some others who would love to exploit it for their own gain. This is where FUD comes in, that includes lies created to intensify the irrational behavior in the market and cause higher volatility so that the FUDsters can make a better profit from the swings.",
