It is better than to stay away from links that we are not expecting and avoid clicking on them.To be fair, exchanges like Binance have been trying to catch up on the sophistication of this malware attacks, so only the actual owner of the account is able to withdraw Bitcoin off to a personal address. For example, there is 2 factor authentication with physical tokens (which the attacker wont have access to), there is also a feature called \"white list\"(addresses which the user is allowed to withdraw without going through harder verification), even if the person does not have a physical token to access their money, usually Binance requires three 2FA before approving an on-chain withdrawal: SMS to one's phone number, email confirmation and electronic token. It would would be quite a hassle for a hacker to get all of it, though I understand it is possible.The worst case scenario would be getting my satoshis exchanged for shitcoins.",

It is also possible that is spread through the Google Play Store as usual since they are terrible at filtering malware apps. Just recently there are fake Telegram and Signal apps being removed because they contain malware[[2].

Whether the malware will target new open-source wallets or not, you should be able to prevent any hack if you don't click on malicious links. For this specific malware, the distribution method is quite unclear based on the news that I've read. Safe to assume it is distributed through similar means like fake app downloads, phishing links, etc. If you use a phone as your main device, then you should focus more on improving your security practices. At the end of the day, you should make sure your device is free from malware etc regardless if you use a crypto wallet or not.",

Why use mobile phones to interact with cryptocurrencies when doing so is risky? I also think it's reckless.Simply because of convenience. Mobile wallets aren't necessarily bad despite the risks in the first place. Like, why use your physical pocket wallet knowing that you can risk losing it? Exactly, you use your mobile wallet for smaller amounts of funds so it's easily accessible when on-the-go; if you're fortunate enough to be in a country with bitcoin/crypto-supported payments.",
