  "content": "Today I found on medium this nice article by Federico Tenga about long term storing of bitcoin to be gifted to future generations. There are a few interesting points to be considered, some of them I completely overlooked while thinking about this very topic:So, have a read:Gifting satoshis to future generationsQuoteRecently I’ve been tasked to gift some satoshis to a newborn baby, who is supposed to redeem them when he grows up, about 18 years from now. The challenge was trickier than originally expected, as there are many different ways to store bitcoin, each one with different trade-offs, and at the same time it’s hard to predict the state of the Bitcoin industry two decades into the future.Hardware compatibility doesn’t age wellAfter a few thoughts he came with this solution:Read the whole article here:Gifting satoshis to future generationsHe has an (inactive) account here on Bitcointalk, maybe if you have enough comment we can summon him back to the forum!",

It is likely that the same problem will happen with USB sticks, so using a hardware wallet from 2019 may end up requiring multiple adapters to bridge between different communication standards.And it made me wonder whether in 18 years, when the gift recipient has grown up, bitcoin will be as popular or as relevant.  It's a technology that might not age well in that amount of time--and I don't get the feeling that it's going to disappear or anything like that, but you wouldn't expect USB drives to disappear either.  People expect long-term growth from bitcoin, but the truth of the matter is that none of us knows what's going to happen in crypto.Having said that, I think it's a fantastic idea to put aside some satoshis or whatever amount of bitcoin would be appropriate for a newborn.  It's a cool gift if nothing else.",

      "body": "Wow, I really enjoyed reading thr article. It's an interesting question with technologies and methods of storing data. I intend to leave some BTC to my yet unborn children, but I opt to keep up with the trends and transfer money from time to time when something gets outdated. It's sad that with bitcoin we have so many questions compared to fiat bank accounts. People regularly lock money for their newborns in banks that have been around for a long while, right? Surely, it does not have any guarantees, but it's just that bitcoin is not tested with time yet, so its way harder to predict what will happen.",

I wish we had this tech breakthrough when I was young, my whole life could have been so different. It's an exciting time to be alive and this is also my plan. To leave different amounts of Bitcoin in wallets for all the babies and children in my family and also for others as well, and trying to educate more members of my family to hold and even use Bitcoin. My goal is to get Bitcoin knowledge and satoshi to at least 500 people before I leave this planet, then I won't feel my life here as being a waste. Knowledge and self-worth are the two great gifts we can give future generations and also the satoshis of course.",

A paper wallet doesn’t mean the wallet is made of paper. Paper wallet, in a broader sense, means you are storing the private key in “plain text” or some very simple encoding (this is subject of the article).Time locked transactions are irrelevant on the case, as this is a gift, and you want the Satoshi to be in the immediate availability of the recipient (she could spend the Satoshi tomorrow, if she wants).",

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't use a USB stick either but not because of the fear I won't be able to read it.Just as you said, to keep things simple, and I would trust more steel than data on a usb stick.But the fear that he is not going to be able to read it or there will be no equipment left is exaggerated.If we right now can order a VHS player, cd player, cassette player with a click of a button then USB adaptors are safe for at least half a century.Quote from: MarioV on December 29, 2019, 09:00:47 PMExactly.
