However, it will not replace traditional currency, fiat will always be available as an alternative so the government will always find ways to sponsor wars. The government can fund wars with weapons, natural resources, and even investments. Another point is that Bitcoin was created to be decentralized so that Bitcoin users will be anonymous or at least enjoy privacy. So how will you track funds used to sponsor wars, except you are pointing at government regulations",

For example, freedom fighters that have a problem in funding might use bitcoin to purchase their weapons without the worry that the government will intercept it and it can also work the other way too, the authoritarian might use bitcoin as a means to subtly purchase or sell stuff that they probably have a sanction against acquiring.",

Specially the Palestinians that are kept in concentration camps or in Gaza which is known as the biggest prison in the world.So for example even if you have all the money in the world but there is no food to purchase, it won't help.

When that invasion of Ukraine started, a few weeks later, massive donations to Ukraine through Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, mainly in Bitcoin. People said similar things like OP said right now.Ukraine has raised more than $54 million as bitcoin donations pour in to support the war against Russia.

The use of a mixer and other privacy tools will promote the anonymous nature of Bitcoin. That is why the US government wants to criminalize the use of mixing and conjoining services.

Many of the conspiracy theories are fueled by the fact that everything is currently centralized. While we do have a government and need to adhere to the law, most of us aren't fully aware of the extent of surveillance they conduct. Bitcoin with its complete anonymity, has the potential to grant us true freedom by allowing us to control our own wealth and providing greater security from prying eyes.I want to emphasize that the three factors, namely \"human rights, authoritarianism, and war,\" have no direct correlation with Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't inherently linked to these issues; rather, it's a matter of government laws and their proper implementation. Mismanagement of these laws can indeed lead to divisions among the people which could potentially cause war at its worse.",

Honestly, I express that similar to money, it can be seen as having many abilities to serve humans depending on our purposes, but the story of freedom or a block of management I think is not the case. We need to separate and harmonize. Historical lessons from different periods show us that many things are intertwined in life and whether its ability to be maintained for a long time depends largely on people's sense of use.And adding an idea about the future, all conflicts will end when awareness and solidarity increase, there is no longer jealousy and competition between individuals, groups, regions, planets, galaxies, ...  and bitcoin will be as popular as you can easily use it to pay for very small services (for example: buying a battery,... )",

The first matter is very simple: all sorts of people use Bitcoin for all sorts of good and awful purposes. As for the second one, I think Bitcoin aligns well with libertarianism, individualism, democracy, and doesn't align with authoritarianism or socialism. On its own, though, it's just a tool in the hands of people, so it's up to people to decide how to use it. Also, I honestly don't think that Bitcoin will become a dominant currency (as in, beat fiat currencies) because the world doesn't change that radically and that fast, and because Bitcoin itself can't really handle it (not on its own because there's a limit of transactions that can be processed per minute).",
