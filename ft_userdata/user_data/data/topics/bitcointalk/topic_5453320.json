  "content": "The Most Powerful Machine: WhatsMiner M53S++MicroBT’s flagship model, the WhatsMiner M53S++, has set a new standard for Bitcoin mining rigs in terms of computing power. With an outstanding rate of 320 TH/s, this machine surpasses Bitmain’s equivalent offering, the Antminer S19 XP Hydro, which delivers up to 257 TH/s. However, the WhatsMiner M53S++ is slightly less energy-efficient, operating at 22 joules per terahash (J/T), compared to the Antminer’s impressive 20.8 J/T. Despite this minor difference in efficiency, MicroBT’s latest release demonstrates their commitment to pushing the boundaries of mining rig capabilities.Additional Models: M50S++ and M56S++Alongside the powerful WhatsMiner M53S++, MicroBT unveiled two additional models to cater to varying mining needs. The first is the M50S++, designed for air-cooling, which boasts a computing power of 150 TH/s. This model, like its flagship counterpart, operates at an energy efficiency of 22 J/T. The second model, the M56S++, is specifically engineered for immersion cooling and can deliver an impressive 230 TH/s, with the same energy efficiency of 22 J/T. MicroBT’s comprehensive range of rigs ensures there is an option available to suit different mining requirements and preferences.https://medium.com/crypto-beat/bitcoin-mining-rig-maker-microbt-unveils-most-powerful-machine-yet-ae1137c9f736",

      "body": "Stuffing more chips on a single miner and achieving higher hashrate regardless of efficiency isn't something MicroBT should brag about, Bitmain can do the same thing, however, MicroBT does beat bitmain and everyone else by setting the quality bar way too high, they managed to take a good portion of the market despite being slightly more expensive when wat/terahash is taken into account, Whatsminers are tanks, Bitmain lost it even since the S9s, they did improve drastically over the years since their massive failure on the s17 series, but they still can't beat MicroBT in terms of quality.So technically speaking, being the most \"powerful\" or the \"cheapest\" or any other thing without a good balance of the rest of the things, is meaningless.- Quality- Efficiency- Pricein no particular order, to me, Whatsminer has the best quality, pretty good efficiency, and an ok price, all Bitmain need to do to beat them would be to build a better quality, of course without affecting price and efficiency, which isn't realistic, so it seems like each of these companies are now forcing on one aspect and trying to sell that.MicroBT > QualityBitmain > EfficiencyAvalon  > PriceAt least this is what I noticed for the latest couple of generations these companies produced.",

For example, Tesla has not yet reached the efficiency of Toyota. Bitman has been working for about 10 years and they have learned from their previous experiences, so it is logical that their efficiency is the best. I have not used any WhatsMiner device before, but I am sure that they will gain good efficiency in the coming years. Price is not a major driver in this industry, as it is part of many variables, not like efficiency and quality.",

      "body": "Why mix company name with brand? Either you call all by company name: Bitmain, MicroBT, Canaan, or all by brand: Antminer, Whatsminer, Avalon. Whats with this confusion remaining after all these years... Every car has a branding and are also made by some company, and so do the miners.Bitmain has the most efficient chips, and MicroBT the best quality at nearly the same efficiency, Canaan seems to be getting left behind.You don't have an \"m10 from whatsminer\", its from MicroBT. They even put an M in the model for you to remember...When Bitmain went back to the previous cooling method (screwing large heatsinks to the hashboard), like they did with almost all S19s, reliability was pretty good. Of course they HAD to retry with the S19j pro+ the same thing they did with the S17....Meanwhile MicroBT keeps doing the same thing, even in the M56: Large heatsinks screwed to the hashboards.Canaan did had good cooling designs, but it seems they couldn't cope with the chip itself.Now with immersion, Bitmain way may be better to squeeze the last bit of efficiency. Time will tell...",
