That means after accepting the project and also only for the service providing. Not for communication. If there is any communication out of freelancer.com and they can understand/know about that then they will suspend the account without thinking twice.",

They clearly violate the terms and conditions of the freelancing platform, and it looks like the job offer has already been taken down. I think it's important to be vigilant and bring to light any instances of fraud or unethical behavior. By doing so, we can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",

But it is a matter of sorrow the user has not yet been banned and also might not be banned as the maximum user reports against the project only. The user has two open projects. I will update that here if I can find out the project link.",

Let freelancer to deal with it. And asking such information in a form/weblink does not mean the project is a scam or trying to steal your information. I have been in lead generation for long time in one of my business, I can tell you that any legit company is not going to take the path1. It's time consuming simply not worth the try.2. Low quality leads eventually will not convert to sell anything for them.The only thing they did wrong is to violate the terms of Freelance which is again their (Freelancers) problem. They are not going to care about any of us or will share a portion from the 20% or 25% fees they cut from the freelancers who work their ass off and built the platform to make them millionaires. I would have a little amount of sympathy for them if they would at least care to add crypto in their site.",
