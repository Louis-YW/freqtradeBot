I thought that was very interesting and since he is a tech savvy coder his use of relevant jargon and explanation was so good, I just wish I remembered exactly how he put it. I did a quick search though and found this relevant article: https://cryptoslate.com/old-wallets-activate-sparking-fears-of-mass-hack-targeting-bitcoin-veterans/Could it be that folks have figured out how to crack the codes on these old private keys? IF so, they are seeing some massive pay days, EH?",

IF so, they are seeing some massive pay days, EH? It is impossible to break private key and steal it.It is possible for someone to get access to a very old disk then successfully access an unencrypted wallet file or break a wallet file with encryption. It is a more realistic case if you are discussing about wallet hack.However, above all, there are many possible scenarios why coins from old eras are moved in this year. They can move their coins from old wallets to new wallets. From a single signature wallet to a multi signature wallet, cold wallet, and something else.Such transactions does not always mean old wallets were hacked.",

With the technology available today, there's no way someone can hack your private key or seed phrase, except you expose it to them. Funds can remain inactive in wallets for very long, and it does not mean that the funds are lost, and whenever the funds are moved it does not mean it has been hacked, the owner of the funds can be the one who has decided to move it.",

If the OG bitcoiner could keep his coins safe for so many years,why did you think that he can't still keep it safe now. It is either the owner has decided to sell off his investment or is moving his coins to a more secured wallet. If it is possible for private keys to be hacked,then our coins are no longer safe which might have a bad effect on bitcoin. I guess your friend is spreading the FUD because he understands coding and he is using this to panic bitcoin investors. Let us be positive for once,when an OG chose to move his abandoned coin to another wallet. Sometimes, it might be that the owner has forgot his password or where he kept his phrase seed and after a long time he saw it,and decided to use or move his coins. We have heard so many old wallet being active after a long period of time,this should let you know that it is normal.",

For now this are just assumptions and has not been proven untill few people affected can come out to confirm the news of their wallets been hacked. Maybe the OGs are just moving their Bitcoin to a hardware wallets or other more secure wallets.It could be they're selling some amount of the Bitcoin they bought in the past. Private keys are impossible to be hacked into, there hasn't been a news to confirm that any hacker has successfully hacked a private key.

Are the oceans boiling from the heat this energy is turning in to? Because that's legitimately what would happen if we used enough energy to successfully start brute forcing seed phrases. And lets not even mention the fact that seed phrases didn't even exist when most of these old addresses were funded for the first time.An absolute trash article, but sadly what comes to pass for \"news\" in the crypto world.

If there are recent old hacked wallets I believe the owners would definitely come up publicly to say something about it so as to make something out of it. If not necessarily engaging tech guru to help them recover their assets,  maybe a proper investigation to unravelling the identities behind the hack. Some would even turn it into a process to gain attention and recognition as early adopters of bitcoin you know how it feels then telling someone you were amongst the early adopters of bitcoin that is a catchy one you know.Back to the reality,  hacking a wallet is not as easy as you think one must have clues of your keys if not in full some hint can gain them access but in this situation none of it is the case so how do you think it is possible. Let me run down to CEX hack as an illustration, do you think CEX exchange hack is just let alone a hacker, I believe there are always information leak before such could happen likewise private wallets too.Let me remind you as well, do not forget that some of those accounts holders are tech gurus as well and they too are good at their games so tell me how do you explain that when you are sophisticated to protect your own. Some of the hacks claimed to have occurred on old 1st generational bitcoin wallets are not what we think some are just a change of wallet. Maybe the owners just felt like changing asset location to another current trending one to be on the safe side.Of lately there have not been any complaint on private wallet hack rather it is coming from CEX so this justifies it that most old private wallets holding bitcoin safe or possibly change of assets location are not hack.",
