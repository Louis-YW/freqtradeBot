Some of them, unfortunately, will be scammed by ignoring those reminders that are all a platform can give to their users.With careless people, their hands usually are quickly responding than their brain so eventually they will end with mistakes.The screenshot shows the trade partner's terms are very suspicious. Peer to Peer platforms have their rules for offer and trade terms too. If you are a Binance P2P user, you can report tricky terms to their moderators who will handle those terms and perhaps will send warnings to those traders too.Anti-Scam Ninja Program: Report Suspicious P2P Activities.",

You can just ignore the number aspect because most of them just include it because others have included it in their terms and conditions. That is why almost all the traders are including phone number requests before making payment, whereas some of them don't even read the messages in the chat after their default message; they only go ahead and make payment and ask you to release your coin, not checking or confirming if you have dropped your phone number.Â This has happened to me because I don't like being given my phone number, but if I notice that the vendor is active and insists I send my number, I do give another number that is not my main line, or sometimes I give them a fake phone number just to get my trade completed.",

There are many other disturbing terms from the buyer's side on Binance P2P, I would highly recommend never trade accepting these terms better to find a local dealer for cash payments, 0 terms, and most safest option.Even if you are as well tricking him by giving a wrong/fake number still you are giving him a number, sometimes these terms suck. I have seen many of my local fellows using the Binance P2P at a time I was also using it regularly for both buying and selling purposes but when i di realized the outcomes, I made an instant exit from it.Better to be honest with your identity, and keep it safe rest of the things don't matter, identity abuse is very common here so be very careful with such deals.",

Binance always sends messages to their users via the email address they have registered with the exchange or via the exchange app's notification Centre. You may also receive messages to release coinÂ or for OTP during exchange transactions. Aside from that, Binance does not simply send messages to your phone number when they wish to make any changes to their exchange. Always remember that a message delivered to your phone number indicates a scammer alert, and you should never take such a message seriously or act on it. Binance would never send you a message through your phone number seeking anything. As a result, all usersÂ must be cautious of such scam alerts.",

I usually encountered some of these in our local p2p (via Binance p2p) since we are conducting transaction called Gcash which uses phone number. They are asking the number to confirm that one we saved or recorded on the profile is same number you are using to make sure the user is 100% confirmation and sometimes the initial name you save on that Gcash app to be sure it is you.If the third party merchant platform you uses doesnt need the number or name then dont give that is probably a possible modus but something like I explained on the first paragraph might be the case.",

I request number to speak with who am buying/selling to for reasons like to confirm if they serious, to inform them about the transaction and most importantly to have access to who am transacting with.Besides Binance has never texted me via my number except my log in code. So why would I trust a message from them without any proper enquiry or confirmationIf you can't trust Binance (the party who is supposed to be escrow), why would someone trust you and what are you doing there in the first place? The whole point of escrow is to keep all the communication there on the platform and fairly solve the issue in case of a dispute.1- I think the fact you able to start a buying transaction is a decent indication of whether someone is serious or not, because they will need to have actual funds in the first place to start the transaction. And if somebody that has bad intentions can go that far, they can give you an anonymous number too (which I think is the easier step here by far). In that case an escrow will need to step in any way, but generally the fact that you are able to start a transaction is enough to confirm if they are serious. And you going out of your way to start asking for numbers actually harms the process.2- I think you can inform them about the transaction via binance communication just fine?? 3- Your third point is interesting as well, you do have access to them via binance communication. But I guess you are talking about someone who is trying to scam and you want to have their number. Again it does nothing to the process, leave it to the escrow and they will handle it. You going out of your way to talk to them outside of binance communication only makes matters difficult and in case of a genuine misunderstanding, could be considered harassment (not saying you are doing that here).",

I also read the topic of _act_ and replied in it, and I did not come to think of this reason, like why those people are getting such phishing messages. I thought, as many other also thought, it might be inside job, but no, this is really happening outside of the Binance and they have nothing to do with such scams. All is happening, due to the mistakes of the users themselves.
