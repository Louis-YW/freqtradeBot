Morocco, Germany and Palestine should be able to win all of these matches but indeed, as I said, there is no definite outcome for matches like this. It would be nice if you don't have too much hope on the seeded team that will win the match and if there are other options such as handicap betting, the over/under goal results are more likely for you to make money. An additional note, don't use too much betting money in a friendly match like this.",

Argentina is a World Cup champion. I wouldn't think they would draw against Indonesia.",

The clubs will play in a most friendly manner with love and care. In many friendly games, players are not always serious. In some cases, key players will not be featured because of some cheap reasons. Most friendly games are also used for formation and tactical experiments so mistakes always occur. Betting in friendly games is risky and hard to predict because anything can happen. I remember when the national team of my country won against Argentina in a friendly game and we were celebrating the historical win. A few months later, the same team gave our national team to beat our life. After that, it became clear to everyone that the Argentine team was unserious in the friendly game. I don't think I will place a serious bet on a friendly game. Betting on friendly games should be strictly for entertainment.",

In my opinion, the best option to do on friendly matches is to avoid 1x2 market. When I have to bet on friendly matches, I would prefer to bet on O/U goals as usually friendly matches ended with more goals than normal matches. Other option is to bet on both team to score, but for sure we need to do more researches about the squad of the teams. Or maybe if available, do live bet after watching 10-15 minutes so you can decide which one is the best to bet.",

In friendly matches, the coach has the opportunity to look at the players, what form they are in, how they interact with the team, he can make an unlimited number of substitutions. Such matches for betting are a very bad idea, because it is too difficult to predict their outcome. I don’t know how often they resort to bribery even in official matches, but there is definitely no such thing in friendly matches, because it’s simply pointless. )",

You are correct that 30% to 40% of international friendly matches are under 2.5 goals, but most of the matches are not ending in draw. I have preferred to bet on clubs, not countries. Even I do prefer to bet on club leagues and cup, I do not bet on country leagues like UEFA national league and others like world cup. But as I check what you are saying that it is most of the time under 2.5, that is correct, but over 95% of the recent played friendly international matches were won.",

There is also nothing to play for, so they are not playing to the best of their abilities... because they do not want to risk getting injured and not being able to play when it actually counts.",

      "body": "To increase the chances of choosing the right bet, it is important to analyze the context of the match, something that may go unnoticed, specially for friendly matchesI'll give you a very simple example that happened to me yesterday: the bookmakers were predicting that France could score many goals against Gibraltar's team, and my choice was less than 5 goals. The result was 3 x 0. Being that France would be a top 3 team in the world today and the opponent would have players that play even in amateur teamsBut the context of the game made me believe that France wouldn't play to their maximum, even with their starters players, they have no reason to play trying to win by 6 or 7 goals for example, and besides that the European season is over now, the players are tiredPutting the context in the friendly match, you have to analyze if the team will play to win, if they will play to test some new formation, or if they will test several different or newer players, if they will play with a full stadium or not...But most of the time the teams use these matches to test.If you see a match of a stronger team vs a weak one, the stronger will probably do a lot os tests, while the weak have a lot of motivation to win, since they don't play important championshipsLook at the case of Brazil vs Guinea, Brazil have one of the top teams, while Guinea will probably play the one of most important matches for them. (but in this case I believe in more than 3 goals for Brazil)",
