      "body": "What is stored on your hardware wallet is the private key or the seed phrase, which is needed to sign a transaction. Just like you have stated a transaction must be signed by the private key and that is what the hardware wallet keeps, the remaining process are done by a software wallet. The reason for a hardware wallet is just to prevent your private key or seed phrase from coming online like the software wallets. The hardware device is prevented from an internet connection which is the first point of exposing your private key or seed phraseThe hardware wallet is referred to as an offline wallet for This purpose, also you can use the software wallets too as an offline wallet by using it offline and never allowing the device to come online. You can then have a watch only wallet on another device for broadcasting the transaction. So basically what the offline wallet does is to use this stored private key to sign the transaction. Yes the private key is needed to be written down and stored (advisable offline), because you don’t know what is going to happen to that hardware wallet, it can mistakenly get damaged, get lost or gets stolen. With a seed phrase or Private key elsewhere you can simply just recover everything back on another wallet that supports the hardware wallet’s seed phrase formats.",

But on hardware wallet, seed phrase are written down for backup, not the private key. I know you know this, but it is worth mentioning. The seed phrase can always generate and regenerate the private keys.I think OP do not need to ask this kind of question because it is not hard to know the reason for the seed phrase backup. On most wallets, the reasons are even stated, that seed phrase are used for wallet recovery.",

What use does a hardware wallet serve if you have to write down what is effectively your private key anyhow?When you press the \"create new wallet\" button on your HW, the device has collected 128 - 256 bits of entropy from various sources. Imagine a sequence of 0s and 1s.Then the entropy is hashed and the first 4 - 8 digits (checksum) are appended to the initial checksum.Then the sequence you have is split into 12 - 24 smaller sequences of bits, of 11 digits each.Each of these subsequences is converted to a decimal number.Each of these decimal numbers corresponds to an english word in the BIP-39 dictionary (which is the recovery phrase you refer to above).Finally, the seed words, plus some salt (the word \"mnemonic\" + an optional passphrase) is stretched through the PBKDF2 function and a 512-bit seed is produced. This seed produces the wallet (EDIT: and is stored in the device).Note: as you can see, if 2 people have the same set of words, they can produce the same wallet, unless they have set an optional passphrase on the last step.Now, to answer the question:BIP-39 is a standard that is used to facilitate people when they want to recover their wallet. How? It is (as I explained above) a representation of the initial entropy. If you wanted to produce the same wallet without a backup of the entropy, it would mean that you have produce the same entropy randomly. It will never happen - it is infeasible.So the wallet offers you 12 - 24 words to help you recover the wallet in any other device you want, provided that it uses BIP-39.The HW can have a state, meaning it can remember the private key, but if it gets destroyed, for example, how would you recover the wallet? I know you think that you could hold a backup of the private key instead of the words, but trust me, keeping track of 64 Hexadecimal characters is much more difficult than keeping track of 12 english words.",

You can then have a watch only wallet on another device for broadcasting the transaction. So basically what the offline wallet does is to use this stored private key to sign the transaction. Some hardware wallets offer additional features like secure element (ATECC608B,) cryptographic method, dealing with SD/RAM protection from physical attacks. All of these features are considered additional protection in the event of losing your device, which instead of trying to brute force all data will be deleted after entering the wrong PIN 3 times.اIt provides an easy device for anyone who does not have technical knowledge to set up a hardware wallet that is relatively safe in all cases, even physical theft, and a simple recovery mechanism represented by seeds without having a technical background. Even if the wallet is stolen, you must quickly access your coins and send them to another address.Quote from: apogio on October 30, 2023, 07:33:06 AMsnipthis is not how HW wallet work, you described how a public key/address can be generated from a seed.",

What use does a hardware wallet serve if you have to write down what is effectively your private key anyhow?The seed phrase is as important as your private key. Perhaps you might not know but this seed phrase is more of a mnemonical pattern of displaying your private key instead of what could be considered as a lengthy sequence of random numbers and characters. Most seed phrase can be easy to be memorized since it consists of words which the brain can easily retain. You need both of them for securing your crypto assets and they are both valuable.OP your funds will be prone to attacks if you don't make use of a hardware wallet. There are lot of Malware that can detect activities that are related to cryptocurrency on any devices, without any hardware on your device this malware may be successful in draining away your funds. This is the reason why a hardware wallet is needed because they are not connected to the Internet in any way.",

On a piece of paper you write a backup so you can use it in case something goes wrong. But in order to actually use the wallet, you can use the device which is stateful, as in \"it holds the key offline in its storage\".The approach I follow is totally different, but my use-case is not the common one, at least that's what I assume. I import my seed phrase to my HW, I do what I want to do and then I factory reset the device. So, my device holds my keys only for the time I want it to hold them.",
