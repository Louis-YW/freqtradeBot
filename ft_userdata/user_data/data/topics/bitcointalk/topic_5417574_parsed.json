  "content": "It's a good day for bitcoin today. Each bitcoin win should be celebrated because it was a victory against naysayers, haters, and those who wants bitcoin to die. Today, Guinness World Records have added Bitcoin and other blockchain events in its latest record book under a brand-new category called ‚ÄúCryptomania\". Bitcoin was included in the 2023 edition as the most valuable crypto with a market capitalization of $816.69 billion as well as being recognised for being the world‚Äôs first decentralised cryptocurrency after it launched in early 2009. CoinMarketCap reports that, Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap stood at $372,316,153,554. In addition, El Salvador also features in the book as the ‚Äúfirst country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender‚Äù last year.¬† Nothing can stop bitcoin nowSource",

In the future we can see Guinness World Records being added to the blockchain, so that no data manipulation takes place.The best part is El Salvador getting into the Guinness World Records book as the first nation to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.",

This is truly a game changer.The problem is, of course, those companies don't want Bitcoin to be adopted in those countries. So they'll do anything they can to stop it.They can't stop Bitcoin itself, so they try to convince people that Bitcoin is bad.It's great to see El Salvador to make this huge step forward.Others already started following, like the Central African Republic.",

It deserves even more accolades.Well, that's just the beginning of the trail- line.Sandra üíá",

Getting into Guinness adds more credibility and recognition to the original cryptocurrency which many people think should have no place in our society...but contrary to their wish Bitcoin is getting more and more accolades as time goes on. I am sure that 2023 will be another banner year for Bitcoin in terms of getting more into the mainstream, recognition and acceptance especially from those who thought that this is just another joke...and hopefully next year it will also be rising in value reaching a new ATH if possible.",

Anyway it is still good to have a rough number for Bitcoin marketcap as it somewhat shows how big or small Bitcoin is in cryptocurrency market as well as in a comparison with other markets.I don't mind about records, Guinness World Record for Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but in reality it is not harmful but helpful to spread Bitcoin news to more people.

In any case, the market cap is an indicative figure because, for example, at today's price, all the bitcoins could be sold for around 20,000 USD, but if a whale puts a large quantity of bitcoins on sale, the price would fall, so the market cap would be lower.

Since El Salvador was the first country that adopted Bitcoin, it has attracted other countries to make Bitcoin legal in their land so that it will help them to eliminate delay in transaction, eliminate unemployment, eliminate errors from their economy so that they will be part of the good news Bitcoin is doing to countries that made it legalized.",

It lists both good and bad, everything in a neutral way, including even the longest fart. It doesn't vouch for Bitcoin or any other. It doesn't say Bitcoin is good. It doesn't say Bitcoin has huge potential or has a bright future. Bitcoin is there, of course, not because of anything else but simply because it is the first and then it has the largest market cap.

In my country, a few years ago, a lot of people didn't know about bitcoin or they would ignore it when they heard about it because ponzi projects are created and used bitcoin as an investment vehicle. But now things are different, when the government media start talking about bitcoin as an advanced technology, people are showing great interest in bitcoin, even farmers and street vendors started hearing and asking about bitcoin. My prediction is just one more bull season, bitcoin will gain worldwide popularity, bitcoin haters' efforts to stop bitcoin will have to stop soon.",
