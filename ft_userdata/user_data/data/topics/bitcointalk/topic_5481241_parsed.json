      "body": "I don't know why they'd vote against, knowing that it would mean a number of lawsuits that they'd most likely lose and have to cough up some money and apologies? They lost a case, did not appeal which means they knew it was a lost cause. It's rare for the government to give up unless they know they don't have anything to support the claim. I read a few articles by lawyers who said that the SEC has now only 2 options. They can either approve a spot ETF, or they can admit to being wrong in the first place and cancel approval for futures ETF. In both cases it would mean the companies would take them to court and win again because futures ETF was trading with no issues since 2018 so there's no way for the SEC to claim that the market is too dangerous to investors. Quote from: freedomno1 on January 11, 2024, 06:01:52 PMOn the secondary topic the market sure tanked I don't care about ups and downs as long as they remain proportional. If we go +10% up on a given day and then 10% down on the next, it literally means nothing to me. On the average we were at 45.8k yesterday and over $46k now. That's a pump if you're looking at it on the daily like I do. Pump or no pump, bitcoin is going up in the long run.",

It would be stupid of the SEC to deny 1 applicant and approve the rest a few days later if all of them wanted the same thing, which is why I'm a bit surprised that 2 people voted to deny. Maybe they wanted this to look like a split decision for the media? I'm sure there's more to it than we know from the media. For instance, the SEC allows companies to snitch on each other and pays them some of the profits from fines if the information leads to such fine. Therefore the SEC allows these companies to manipulate the market. Company A gets some information about shady tactics at company B for instance from a former employee. That employee gets paid for snitching, company A reports to the SEC. The SEC checks the information and contacts company A about planned enforcement. Company A shorts B stock with leverage. The SEC goes public with the investigation, the stock falls. If B is found not guilty, A gets to keep profit from shorts. If B is found guilty, its the money from shorts plus the SEC pays A for the tip. A win - win situation for the snitch.",

If he voted no, he knows that everybody would be against him and make his job hell so he voted yes.He just put that disclaimer that he is against bitcoin and crypto personally and that to invest at your risks. Either way I don’t think he will remain in office for long. After all this etf fiasco that happened for the past week, makes the sec look like a big joke.",

LMFAO JK. That is seriously no suprising though, the SEC has deep pockets and they get to regulate everything so i'm sure if you have friends at the very top you can practically get away with murder. Its also pretty wild that such a decision like this was basically up to a very few amount of people that pretty much hate BTC with a passion.",

They'd get more paperwork to review when it was clear that they'd eventually have to approve them or get sued. The way I see it, Gensler knew that and wanted it all over sooner than later. They were denying ETFs before because that was the official stance of the party and Biden administration, especially after the FTX drama, but Gensler was put between a rock and a hard place. On one hand he was destroyed in court and later in Congress, did not apply the case against Grayscale, so he took a big L, knew he'd lose against BlackRock if he denied the ETF, so he wanted to do by his masters, but also did not want the SEC to be humiliated in court once again, which is why he voted the way he voted.

It really pays to cooperate with the SEC if you have Intel Into a huge operation that can lead to bad actor and shady business tactics .
