  "content": "I’ve been wondering how many of these coins were actually minted. I know in theory they planned to mint 500 but my impression is that less than 100 were made. If you are willing to share could you please list the number you own so I/we can get a rough estimate of actual mintage. I own number 4. I’m curious the highest number somebody posts.  I’d be curious about the Chikun coin too, I own number one but that doesn’t really help with my questions, so if you feel like sharing, I’d love to hear from you.",
