This of course is assuming you don't spend a penny, and you survive on god knows what!There are a few countries missing as their minimum wage is either not set or it's irrelevant since it's so old everybody already earns 10 times more. Also, as a note, when you go over the 10 000 number, that's 27 years! LE:Second note, since the data comes from monthly wages in some countries those days include the resting days, so let's say it's the number of days you;re going to spend employed over the minimum wage!123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156LuxembourgAustraliaNew ZealandGermanyUnited KingdomIrelandNetherlandsFranceCanadaMonacoBelgiumSan MarinoSouth KoreaIsraelAustriaSloveniaSpainJapanUnited States of AmericaAndorraTaiwanMaltaLithuaniaThe BahamasPolandGreeceOmanHong KongMacauPortugalSaudi ArabiaArgentinaBarbadosSlovakiaCzech RepublicRomaniaEstoniaLatviaCroatiaPalestineSaint Kitts and NevisMontenegroHungaryAntigua and BarbudaPalauCosta RicaTurkeyBulgariaBelizeEcuadorJordanLebanonUruguayChileTrinidad and TobagoMarshall IslandsBoliviaParaguayMoroccoBosnia and HerzegovinaGuatemalaColombiaPanamaAlbaniaSouth AfricaEl SalvadorSerbiaTurkmenistanSeychellesGabonVanuatuFijiThailandMexicoDominicaBrazilPeruUkrainePhilippinesEquatorial GuineaMalaysiaRussiaPeople's Republic of ChinaDominican RepublicMauritiusIndonesiaAzerbaijanHondurasRepublic of MacedoniaKosovoSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesJamaicaKuwaitCambodiaPapua New GuineaIraqGuyanaTunisiaRepublic of the CongoBotswanaMoldovaArmeniaAlgeriaMongoliaLaosVietnamComorosNepalNicaraguaEast TimorChadPakistanIranLibyaUzbekistanHaitiMauritaniaLesothoSolomon IslandsNigeriaBeninAfghanistanCentral African RepublicKazakhstanIvory CoastCameroonTogoBurkina FasoKenyaEswatiniMyanmarSenegalIndiaAngolaNigerMaliBhutanSri LankaZambiaSierra LeoneMozambiqueGhanaUgandaGuinea-BissauMadagascarMalawiTajikistanThe GambiaDemocratic Republic of the CongoBangladeshTanzaniaKyrgyzstanSyriaCubaSudanVenezuela3413453503714054354394514544554565145225566306416616777267359159749961,0031,0091,0181,0671,0911,0981,1021,1411,2231,2391,2571,2611,2651,3871,5431,5481,5681,5791,7141,7181,7331,7551,7821,8231,8401,8721,9822,0252,0382,0522,0552,3732,6322,6902,7002,7402,7732,7912,8232,8672,9522,9833,0003,0333,1933,3363,3733,3803,3883,4013,5283,5543,7463,8073,8313,8623,9224,1094,1384,1454,1914,3144,4714,4974,5254,5294,5384,5494,5594,5634,7045,2495,2925,4345,4755,6215,6655,8156,1286,1626,1906,3226,8826,9007,1857,2717,9358,4368,4958,7749,36710,51910,79911,15111,45411,73612,15312,65912,76213,33713,73913,82613,94914,46514,60015,59815,77815,84715,96216,24616,51616,84617,77617,98018,15918,37219,04319,90925,28925,70426,57829,12241,16541,32143,28149,77351,65152,39267,593114,063248,864842,3081,095,000Seeing those numbers, do you feel like flipping burgers for a minimum wage?Cause here is some trivia, at the average 300 burgers you might prepare at a Mcdonald's in a shift, in countries like Lesotho you will have to serve each citizen in the country one hamburger more than once till you get your BTC.

Instead of the actual exchange rate might be much higher, like 1 bitcoin being worth 4 million dinar with bank price, but you might need to pay more than 6.6 million dinar to buy it due to this factor ( you can’t exchange dinnar to any other currency in bank). As a result the equivalent number of days you need to work in Algeria to afford 1 bitcoin is at least 9,000 days.And also an important note  to know is that the majority of Algerians earn salaries are very close to the minimum wage which is 20k dinnar.",

So it's (1635564/610)*7/5 so 3,753, pretty close to the table at 3,862.Yeah, I should have added it includes resting days but the title won't let me so I'll add in the OP!Quote from: GxSTxV on July 20, 2023, 12:13:03 AMRegarding your mentioned countries, I must point out that your statistics may not be all right as for instance, you mentioned that 1 bitcoin which currently trading at $30k and in Algeria we don't use the bank's foreign currency exchange rates.I intentionally left out a few countries from the minimum wage table where there were * about the rates and the numbers really didn't seem right, but in most cases when I saw them around countries in the same region and roughly the same GDP per capita I let them slide.I have serious doubts about Argentina now that I'm double-checking the ranking!Quote from: GxSTxV on July 20, 2023, 12:13:03 AMFunny yet so sad and choking to realize how unfair wealth distribution is all over the world.

That would be more than 7 years.I don't get how we are different in the estimate, there's 299 typical working days in a year in the Philippines so I multiplied that to 610 and then I divided the product to the current price of bitcoin as of speaking right now which is 1,635,803.82 and it gave a result of 8.97 which is around 3276.3 according to Google. Maybe the reason why your estimate is much lower than what OP has for Philippines. Or I did something wrong in my calculations, happy to be corrected.Luxembourg is in the top spot iirc is because they are tax free or something or that most of their workforce are working in neighboring countries right?",

Apart from carrying out routine activities as an employee who is still paid the minimum wage, it is necessary to find other activities to support income. Getting 1 BTC is the dream of all Bitcoiners, they will do everything they can to achieve their dreams in their own way. The rules seem to restrain and squeeze the people to change their lives.

But there will definitely be some wrong data present in your post because most of the data is not accurate. For example, i am a Pakistani and i know that what's the minimum wage of a Pakistani Labor. Which is only $5. Yeah $5 dollar a day and if you started to save $5 dollars a day and wanted to buy BTC at the price of current BTC's Price which is around $29,990. Then with the following formula you have to wait 5998 days not 8,495Number of Days = $29,990 / $5Number of Days = 5998 daysAnd if you are able to save 29,990$ in 5998 days which is equivalent to 16.42 Years. Which means we are going to buy BTC after four halving. And i am sure even if we started to save $5 a day we will not be able to buy BTC at the rate of $29,990. Because after 16 long years. Who know what will be the price of 1 BTC. That's sad but bitter truth. But many has worked their ace off to make more money then just $5 dollars so that they could fulfil their dreams too. Because in a person who earns $5 a day, he is empty at the end of the day too. Because this money is not enough. And believe me i was in that phase when i was earning $5 dollars.",

Number of work days to achieve 1 Bitcoin.I am also curious about the table from OP: Does it mean the higher on the list, means the higher minimum wage per country? For example, if, Luxembourg is the top 1 on the table, do this mean, Luxembourg is the highest minimum wage in all the countries?",

I can't imagine that even working like a robot (no eating and no sick leaves) it takes lots of years to achieve a whole bitcoin, and almost you are in your life with a very stagnant and continuous cycle. This is really hard if we are just minimum-wage earners. This is also a sign to take another job or side hustle so that if ever you are really planning to buy bitcoin, it is better to have another source of income if you don't want to work years just to save money to buy bitcoin.",

So you might get the Bitcoin quicker.If I would have done I would end with the same garbage PPP.No, the rules are simple, you flip hamburgers, you stay in the local church basement, you dress from the salvation army and you eat leftover hams!Quote from: Faisal2202 on July 20, 2023, 04:22:23 AMYeah $5 dollar a day and if you started to save $5 dollars a day and wanted to buy BTC at the price of current BTC's Price which is around $29,990. Then with the following formula you have to wait 5998 days not 8,495, he is empty at the end of the day too. Same thing as with the other issue, some numbers were from monthly minimum wage to some daily wage, so for some countries, you will need to do a *7/5 thing to get the actual time it will take since those numbers in the table are including resting days when you don't work!Quote from: GreatArkansas on July 20, 2023, 06:10:50 AMI am also curious about the table from OP: Does it mean the higher on the list, means the higher minimum wage per country? For example, if, Luxembourg is the top 1 on the table, do this mean, Luxembourg is the highest minimum wage in all the countries?Yup, around 2300 euros per month.",

But still, why this country is being scattered like this. So, actually that documentary wasn't actually a documentary but instead a series of jack Ryan which i just started to watch and in his 2 seasons. They helped some bonalde women to become President.The main purpose of mentioned this is, i think like other resource full countries, Venezuela is also facing the same level of corruption that has led it's inflation rate so high. Like to gain 1 BTC or to collect around $30k dollars we have to wait 1,095,000 days. I am still shocked. I hope the conditions of this country will be restored to normal inflation rates like others. But still, the country has been pressed by many entities for the gain of Oil.",

Almost accurately, it takes about 12 more years but provided that the wage money is not used for other needs. The math looks possible, but in reality, it's impossible to do. You have to have some other source of income to be able to directly buy 1 BTC. But we can do trading and investing to double the money. and Bitcoin prices also fluctuate, there are times to buy at low prices. Bitcoin will not change anything, it depends on how a person is able to change himself by investing from the wages they receive, it will grow and continue to grow.",
