Just as quickly turned off as on (.. according to price, if it's 'profitable' to mine).Then again, I go against that thought by saying that for some it's never unprofitable to mine in the long run, to a certain extent: it's not important at all the price in fiat paid; all that matters to the miner is more 'fresh block' sats - granted they can operate at a loss nonstop. Perhaps there's a 'failure' somewhere in this thought.",

Is hash-power considered a lagging indicator? Just as quickly turned off as on (.. according to price, if it's 'profitable' to mine).The bull-trap signals are quite notable, they are when hash rate recovers but there isn't a buy signal, because there isn't positive price action since the recovery (ie there is a continued downtrend).A good example of this would be July this year where hash rate recovered (green circle, see above) but there wasn't positive price action prior to further capitulation, so no buy signal occurred. Similarly in April and May last year, hash rate twice recovered (MA30 crossed the MA60), but again lacked positive price action and/or network growth, in April it was the former and in May it was the latter, hence further capitulation occured.So in this case it could be a bull trap if there isn't a buy signal the end of the week, if price closes below $20,835 for example, the price at which hash rate signalled a recovery on the Daily time-frame.For reference sake, this is more than possible if there is a drop in hash rate / price tomorrow, as the MAs have only just crossed over by a very small margin:",

Currently average mining cost made a new low on August 19th at $16,555, which is not only benefical for the miners, but could help to explain the spike in hash rate on that day. Â For reference sake, it's quite usual for the buy signal to arrive the week or two after the hash rate recovery (green circle) has signalled, if not signalling the same week as recovery. Given that the current capitulation has lasted for 10 weeks now, it seems much more likely for a buy signal to arrive rather than a return to capitulation, as the latter is more common for shorter capitulations that have only lasted a few weeks.",

In summary, price will need to move higher, around $21.5K/$22K approximately, and close the week there, in order for the buy signal to appear with this indicator.Quote from: dragonvslinux on August 21, 2022, 12:03:18 PMGiven that the current capitulation has lasted for 10 weeks now, it seems much more likely for a buy signal to arrive rather than a return to capitulation, as the latter is more common for shorter capitulations that have only lasted a few weeks.",

If there are lower highs and horizontal support, aka a descending triangle, it's as bearish as they come. Not based on some prophecy, but rather based on buyers having decreasing momentum to push price to upside while sellers are stepping in at increasingly lower prices. That was 2018 as well as 2019 and why double, triple, quadruple bottoms make no sense in the bullish case.Quote from: buwaytress on August 23, 2022, 02:27:21 PMThink I've been neutral since the last rally above 20k, leaning towards bearish, especially after what I'd say is disappointing attempts to hold above in sustained manner.To be honest I was feeling pretty short-term bearish earlier today as price returned to re-testing $21K for the 4th/5th time, but now I'm not so sure about re-testing $20k. Maybe price barts back up to $23K after all. One interesting thing I noticed with the RSI on the 4hr since May is there has been the pattern of after <20 deeply oversold, previously it re-tested around 20 (green arrows) in order to make a lower low (as well as swing low), after getting rejected around the neutral level of 40. Despite the sideways looking bear flag, there hasn't been this rejection on the RSI despite anticipating this to play out, because like I said re-testing support for the umpteenth time isn't a bullish sign, and instead looked ready to form the bullish divergence we've seen in previous swing lows. \"This time it's different\" has therefore become a relevant argument imo.All in all, my short-term bearish outlook is already turning neutral as bears fail to push prices below $21K, while the bulls fail to reclaim $22K and the 4hr RSI returns to neutral territory.",
