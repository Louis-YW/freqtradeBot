      "body": "There's no strict rule for placing the Bitcoin symbol before or after amounts, as it often depends on personal preference and regional conventions. The most common and widely accepted format is to place the symbol before the amount, like \"₿ 1.23456789\". This format is similar to how currency symbols are typically used in financial contexts. It's essential to maintain consistency within your writing or presentation when using the Bitcoin symbol.For me, The best place to put the Bitcoin symbol (₿) is before the amount. This is the convention that is most commonly used by Bitcoin users and exchanges. I personally prefer to put the Bitcoin symbol before the amount. I think it makes it easier to identify the currency and to distinguish between Bitcoin amounts and other types of numbers.",

It probably feels that way because you're more familiar with it, just like how you write fiat. At the end of the day, this is just a matter of consensus, and I've never seen one argue strongly against the other. I'd say just use whatever you like, the other party is likely going to understand anyway.",

What now if all the fiat currencies that we know use this kind of standard? Should Bitcoin follow their ways? As a matter of fact, if I were to treat Bitcoin as a new and revolutionary currency that goes against the flow of all these rotten fiat currencies, I might even be convinced that Bitcoin's symbol should be placed after, if only to show that this currency is different from the rest, that this currency is a form of resistance to the fiat standard.",

So far we are dealing with a currency here, normally, we should also follow the same method we write or place our fiat currency signs.",
