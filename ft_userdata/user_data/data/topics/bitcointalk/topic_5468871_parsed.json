Exactly and bigger casinos do not ban people for winning,I know people at Stake who have won huge amounts in a consistent way at some time but that have lost big some other time,the casino knew that and they would be stupid to ban these type of persons.If you don't break any rule even if you win a million dollar for big,well established and reputable casinos there is not the slightest problem to pay you.So before having strong evidence I agree with you,I usually don't take side with the gamblers who can be disgruntled from a certain treatment that the casino in total fairness have done to him.",

The thing though is that they are not going to give out the details on how they arrived on that decision or how they know that certain players are just taking advantage and abusing their casinos.",

That being said if any casino has genuinely prevented a gambler because he was able make large amounts then it is bad for business. I think the casino should reveal the reason for such actions. They don't want a bad name in competitive business. They should clear the air and prevent this negative publicity if they haven't done anything wrong.",

All they prefer to do is the lazy work by registering and gambling immediately without reading the ToS. They will violate one or some of the rules and they may be banned. But some gambling sites too may use the privilege to cheat the gambler. If a gambler has two accounts and has not using any of the account to cheat, the gambling site supposed to only merge the accounts together, but if a gambling site ban both accounts, they have the right to do so, but that is cheating.But the best is not to violate the ToS at all so that you will be able to avoid ban or restriction.",

It is not a nice thing to only hear one side to a dispute because one party might have been the cause of the dispute, that is why they say there is no smoke without fire.In all fairness too, I believe must users here have been trying to lean towards the side of fair hearing when some newbie accounts open up an allegation thread against a casino especially those that we know that are reputable here and most times you find out that the complainants have not followed the ToS of the casino or have contravened other conditions leading to the casino taking a punishment action.When allegations are brought against casinos here, most responses always want to be sure of the claims of the one sided story by asking for screenshots of conversation, screenshot of issues in question and other proofs to ascertain the claim of the complainants and most times require the casino to respond where the complainants seem to have a case but if the complainants doesn't have any case, the complaints are dismissed with the flip of the palm. So I think it is a balance report here between the gambler complainants and the casinos.",

However these customers rarely come back to defend the casinos when the bullshit accusations come up. If you follow the scam accusations section carefully, anyone can realize this and come to the proper conclusion that most of the casinos are fair and try to pay their customers in case a problem arises and the player wins but is not paid out immediately or some glitch occurs.A disgruntled player will often shift blame of their addiction on the casino, sucks to be them, I would say.",

Moreover, the ToS at reputable casinos is quite clear and their professionalism is also very good, so their decisions have definitely been considered very carefully and everything has definitely been taken into account by the casino management, so that it doesn't damage their reputation.",

Readers look into this, before taking sides. If I read such an article, its obligatory to observe the quality of support the casino gave the big winner. Casinos that stopped responding to the gambler after winning big, should be blamed. So, cases like this one, is getting too much and casinos are mostly blamed. Because some casinos are found guilty, many others will be seen as guilty, even when not. The question remains, why now? Subsequently, the player wagers money in the casino and wins, with zero problem of withdrawals. But, when he wins big, the casino begins their research on the player to know if he broke any rule. One way or another he did, and the money is denied off him. I think it's a bad conduct. If need to check up a casino member's activities arises, they should do that always or immediately. To help the player understand better and stay clear from breaking rules. The casino need to issue those bans, even when they're not winning. Out of greed, some casinos enjoy the losses of the player, and fail to check if they're breaking any rule. That's where the problem of taking sides erupt. People are not nut. We read to uniquely understand a situation. When a casino is known for its quality attention to issues, a player is blamed for breaking rules by the community. Not all threads as such, have I seen the community blame only the casino. As they also use the casino and have not experienced such a back log. Question would be asked and if no sufficient answer is provided, the player or casino gets the bad review. Depending on their reaction to the problem. A player that takes advantage of the casino, will be penalized by the casino and nothing is wrong with it.  I think only few people take sides. If the number of people who take sides are higher, then the casinos are at fault.",

I want to remind you that mistakes can happen even in reputable casinos and also happened in the past if you look at the scam accusation section.But what differentiates the reputed casino and shit ones is if there is something happened due to a mistake from the casino they have to accept it and willing to revoke/refund/unban or whatever they are supposed to do and it also acts as a sign that the casino care about their reputation more than anything also there are others who try to cover up the situation by changing the terms after the incident happened and refuse to even address it damages their name.Now in reality 95% of mistakes from the user side as far as I have seen but the gamblers can't accept their mistake and are willing to throw wild accusations against the casino which is mostly because due to the frustrations that arise from loss.",

Some of the reasons casinos ban gamblers are cheating, disorderly conduct, underage gambling, suspicion of money laundering, non-payment of debts and high-stake gambling in the case of some prominent gambling personalities. And you know that the higher the stake, the higher the probability of winning. So yea technically winning too much money can make a casino ban you. I do not take sides with either the casinos or the player. I know that there are very terrible casinos out there that will bend the rules to their favour. It is a business so they must make profit at all means even at the expense of customers dissatisfaction. There are also gamblers who try to cheat the casinos to win. So I do not take sides. -gamblingnewsmagazine.com/casino-ban/",

Let’s just say these casinos have been eyeing these particular gamblers if they have been doing fraudulent activities or they have been cheating all along. But whatever it is, a reputable casino will always be credible of its own actions so if they decide to ban that gambler, most likely he had been breaking the rules numerous times.",

Anyone believing on random user bad experience story about casino without any valid proof is surely need to think carefully. Scam accusation reports here needs substantial evidence before user should entertain it.Although some user playing victim usually fabricates evidence that will work against casino since some forum user is very quick to judge especially those user that doesn’t like casino. Most of the scam report on Bitcointalk is just a fraud while only few is telling the truth but it’s very rare for casino especially those trusted already for a long time to commit mistakes on giving punishments to their customers.",

That is why you see that evidence should be provided because I have seen a case whereby, the casino deprived withdrawal due to claiming that the user has two accounts registered on the casino, and the user said that he only has one account. I have also seen a case that the casino claimed that the gambler country was restricted but they registered, feposited and played a game and won, but when it comes to withdrawal, that was when they said this.On the other hand, we know that some gamblers are always looking for a way to cheat a casino and they will come up with various kind of activities in the site that will make the casino notice them and will ban them. It is better to read ToS of the casino before registration and also make sure that you complete your KYC verification first, before you deposit any funds.",

But, people ain't idiots to not look for something that would prove it is true. That's the good part about people right now in the internet era, they already learned that somehow we can find some facts using the internet so they do their own research. Some may agree but many will try to find the truth first. I am assuming only here, but I do believe it has always something to do with KYC. Some gamblers just don't understand the risk that is involved with gambling sites if they let a big amount of cash come in and out of their service. It can be a crime for money laundering and maybe worse so a gambling site must get the details of the one cashing out. This ain't different with banks, they have a limit for cash outs and they will take your information and prove it before they let it go.",
