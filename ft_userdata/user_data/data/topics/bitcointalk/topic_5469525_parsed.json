  "content": "-----Emotions-----Opinions-----Fact------Hey! I was thinking of something this night, this thing about merits and the merit-sources. If you are a merit-source, should you always give away merit to good posts even if you dislike the user that created the post?Or are you allowed to be controlled by your feelings and only give away merit to people you like or don't know? It's a different a user can give merit to whoever he wants, because it's his/hers own merit and they can do whatever they want with it. But a merit-source how should he act? Without feelings or with feelings?I don't trying to blame anyone, or create any drama and I am not disappointed with my low merits, I am quite happy and proud that I already got ten merit and being a member rank, so I am in no rush what so ever to rank up, I actually love the farming and the journey, because when and if I reach Legendary nobody can say I didn't earn it the right way. I rather let it take years of honest farming then months of cheating.But back to my question, what do you think aboiut merit-sources when they handle out merit? They ¬†should give merit to all good posts right, even if a user they dislike made a very good post. Or is it okay to just skip to give that user merit even that he made a very good post?Maybe this come as bit confusing, I am sorry my English is not 10/10. But I hope you will understand! Great weekend everyone.UPDATE 18th November: I now been on the forum a bit longer then the time I created this topic and I truly believe being a Merit-Source is not as easy or fun as it may look like.So I want to take the time to say Thank you to all Merit-Sources that seeing this with neutral eyes! üôè",

You farm your way up to something, whatever it is. it's a term I got from when I played World of Warcraft.Here you farm your way up to Legendary rank, but you do it the right way. That's farming for me.Farming is not a negative or bad thing. Farming is something that take long long time, example in the game World of Warcraft you maybe farm gold, or better gear.

There are several reasons for that. For one there are tons of people that use bitcoin around the world but most of these forum is for English speaking audiences only. Local bitcointalk communities for countries where there are thousands of bitcoin and crypto users are nowhere near the level of activity said country and language might have. So meriting local community participants to encourage them rank and to and bring more quality global traffic on this forum is going to be all around beneficial. However, what is it that drives one to appreciate and want to reward usage of his mother tongue? In part it is emotion for sure... In the end I don't think we should be judging people's emotions too harshly. We all have them, we all think based on emotion to an extent. The thing is to not overdo it.",

Merit should be awarded to posts that are quality or high quality and a forum member should not use it as same as Like on Facebook or Twitter. It is applied for all types of forum members including merit sources.Quote from: theymos on January 24, 2018, 11:00:11 PMI'm hoping that this system will increase post quality by:¬†- Forcing people to post high-quality stuff in order to rank up. If you just post garbage, you will never get even 1 merit point, and you will therefore never be able to put links in your signature, etc.¬†- Highlighting good posts with the \"Merited by\" line.While we will not be directly moderating this, I encourage people to give merit to posts that are objectively high-quality, not just posts that you agree with.But remember.QuoteDo not beg for merit excessively.Merit sources are human, not bots so they do have emotional when distributing their sourced sendable merits (sMerits) but it is not big issue. If your posts are good, you will receive merit from merit sources or non merit sourced users.There are 109 merit sources so why do you worry about one or two merit sources dislike you?",

I mean that their actions should not be controlled by feelings, it should be controlled by fact and their opinions if the post is worthy or not, but not because they are friend or enemy with someone.Merit source can do as he supposes right as long as does it the way admin sees correct. And that's all. Of course many see the work of merit source the same way (including sources), so usually sources give merits for what they think will make forum a better place for us all (it's your position that two posts are equally good, others could see it the other way). If you think that your own vision has not enough support from existing sources, then make your own application and show what valuable posts are underrated and if you'll get some support then theymos can probably give you such an opportunity.",

Yes, they are allowed to be controlled by their feelings. It is a voluntary responsibility they undertake, so they are giving lots of wiggle room.Merit sources are judged for merits they give and not merits they do not give. You will almost certainly not know if a source was avoiding your post. If you perceive they are, (like you commenting on a post with a helpful comment and someone repeats your post immediately after you which gets a merit but you don't), you still cannot fault the merit source for that.In a flawless system sources should be 100% objective in how they distribute their smerits. They should be blind to prejudice and only merit the post and not the user, they should even merit posts they do not agree with if the argument is deserving of it.

I can decides to be giving out on 2 merits per post no matter how constructive the post seems to be, or I can decide to be giving out 4 and this also depends on your allocation per months, there are some people whose allocation could be 1k merits per months while some 100 or 200 respectively. Those who are with 1k merits can be more generous to people than those who has limited allocation so in my opinion there's no feeling attached to it the only thing is how much merits left with the user.",
