Hardcore rules that you will have to follow, that's how I see gambling to work on your side if somebody is really aiming to make this as a steady income. Obeying those rules might really work as long as the gambler sticks to the plan.Greed will come in, then regrets that leads to chasing losses which is a wrong thing to do when it comes to gambling. I've been on that side and I try to minimize that kind of emotion as much as I can, but I still see some people who do it in different casino games. Using martingale to chase their losses that will only end up being rekt. Emotions will always be the target, and being drowned by it will lead to possible zero balance in the long run. This is the reason why I don't like playing too many casino games, somehow they can still get in your head and as long as you have more in your wallet, you cannot be stopped easily.",

This is the reason why society erroneously see gamblers as jobless and irresponsible. Some people indirectly lives in casinos because they don't have jobs. They see gambling as a full-time job and they spend enormous time and their meager resources on bets. Gambling like Op said shouldn't even be a side hustling but an entertainment that may or may not give profit.

Entering a casino without plans that set your limitations will lead to a loss of control. Every gambler should have a gambling plan that reflects his income and how much he can afford to lose. Every gambler should have a strong will to know when to walk away to avoid uncontrollable losses.QuoteThat's if you are not even addicted to gambling already, a addicted gambler always have one goal in mind, '( I have to make back all I have lost ), this is where the beginning of the end begins. Chasing losses is the highway to gambling addiction. That's why it is important to follow your gambling plan no matter what happens in the casino. Chasing losses is like pursuing a train on foot.",

Gambling is entertainment and looking for fun, even though there are some of them who get big profits or get the biggest wins, of course they have also experienced big losses the previous day. I think that gambling is a place to get rid of stress from work fatigue and that is a normal thing that everyone does.Apart from that, if you want to make gambling as passive income or looking for wealth, of course we have to become owners in this gambling and this has become a visible reality today.",

Through regular gambling made it into 0.0412BTC which I lost in less than 10 rolls following the worst martingale strategy. Earlier it was the strategy that helped in multiplying the wallet balance.

Yes, I so much agree with you on this very statement of yours as mentioned above, because truly gambling can never give a steady income due to the high risk involved whereby a gambler is bound to either win or lose depending on how lucky or experience he/she might be whenever a game is at stake. Because with the fact that in every game you play, you only have a 1% chance to win while 99% chance to lose, that makes it a lucrative business to casino owners to always have a steady income compared to an ordinary gambler that may end up losing all his funds in a single day. Which is why it's always good to be discipline and have a set rules on how much to gamble with each week, month, so as to not go bankrupt due to overspending.",
