  "content": "User : AndyStThis user is interesting about his posting behavior, almost of his posts were edited in the next day, I'm surprised no one noticed this because he have doing this for a year and a half. It's not suspicious if he only edited some words or even add more explanation from his current post, but he's quoting a post without wrote anything or giving a mark \"Yes\". What's the reason he doing this? it's for abusing the campaign rules of must active for 5 days or want to hide from LoyceV and TryNinja for archiving unedited posts? I think he's high likely want to abuse the campaign rules since most of his posts created per week are around 25-28 and spread for 5 days. He quoted the post that he think he can comment about it, but since he doesn't have enough time, he quoted the post and edited it tomorrow when he have free time. I think this is behind of his behavior.Quote from: Carollzinha on November 21, 2020, 05:25:39 AMRULES♦️ Must make at least 25 quality posts per week♦️ You must be an active forum user in daily basis (or at least 5 days a week)The stake campaign spreadsheetQuote from: Carollzinha on December 29, 2020, 03:51:10 AMAnd for those that (I honestly have no idea why) want to know about the campaign members, here is the list.. but, as I said, no new members are shown in that list until they get their first payment.Here I will show it based on his latest 10 weeks:June/13 = He posted on date June 13, 12, 10, 9, 8 (32 posts, spread for 5 days)June/6 = He posted on date June 6,5, May 31 (25 posts, spread for 3 days)May/30 = He posted on May 30, 29, 27, 26, 25 (26 posts, spread for 5 days)May/23 = He posted on May 23, 22, 20, 19, 18 (27 posts, spread for 5 days)May/16 = He posted on May 16, 15, 13, 12, 11 (29 posts, spread for 5 days)May/09 = He posted on May 9, 8, 6, 5, 4 (28 posts, spread for 5 days)May/02 = He posted on May 2, 1, April 30, 29, 28, 27 (28 posts, spread for 6 days)April/25 = He posted on April 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20 (27 posts,  spread for 6 days) April/18 = He posted on April 18, 17, 15, 14, 13 (27 posts, spread for 5 days)April/11 = He posted on April 11, 10, 8, 7, 6 (27 posts, spread for 5 days)This mean in 10 weeks, only 2 weeks he spread one more day, the rest is hit the minimum requirement while the June/6 he failed to met it (perhaps he already communicate with Caroll)Here is the example where he quoted a post without add anythingMore example with such post can be viewed here:https://ninjastic.space/post/60232037https://ninjastic.space/post/60232059https://ninjastic.space/post/60232095https://ninjastic.space/post/60232121https://ninjastic.space/post/60238769Here is the example where he quoted a post and only mark it with \"Yes\"More example with such post can be viewed here:https://ninjastic.space/post/58613461https://ninjastic.space/post/58603807https://ninjastic.space/post/58573425https://ninjastic.space/post/58573461https://ninjastic.space/post/58603849Obviously I will PM Caroll about this thread and look how his response about this.",

Since Carrick was in control, Man United has continued to show positive results so far. Will it be better after Rangnick takes over, because in terms of quality and experience Rangnick is much better. At least for the time being Man United supporters can be happy with Man United's performance which is getting better after being left by Solskjaer. Ralf Rangnick has finally received a work permit from the British government, so when Man United face Crystal Palace this will be Rangnick's debut as Man United manager. After the excellent results shown by Carrick, will put pressure on Rangnick to be able to continue the positive results obtained by Man United. It's really interesting to see Rangnick's debut, Man United should be able to beat Crystal Palace easily, if we look at Crystal Palace's recent bad performance with two consecutive defeats.YesEdited postQuote from: AndySt on December 02, 2021, 11:31:48 PMQuote from: Wawa2013 on December 02, 2021, 10:56:48 PMA very good decision made by the management of Man United by making Carrick as interim coach.

It's really interesting to see Rangnick's debut, Man United should be able to beat Crystal Palace easily, if we look at Crystal Palace's recent bad performance with two consecutive defeats.Well, Carrick still remains at the club and will continue to work in the coaching staff of Manchester United already as an assistant to Rangnik. In any case, the decision has already been made and the contract with the Rangnik has already been signed and obtaining a work permit was no longer such an essential detail. Given Manchester United's not the greatest stability in the results, I would personally be wary of claiming an easy victory over Crystal Palace in the upcoming match. Another question is that Manchester United should continue to gain points to improve their standings and where else but in matches with such opponents it is worth doing.I hope you will understand my point, the thing is all of his post has been edited and no one on gambling discussion noticed that.",

Chipmixer pays for up to 50 posts per week, but it does not bring any spam whatsoever to the forum. People are responsible for their actions and not the campaign they are on.Having said that, the last case that was similar to this one was handled shrewdly by Carollzinha who is the manager of the campaign, which goes to show that they do not tolerate spam or behaviours such as this.",

We have since people with 0 knowledge about gambling & sportbook (literally 0 as he joined it less than 2 weeks ago) but we also have people thats inside this world for over 7 years. Everyone rate every campaign member posts, every week, and link what they believe was the best post of them for that week.. after that we pick the average from these 4 rating to select those with the highest scores to win the prize. Same happens with those with the lowest rating.. once they reach a 5.5 average, I do talk to them myself but if they quality wont change in a week or two, we are replacing that person, as simple as that.

Will a negative tag with a strong message suffice?I don't think negative tag solve the problem and maybe it's not the best way to give it to spammers given the trust system isn't meant to tag spammers. If that's possible, then we should have flagged thousands of spammers on this forum as in bitcoin discussions as well as altcoin discussions. It might be appropriate to tag it as neutral which could serve as a warning to certain managers to be more careful about hiring them, but it's best to report a user's post for deletion and let a moderator judge it.For other considerations, I agree that each topic should be moderated by the OP to discourage spammers. But since not many OPs do, I think we still have a chance to contribute to the forum by reporting the spam post to a moderator.By the way, I'm no longer reporting posts on gambling boards so far as it seems the mod doesn't think it's worth deleting even though I'm sure it's spam. There are 100+ of my reports on the gambling board that were not dealt with to this day, so maybe that's the reason I don't do it anymore.",
