He sends complaints to the registrar, hosting, creates threads on bitcointalk, and GitHub! This person starts by stealing sites, bans these sites, and then steals cryptocurrency!He has profiles on GitHub and bitcointalk, where he simply destroys his competitors. He doesn’t ban his own sites and tries to keep them in the shadows! He advertises his sites through YouTube, his 3 accounts are @egg333, @BitXpress, @BlockBrainiac, all the links I’ll provide below, on YouTube, bitcointalk, and GitHub!He has already stolen over $100,000 from people and continues to do so!

This behavior is often seen among scammers who lack emotional control and become unstable when their cybercrime activities are unveiled.I firmly believe that every cyber crypto scammer like \"cryptofbi007\" deserves to be arrested for their fraudulent activities. Furthermore, I sincerely hope that victims who fell prey to schemes similar to those found on your crypto QR phishing code websites are able to recover their funds in some capacity or obtain the justice they deserve. It is crucial that scammers like you face the consequences for your actions.Here, the malicious cryptocurrency crimes committed by \"icryptofbi\" or known as \"cryptofbi007\" are described:QuoteAttention, BitcoinTalk community:Please be cautious and aware of the fraudulent activities carried out by an russian individual named \"cryptofbi007\" & \"icryptofbi\" (🇷🇺). This evil person has created multiple fake crypto QR code generator websites, including \"xmr-qr-code.com\", \"xmr-qr-code-generator.com\", and \"xmrqrcode.com\". These websites generate QR codes that only direct funds to the scammer's Monero (XMR) address: 84gHdF7rArqU6e9cbmfPi9iJR2QUU7CoX1XJEvAmQWXmSUkj3C3LVLW3ioHiqNc8iwGPcxCv5Fk13ZY k9fxQFLKuKEW54r6Please note that a saved archive of the phishing website containing the fraudster's Monero address can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20231122120748/https://xmr-qr-code.com/8.phpThis phishing scam involves tricking users into sending their cryptocurrency to the scammer's wallet through a QR code, resulting in significant financial losses. The scam operator, known by the pseudonym \"cryptofbi007\" on websites like GitHub, manipulates and social engineers hosting and domain teams to avoid suspension of these phishing websites. They consistently alter the websites' functionality upon receiving reports and even spam repositories to unblock their malicious domains in order to exploit innocent individuals.To protect our community, it is crucial to exercise extreme caution and avoid engaging with any QR code generator websites associated with \"cryptofbi007\". If you come across any instances or suspicious activities related to these scams, please report them immediately.The scam involving crypto QR code phishing works as follows: The victim enters the crypto address for which they need a QR code. Then, when they generate the QR code on one of the fraudulent crypto QR code websites, it always displays the same QR code on the final page, containing the fraudster's crypto address. Regardless of which crypto address the victim initially entered, the QR code will always belong to the fraudster, and the victim remains unaware. If someone sends cryptocurrency to the victim's \"QR code\", the funds will actually go to the fraudster, as the QR code belongs to them and displays their crypto address.His email accounts: The operator is known to use the following email addresses: \"cryptofbi007@gmail.com\" and \"uuyqq11qqaa@protonmail.com\".Due to this abuse, Proton Team has already banned the account \"uuyqq11qqaa@protonmail.com\", while the account \"cryptofbi007@gmail.com\" remains active.His YouTube profile: The YouTube account \"https://www.youtube.com/@gabrielenesto1\", named Gabriel Enesto (as of 12/22/2023) with Channel-ID: \"UCO5q0rVGQs4F4IKnNUbRERg\" belongs to the notorious individual known as \"cryptofbi007\". The fraudster \"cryptofbi007\", previously known as \"@gabrielenesto\" on YouTube, recently changed his YouTube handle to \"@gabrielenesto1\" with the intention of misleading and socially engineering individuals involved in this case. While the old YouTube handle now leads to an error page, people might mistakenly believe the link is incorrect, false, or outdated, whereas the actual YouTube handle as of 12/22/2023 is \"@gabrielenesto1\" and can be accessed.His Trustpilot profile: Additionally, the Trustpilot account \"https://www.trustpilot.com/users/63c0b6a16503ee0012e7c049\" also belongs to this despicable character. He utilizes these platforms to defame legitimate companies due to the banning of some of his phishing domains and to sabotage his competitors, driven solely by his insatiable greed.Also, \"Cryptofbi007\" and \"iCryptofbi\", who is named Gabriel Enesto on Trustpilot, changed his country to France in the settings, which is why it shows FR on his clearly fake reviews; however, he is originally from Russia, using this method to manipulate both people and law enforcement agencies.His Reddit profile: The fraudster known as \"cryptofbi007\" went to the extent of creating a public and restricted Reddit group called \"qr_code_\" to bolster his deceptive crypto QR phishing scam websites in search engine rankings. This group can be seen at \"https://www.reddit.com/r/qr_code_/\".To further his illicit activities, the fraudster operates under the Reddit username \"Itchy-Attention8905\". More information about his activities and profile can be found at \"https://www.reddit.com/user/Itchy-Attention8905/\".His Medium Profile: The Medium profile \"@cryptofbi007\", which can be visited at \"https://medium.com/@cryptofbi007\" (banned), also belongs to the Russian cybercriminal who goes by \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk.His GitHub profile: Additionally, they can be found on GitHub under the account: https://github.com/cryptofbi007 (banned), attempting to unblock their phishing domains from phishing warning systems. Here are the relevant repositories and issues:https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13139https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/13080While \"cryptofbi007\" attempted to unblock his phishing domains, the request got declined. Additionally, he changed the titles of the requests on GitHub, making it difficult for potential victims to find the specific request related to unblocking his phishing websites.I recently discovered that a malicious individual known as \"@cryptofbi007\" (banned) on GitHub has created a new account on Github with the username \"@Ceytllle\" (https://github.com/Ceytllle). This person, using the username \"icryptofbi\" on BitcoinTalk, is falsely accusing random individuals who report phishing websites of being me, just as he did on the GitHub platform under his new account named \"@Ceytllle\". This is how I came to understand that these are multiple accounts of the same individual. He have linked a BitcoinTalk topic on a GitHub comment where he claim I am somehow involved with websites that I have no association or connection to. It appears that this fraudulent individual is intentionally targeting anyone involved in the fight against crypto cybercrime, including myself.I obtained some of his social media accounts by reporting the phishing websites to domain registrars and hosting providers. The Russian individual behind these fraudulent activities went by the names \"icryptofbi\" or \"cryptofbi007\". Consequently, I received delayed messages that contained pertinent information from this fraudster.Furthermore, it is worth noting that the operator behind this phishing scam is believed to be Russian and has previously operated fake Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum QR code generator websites such as \"Crypto-qr-code.com\", \"btc-qr-code.se\", and \"crypto-qr-code.su\". These websites generate the scammer's Bitcoin address: 18gcvrjDju719nQNXhJxRAaw25Vj6M6i4WThe phishing websites \"usdt-qr.com\" and \"ltc-qr-code.su\" are also owned by the same individual using the pseudonym \"cryptofbi007\", indicating a coordinated phishing scheme. Both websites generate the domain holder's (cryptofbi007) USDT address 0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6 (https://etherscan.io/address/0xBeE32483957f116c5830133188dca45B80b94Fe6) and Litecoin address LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ (https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LNWTRts3HQeuWnbjjr3Ndg4NARuWQSTApZ), further solidifying their association and intention to defraud unsuspecting victims. It is of utmost importance to raise awareness about these fraudulent activities to protect potential targets from falling prey to these scams.To aid in identification, please find below a list of all known phishing crypto addresses and domains associated with \"cryptofbi007\":Phishing Crypto Addresses by \"cryptofbi007\":1.

This behavior reveals their malicious intent.Warning: Please be cautious of a fake crypto QR code generator scam conducted by users with pseudonyms \"cryptofbi007\", \"icryptofbi\", and \"Olgareva\".As the operator of this scam scheme resides in Russia, I recommend reporting the scammer on the following platforms, providing detailed information from this BitcoinTalk topic:Email: info@mvd.ru - Russian PoliceEmail: fsb@fsb.ru - Russian FBIEmail: info@fsb.ru - Russian FBIEmail: incident@cert.gov.ruEmail: info@cert.ruIMPORTANT: If you are not Russian or do not have a Russian email address, I recommend creating a \".ru\" email address on websites such as \"https://rambler.ru\". For example, you can send a detailed report, similar to my complaint, to them from a Russian email address. This is necessary because other email providers, such as Google, may have blocked sending emails to \".ru\" addresses due to the ongoing war.IMPORTANT²: In the police complaint, please remember to include the individual \"icryptofbi\" or also referred to as \"cryptofbi007\". This person utilized the Tether USDT address \"0xbee32483957f116c5830133188dca45b80b94fe6\" to receive the stolen funds and defraud numerous unsuspecting victims, resulting in the loss of several thousand dollars.

However, your dissatisfaction with the outcome was evident in your response which can be found here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475616.msg63436255#msg63436255 (https://web.archive.org/web/20240106030129/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5475616.msg63436255#msg63436255)QuoteIronically, you seemed to conveniently omit a prior incident that took place nearly a year ago on 4/28/2023, where you made a claim on GitHub that these exact websites scammed you out of 200 USDT. This claim can be substantiated through the following link: https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/12425#issue-1688854430 (https://web.archive.org/web/20240106030319/https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect/issues/12425#issue-1688854430)QuoteThis contradiction by \"Jerayer\" exposes his intent to engage in malicious behavior, such as slander, defamation, and harassment, rather than providing factual evidence or substantiated arguments.Your actions appear to be an effort to tarnish the reputation of individuals rather than engaging in honest discourse supported by valid arguments or evidence.More information regarding the user \"Jerayer\", who is the operator of the scam platform \"Boomchange\", can be found at this link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454622.0 This individual persistently attempts to socially engineer people into visiting his fraudulent website and defames those who expose cryptocurrency phishing scams, like \"icryptofbi\" already has.",
