Most have little original code.Sigh.",

If there is a virus in the miner, then I don’t have wallets and passwords on the mining farm that can be stolen. Now it remains to install Hive OS or Raven OS and you don't need to install anything else. Developers of these systems test miners before adding it to their system.",

Sure it was closed source but he had a reputation and they were all on rigs with no private keys or anything. Still using Claymore? I thought the developer vanished from the earth.No, nobody used claymore for like 5 years but the point I was trying to make was that at the time it was the best miner you could use. He didn’t develop it for free and due to that he made to make it closed source to get the fee. If he made it open source, everybody would just move the fee to 0% and he wouldn’t make as much money.None of his miners had viruses or malware. People used it for years and just trusted him. Plus like I said before. It was all on headless rigs with nothing installed except the miner software. Nothing to steal from those systems.",

Basically, the problems were not with the miner, but with Windows crashes  and I had to read miner forums. With hive OS and other systems, there are fewer problems.",
