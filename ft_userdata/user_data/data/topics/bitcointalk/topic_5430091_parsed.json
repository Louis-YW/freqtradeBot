      "body": "I just reviewed the website you posted here, thanks for bringing it to our attention. I guess this is a new site, but it has all that many might need in just one page, which makes it powerful even though it looks simple. But it seems that your interface is a bit different from mine as I only see data without having the option to select the data of the country I want to display on the screen like you selected the USA in your own case. Well, I will continue to use it, perhaps I would get acquainted with it over time.This is majorly an inflation site, which is good, and another thing I like about the site is that it is not fiat-company based as Coindesk is included as one of the tagged companies.",
