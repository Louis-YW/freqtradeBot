So the only way what they receive could be zero is if we are about a 100 years from now that the block reward is zero and also nobody uses bitcoin anymore to pay any fee.QuoteIs it possible that Bitcoin could increase its total supply in the future? But that would certainly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop significantly.Anything is possible but remember that capped supply is one of the main principles of Bitcoin. Changing those is extremely difficult because it fundamentally changes Bitcoin.Not to mention that there is no reason to do so in the near future (that's the next decade or two). And in my opinion speculating about any further than that is wrong because of the way technology advances, we may have something far better than Bitcoin 20 years from now.QuoteCould Bitcoin switch to PoS like Ethereum?

The network halt only happens if all Bitcoin miners stop mining, but fortunately in other cases, blocks will be found with longer time, more than average block time of 10 minutes, but new blocks will surely be found. And after 2140 blocks, difficulty will be adjusted and become lower. It will help new blocks to be found faster.Future Bitcoin SupplyBitcoin Equivalent Network TimeBitcoin difficulty estimator",

So as long as people keep using Bitcoin, and as long as BTC price grows over time, I think there will be enough incentive to do this kind of work. Also, let's not forget that miners can quit, and then the difficulty rate readjusts, so it's not an issue if some miners leave over time because of being unsatisfied with rewards.There's no need to increase the total supply, as Bitcoin is highly divisible into sats.

A few miners drop out, but this is all part of an automatic adjustment that regulates mining profitability for those still online, a shifting difficulty level that will keep the network going with less miners on it.As for increasing the supply of Bitcoin, this is not likely. Bitcoin's hard cap of 21 million forms a fundamental part of its value. Changing this would disrupt its appeal of scarcity and undermine trust in a way that the decentralized community would not go for. Moreover, unlike Ethereum, it is not in Bitcoin's philosophy to migrate toward Proof of Stake. While Proof of Work in Bitcoin has held up over the years, Proof of Stake is arguably more secure, decentralized, and perhaps more energy-efficient.",

Halving reduces the supply of bitcoin and the reduced supply, increases the price value of bitcoin because the demand either remains the same or increases. This means even if the reward miners get per block mined reduced, the value of the bitcoin they get increases. Miners made about $300 in 2012 even though the reward was 25btc back then. Today they make just over 3btc and the reward is over $180k. This figure will increase with the increase in bitcoin price. So there is no way they'll make zero dollars as long as bitcoin is not equal zero. Bitcoin price at this stage will always be reasonable. In four years time when the reward will be halved to 1.5625, bitcoin price might get to over $200k after that.",
