Anyone with insight as regards to this news should throw more lights.https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386?t=H9hkprSmswf5MFwc2WNP0w&s=19",

WIF, PEPECOIN, SPX, and many more. you can check this list: https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/the Official Trump memecoin is also in the list. and it is listed in a lot of exchanges already. it is going insane with almost $4 billion marketcap.

      "body": "That is new Trump themed meme coin making waves. Although it is not listed on major exchanges yet some investors have already shifted funds from Bitcoin to this meme coin. Bybit exchange has countdown suggesting it will be listed soon. Launch timing has raised suspicions possibly planned during SEC office closure and before Gary Gensler departure but there is no official confirmation. Currently TRUMP trades almost at $20 and market cap of $3.87B which is a huge gain. And in my point of view they are just playing with crypto market. That would be better if he concentrate on Bitcoin other than launching new token.",

It will depend on Trump adminstration and policy on Bitcoin market in particular and blockchain industry in general as well as policy and execution on making Bitcoin as part of the USA.

If Trump could launch memecoin and not a coin to attributes to the overall growth of US is worthless as nothing because I didn't see how this coin has control to even the growth of bitcoin or even influence other altcoin as I may see, people who are investing in this meme are just those who are solely jumping from one memes to another with the purpose of utilizing the quick cash out when there is possible x to achieve from their investment.",

No one can actually afford to leave off profit on this coins, memecoins remain memecoins no matter who lunched it. Most of the buyers were those buying with two figure price and not some huge money.
