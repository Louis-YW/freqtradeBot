This service does just that, the only difference is that this one seems to offer virtual numbers as well.I came across it through Binance's merchants page[1] and while searching I found that they also have an announcement thread here[2] so I just want to hear some of your thoughts about it if you've used it already.[1] https://pay.binance.com/en/merchant-stores[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5447115.0",

      "body": "I recently got a free eSim, from RedBull. It's valid for a year in many countries. There are more services offering free trials, and since they compete worldwide, I'm hoping many more will offer free trials in the coming years.The bad thing is most free eSims require installing an app.I don't really need it though, as long as I'm inside EU I have enough data in my plan. I see a bigger market for GPS trackers using eSim.Update: I googled it, and the first thing I found was lifetime eSim for €2.50, to be soldered inside a device. This is very scary, it will create a whole new level of attacks. Imagine replacing someone's hardware wallet with a fake device with esim that instantly broadcasts the PIN. Air gapped devices will need a faraday cage to be sure.",

      "body": "So when you buy an eSIM, it's completely digital right? As in, no card for you to put anywhere.Then how do you switch between different eSIMs on your devices?Quote from: LoyceMobile on August 24, 2023, 08:31:02 AMUpdate: I googled it, and the first thing I found was lifetime eSim for €2.50, to be soldered inside a device.

Air gapped devices will need a faraday cage to be sure.I believe you can coat or wrap the device in aluminium foil to prevent the WiFi and cellular signals from being broadcasted, thus preventing this type of vulnerability or *any* internet/NFC/Bluetooth access from the device, for that matter. QR codes will still work of course.",

I can select one esim at a time.",

That’s what I bought it for before realizing my iPhone doesn’t support esim because it was 2 physical sim slots (I believe it’s a Chinese market version).",
