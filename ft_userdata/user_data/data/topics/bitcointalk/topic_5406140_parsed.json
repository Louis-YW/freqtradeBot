  "content": "Pusha.one is a free service allowing you to customise the prizes in a 3D coin pusher game.Pusha.one runs as a Web App, making it accessible to all platforms, although it's best added to the home screen on mobile devices to take full advantage of it in Web Application mode.The concept is that by using your API callback URL you can customise what the prizes that the coin pusher game will reward to the user and when, the prizes display a javascript alert() box once they are won and using this alert box you are able to reward the user with a link, product keys, discount codes, etc. The user makes this request from their browser allowing you to create session cookies so that each user gets a unique discount code or similar. You could have a limited supply and when they run out just return \"this prize giveaway has ended\" or similar.Your API url will receive the following url query parameters;- {pid} present box theme id- {coins} how many coins played since game start- {elapsed} how many seconds elapsed since game start- {winnum} current number of presents won- {width} screen width- {height} screen heightRequest Example:mywebsite.com/api.php?pid=1&coins=92&elapsed=34.16&winnum=1&width=320&height=240What format to supply as your API URL?mywebsite.com/api.phpJust the domain and page with no query parameters.Make sure you enabled cores for Pusha.oneAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://Pusha.one.Tip: Press 'c' to switch between Perspective and Orthographic.Present Box Theme ID's2.
