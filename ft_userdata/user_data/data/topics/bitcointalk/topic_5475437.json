When you buy Lightning coins, you are buying a type of a crypto currency that can use on the Lightning Network. This doesn't directly affect Bitcoin itself. But with the use of Lightning Network people can reduce the traffic on Bitcon network.The thing is that Lightning Network is still in test and in progress and did not launch properly. It has its own problems and risks. And the lightning should have its own problems and risks.In the conclusion, I want to say that lighting network will not affect directly on the transactios on Bitcoin Network. So if you want to buy the lightning coin so it is your personal decision. If you want so you can buy.",

Instead we have lightning network which delivers quick transaction with about some second or almost to be confirmed a transaction, talking of lighting coin I have never heard of that maybe there is a new coin I am missing so I stand in a better chance to be corrected if I am wrong. However you can withdraw Litecoin from any exchange and it takes not less than 10 to 20 minutes to confirm transaction.",

It's actually a good alternative for small transfers and known for cheaper and faster transaction than the typical Bitcoin transactions that you do. If you know what wallets it's being supported.Try to make some experiments and send a couple of bucks and see how fast it is. I've done a few of it in the past and it's great for small transactions.",

How does an altcoin be of a help to bitcoin?I had used lightning in the past. Some like 3-4 years ago. It was at a point were widely promoted by some users in the forum. They might still be but have lacked the steam now.It came as a cheap and fast way to transact BTC, and it was a comfort but the reason why it never got the recognition is also obvious. People were not interested to use BTC as a utility or merchant coin. There were already a multiple of option for that.Lightning came as a response to high fee and congestion of bitcoin network but that got eased to some extent now. The network might still be going strong but people are not much interested about it now. And lightning was bitcoin. You needed to freeze the amount of BTC to generate equal amount of lightning BTC.",

How does an altcoin be of a help to bitcoin?What do you want to do with lightning bitcoin when you are not a business person or someone that want to be spending bitcoin in for shopping and buying stuffs. If you want bitcoin for holding, do that on exchange and have transfer it to your personal wallet.Lightning network bitcoin are also real bitcoin but you can't ubuy them to hold as they are meant to be used to transact and when you are done with all the spending, you can close the channel and then your bitcoin will be move from the layer 2 chain to the bitcoin base chain where you can do whatever you like with it, I hope you understand the difference.Altcoins doesn't help bitcoin in anyway, it's actually the opposite.",
