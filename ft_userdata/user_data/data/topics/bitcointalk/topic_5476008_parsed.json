  "content": "I was checking my mails and came across this mail [1] from hdfc. I was surprised to see digital rupee already live. So I decided to give app a try, process of registration was relatively smooth, after registering I tried to load wallet with 10 rupee, funds were transferred from my bank account but digital rupee never showed them  Aside from that obvious problem, interface (mostly) works but is quite ugly, some options are bugged, there is field called \"activate mobile number\" in wallet section, you are supposed to activate to receive money with mobile number, if you click it, it'll show success pop-up but nothing actually happens. You are also given wallet address like crypto blockchains do, can't figure out how to see this address fully (will they have explorer?), it was shown fully during registration, now it's hidden with stars. Hopefully, paytm/phonepe will adopt it whenever it's ready, and give it a better ui. Better customer support too. I read it works with upi qr codes, so it's really good thing. [1] https://www.talkimg.com/image/Nt3w5p.s. I'll update post when/if I receive loaded 10 rupeeEdit: Received the refund in bank.",

Okay, I got it, this interoperability feature implemented a couple of months back and most banks are yet to integrate it that explains why we see contrast statements on two official banking websites.I use ICICI as my primary bank account, and they seem not really interested in this CBDC concept, so not notifying their customers too.",

As it is still a test version that might be the reason why not everyone is happy with the app. I am still unable to figure out the actual usage of digital ruppe. Why would anyone need it if they have UPI or wallet. I don't think it will be very useful unless the RBI comes up with its unique usage. For example international transfers.",

They are the only interface for UPI transactions and have their wallets, which most of us do not use. Are you sure you were trying to load eRupee? I have the eRupee wallet which is directly connected to my bank account I can load the money easily but can only transfer it for now to anyone who has the same kind of wallet. Merchants are not accepting the digital version of Ruppe for now maybe they will be later on as it is still a pilot project.   Quote from: Bitcoin Smith on December 03, 2023, 12:49:59 PMIt is supposed to work like that but what the banks are doing is to interlink them in someway to promote the usage of erupee but honestly there is no difference in CBDC from digital money so why government wants to spend extra resources.I am also clueless as to why so much money is being spent on the CBDC project. In a perfect case, it might be to boost International payments for expats based in the Middle East, Europe, and the US. In those regions, SBI has its base and some other government banks. Expats generally use the government banks to transfer money to India I am sure RBI want to move from the SWIFT payment system to CBDC to improve the payment processing time and reduce the fee for transaction.",

Yea, they don't, I'm talking about making payment of fiat money through paytm/google pay to load into eRupee.

Ah, the Demand/Supply ratio. With no merchants the app is essentially useless. Since its a pilot project, this should change in the coming days. Just keep that app installed and check back with the officials to see how things progress.I also got a notification from the Bank's app, but I did not feel like following it up. I can see on play store the ICICI bank's app for the same is thisHas the other banks launched their apps too?",

It's centralized and it would be just like making UPI transactions and payment, will cross border payment transfer without the exorbitant charges be the only difference it would make? DO we really need these when we have lot of payment methods and at the same time there are scams targeting everyone right from villages to metro cities. Wouldn't the scammers like Jamtara group find this as a new bait fill their coffer ever further? These needs to be more awareness and a clear roadmap of pros and cons.",

I still don't get to understand the reason to use it. When you have UPI and wallets why would someone use digital rupee. As of now none of the vendor accept it or I can use it for sending money to anyone. It is better to wait for it to be made accessible to everyone for regular usage.",
