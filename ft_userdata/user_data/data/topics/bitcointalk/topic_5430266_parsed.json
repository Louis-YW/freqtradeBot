  "content": "The improvement has began over times and bitcoin has gone a long way over a decade and more,I don't think we still have to look back at the previous means of exchange that we have, although bitcoin hasn't fully been considered a medium of exchange since it hasn't generally been accepted.Bitcoin supports much lower transaction cost than fiat currencies. And we should also know that bitcoin never sleeps,you can send bitcoin to your relatives or friend anytime,no matter were the person lives and bit coin does settlement in minutes or less,fiat may take a few business days. Another thing about fiat that annoys  me is the need to convert them depending on the country of a friends bank,for instance if u have a friend that lives in india,then u will have to change the currency to INR.Bitcoin is easier to be moved around since it relies upon a digital network for distribution rather than physical storage and transportation of fiat.Bitcoin is very easy to buy,sale and HODL, now there are numerous ways and platforms that people can choose from to buy cryptocurrency.It Is s important for anyone to dance to the tune of their days.Bitcoin is the currency we have for this our modern world,and I expect everyone to HODL bitcoin. We should improvise and improve with how the current currency rebirth is going, I don't expect everyone to HODL shit coin and I dont advice any one to find their way into NFT since its non profitable (non fungible tokens)Am advising everyone to put in their effort and make haste while the sun shine.If everyone could improve as how the currency system has improved,every one will be made to enjoy the privacy, freedom and the uniqueness of cryptocurrency which is based in bitcoin.Regards",
