  "content": "I have just realized a new version of Electrs has been published (https://github.com/romanz/electrs/releases/tag/v0.10.0-rc.1)It is just a RC1 so probably we will have to wait a bit longer for the final release, but it is good project is evolving. I am curious what we may expect in v 0.10, as it is no longer 0.9 patch.Anyone already gave it a chance and installed a new server?",

And no, on the few things I do write I don't put that in there but nobody really reads & uses that code other then me.....-Dave",

The same was with 0.9.0rc1 (Update RocksDB to 6.11.4).By the way I am curious what else we may expect in electrum server, I guess most of the work could be dedicated to the performance improvements only.",
