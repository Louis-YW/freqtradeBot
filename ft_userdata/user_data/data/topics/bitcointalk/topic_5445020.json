  "content": "I was watching a TV programme in one of our local TV channels, it was an interview section/discussion with a certain popular musician as a guest in the studio, soon afterward as the discussion was going on the presenter asked him a particular question to which I found very interesting and absorbing. The question goes like this: \"How do you maintain your private life in the view of public eyes\". So I decided to ponder on this myself and also to  bring same to the forum for forum users to share their thoughts on this, as a bitcoiner, a bitcoin trader or investor how do you maintain your bitcoin life in the view of public eyes?As for me; I keep mine on a low cause personally am someone that love to keep a very small circle  and so I do my things my way not to attract public eyes. I don't post about being a bitcoiner on social media like facebook, Instagram, and rarely talk about it in any gathering except in demanding situation's.  I like it when people have no clue about what I do rather assume things about me than being certain especially not about my financial life which is supposed to be strictly private for me.According to Socrates, \"The unexamined life is not worth living\", so can you take a minute to examine your bitcoin lifestyle in in terms of public view and share with us if you're the private life kind of person or you prefer the public lifestyle of letting almost everyone know you're into bitcoin.Mind you, this is only intended for a discussion purpose.",

A $5 wrench attack can happen to anyone at any point in time, so can a targeted scam attempt. To protect oneself from this, maintain a private outlook when it comes to bitcoin holdings or any investments at all.Quote from: mk4 on March 15, 2023, 03:14:05 PMSure, people respect you a lot more when they know you're well-off, Seems like sycophancy to me.- Jay -",

And only a complete fool will tell everyone right and left that he knows how to buy bitcoins on the stock exchange, bragging about it. To tell how much he earned. Do not confuse it with those good people who dedicate others to cryptocurrencies. The difference is that someone brags, and someone wants to teach others.",

I don’t encourage my friends to use Bitcoin since I don’t want to be blame in case they lose money on many shit scam scheme on crypto.So how’s my Bitcoin lifestyle? So bless in silence.

It is basically a simple rule of thumb, do people go around making it known to everyone how much they have in their bank accounts, or in their safe at home, if they don't, then why should they feel comfortable with a public Bitcoin lifestyle.Having said that, there is a thread by 1miau on why it's important to avoid telling everyone about your crypto holdings, it is a very good read for crypto enthusiasts who are still unsure of whether to shut their mouths about their crypto holdings or not.",

People brag about cryptocurrency so that the less knowledgeable ones will either respect them on hold them in high regards. That’s why you see cryptocurrency chats on people’s social media handles. I see this as a great danger because from my place once you are found to be involved in cryptocurrency people tend to think you are getting lots of money from it and they will also learn. With this mindset of getting rich people come into the space investing way more than they could lose and you hear stories of how people naivety made them broke. Personal it is better to be on a low key since bitcoin hasn’t been globally approved by the government.",

Where it is worse is the fact that you may not know the extent to which that friend who seem interested in your affairs of finance knows or is hiding.Bitcoin lifestyle should be dealt same way. After all, ones lifestyle is reflected by how they spend thier income. If the source of earning your Bitcoin is not legit, or it serves as passive income till you figure out things or you haven't quite figured out the earning part that suits you and you can benefit from fully, why showoff? Until you get to the point or position where you feel comfortable to open up, please do so without fidgeting or stuttering or trying too hard to show everyone you have more money.I really don't make noise or act lavish with the little knowledge I have about Bitcoin, because I am still learning and would love to have gotten to a master merchant stage before even spending my profits accumulated.",

Since I got to know bitcoin and have lived my life side by side with bitcoin, financially all my needs have been met and I have several Bitcoin savings and other assets. Since bitcoin was not very popular until now I have been consistent in continuing to collect bitcoins. Maybe 2018 will be my first peak of success because the price of bitcoin at that time rose drastically and gave me a lot of profit. I remain a private person with my bitcoin work, and don't flaunt what I have too much, because that would also be dangerous.",

If you tell them what you do too especially cryptocurrency you might get in trouble if people know you are holding one. So, I like it to be off the grid from these people since no matter what you say to them they wouldn't understand for sure.Enjoy your life without having no one to know you are enjoying, it means you don't have to tell them your are celebrating your small success.
