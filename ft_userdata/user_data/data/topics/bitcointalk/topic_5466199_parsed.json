What do you think?It can not be useful for me, except the layout is like on desktop. I do use mobile app very well, but I prefer it to like it is in desktop mode. If you can do it like that, it would be good. But as for me, I will prefer to use this forum directly on a browser.",

What do you think?Sorry to ask, but how do we check if there’s any backdoor at your app? I get that we can do that if you make it open source but what about the one that you’re going to upload on App Store? How do we know that you won’t use a different code for that one?It would be a great idea to have an app but if it’s not the official app I won’t bother to use it, I don’t want anything that would out my account info at risk, after all I’m already used to the using browser to access the forum so I don’t think I would be missing out on anything, that’s if you even develop the app.",

However since many of users in this forum are privacy oriented people, you need to create Tor version if you want to reach all users in this forum.",

Maybe you should tell us about your experience first and what you have done in the past. No offense, but I wouldn't be interested in testing an application from a totally unknown person to me where I have to enter my login details. I am sure many other users will agree with me. There is no trust here. Even if you made everything open-source, I don't have the skills to verify the code. I might give it a try maybe after 2-3 years of being available, and after I see the reports of people who know more on this subject than me.",

But, I think that you aren't a developer yourself and you are somehow trying to find the developers for building that app for you. If you are ready to pay some good amount to the developers then you may get some developers in your team. I'm sure that there are many freelance developers who can make that app for you if you have money to pay them. You can find most of those developers on Freelancing sites and if you are lucky then you may find some of the developers on this forum, but still you'll have to pay those developers. I don't think that any of them would work in your team for free.",

Even without demanding credentials it’s already risky enough to download apps nowadays, and certainly not something one should run to, whatever the pretext.Note: Depending on how long your development takes, it may become obsolete pretty soon (a day, a year, a decade … who knows).",

You have raised a good point; background history like the work experience and samples of the OP might help us a lot to build some trust in his skills. But still, we should not judge a book by its cover. And the creation of the BTT app is not something new; many members have tried their best before. Another thing is that all this OP could do is convert this webpage (in desktop view) to a mobile app view. And AFAIK, this has already been done by our beloved community member, Shahzadafzal. But still, I am looking forward to seeing the app, which the OP is promoting here.",
