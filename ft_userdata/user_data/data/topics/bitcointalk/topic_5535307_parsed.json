In any case, if you want a hint or to leave it written down, you can also do it in the same house but in a different place.You're also talking about the average holder, who is likely to have considerably less than 1 bitcoin. In that case, 1 HW and the seed in two different secure locations is more than enough.",

So it's accessible while you remember pm's master password which you probably re-type more often than seed's passphrase.Then you have pm's vault backup on 2 flash drives -> flash memory is not the most reliable -> but it's fine as you have passphrase and the most important passwords on paper too.",

I don't need such unnecessary stress to secure what won't even place me top on the list as one of world's richest men. Even Elon Musk won't have that type of security, storing up his treasures at different locations because he wants to prevent hacks or thefts. I like keeping my stuff simple. Just make sure there are no roving eyes around where you live or store your seeds. That's security enough. It doesn't need one to store up everywhere. What if someone else gains access to any of those places and voids all the safety attempts?Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on March 15, 2025, 10:17:36 AMThe passphrase does not need to be written down, in which case you can rely on your memory, unlike the seeds.I would rather not rely on my memory to remember such a crucial thing. It's better to write it down. Memory can forget, especially if one has so many things competing for one's attention. What if one becomes sick and suffers partial forgetfulness (maybe memory loss), won't that be kissing one's investment goodbye?",

      "body": "My passphrase strategy is to first write it down...but then I will memorize it totally in my head. You can do this by first carefully choosing a good passphrase. But DON'T rely on just your memory at first.A good passphrase should be simple enough for you to memorize, but not too simple that it could be easily guessed by someone else. And not  too complicated that it can be difficult for you to recall from memory.So choose something that is very personal to you, for example the name of your favorite teacher in school + the class that they taught + year of your graduation.It could be the name of your first crush or first girlfriend/boyfriend + where you met, name of your first child and their favorite song, or your first pet and so on.That is why it is called a pass-PHRASE. Using a combination of words and/or numbers that are very personal to you makes it virtually impossible for a hacker to use a dictionary attack to guess your secret phrase. I would say a minimum of two words/numbers and maximum of four words/numbers is adequate for most. Then what you do is write down the passphrase on a piece of paper or other physical medium. Then about once a week or once a month you test yourself to be sure you can recall the passphrase without looking at the answer that you wrote down.Keep doing this self-testing over and over again for a period of several weeks or months until it is so deeply ingrained in your memory that you know it as well as you know your own name, until you feel comfortable enough to permanently discard your written physical backup.Even if you never discard your physical backup you should still practice the self-testing once a day, week or month,so in case you ever lose your physical backup you will still have it ingrained in your memory.",

On that note, it is best to write down pass phrase were you can easily access it whenever the needs arises.
