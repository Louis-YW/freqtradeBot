      "body": "Buying at 60k was not just foolish but it was actually an action that came out of anxiety and those people honestly lost most of it as well and the value came down and now with the feds lowering rates it made things much easier for people to transfer these funds into the banks and with the real estate market, how much would it fall? It won't fall as low as you think at the end of the day it will only fall 5-10% that is also a loads as well I do think you realize that the real estate is not that volatile thus comparing it to Bitcoins would be foolish as well, right now people are investing but most of them are waiting for even lower rates as well.",
