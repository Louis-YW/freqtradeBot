  "content": "Hello all. I have been exploring the Blockchain and I found a few whale addresses containing 1000-6000 BTC that seem to be connected in some way. upon searching theese addresses on bitcoinabuse, some of them seem to have a few reports. I find this very mysterious and I am wondering what these addresses are up to. I also found that all of the addresses are still active. Here's some of the addresses I found: bc1qw8wrek2m7nlqldll66ajnwr9mh64syvkt67zlu - 4103.17259053 BTC3QFtYbR22en2AizTb7JVFA9bL2rf1fbNJr - 6255.97665029 BTCbc1qmxcagqze2n4hr5rwflyfu35q90y22raxdgcp4p - 2988.93455519 BTCbc1quq29mutxkgxmjfdr7ayj3zd9ad0ld5mrhh89l2 - 1361.74526852 BTCbc1q8yja3gw33ngd8aunmfr4hj820adc9nlsv0syvz - 1797.08620625 BTCmore...I didn't search very deep and managed to find all of those addresses that sum-up to 16506.9152708 BTC which equals to 332,548,315$ USDÂ  Does anyone know what this could possibly be? Is it bots trying to \"launder\" Bitcoin?Regards, excro",

      "body": "When you said you explored Bitcoinabuse, I thought was some kind of analytical to look deeply at wallet addresses but it is not the case but there is something we are ignoring which is the website itself. According to Bitcoinabuse website, it is a public website where anyone could report a wallet address that has carried out fraudulent activity and this could be done by anyone because it is free and open to anyone but I also think that the scammers are taking advantage of this website. For example, I viewed the last report when I was on the website https://www.bitcoinabuse.com/reports/bc1q289x3t4ap46xt8dk3q2herzwy0muzpljhfl25j and It was a scammer trying to use that to get victims. Here is the screenshot below:Looking at this comment, you will agree with me that this is a scammer at work and trying to make a report in disguise to scam people who may think that the website link posted in the description could help them when they lost Bitcoin to scammers. I don't know if the admins/owner of that Bitcoinabuse does take care of this spam.",

But I don't think they will care about us when they already have a plan to where they will gonna exactly hide those funds. Some of these people don't really know how to hide their transactions and make it obvious to see they were up to something but whatever that is, I hope it won't negatively affect the crypto market.",
