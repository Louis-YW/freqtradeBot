  "content": "Fenomy started in January 2020, Fenomy System is a sophisticated user-driven decentralized ecosystem with its own Blockchain and a mobile app. The system is built on the principles of a horizontal economy and relationships between people in real life.Fenomy tools include:1. Insuring the safety of family and loved ones;2. Solving various daily tasks through interpersonal horizontal connections;3. Functional economy. Business and social activity of our members;4. Public safety;5. Complete anonymity in interactions between members;How Fenomy worksOur ecosystem is based on loyalty circles. The first circle is formed directly person-to-person, the rest are formed automatically by the ecosystem. Members of the system can create calls to each other. Calls come in different types: emergency or alarm, as well as calls in groups or when working on tasks that members can create them for circles or for groups. All signals in the system go through the nodes, and not directly between the participants. Depending on the type of signal, a certain algorithm is launched.  All the mathematics are done not by the client, but by the system.An important component of the system is the Reputation Center, which is linked to all other components. Each participant in the system has a reputation that affects all possibilities.Problems Fenomy solves:1. The monopoly of government structures and affiliated organizations in the field of citizen and business safety. Low organization of citizens' interaction at the horizontal level in emergency conditions.2. The monopoly on security technology.3. Anonymity of interaction between people while maintaining trust.4. Defining the reputations of people, communities and organizations.5. Communication between client devices in conditions of poor network or complete lack of network. Ensure integrity of incident data.6. System operation without Internet access and with regional Internet access restrictions.7. Timely information for potentially interested participants8. Dependence of traditional social systems on community size. Advantages of our system:1. The ability to work in full anonymity. You do not need to enter any personal data to create a profile. Everything is done in one click. The exchange takes place between the client application and the node in the form of instructions, and not arrays of data.2. Client applications can work offline, accept commands that go to the node, even with a rare and weak Internet connection.3. System activity without Internet access, in a closed local network, if a private node is used.4. The system is completely self-sufficient for each participant. The functionality does not depend on the total number of participants in the system.Fenomy Blockchain- Ensuring the security of operations within the system. Protect accounts against thefts and unauthorized transactions.- The system utilizes the mobile devices of users. The load on computing power is distributed among all participants of the network. - High anonymity of network members and operations.- Setting the importance of transactions.

We do not want the marketing to overpower the technical process.  Now the community is growing naturally, people are registering in the system and help with testing. We hold online and offline gatherings for people interested, joint events with our partners, publish news and information to different media outlets. We already have Chinese, Indonesian, Russian, Arabic groups. Next in line are German and French. As we said we are still in development and moving along as we planned from the beginning.",

      "body": "Fenomy - For Real People in Real LifePersonal safety is an essential need and the basis of a person. When there is a threat to the life and health of our children, family members and friends, everything we consider important becomes meaningless. Providing safety is then our foremost task.According to official data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the UK, about 300,000 people go missing every year. In the US and EU, that number goes up to 600,000 people who are declared missing every year. A significant proportion of them are children. We also must remember that not every single case is accounted for.The Fenomy developers’ main goal was to create an efficient information tool, primarily for situations where help is needed, when there is a real threat to life and health.We provide different tools for different situations, which include:— The ALARM function on Fenomy app, available for the most common Android devices;— Automatic data collection of the location and battery level of the device that activated the alarm;— Maximum battery saving in alarm mode;— Triggering an alarm and accumulating data OFFLINE, transferring information to the data processing center using a special protocol, even in case of a short-term weak network signal;— Ability to send short messages to the data center;— Notifying everyone who agrees to receive requests by triggering an alarm;— Transferring information in real time and tracking movement on the map when accepting a request;Another special feature allows you to request the location of any first-circle user at any time, even if an alarm is not triggered. This feature is available if you have given personal permission for such requests when establishing a connection.A user can allow their parents, partner, and/or close friends to request their location.Our work never stops, and we are only moving forward!A comprehensive industry solution for partners based on the Fenomy ecosystem for the organization of safety and security in a natural environmentThe Fenomy ecosystem has become the base for safety and security management, as well as participant coordination, in a series of international events held in a remote wildlife environment with complex terrain covering an area of more than 100,000 square meters.The series' first and largest event will take place in June 2023. The main trail is more than 1,200 kilometers long, making it one of the world's longest and most difficult extreme races in 2023.The development team is working with the partner's company to complete the main components so that the ecosystem's full capabilities can be used at the event.The primary solutions are as follows:— Incident Control Center for the entire area— Tracking of participant moments in real time— Setting off emergency alarms (manual or automatic)— Route notifications for participants— Safety perimeter— Satellite communication on the route's most dangerous sectionsIt's encouraging to know that, despite being in its early stages, the Fenomy System is gaining traction in the most important field—safety in real life.Great trust comes with great responsibility.Preparation has already begun. During this time, the system will be subjected to extensive development and debugging of the most essential tools and solutions. This, in turn, will increase project awareness and the possibility of forming new partnerships in the present and future, as well as attract a new audience to the project.Success in this partnership is a significant step toward new solutions and opportunities, and thus new accomplishments.We will keep the community informed of our progress and preparations for this and future events.You can find the official article here: https://helpdesk.fenomy.com/knowledge/details/144/industry-solution-for-the-organization-of-safety-aFenomy CirclesThe Fenomy ecosystem consists of circles and are a vital component. So, what exactly are they? And how do they function?Fenomy circles are real, not virtual, and reflect real-life connections between people.The first circle is formed by making direct personal contact with others via mobile devices or by exchanging special codes. Your family, friends, and coworkers make up the first circle. In a nutshell, it will include everyone you personally know and with whom you have established a mutual connection using the system tools.The second circle is made up of people who are connected to you through the first circle. Many of them you probably know and trust, so you can promote them to your first circle through personal contact if you like.The third and fourth circles are formed using the same principles.The data center, not the user, forms the second, third, and fourth circles based on the exchange of connections between all system users.All system interactions take place within the circles.The Alarm FunctionThe “Alarm” function is an essential tool in the Fenomy ecosystem, intertwined with numerous other tools and functions.The “Alarm” can be used not only by individual system users, but also in the “Group” tool in all categories, “People's dispatch,” and the safety perimeter tool.When a member activates the “Alarm,” or “Emergency call,” the device from which the call was sent enters power saving mode and begins collecting data on the device's movement and tracking cellular signals.Even if you have poor to no cellular reception, the Fenomy app can collect and send the accumulated data to the DPS (data processing server) in small packages using a special protocol.If an “Alarm” is triggered without an active internet connection, the app will wait for the network and immediately send the accumulated data to the server with the most recent relevant coordinates and information. If there is a stable internet connection, Fenomy will share the entire movement track from the moment the “Alarm” was triggered.When the server receives an “Alarm,” the system notifies those in the first circle and those who have agreed to receive alarms from the second to fourth circles, as well as the “People's dispatch,” if the member who triggered the “Alarm” has that option selected, and their groups.* The system is fully customizable for any system member.Everyone who receives an “Emergency call” notification can see where and how far the source is, as well as an option of sending an accompanying text message.Both the person in need of assistance and those who accept the “Alarm” will see useful information on how to act in the given circumstances, to provide or receive assistance as soon as possible.When recipients are ready to assist, they press “Accept call” and are automatically connected to information updates from the “Alarm” source. The requester’s movements are displayed in the Fenomy app, as well as how many people have accepted the “call,” how far they are, and coordinate on how they can best help.The Fenomy Group tool - a powerful way to organize safety and communication The Fenomy \"Group\" tool is a strong tool for managing and organizing people and smart devices to tackle a wide range of cooperative tasks. In Fenomy, there are many forms of \"Groups\" such as Companies (both public and private), Associations that can only be private, and Groups that only have a public status and the option of being temporary. Members of all group types are not required to have a pre-existing relationship with one another and may remain anonymous.We will tell you about the \"Group\" tool using examples that users are interested in.You can find the official article in the link below:https://medium.com/fenomy/the-fenomy-group-tool-a-powerful-way-to-organize-safety-and-communication-5afe475e6ca0Safe ModeA safe mode for your personal profile in the system will be available in upcoming updates.Safe mode will allow the profile owner to:- Protect the right of the profile owner to perform sensitive transactions such as editing personal and contact information, creating groups, sending messages, triggering alarms, and making transactions.- Prevent profile theft as a result of criminal activity.To switch your profile to safe mode, you must have the mobile app that allows you to change the modes.When you switch to safe mode, the application will connect to the Fenomy Blockchain, register the first block in the network, and do so 4 to 8 times per day.The profile's owner must also specify a cool down period ranging from 3 to 90 days, as well as the types of operations that will be subject to additional network verification.How does safe mode work?When performing sensitive transactions, a special request to the network is made to verify each operation.Following receipt of an operation request for verification, the network will send a confirmation request to the device that originated the oldest block source code, which should be older than the established cool down period.When the source code and age of the block are confirmed, the operation is validated and the right to perform it is confirmed.The operation is not carried out if there is no block source code on the device.What this providesIn the event that the secret code is stolen or lost, a person with criminal intent will be unable to perform operations using the profile in question during the cool down period, and the true owner will be able to change the secret code and retrieve the account.Any suspicious transaction attempts from the profile will be reported to the owner.Nuances- When safe mode is enabled, authorization in the web application without the mobile app is impossible.- Only while online will you be able to make changes to your profile. Offline, only emergency functions are available.- The application's permissions must be enabled at all times.- If the main device is replaced, the owner must wait for the entire cool down period that they established when setting up safe mode before being able to perform operations with his own profile.Incident Control CenterWe are currently preparing the Incident Control Center (IC2) for use at public events, in nature, and in urban settings.The Incident Center will allow you to keep track of all events in your circles and groups, set up safety perimeters, coordinate between participants/devices, accept requests, and complete other tasks.The Incident Control Center Only will only be accessible through the web app.Here is a visual representation of the IC2: https://i.postimg.cc/yd2hnnw7/image.pngUse case: Fenomy for the elderly and people with disabilitiesAs you may be aware, the Fenomy ecosystem can be used for a variety of purposes; today, we will look at how the system can help the elderly and people with disabilities by ensuring a better quality of life, safety, and a quick response if assistance is required.The Fenomy ecosystem enables you to effectively monitor the condition and needs of the elderly and people with disabilities, informing the appropriate agencies or people and monitoring the help-giving services.The Incident Control Center allows you to track the location and activity of the elderly and people with disabilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Older people and people with disabilities will be able to send a request for assistance to all responsible individuals and organizations at the same time with a single button press or voice command.You can set up a safety perimeter for each individual. If the perimeter is left unattended, an alarm is automatically triggered.An automatic alarm can be sent if a person is inactive for an extended period of time.Assistance in organizing search and rescue operations if the person is elderly or disabled, disoriented, lost, or in other cases.Senior citizens and people with disabilities will be able to create one-time/regular visits and orders for responsible organizations, people, and other groups.The system will be able to function without the use of a smartphone. A simple push-button phone/bracelet or other solutions, such as satellite navigation, are sufficient.Use case: Natural parks and nature reservesA single dispatch center enables park managers to track the movements of all visitors and personnel, receive incident alerts, coordinate interactions, and send messages.Visitors will be able to autonomously and automatically register their stay at the territory at any entry point using QR scanning or code exchange, outline their stay period, and approximate path even lacking a network connection.Creating a safety perimeter—the boundaries of locations where visitors are permitted or discouraged from entering.This would allow visitors to receive automatic notifications about boundary violations and potential threats even when there is no active connection. The dispatch center, rangers, and personnel will get information concerning border breaches.Visitors will be able to call headquarters to ask questions or send an emergency alert.If a visitor's information is not updated for an extended period of time, the visitor remains motionless, or the declared stay period is exceeded, an alarm will automatically be triggered.Special equipment can be used to deliver telemetry and alarm signals over satellite communication channels.Ecosystem Component “Safety Perimeter”Designed to define the boundaries of territories to which specific rules and actions can be applied automatically.Perimeters are system entities that can be associated with other entities such as groups, circles, and tasks. Each perimeter has geographic coordinates, descriptions, conduct rules, and a set of system reactions.Perimeters can be set to “enter” and “exit” mode.When all the set conditions are met, such as crossing a border of a set perimeter or approaching an object, a system reaction is triggered, which can be a warning, an informational message, or automatically triggering an alarm, which is displayed in the Incident Control Center. These will appear as pop-ups on the user's mobile screen, with alerts that correspond to the form of the notification. The perimeters are stored on the client device and work offline without Internet access.The Groups component is currently being tested alongside the Safety Perimeter component. The component will be available for personal circles and tasks in the near future.Perimeters can also be used to manage the operations of security systems at facilities that use electronic unmanned devices and sensors.System images available below:https://i.postimg.cc/zXLLV39x/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/4NJYQB7F/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/C1F7gbrP/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/L8K0WgS7/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/52KpVHWb/image.pngUse Case: Mass event coordination and law enforcement services In a bid to enhance workplace efficiency, employees are now able to coordinate field activities seamlessly. This is made possible through the exchange of location data and the creation and coordination of tasks. The new system allows for better field coordination among employees, ultimately leading to improved productivity.The system allows for monitoring and overseeing of events through a single dispatch center or via a mobile device from anywhere within the event area. This technology provides event organizers with greater flexibility and control, enabling them to manage their events more effectively and efficiently. With this system, event staff can stay connected and informed, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and that any issues are addressed promptly.The system facilitates rapid event registration, allowing participants to quickly sign up through QR code scanning or code exchange. This streamlined process eliminates the need for lengthy registration forms and reduces wait times for attendees.At the event, it is possible for participants to receive signals from other participants.In a move to streamline communication, the features of the platform that allow for bulk notifications to be sent to all participants. This will save time and effort for those who need to distribute information to a large group of people.The registration process allows for payment to be accepted at the time of registration.",

      "body": "Fenomy BlockchainThis video (https://www.veed.io/view/b9cf6a2f-c6f4-4c41-948d-5ebb6ee017af?sharingWidget=true&panel=share) demonstrates how a test transaction works.Each formed but uncompleted transaction has only a hash1. Following the successful completion of the transaction, hash 2 is formed, which is the transaction's final hash.Multiple operations can be contained within a single transaction. The number of operations is determined by the type of transaction.Operations of the same type are accumulated over a set time and added to the transaction.The transaction can include text, media, or documents, among other things.In this example, we see nine p2p operations with the importance parameter set to normal.Blocks that meet the requirements are chosen for the transaction and displayed in the left column using a special random \"set of sets\" sampling algorithm.The hash of a successfully validated block by its creator is displayed in the left column.And in the right, the fact that the block has been validated, in turn, necessitates verification by other network members.Blocks that have not been validated by a certain time are marked as invalid.The changes in the transaction status happen in real-time. The Fenomy Blockchain uses our algorithm to randomly sample \"sets of sets\" This algorithm is used for, but is not limited to:— block selection for a transaction from the total number of blocks that satisfy the transaction conditions— select a transaction hive when creating a new transaction— block selection for confirmation by network participants— in the process of block validation confirmation— when selecting workersWe'll explain in plain English, without using complex mathematical formulas.The sampling algorithm works by converting hash codes to decimal numbers.The algorithm has the property that when a random sample is required, the source data for generating a group of random values does not yet exist and cannot be interpreted in advance.The system uses the hash code, which will appear on the network after the operation begins, to execute the algorithm. Furthermore, a procedure is carried out to re-hash the received hash code as well as the operation's start time with accuracy down to a millisecond.At the same time, the procedure for obtaining a group of random numbers within a given range does not yield element endpoint IDs, but rather temporary IDs of elements within indexes that are not constant for each element and change frequently.In other words, the network obtains random values to produce the «sets of sets» sample, from the future.How it works:— at input, we receive the following data: the sha512 hash code, the transaction conditions, the range of values  for the index ID— a mathematical transformation of sha512 into a decimal series, obtaining a massive number.— a mathematical formula is used to convert the obtained value into the desired range.— the iteration is repeated the required number of times, converting the old hash code into a new one at each iteration.— a set of obtained index ID’s is used to obtain a set of elements.The algorithm has been successfully tested and implemented into the network.",

The team is making it easier for non-English speakers to research the ecosystem and learn more in a language that is convenient for them.It is now easier to communicate with the team through the @fenomy_bot, as well as join the ambassador program and complete tasks in Spanish.23/12/2022Ambassador ProgramThe Fenomy Ambassador Program is now fully operational, with tasks of different levels and different monetary rewards. The program is completely integrated into the Fenomy Bot (https://t.me/fenomy_bot), where you can ask questions to the team, view tasks in six languages, send task reports, and view your ambassador FNM balance. When new tasks are uploaded, the ambassador is notified via bot. Tasks can be approved/rejected automatically or manually.To become an ambassador, you must first complete three entry-level tasks. All tasks are gamified, with various levels and quests to complete along the way. The highest-paying tasks will be for testing system tools and other components.With a small amount of FNM on your ambassador account, you will be able to withdraw the funds earned from this program to your main account. By taking part in the program, you will become a part of the team and our rapidly expanding community, as well as help spread the world about the Fenomy project and improve the system.We welcome all members of our community to join the ambassador program.23/12/2022 Public Safety - Use CasesAs we continue to fill the information section of our Partner page we have added new use cases concerning public safety in natural environments, volunteer assistance and event coordination.Each use case relates to partner projects that are in the works at the present moment and actively being developed for industry specific uses.We will continue to add more use cases in the future as we move further with our partner projects.Learn more on our Partner page (https://fenomy.com/i/partner/).28/12/2022NFT Management The management of NFTs will not be a separate component, but will be integrated into the Fenomy Blockchain-based Document Management System.The first NFTs to be added to the public tracker were investment NFTs. NFT pens and Partner NFT cards will be available in the near future.Anyone can check an NFT by entering the Fenomy ID in the unified form at the bottom of the website, but only the NFT's owner can activate it and change its parameters.Because all document operations require the Blockchain, access to full NFT management capabilities will be available only after the Fenomy Blockchain is launched, which is expected soon.Some settings are temporarily unavailable due to the aforementioned reasons.Document creation and management, including NFTs, will also be available through your personal account.15/03/2023Fenomy RoadmapThe Roadmap, which has been in place since 2020, has become obsolete and redundant for the project. This does not apply to the Fenomy ecosystem components and solutions that have been planned or are currently being developed. Only the implementation schedule's priorities have changed.The company's workload distribution is set up in such a way that a fully functional product is ready for hands-on use as soon as possible, which necessitates a redistribution of forces in favor of more important tasks at this time. We are currently concentrating on upcoming events and the most pressing needs of partner organizations that will use Fenomy in their work and activities.We are currently working on a variety of components in our workflow to prepare the necessary application solutions, including those that were planned for 2024 and 2025 and even those that were not on the Roadmap at all.Likewise, we believe that determining the timing of implementation in relation to umbrella solutions, rather than individual components, is preferable.Furthermore, we are currently determining how to visualize a map of the system's components so that everyone can get a sense of what will be implemented.We will be announcing the following news and updates soon:— Secure Blockchain and its related tools and capabilities.— A new mobile application version.— Groups and Coordination tools.— Incident Control Center.We carry out updates regularly that go unnoticed, but are no less important.We will keep you up to date on all updates and events via our official media channels.15/03/2023 Language Update - PortugueseThe Fenomy web app now supports Portuguese.

Everything is functioning right now, and the system is stable.Since the beginning of development, this is the first time that ecosystem tools have been used when all the major components are involved and where the ecosystem's capabilities are used in a single complex together with other security measures.We will continue to publish updates.05/06/2023",
