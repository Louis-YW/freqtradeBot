It's just a local dealer initiative and is supported by friendly regulations, not a directive from head office.If you are outside the US, maybe you won't see anything similar because crypto regulations in your country are different.",

The thread actually cites binance as its source, but this doesn’t in any way mean that it is true because the news is spread on the forum. The forum members could Also see random news of a thing and decide to post here. But in position of this maybe it is true, if not we would soon here the company debunking it. Here is the forum thread link  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5468912.msg62934604#msg62934604. You can join the discussion there and lock this your own thread.

Japan has been one of the leaders in this space as this is not the first auto company to start accepting crypto. Also buying cars with crypto is nothing new on secondary markets or even some 3rd party providers. Its only kind of \"novel\" for the large companies but im guessing it will become more and more normalized as adoption increases.",

Most automobile companies are looking to be creative and will do anything to keep trending and what better way to do that than to announce you now accept payment in Bitcoin? I mean this won't have raised much eyebrows if it were a company like say Ford or Tesla right? Some will view this as a positive for Bitcoin and an ever evolving move of digital finance, I call bull. They will not hesitate to scrap off the option once Bitcoin experiences a heavy price decline. And also, it would be nice if the Op locked the thread as more users have clearly pointed out that a topic has already been opened in the Economics board.",

Honda has not announced anything about it on their US website and has not provided any press releases.The most reliable link was provided by Binance, but the problem is that Honda did not accept payments in Bitcoin directly, as happened with Tesla when it used BTCPAYSERVER to conduct transactions and bought Bitcoin, but rather through FCF Pay, which is listed on the BNB network.The news may be misleading because FCF Pay and Binance are the beneficiaries of this news, and this acceptance means that Bitcoin will be converted into dollars in their bank accounts and fees will be charged accordingly.This explains why they accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, Doge, Shiba Inu + many more!Japanese Automobile Giant Honda Now Accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum As Payment Methods",

That's really impressive, a new fellow is clearly following some decent tips, to improve the post-quality that really nice to see as most of the time newbies ignore the suggestions.Quote from: headingnorth on October 04, 2023, 06:11:18 AM__SNIP__OP I haven't heard of it as a big acceptance by the automobile industry towards Bitcoin can really make some notice off. But currently, I haven't heard of it, at least on the mainstream crypto media or CT. So I can be sure there must be something wrong with this news presentation.Anyway, a couple of more hours can clarify it as well, but from the latest post, I can be sure that Yamane_Keto  makes sense in the current situation. But for more, we need to wait. I'm not excited about it as ETF approval can bring something next level until that, what the shit SEC are you planning for   , clarify.",

Sales of all the other expensive goods are far not this scale. There are many specific expensive things for business: tools, hi-tech devices, machines, even the whole enterprises, but only a car and a house are bought by nearly everyone (even regardless of the region: the only difference is that in poor regions most people buy cheaper cars or cheaper types of transport, and houses of lower quality). So, increasing adoption level will let people buy cars directly with btc at some point... I don't know whether Honda is really going to sell cars for crypto right now, but the general market development goes this way.",
