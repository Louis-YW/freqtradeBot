CasperExposing FBI and U.S. District Court Doublespeak, Intimidation, and Collusion - U.S. v. Crater, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 19-cr-10063Doublespeak is powerful.Edward S. Herman, in his book Beyond Hypocrisy, describes the principal characteristics of doublespeak:“What is really important in the world of doublespeak is the ability to lie, whether knowingly or unconsciously, and to get away with it; and the ability to use lies and choose and shape facts selectively, blocking out those that don’t fit an agenda or program.“Throughout our expose series on the U.S. vs Crater case, we’ve shown the lengths that government agencies - the #FBI, #DOJ, #SEC, and the #CTFC - will go to in an effort to win at any cost: witness intimidation, suppression of information, lies by omission, and simply making things up… it’s all fair game.In this special supplemental edition, we’ll get to know FBI Special Agent David Cirilli and Judge Denise J. Casper better, and why what they’ve said and done proves how deep the rabbit hole goes.For more information go to: https://sherloc.substack.com/p/us-government-exposed-us-vs-crater-9b1Podcasts available at: https://shelocwarroom.podbean.com/",
