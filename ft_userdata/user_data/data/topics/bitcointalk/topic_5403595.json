The Binance adress I gave you was just out of curiosity to see how much \"illegal\" BTCs are stored in their cold wallet.Until 5-7 all's safe, it may be just of the possible look of a mixer service if identified method. Between 5-25, the proximity of a reported input is too close to be sure of a change of ownership or the address may be part of the same wallet. For further knowledge, any evil score over 25 may create serious problem while dealing with cex's.Unfortunately, my formula doesn't cover so well between 50-100 evil points, it will jump fast from 30-45 to 100, as there is no half evil as I see it.The address from Binance had a 100 evil score.",

This I will say that you are the first to have got engaged in this task. You claimed to have access as you have stated earlier \"As now I have access to a database of over 40k btc addresses, 100k eth addresses and 2.5k trx addresses\"Â  and I am very much curious in knowing and having knowledge of how you came about all these addresses, where you got them ? And how were you able to conclude that these addresses are involved in a money laundering activities. I would want you to tell us about your existence, do you belong to any antigraft, or any national security organization in your country because am I certainly sure they do this activities. We need explanations.",
