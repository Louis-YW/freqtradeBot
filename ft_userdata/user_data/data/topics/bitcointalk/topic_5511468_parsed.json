  "content": "The Patoshi pattern displays Satoshi's mining activities, and recently a bitcoin researcher Wicked has explored it again, and discovered some fascinating debatable facts that happened in 2009. However, one undebatable fact is that Satoshi integrated a non standard iteration of the ExtraNonce, that changed how data was embedded on the blockchain. The diagram below, indicates Satoshi's mining actions in yellow.        Furthermore, the debate began where he claimed that Satoshi launched several 51% attack on the network, intentionally or accidentally. Backing it up with 23 - 25 may event, between block 15323 and 15324, the entire network went off for 25 hours and was rebooted, then it took another 8 hours before anybody else connected. In explanation, wicked suggests that Satoshi's node went offline in the afternoon of may 22nd, and the few online nodes mined a little, so Satoshi's node came back online and began where it stopped, and before it could reconnect to the other nodes, it has mined more blocks than all of them combined, then reorged all theirs to his own heavier chains. Subsequently, after too many suggestion from bitcoiners, he went ahead (using the diagram above) to say that Satoshi may have been testing out the network against 51% attack between 19th to 25th may. Contrarily, Jameson lopp, added that the miners may have lost internet connection, which caused the mining software to freeze because no peers was connected. Finally, if it's true he was doing it on purpose, he would have sent out mails to developers, but they were only Satoshi and Martti Malmi AKA Sirius at that time, and an email like that have not surfaced the internet till date. What do you think happened on the blockchain during these periods?https://x.com/i/status/1841157281125118280 a 20 mins video on Patoshi pattern.",

For that reason, it took a few days to mine the first block after the Genesis Block. If Satoshi's node was online, and nobody was connected, then the network was there on block zero (called \"block one\" at that time, it was changed later).Also note, that to have a successful connection, someone has to accept incoming connections. If everyone is just trying to make a new outgoing connection, then nobody is connected.Another thing is that mining requires burning some CPU power. Coins were worthless at that time. The client does not mine anything by default, if nobody is connected.To understand it better, you can try to mine something in testnet4. If you would have some CPU-mined block, then you cannot immediately consider your own block as \"valid\". You wait for other users, to start building new blocks, on top of what you mined, to make sure, that at least someone else also accepts your coins. Because if not, then you can easily create a long chain of invalid blocks.",

It was just a simple block counting. So, putting more power did nothing. Instead, it was all about hitting more blocks.2. He had a prenet, where he could produce 20-bit difficulty blocks, so he could test chain reorganizations here, if needed.3. Doing tests on live network would discourage a lot of users. Imagine you join the system, mine some blocks, they are confirmed, and suddenly, someone destroys all of that. If you consider, that even then, six confirmations were considered quite safe, then it would hurt a reputation of Bitcoin, if users would witness some deeper reorgs.4. Deeper reorgs were discussed in details, for example Value Overflow Incident. So, such attacks would be also discussed as well, even on some mailing list, if forum was not yet there.",

Any block is accepted, as long as it passes consensus rules (MTP = Median Time Past of the last 11 blocks; two hours rule, and so on).QuoteSatoshi won't wait for others to connect before he'll continue miningWhy not? Even if you assume, that Satoshi=Patoshi, then still, it was possible to mine much more coins, if that person would try to get the maximum amount of blocks. However, this is not the case. There are many hints, leading to a conclusion, that Patoshi miner was simply turned off, after reaching specific conditions: https://blog.lopp.net/was-satoshi-a-greedy-miner/#sleeping-satoshiQuoteThere's an odd aspect to the timing distribution of blocks mined by Satoshi: they don't follow the distribution that we would expect from a miner that spends 100% of their time mining. In fact, they practically NEVER mined back-to-back blocks that were less than 5 minutes apart! A simple explanation is that they paused their miner for 5 minutes after mining a block.See? So, even if you assume, that Satoshi went offline, and mined a secret chain, and reorged many blocks, then you should see those patterns after his chain was published. However, this is not the case.Quotehe could mine alone with two computers running on different nodesThen, you would see Double Helix on an extra nonce charts. However, even if they are present, then they happened at different times, so this is not the case (blocks 1400-1916 were mined in January 2009).",
