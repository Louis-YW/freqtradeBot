  "content": "Curve.com allows users to add multiple cards and select the currency the card is in. When you make a purchase, Curve then uses the interbank rates to settle the FX rate. So for example if you have a card in USD, you load it with USDT and use it in UK then your card company will add a markup which is normally around 2.5-3% on the FX rate. By using Curve this goes down to 0%. Therefor we can find cards with lowest funding fees and the FX rate does not matter really as Curve will provide real interbank rates here.I tried to add advcash virtual card but Curve declined it saying they do not accept Prepaid cards. I tried another card also but Curve gave same error. Does anyone know which crypto cards are supported by Curve? Anyone using this setup successful? Was thinking cards like:Nuri, wirex, plutus, CDC, Trastra, Monolith, ? Are any of these supported or does Curve not work with them?How can we found out before signing up for any card if its supported or not?",

I suspect that when I finally will receive a response it will most likely be an automated pre-written reply which does not even answer my question. Anyone else have this setup or know of similar company that can offer this? I think it's a great solution and surprised not more people here use it to get rid of all FX fees. Saves a lot!",
