  "content": "There is a lot of talk about how Bitcoin mining incentivises the creation of cheaper energy, but what is not often talked about is how it also incentivises the creation of cheaper computation.I've been thinking a lot about theoretical limits to the efficiency of computation as it relates to Bitcoin.I had assumed that Bitcoin miners would soon approach theoretical limits of computational efficiency in the context of hash power.Maybe within an order of magnitude I thought.As it turns out, we are nowhere near the theoretical limit of computational efficiency:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principleI'm sure there are practical limits I am not aware of - e.g. lower limits of feature size of semiconductors probably impose a relatively hard limit on computational efficiency.Someone here probably knows the calcs for the practical limits of computational efficiency with conventional semiconductor technology.In any case, it is reassuring to know that we have a long way to go yet.To think that Bitcoin could be a strong driving force to improve the efficiency of computer hardware is very exciting to me.Just a thought I wanted to share with you folks.",

As a comparation, altcoins may have been driving GPUs into getting more powerful, but Bitcoin.. I don't know...And about the cheaper energy, Bitcoin indeed can (and should!) get people and companies invest into renewable electricity sources, since sooner or later only the mining with free electricity may remain profitable. Will this make people and companies expand their use of free electricity to everything else? I don't know, I wouldn't be so sure, since the mining facilities will probably be away from the place they're living and transporting that electricity around may or may not worth it. Plus, let's be honest, people are generally lazy. They need quite a push to do the right move and Bitcoin alone may not be the one in this case. Maybe the energy war though.",

      "body": "I think industrial crypto mining operations utilizing GPU's, are similar to an IT datacenter. We have seen in past years where surplus datacenter computation was dedicated to mining bitcoin. And the opposite was also true. Mining ops that were no longer profitable after rewards halving were converted into IT datacenters. Nations like iceland used local cold weather in an effort to save on server costs. This opened the door to crypto mining ops and datacenters industries flocking to their country. In addition to this, rising demand on GPUs fueled by crypto mining likely incentivized AMD, nvidia and others to produce in higher volumes to keep GPUs affordable for gamer markets. Which could have in turn provided semiconductor manufacturers with greater profits and revenue to expand their existing operations.The same positive precedents might also apply to ASICs even though they're optimized more for pure cryptographic operation rather than FLOPs. But yes I think it is fair to say that bitcoin mining did incentivize the expansion of semiconductor production and distribution throughout the world. Which is something we can all be thankful for.",
