BTC could go as low as $18K to $15K during that span. I don't know where the price is going to stabilize though. It will be nice if BTC could bounce above $25K and stay around that level for months but I'm not that optimistic. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Right now, the bears seems exhausted pushing the price further.",

They have enough money that they don't need crypto support. But as the world is moving towards the future, crypto or some digital asset will be the main currency in that future. But as we know, old is gold. So any new currency will have hard time to get accepted by people. In which case, crypto will have the best chance to stand it's ground. So it is safe to say that there will be some bump on the road, but this isn't the reason to lose hope.Quote from: Flyingjack123 on June 15, 2022, 02:07:16 AMHow long will this market correction will continue and where will this stop.. and where will Bitcoin stabalizeHard to say. Could take years or more than that. But it will rise again and stabilize, that's for sure. So just buy the dip and forget about it for 2/3 years or so. Come back after that and i'm sure you'll find yourself in a good place. [DYOR][NOTE: not your financial advisor]",

Base on what happen, we can say that it might be at least 371 days or more than 371 days before it will start to recover again. Maybe don't focus on that part and just focus on accumulating while everything is down. Take note that profits are being made mostly in a bear market.Stabilization of Bitcoin? Nahhh you're dreaming right? Bitcoin will never stabilize because many consider it as an asset and assets are volatile in nature.",

Do you think only crypto is affected? Look at the global stock markets! Today morning I looked at my stock portfolio and it mostly in red except some well performing companies. My crypto portfolio is also in red except ETH which I acquired at $450 range. So the global market is crashing. It's not only cryptocurrency. So I don't bother what others are saying and what theory is being invented, crypto is here to stay for our lifetime! So I am indeed acquiring more bitcoin as per the limit of my pocket. Crypto winter usually lasts for 3 years as seen in the previous instance but no one really knows what will be the reality this time. Also I agree to Bill gates on NFT. It is indeed a scammer's tool and a playground for money launderers. So NFT may go down to drain rightfully, but crypto is indeed going through a bad time like any other markets and it is the best time to invest in.",

If it is, you should worry. Like when you hold stocks of a car company and the company stops making cars because one of its factories went up in flames or there's a war in the country where it produces, it's time to sell. In case of Bitcoin there's nothing wrong with it. Its price went down due to Luna dump that caused panic and because of high inflation in the USA that causes stocks to lose value and stock investors are selling everything they hold including cryptocurrencies. It doesn't mean cryptocurrencies are bad, it's just investors going bust and selling at at a loss to cover debt. I keep holding and I'm going to continue, regardless of the price. If it goes to 10k, I'll still have the same number of coins that I had at 30k. None of these prices satisfy me enough to sell.",

Of course there is always a chance that some super good news will appear and reverse the trend, but apart from the possible approval of the spot BTC ETF in the US about which there is some speculation, I do not see any light at the end of the tunnel in the short term.Quote from: LogitechMouse on June 15, 2022, 05:13:54 AMI don't know what is Greater-Fool Theory but for me, I will be a fool if I will follow what Bill Gates will say that relates to crypto.After being left alone in a house with 18 bathrooms, he began to demand more and more public attention, so he talks about a lot of things he has no idea about - but he seems to be most interested in a pandemic, not one that lasts, but a new one that will be a little more efficient in terms of depopulating the world.",

Cryptocurrency relies a large part of trust and simultaneously Bitcoin has been extremely volatile in recent history so it is a bit of a paradox. It seems to be a good short term tool for transferring good chunks of money around, potentially across borders, but due to it's instability it was never going to be a good long term investment. In some ways Bill Gates is right, for speculators they are only able to profit if the prices goes up between the time they buy and sell, otherwise they are destined to lose money as it doesn't produce anything in the meantime (unlike a company stock/share that pays out a portion of profits in different forms).",
