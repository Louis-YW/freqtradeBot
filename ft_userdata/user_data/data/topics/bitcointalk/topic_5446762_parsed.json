      "body": "WixVPS just labelled me a hacker, because they saw email extractor software and power grep for searching through large files. I wonder how they think every business in the world gets their b2b Leads.I am an honest upwork freelancer but wixvps is hoping i'm a hacker so they can justify shutting down my RDP server without a refund.Now they are giving me 20 minutes to download my files, with zero refund. whoever is doing your risk assessment needs to lay off the weed and visit upwork.com's lead generation section  https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?q=lead%20generationSTOP PROFILING YOUR CLIENTS Maybe if you had hired me instead of profiling me you wouldn't have just 50 customers.",
