The fact you cannot even spell correctly no matter what altcoin's name (and no matter how its price will evolve) shows the deep extent of the knowledge you're sharing with us.",

However, your exaggeration of the price history is easy to disprove, by checking the price history via charts, and thus any credibility that you might have had would've shot right up. Honestly though, if you're panicking because at the moment you're losing money, my advice would be to hang in there. I know you might be questioning your belief in Bitcoin at this moment, when its taking a dive, but if you look at why Bitcoin should, and has been successful it should restore some faith on why it'll return to higher amounts than it currently is.",

Lol, kidding aside, of course, if you are a smart investor then you can sell your bitcoin right now and then enter later when the price is in the $20k'ish.However, for those who have been worst, not sure if they are rattled by this price action. On the contrary, they are going to scoop a lot of bitcoin from those who are selling because of panic. So still a win-win situation no matter what.And at $21k? capitulation, but then again as I have said, golden opportunity.",

The fact you cannot even spell correctly no matter what altcoin's name (and no matter how its price will evolve) shows the deep extent of the knowledge you're sharing with us.The funny thing is, if anyone actually believes that bitcoin could be 21k, they could get rich beyond our wildest dreams if they are right. Just get as high of a leverage as you can, the max I have seen so far was 150x if I am not wrong but if you can find bigger, just find it. Sell all the possessions you ever have, sell all of them, for half of the price, fraction of the price if you have to, then put it on that leverage.If you are right, and the price goes from 30k to 20k, then you will make so much money that you wouldn't even believe t, a few thousand would turn into a million, all of your possessions would probably worth more than a few thousand, so you will be multi millionaire very very easily, maybe like even hundred million if you have a lot.",
