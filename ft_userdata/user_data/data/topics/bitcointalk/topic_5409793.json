When there is a shortage of Bitcoin and an increase in demand, the price will rise.

Price of Bitcoin is not solely depended on Supply and Demand but seriously depends on price manipulation, forced liquidations. If you don't believe me, you can check price spikes with high trading volume, within those times Supply and Demand is not a main factor but pressure from forced liquidations on exchanges are.",

However, 1% seems too small to me because it would amount to only about 80 million people considering that the current number of people on earth is about 8 billion.I will share a link with a lot of interesting information for those who might be interested in this -> How Many People Own & Hold Bitcoin?",

Only a minority percentage of the population understands and invests in Bitcoin.Also, Bitcoin is not valuable cause its price tends to rise more than it falls, leading to an appreciating pattern; Its price appreciates cause it is valuable.This mean that people get into bitcoin (or at least used to) cause it had qualities that attracted investors, and hence its price rose. Like any speculative asset, after the price rose remarkably, lots of people fomoed in.Quote from: autumnleaf on August 14, 2022, 05:01:57 AMThis may have been discussed many times but I believe also that Demand and Supply are the two main factors that affect Bitcoin pricing.Demand and supply are the two main factors of any market.",

When there is a shortage of Bitcoin and an increase in demand, the price will rise.There is no doubt that demand and supply is what determines the price of any asset but the real question is what factors affect the demand and/or supply and cause it to change! Some people think it's giid/bad news, regulations, halving as you said.. But, imo, the crypto market is totally different from any other market and sometimes it moves irrationally without any logical reasons.

Bitcoin 5 years ago was known by less than half the percentage of the world that owns Bitcoin today and over time the percentage will keep multiplying. One of the fastest way to help Bitcoin find its way to becoming a central currency is publicity and campaigning for Bitcoin. At most if every country host a conference for Bitcoin once a year Bitcoin should get massive spread",
