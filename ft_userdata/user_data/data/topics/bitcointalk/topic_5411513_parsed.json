  "content": "QuoteBillionaire Marc Lore is fleshing out his plan to build a utopian city called Telosa for 5 million people in the American desert — and he's not the only one with such ambitions.Why it matters: There are about a dozen projects worldwide to create sustainable, hypermodern cities-from-scratch. While they may never come to fruition, the proposals themselves hint at what the city of the future might look like.Driving the news: Telosa is set to be built on 150,000 acres in either Nevada, Utah or Arizona, and 50,000 \"diverse\" people will call it home by 2030, according to newly released details from Lore — a serial entrepreneur who sold Jet.com to Walmart for $3.3 billion and the parent company of Diapers.com to Amazon for $545 million.\"We're not just building a new city — this is a new model for society,\" Lore said at a Telosa \"town hall meeting\" in July, adding that he wants his new city to be \"sustainable and equitable to all.\"It'll be governed by a principle he calls \"equitism,\" which seems to be a mashup of democracy, capitalism and socialism.In Lore's vision, vehicles will be electric and autonomous, and roads won't have curbs (which could hinder differently-abled people), or on-street parking.Telosa's 36 districts will each be \"15-minute cities,\" where everything a resident needs is a short walk away.Every building will be \"green,\" with rooftop panels producing renewable energy.The design calls for fresh water to be \"stored, cleaned and reused on site,\" creating a \"diverse and efficient water system that is resistant to drought.\"How it'll work: A nonprofit called the Telosa Community Foundation will purchase the land to build the city — \"land that is virtually worthless,\" as Lore put it.The hope is that development will increase the land's value, and then the foundation eventually would be able to create a market for it — investing the proceeds in an endowment-style vehicle that would fund education, job training, health care, housing and more.This structure \"allows us to offer these incredible social services without having to increase taxes. That is the Holy Grail,\" says Lore.Among those working to make Telosa happen: Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York and a childhood friend of Lore's, and Bjarke Ingels, the prominent Danish architect whose firm is designing the city.The big picture: Telosa, a name derived from the ancient Greek word meaning \"highest purpose,\" is one of a growing number of dewy-eyed ambitions to build centrally planned and sustainable communities on a blank landscape — despite obvious impediments, like a lack of fresh water.In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is constructing a megacity named The Line, part of a larger development called Neom.The Line's plan calls for a city 105 miles long but only 220 yards wide, enclosed by mirrored walls and powered entirely by renewable energy, according to newly released designs.Water will be plentiful, according to the project's claims, through desalinization, wastewater and seawater processing, and smart metering.\"Saudi projections call for 1.5 million people to live in The Line by 2030,\" NPR reports, with eventual plans for 9 million residents.But recent Businessweek reporting suggests the broader Neom project has been plagued by indecision at the top and other problems.Floating City in the Maldives is envisioned as a large cluster of hexagonal structures that rise and fall with the sea, with room for up to 20,000 people. It's set to be completed in 2027.Toyota Woven City is a company town being built in the foothills of Japan's Mount Fuji. The proposal calls for a 2,000-person city where Toyota \"will test autonomous vehicles, smart technology and robot-assisted living,\" per CNN.Masdar City in Abu Dhabi is a \"master-planned eco-complex designed to show off the UAE’s commitment to sustainability,\" Bloomberg has reported.Net City in Shenzhen, China, is another company town being built by tech giant Tencent. It'll be a Monaco-size metropolis for 80,000 workers, CNN reports.Other billionaires with city-building aspirations include Bill Gates, who wants to build a \"smart city\" called Belmont in the Arizona desert, and Elon Musk.On Earth, Musk has discussed creating a city called Starbase in southernmost Texas, as a hub for space exploration — and, of course, he aims to one day build a \"self-sustaining city on Mars.\"Reality check: Some of the claims being made by the utopian planners strain credulity — like Telosa's assertion that it'll eventually be a net exporter of water and energy.In the real world, the promise of smart cities — where intelligent sensors, cameras, and Big Data combine to improve everything from traffic flow to city services — has been a consistent disappointment.The bottom line: The road to utopia is littered with shattered dreams.\"We still haven't figured out how to make utopian environments work for people,\" Professor Sylvie Albert of the University of Winnipeg writes in The Conversation.She reviews the flaws in experiments like Brasília, Levittown, Celebration, Songdo, Eko Atlantic and Sidewalk Toronto.https://www.axios.com/2022/08/25/city-of-the-future-neom-telosa-lore-mbs....I'm not certain if the proposed Akon City in africa, linked to the cryptocurrency akoin, began this recent trend to design and build the city of the future. There are many similar projects on the horizon hoping to get in on modern redesigns of the traditional city. Wealthy moguls are targeting cheap low cost land in deserts and sparsely populated regions as foundations for these ambitious plans. Carbon neutrel design and sustainability are as you might guess the most common buzzwords used to market and promote these projects. There are interesting and innovative ideas being proposed. The saudi arabia project is constructed around a mass transit length of rail. Built above the surface of the desert like a skyscraper. Elon Musk has discussed building a city devoted towards space exploration in texas. I was hoping UAE dubai and middle eastern real estate development would explore the viability of building cities underground to save on insulation and cooling costs. That seems like a natural progression. Interestingly enough, no one seems to like the idea.While there haven't been any major updates from akon city in a long time. Wouldn't it be great if the first of these projects to completion were based on akoin and incorporated cryptocurrency as a native token of exchange?",

      "body": "There are actually a few examples of such future cities being planned, such as the one you mentioned called \"Line\", in Saudi Arabia. Before seeing the article featuring it, I had no idea that someone would actually planning to build such a city, they honestly look too futuristic, coming from a sci-fi movie. While the whole concept of smart cities along with Blockchain technologies and even cryptocurrencies sound tempting, they don't look humane or earthly.Personally, I'd prefer a concept of a green, sustainable city which looks humane and respects traditional values, heritage and nature. A decent example is a project in Mexico, called \"The forest\" and is claimed that it'll be the greenest city in the world.https://www.ubm-development.com/magazin/en/the-greenest-city-in-the-world/",

Although this smart city is just at its inception stage, hopefully we will see it spring up in some place soon and begin hosting populations of all different types of humans.I believe that any delay in the success of akoin and akon city is due to lack of funding.

Making the city comfortable for the people that will live there.In the illustration of the desert city. There are towers which appear to be condensation towers. They can passively generate water by cooling air through natural wind motion. Dune Sea farmers in star wars have a similar water evaporation technology used by moisture farmers. Heat can be mitigated by building portions of a city underground. Or having good insulation and cooling. Either measure greatly reduces the amount of heating and cooling energy needed to stabilize living spaces. Resulting in living quarters that are more carbon neutral and green. As well as reducing electricity consumption.Being located in a desert miles from civilization makes it less likely for randoms to pass through. It could make it easier to screen troublemakers and unwanteds from entering the area, engaging in crime, vandalism, theft and other undesirable activity. It could also make it easier to retain a sense of privacy. Entry to the city could be by invitation only. They would likely cater to high end clientale with money to burn. Try to reorganize the shape of cities and civilization to produce various types of benefits. Infrastructure these days isn't a major concern, I think. It all comes down to funding. Starting from scratch makes it easier to transition to solar, wind, hydrogen or any other form of energy. Its easier than ever with megawatt hour grid tied lithium batteries. Which were the main missing link as far as technologies like solar energy go.",

But yeah, the probability that we'll see this city in this specific layout is quite low. Maybe a smaller version.Best \"planned\" cities are probably those who don't want to make everything different, but improve small details like \"walkable\" neighborhoods and above all the distribution of green spaces. So Brasília and Abuja (and probably The Line) did everything wrong, but St. Petersburg, Karlsruhe, La Plata and Washington D.C. did at least something right (all older planned cities, so the bad reputation planned cities have is very much affiliated with the 1950s-1980s car-friendly design trope). I have some hope for the Egyptian planned capital, seems to have a reasonable design.For Eko Atlantic, this is more of a \"business\" neighborhood than a full city. Very similar to something like Puerto Madero in Buenos Aires. Seems also to develop very slow.I'm wondering if a city design can effectively benefit Bitcoin usage. Besides of fast Internet, a government facilitating tax payments in BTC, I can't find much. Maybe citizen-owned mining facilities powered by renewable energy?",

But I must say, I disagree with the rest. I think when a project at cost of billions is on, many thousands of poor families benefit from it. They are getting jobs that wouldn't be there otherwise.

Allowing only city residents to mine it. That could be one path to recreating the early adopter days of crypto mining while reserving control of a crypto token inside a city or specific region's borders. The number of miner's a single party can own could also be capped in an effort to prevent it from becoming too monopolized and centralized. Having many independent miners in the same local district could also encourage commerce and transactions using the local coin. Such an arrangement could help to prevent crypto tokens from being pump and dumped or manipulated. It might also reduce volatility.",

Creating a city in the desert has two main benefits:1.Cheap land.2.Sunny weather for the solar panels.Those are the only benefits I can think of. The problems are way more:1.The weather is going to be hot during the entire year.2.Finding enough water supplies.3.Finding people, who would want to live in a city in the desert.4.Creating good infrastructure around the city.The people, who are building such innovative cities are missing one key point. Making the city comfortable for the people that will live there.Las Vegas was built in a desert. They turned a wasteland into a casino/competitive sports hub. I don't have the specifics on how they're able to import water to supply the city, but it can be done.The housing problem wouldn't be an issue as long as the infrastructure is built. There are housing shortages and an influx of folks leaving California for states more Eastern. Whether this \"Marc Lore\" character ends up building this thing in Utah, Arizona, or Nevada, they might attract some fleeing California residents.",

Singapore is even very beautiful with so much green and they did by importing soil from other countries. Singapore is built in the desert...omg!Never heard of a desert with those characteristics:QuoteSingapore's climate is classified as tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af), with no true distinct seasons. Owing to its geographical location and maritime exposure, its climate is characterized by uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity and abundant rainfall.Quote from: Hydrogen on September 07, 2022, 11:07:59 PMWhat if a techno city of the future forked bitcoin. Then limited mining exclusively to the city district. Allowing only city residents to mine it. That could be one path to recreating the early adopter days of crypto mining while reserving control of a crypto token inside a city or specific region's borders. The number of miner's a single party can own could also be capped in an effort to prevent it from becoming too monopolized and centralized.Restricted mining to only selected few, closed borders, capped share and equal distribution, total control in the hands of a few.I already have the best name for the city and the coin, with such characteristics they can be only called Pyongyang and Kimcoin, are those taken by",
