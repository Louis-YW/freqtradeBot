I doubt that the value when sold will exceed €100.When you buy investment gold, like a bullion, if you buy a 10 gram bar of gold today it will cost you about €596 and if you sell it after 5 minutes they will give you €555 (source).With jewelry it is much worse, since you are paying for the design and the brand, but when you go to sell it or pawn it you are going to be paid for the gold content by weight, and it is rarely more than 15% of what it cost you. The solution would be to find an individual who will pay you for the jewelry as jewelry and not for the value of the gold it contains to be melted, although you should also offer them a discount on the price in the store, but basing a loan on that has little hope of success. So, you are right.",

This actually what you are looking for instead of asking a loan here and spen shipping fee more than the value of your jewelry.Your best chance is to find trusted guy here that you can meet IRL near your location and interested to the jewelry you are offering.

Even if OP is legitimate the jewelry is nothing more than costume. Worth maybe $2 a piece wholesale.
