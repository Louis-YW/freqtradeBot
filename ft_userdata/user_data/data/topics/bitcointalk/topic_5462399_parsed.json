Bitcoin itself is what others can see through us to how we lived out lives and the benefits it serves us that will make others have more urge to also try out a new financial system, when our personal life as a bitcoiner preaches about bitcoin, others will see and try to know about bitcoin from us because they have behold the benefits in us than whe we are just busy telling them stories that have no evidence to take on from us.",
