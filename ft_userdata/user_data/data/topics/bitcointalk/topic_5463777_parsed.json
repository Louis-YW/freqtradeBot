Trading signals are for those who cannot trust their decisions, so they buy or follow them, and if you do not trust your abilities, do not trade in the first place. It can be said that the trading signals (if they are free) are part of your investment plan, as you search from that signal, but the paid signals are a loss of money. The business of selling trading signals is akin to the science of human development, they promise to make you feel good but all they do is sell dreams.",

If a trader follow the right thing to do in trading and not greedy, he will make money from it.I definitely agree with you.Trading using signals from signal providers are not profitable in the long run. Because if suddenly the trading signal providers just stopped their service, the profit will also stop to those who are availing their service most of the time. Self study is the best because the knowledge will be engraved in your brain forever, no fees or whatsoever. Being independent is so much better rather than trusting your future to other people.",

I've seen that the most of them aren't really profitable because the majority of their indications fail to materialize. Most of them are only interested in making money off of other people. Other than that, risk management is highly important in preserving the funds in trading, but if the signals have a very low winning rate, your capital will be liquidated in the end. So, if you're going to trade using signals, make sure the person is profitable.",

What is your opinion?My opinion is that those who use signal groups only identify one advantage and that is the one you already mentioned. Other than that nothing else looks positive to me about copying trade. Someone who is sure of profit may not sell his money to other persons because that is what it appears to allow someone copy you off your trade even though you are also gaining or losing separately. My opinion is that most traders make losses likewise those running copy trading channels, what then is the point to copy someone's losses.",

It’s only the main reason.If at all copy trade is to be followed, it is not suppose to be for newbies. Copy trading is suppose to be for an experienced trader who perhaps want to better his own trade and so he could be doing a comparison with what he is following and what he is also seeing in the chart of his trade. If they correspond then he could take a bigger risk or at most be sure that the trade would turn out in his favour. But a newbie barely knows nothing nor how to analyse the trade he is following, he would just take anything in and most times it is in lose because he won't be doing a comparison check.",

Nothing beats out if you do know tradingwith your own skills and snipping out some ideas and analysis into those people above which you could eventually apply it on your own.You know that it wont really be that something worth if you do 100% rely with those copy trading services or to those people who are offering such thing. You could really check out about a traders statistics which it is really that right. You would see whether this fella is really that sustaining or just simply profitable on a certain short frame. Seeing on 6 months or more and checking it out wont really be that a bad idea at all.",
