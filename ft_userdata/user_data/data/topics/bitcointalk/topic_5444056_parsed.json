I think how bitcoin popular nowadays depend with internet access and not ability withdrawing bitcoin fund trough local currency exchange as offline seems without internet bitcoin less worth.I will think twice for investing in Bitcoin and several altcoin if there are not access to internet, how possibility I check with my portfolio without have access with internet. Most important is internet access and seems when I am going to some where without access internet not comfortable for checking my cryptocurrency assets.",

I saw a post earlier this month or last on this forum regarding a means of transferring bitcoin using SMS, which I was totally against because that pattern can only be possible if it operates under a centralized platform and will later record or execute the transaction online with the help of the internet. It's impossible to make Bitcoin transactions offline because the transaction being recorded on the blockchain requires the internet, and a transaction can only be said to be completed if it has been recorded.",

The internet today is like water, it is an important part of our lives, we can go without food for many days but cannot go without water for a long time. If I weren't exposed to the internet regularly, I wouldn't invest in cryptocurrencies. I also think like @armanda90, bitcoin is very volatile, and when I invest in it without being able to check its value, it poses a lot of risk to me. There are still some parts of the world that are not connected to the internet, but with the current development, I believe that the internet will have global coverage in the near future.",

I think increase in internet access is still the solution — maybe through typical internet service providers, or through something like Elon Musk's Starlink.",

That's why we don't totally remove fiat because for the last hundreds of years, we are using it and for the people there to adjust to using bitcoins instead of fiat will be impossible.
