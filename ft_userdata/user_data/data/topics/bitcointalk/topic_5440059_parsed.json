  "content": "NATO vs russia now.It's stradegy and very complex chess game.Dont forget russians are good in chess game.Therese a lot stradegy here biggest problem is NATO sending all the equipments there is no guarantees that those military equipments dont get in the wrong hands.Europe is allmost empty of weapons.The point of chess game is to check mate who is the Queen? The Queen is the UK as first mover in NATO Alliance but the weapons Are gone and UK are out of weapons soon it means Queen Will be taken and then king Will be attacked Who is the king ? Probably Norway mr Stoltenberg the russia eating slowly NATO weapons and If this war continue that way then europe got no more weapons left to defend nothing anymore.Who can help europe? USA and canada but Will they do it ? Maybe later but first russia can take over Europe quite easyIf you compare this situation with chess game you can see that NATO got no idea how to play it right.If NATO dont send weapons to ukraine then russia can take ukraine but europe Will be saved now the ukraine Will be defended for some time but the king Will soon get the check mate becouse without protection there is no way much to defend.Can the king castle ? Maybe but how it might look like ? Probably not becouse the defence rocks for king to castle been sent to ukraine.NATO Queen is weak and soon might be taken away then anyone who got brain can see this chess game doesnt look good at all.Off course the ukraine is not main target for russia but Europe as whole but If EURope got so many weapons then it's impossible that's why the russia opened war in ukraine to direct all attentions to there and make europe to send all his resources there Also russia keep this fight long enough and dont use the real power all the russia doing is just keep enough pressure to make sure EU Will send all the weapons to there.Anyone can see that its interesting that that's not spoken about becouse it's the problem.",

      "body": "Nato against Russia is a no-brainer. Russia has been preparing for war for a long time. Nato has been working for peace. Without the support of the US, Nato is done for if Russia decides to attack.Endgame for Ukraine: America vs Americahttp://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/featured-articles/2023/february/15/endgame-for-ukraine-america-vs-america/For it is the US political calendar that may yet determine what happens next in Ukraine – from the western side.Seemingly nothing important occurred – it was an instant of spy frenzy, leaving Biden's 'tough task' unchanged: He needs to convince the American voter, facing collapsing standards of living, that they misread the 'runes'; that rather than gloom, the economy – contrary to their lived experience – is 'working well for them'.Biden needs to perform this magic against polls that say only 16% of Americans feel better off since the start of his tenure, and 75% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters wish him to not stand in 2024. Significantly, this message is coming today from the Democratic-leaning media, suggesting thoughts of replacing him are already in circulation.For now, Biden's allies in the party establishment (the DNC) continue to clear the way for his candidature – postponing initial primaries (in which Biden could be expected to be trounced) for a later South Carolina primary election, where Black and Latino voters would reflect demographics in which Biden might (possibly) shine. It may work; it may not.Simply put, against this highly sceptical Party backdrop, Biden will have to change American perceptions of the economy at a moment when many indicators signal further deterioration. It will be a 'heavy lift'. The economic team, for sure, will be insisting: 'Keep the focus on economic achievements! We don't want distractions from any foreign policy débacles; We do not want the TV debates to centre on Balloons, or around Abrams tanks: 'It's the economy, stupid!''....",
