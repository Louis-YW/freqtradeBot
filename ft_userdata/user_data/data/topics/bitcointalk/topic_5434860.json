  "content": "Hey Guys,While I stated that PNNV.com is a community-based project, it still is. I want to add a banner to help me cover some of the expenses.My expenses are high with zero income. So I was thinking of selling banner space at the header or at the button (we'll figure it out together)I got 160K users per month (see the attached google analytics stats) 100% are crypto dedicated mainly from Europe.The price Start with $4000 (USDT or BTC) and 100$ increment, im expecting to have 300-400K users within 2-3 months.The logo will appear in the header \"Sponsored by COMPANY-NAME\" and it would be clickable. High visible with every search from web and mobile.",
