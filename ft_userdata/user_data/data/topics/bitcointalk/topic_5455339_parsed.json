Meme coins/tokens have no future, these assets get public attention not because they have a revolutionary vision in crypto, so people have to really look at them (IMO).All they have is hype, as long as the hype is there, they will survive, but if the hype fades or disappears, the price of them will decrease too, we have seen many examples like $DOGE, $SHIB $TRTL and many others.",

Maybe the stubbornness in the words of the people who are supposed to bring influence and bring out the glamor to attract people to them, this crypto space is very diverse in different fields, I can form when all fields have not met their expected capacity and also with the context of the market economy is not good, bad variables appear to sneak in and take everyone's money.",

We see that every time Elon Musk says good things about Doge Coin its price always rise even if it's only a few words because the people that are buying it are expert in terms of buying low sell high. When the price of those coins is decreasing their owners know how to market it well and this is what the other coins owners are lacking because this talent is also necessary to keep your coins alive no matter how bad it is.",

I think meme coins have a low impact when it comes to having solutions or solving problems, but maybe it's only focused on one, to be a hype coin and make people rich and solve their money problems.With all the sharing it garnered throughout that hype season, there are probably reasons why it goes hype, and maybe they are doing the right thing.

Is there any reason to say this meme coin will work for the betterment of the entire crypto and Web3 realm?Don't be misinformed, there's nothing strange with what you're seing happening with Pepecoin, it has always happens to some other coins in the past which started small but ended big, a good example is the Dogecoin, Ethereum and many others, receiving hypes from investors is not something that has been tricked or manipulated atimes, people also want to invest on something that will ve profitable and appreciable on the long run.Quote from: cryptosk04 on June 06, 2023, 12:57:48 PMThere is another new meme coin called SNEK, based on Cardano. What impact these meme coins will create in the crypto space?As of Cardano i know it but am only hearing the snek you mentioned for the first time, they may actually share thesame network but do ensure you research well about many newly introduced coin before investing on them, they are just crypto projects whereby some may be unsuccessful while some may be successful.Quote from: cryptosk04 on June 06, 2023, 12:57:48 PMI don't understand why meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are so famous and why do people invest in them, wondering about the future of meme coins. They are reliable base on the research conducted on them, part of which is the liquidity, market cap, market volume, inventors, purpose or the project, market acceptance, and so many other features you have to looked into while accessing a coin.",

I know that a lot of people are getting aware of the whole crypto market because of the news of tokens like Shiba Inu or more recently PEPE where early investors literally could have made millions with a pretty small investment. So those people here this news and want to do this again obviously, everyone wants to do that.The sad truth about meme-coins is though that 99,9% of them are dead again within a few days. By some of them you can make a little profit if you buy within the first hours and then sell again a few hours later but with most of them not even that is possible. Projects like Shiba Inu and PEPE only happens like once in every 100.000 meme-coins.So if you are new to the market i would stick to \"real\" projects and avoid meme-coins.",

      "body": "The nature of meme coins often relies heavily on hype and attention from social media and online communities. As the hype wears off, the price and value of these coins can drop dramatically. So it's only profitable for those who come first, in the hope of taking advantage of the popularity wave and selling at a higher price. Although it can be profitable, if your mind only wants to get rich quickly, I think it's best not to worry about it because that will only make your investment knowledge narrower.",

Welcome to the crypto world. First of all, if you are new, AVOID meme coins and other hype coins for your inbestment. This is bery important rule.  Although many people say that meme coins will make you much money, don't trust 100℅. Most of them only want to attract you, but, meme coins are bad for investmemt, moreover for newbies who are stiln not able to utilize the point of hype and meme coins. however, i read that you are recently studying about Matic. Imo, Matic is one of my favorite altcoins. This has great use case, as competitor of Ethereum, offers more affordable fees, and the platform is very stable. but the most important thing fot newbies to invest in crypto is :invest in Bitcoin..",

They are not famous yet, they are just familiar because of the hyped created in social media which caught attention this time. I said just \"just this time\" because sooner or later, their names weren't that popular anymore for new projects will then to make hyped. This year is probably for meme coins, last year we have NFT, and probably next there are other names that will then show the same. Because the truth is that only those project that has the use-case will survive while those who are not will then just die or vanished in the crypto space like ICO projects.",

But really, the market can change quickly, and the price of meme coins can be very volatile. You should approach investments with a diversified and recognized portfolio, like bitcoin or etherium, rather than investing in memes. Remember that potential comes with risk, but this risk is too great for meme coins, so stay away, especially newbies.",
