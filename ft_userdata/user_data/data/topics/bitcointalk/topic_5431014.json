It should break as close to apex as possible if valid. Apex of so wide wedge (with trend lines almost symmetrical) is around 10k ... 500 days from now.3- you are calling the bottom of 600 days bear market based on almost zero price action. Dump below last support and consolidation for 40 days.I'm not talking its not the good time to buy. Maybe its the bottom. Maybe we are about to start bull run ... but not based on your analysis.",

      "body": "That falling wedge looks quite steep and it's also possible we could touch the bottom more than once before there's a reversal or a break of the supports and resistances.Elliot waves are generally considered unreliable as has been said above but I think there's a good chance we fall from here down towards 10-14k, I'd expect it to be swift though and fairly random when it happens (so we could recover more first too and even stay here a few months before then).",

Well, I hope you are right and it is good to see that you have positive insight about it.I am also hoping that the bitcoin price will reach that price when I have enough stored in my wallet. But as of now --there is no point in wishing bitcoin will go pump because I did not accumulate it and I did not receive yet a Christmas gift were supposed to be I will invest in bitcoin when the price is low. Each of us as investors has different prefer on the market, whose investors are waiting for a bullish trend to enter the market and those investors who already accumulated are also wishing for a bullish market so that they will cut their profit.",

I know that if someone can do that then their profits will be the highest once bitcoin reaches a new all time, however buying slightly above the bottom does not change things that much and it is way easier to do, as most of those which buy at the bottom did not did so due to their amazing skills as traders but simply because they got lucky.",

There's still a possibility that prices can move randomly. BTC is now in green but the increase were only small so I don't think this can be said that we are now going for a bull run and the bear market will finally end though this increase can continue till we touch $19k, and the other two values that you listed above. They are only small so they are pretty possible to get. What about now @fennic. The price of $16k per BTC is still a best buy imo.Don't expect too much about the bottom because the price of BTC can still rise even without it. Buying alts is also fine as long as it was a nice alts, and not a junk one.",

BTC investment expected it is good for long-term purposes and you will see there is a big return when we will hit the new ATH of BTC price which we know will happen. So now, good to know there are still people who believed that the BTC prices will increase soon.",

Now is the time that only fundamental analysis can be used as a sane analytics. I remember being fed these stripes and triangles in mid-2022, saying the market was about to explode. But the miracle did not happen, because there are absolutely no fundamental prerequisites for injecting money into bitcoin and did not exist at that time. Liquidity does not appear simply because some kind of technical analysis showed a reversal. Until the situation with binance, FTX, large exchanges is resolved, until the miners finally capitulate, there can be no talk of any bullrun.Yeah, can't remember just how many golden crosses and heads and shoulders and dead cat bounce calls etc were made and invalidated every step of the way in 2018-19... It was really until 2020 Black Monday crash and the recovery globally that Bitcoin price made serious rally moves.Fundamentals in Bitcoin do keep getting stronger but while market fundamentals are ailing, with symptoms yet to clear, not really useful to look at these indicators, particularly at poor volumes.",
