It's same with Bitgert... The most annoying one is Crypto.comCrypto dot com promised 25$ on new users signing up through a popular Youtuber and after KYC verification they revealed that you have to buy some CRO in thousands before you can claim the free 25$, these people are just liars.",

They hope they may like the platform, get over their initial lies and remain there, since you've already filled KYC.I've seen such behavior in all kind of stores/business. Some years ago in my country, a certain car maker had advertising about cars starting from price_x. I've found out soon that allegedly they only had one car (for the entire country) at that price, but the strategy was to get people into the showroom and .. show what they had (at higher price, obviously).My take? Don't just sign up for a platform because of the ads, since you can easily go to even worse experience, like getting your money stolen by scam platforms, which also put out banners here and there.Also, you may want to read Why KYC is extremely dangerous – and useless; it should hopefully make you understand that 25$ is not worth it, even if it's real.",

      "body": "That's the scheme that many exchanges do to attract people by false advertisements. The thing is you should never believe anything that says free money especially that kind of amount which is not small to start with and surely it requires something that you should do after you get that so called free money if what they claimed is true. If you want to find an exchange that you can trust then better find it yourself rather than choosing an exchange that you saw in an ad. If you want to find an exchange much faster and also through ads then you should make some research or exploring first before depositing any funds. What I see is that you are being greedy when you saw the ad that says free $1500. There is no such thing as free money all the time (since there's some platform gives free money around $5-$10 per person but limited only and also very seldom to happen).",

Some countries have stricter rules and regulations that apply to the cryptosphere, although I don’t expect this to be a general norm. For example, Spain recently explicitly regulated crypto-asset advertising, and although it’s something relatively new, it does mean that clearly deceiving campaigns can and will be denounced to the concerning authorities. There are also prerequisites (in Spain) for campaigns that have an intended audience of over 100K viewer impacts, with a mandatory pre-communication to the supervisors, who could demand changes or a halt altogether. We’ve still yet to see how it plays out in practical terms there.",

This is money we are talking about here you don't expect them to just make the process of getting it as easy as it seems, you have to do something for them for them to do something for you that's how it works, nothing goes for nothing.Next time to avoid being fooled, be sure to read through completely the terms and conditions of any exchange you want to use before you sign up, don't simply be lured by the promise of money.",

Similar to when sell price is something like $999 rather than $1000. Just a marketing trick and somewhat gives people more comfortable feeling when they want to buy something. About bonus, it is attractive for users but you should read more details at their website about a specific program.

Many other people have probably seen that ad or a similar one and went to check it out.Despite what the ad says, you should always confirm what is true by reading the TOS and speaking with the support before depositing money.
