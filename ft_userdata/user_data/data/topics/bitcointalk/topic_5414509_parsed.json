  "content": "Without question one of the biggest issues with the United States government is allowing for big corporations to fund politician campaigns without any contribution limits. In doing so, they are buying the politicians so that when they get in office, the politicians will then be obligated to return the favor.  This creates a political puppet. It’s 100% wrong, and what creates most of the corruption issues. Big corporations run this country, not politicians. There is no debate that this should be stopped. Whether that means capping campaign contributions, or ending them all together for these big corporations. Im curious to hear from those who live outside the US, how does your country handle this ?  Also curious if anyone has any ideas how to fix this, other than the ways I described.",

Politicians bank accounts, money their using for the campaigns etc are all traceable. These high level politicians get millions and millions in donations, that’s way to hard to give under the table.  Plus you could increase transparency requirements.",

Satoshi wasn’t running for political office (which obviously requires not being an anonymous person), transferring funds to exchanges to convert to fiat to then use to fund their campaign. Politicians have oversight and money transfers to pay for their campaign can all be tracked. If they spend millions of dollars with unknown sources or a paper trail, then they are going to know and require detailed information and proof where the money came from.",

So money can be considered a form of \"speech\" in the most liberal forms of democracy and I'm generally okay with it. I agree with your idea of capping contributions, here are some that I'd also support:Political contributions are all public, no anonymous donations.Corporations cannot donate directly on behalf of a candidate, individuals of a corporation are of course exempt (ie board members).Cap political contributions but also adjust yearly for inflation.Contributions must be spent only towards campaign towards individual campaign expenses and cannot be stowed for other elections of other politicians.**Doing this would prevent one politician from having too much financial power. Say you're Donald Trump and have 100M USD in campaign donations that's ready to be injected into political campaigns of other people, you own everybody else.Granted every country's laws are different, making a few basic stipulations you can have money in politics without too much problems.Side note - I suppose there is nothing stopping an individual from registering a business, pouring his money or someone else's money into media campaigns on behalf of a candidate to bypass some of the stipulations I've made above, but I guess there could be laws to address this too.",

Sadly, there is little we can do except to hope that, it goes against the rule of law and that way, someone could act on it.In my nation, years of looted funds plays most of the role, wth the godfathers and the corporations at another end, pulling there strings.It creates a Web of issues as there are so many strings and all needs to be satisfied.The best way to its resolution is ensuring a credible election where the people's choice wins.
