  "content": "As always, your beloved stompix bringing you the good news that nobody wants to hear.Keeping it up after my last one:Eu gas and electricity prices drop 80% to 2021 level, another apocalypse avertedhere is again, good news!Europe’s top economy expanded by 0.3% in the third quarterArchived since paywall!Remember how Germany was supposed to plunge into recession, how according to some 60% (just lol) of the companies went bankrupt, how everything is shut down, how there is no more light, no more cars, how bla bla bla.Well, again, completely defying propaganda Germany has managed to grow again, despite the highest energy prices ever encountered, and those are going down all the way in Q3, TTF day ahead spot prices crashing almost 10 times from the peak.What's more interesting is that the whole EU economy still went up, and only one country posted you decline with 3 countries posting a previous trimester decline.Of course, this doesn't mean everything is going perfectly, inflation was still up, but the ECB is finally starting to do its thing, and as I said a few months ago, doing it the right way, acting when it matters and with enough room left for more serious involvement, especially since one of the countries that posted surprising growth was ItalyItaly's economy grows stronger than expected 0.5% in Q3, easing pressure on new govtand these numbers will help counter the fear of the consequences of further rate hikes.Going back to Germany, there is the need to address one thing as I saw some quoting that large companies are fleeing to China and shutting down in Germany.Of course, the usual crap, and the truth is completely different.BASF planned to open a factory in China in 2019:https://www.basf.com/cn/en/who-we-are/organization/key-production-sites/guangdong.htmlBASF is a 80 billion a year in revenue company, with factories in 11 countries, investing 10 billion is nowhere near what a move would look like.And furthermore, to counter all the doom and gloom and bankruptcy theories:https://www.basf.com/global/en/media/news-releases/2022/10/p-22-381.htmlBASF achieved solid EBIT before special items despite continued high raw materials and energy pricesQuoteSales of €21.9 billion up 12 percent over prior-year quarterUnchanged outlook for 2022: Expected sales of between €86 billion and €89 billion, EBIT before special items of between €6.8 billion and €7.2 billionAs I said above, this doesn't mean that the EU will avoid a technical recession completely, since Q4 is always a slowdown, taking into account inflation and demand destruction we might still see a recession, I'm actually convinced there will be one in Q1 2023, but every single analyst out there no matter how negativist he is about this has slashed the decline numbers, from the worse -1.2 were slowly hovering to an average between -0.6% and -0.2% and not a single source is mentioning a decline in the whole 2023, as overall the economy will reverse the start of the year trend and still grow. Not as fast as predicted at the start of this year but not doomsday either.So everyone should be happy, another apocalypse is being avoided, the economy works, employment is at record levels, people still have money, and people still afford to buy bitcoins, what do you get if you preach all day long about collapses and recession and bankruptcy?",

      "body": "That the countries of Europe without Russian gas and oil could freeze in the coming winter was propaganda by Russia, which sought to force the EU to lift or at least ease international sanctions in exchange for resuming supplies of its oil and gas. This blackmail and threats this time had no effect on the countries of Europe. Yes, long-running supply chains have broken down. But Europe is confidently overcoming this crisis and has already filled its storage facilities by more than 90 percent without Russian energy carriers. By the end of the year, Europe will completely abandon offshore supplies of Russian oil, and this will be a serious blow to the Russian economy. Russia is now losing on all fronts. The bet on force, blackmail and threats did not work this time. Hard times will come not in Europe, but in Russia.",

In my opinion, just the fact that Germany lost the Second World War made her a strong state economically. Militarism hinders the normal economic development of the country in the long run.  Germany was inoculated against fascism and militarism.  She learned to be friends and cooperate with other countries.  At the same time, the Germans have always been distinguished by diligence, education and discipline.  In the 19th century, almost all engineering textbooks were written in German.  I am confident that Germany will continue to experience economic crises with less losses than other countries.",

I was thinking that European nations would soon go broke because of cost financing and supporting Ukraine. Another factor that always make the doomsday predictions real is the refusal of OPEC+ to increase the crude production because they want the price to keep increasing. There was even news of protests erupting in some parts of Europe because of high cost of gas and other essential commodities. There were predictions that these protests would soon spread to other parts of Europe thereby giving an opportunity for anarchy. From this information it is clear that although Europe is not free from its economic challenges but there is a very bright light at the end of the tunnel.",

Some mistake protests in Europe with the anarchy in other countries, but it's not like that, Belgium went 600 days without a government, and the Netherlands did so for 9 months, it's not like everything will crash just because of a power change.",

I am not sure how much true it is. But if this is the main reason why the energy prices are down in Germany, it will have a catastrophic effect on rest of EU countries. A subsidy war will be started and since German companies will be able to keep their product prices low due to the subsidy, entire EU will be flooded by German goods because they will be cheaper than the locally produced goods. That's not good for EU as a whole.",

Yes things are up, but not really that much. CNG is still fairly cheap, and so on.But telling people that does not sell ad space. I am still seeing some people complaining about 'shortages of things' but digging a bit deeper I see it's a mostly I can't get THIS brand that I like there are only these 4 other brands of the exact same things but I don't like those brands.I made a post a few years ago that is still somewhat active in P&S about a pair of gas stations across the street from each other and one of them had prices that were stupid high compared to the other: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5254433.0From the last time a took a picture and posted in early September it's gotten worse Diesel at the cheap station went from $4.89 / gallon to $5.49 the expensive went from $6.99 to wait for it $7.99 So looking at 1 location you can easily say diesel fuel is $7.99 a gallon on Long Island. And it is....there. Every other station for MILES and MILES around is $5.79 or less.I was listening to someone say how expensive the local pizza place has become for their lunch special. Guess what, 2 slices and a drink have been $8.00 there SINCE 2018. The other place down the road that went out of business (owner died nothing to do with economy) WAS MORE. But, he remembers the good old days or something.-Dave",

Im not sure with what their goal is but by preaching it every single day, they are actually encouraging this thing to actually happen. Probably they are trying to sell their 'investment course' or whatsoever but these people are actually disgusting in a way",
