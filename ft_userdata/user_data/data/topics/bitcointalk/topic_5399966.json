  "content": "I've said before that I think tagging Newbies for \"bounty abuse\" is futile. Accounts with high Activity and 0 Merit have nothing to lose, because they can easily create new accounts. Worse: it makes negative feedback very common instead of reserved for scammers, which leads to more and more people (including bounty/campaign managers) ignoring the warning. So I don't think tagging them makes the forum better.The bounty scams don't even care about the duplicate accounts: they pay with made-up tokens created out of thin air, designed to make the creator rich. There's no way all of them are unique projects, and I'm pretty sure a couple of teams are behind most of the ICOs, Defi and other useless \"disrupting\" pump and dump BS that gives crypto such a bad name. They don't care: the more spam, the more they earn!But if you do insist on tagging bounty spammers for bounty abuse, why not just tag them all? There's no way thouse bounty spammers all have thousands of real followers. All they do is spam Twitter and Facebook, and they exchange followers with other bounty spam accounts. So even if a bounty spammer uses only one account on Bitcointalk, they're still cheating with fake followers on social media!The way I see this entire \"business\": there are a few multi-millionaires at the top, and there are a few (maybe hundreds or even thousands) of bounty spammers at the bottom. Together they produce millions of useless posts all over Bitcointalk and social media, hoping to convince more greedy gullible victims to hand over their money. It's a terrible concept and the entire business model is deceitful.Yes, the topic title was clickbait, but I'm trying to make a point here. If tagging them doesn't work, if the forum doesn't ban their low-quality posts, and if they don't bring anything good at all, can't we just ignore them completely? Don't mention them in Reputation (sorry, I'm guilty too), don't mention them in Scam Accusations, don't look for \"alts\" as long as they have nothing to lose, don't tag them, but just ignore them completely?No spamSelf-moderated against spam.

And we have to keep the forum clean (of course, between the limits on what's possible).But I agree that too much drama goes on around that kind of accounts. On the other hand, it's not the same about all clickbait topics, no matter how many times the same thing was discussed or how useless it is?So the reality is (as I see it)* yes, it's too much drama around those accounts* people seems to like drama, it gives them a reason to post (also keep in mind that most sig campaigns have a minimum quota, but it's not the only reason)* it's known that the forum grows even with shitposts, as long as they are under a certain thresholdSo yes, you're pretty much correct, but I don't think that anything is going to change.",

I would say that the biggest blame here comes from bounty managers. They try to have as many participants as possible, but the quality is completely neglected. even ignoring the negative feedback on the profiles.somewhere in the past (at the time of ICO), there were some mass campaigns that brought in good money and based on that, all managers took over the template. the same thing has been driving for five years, just different names for \"projects\".so the question is if you are one of the top groups and start a business, would run a bounty program like these currently running?",

      "body": "I don't know the answer to how we can effectively sort that section out. You could probably put ten moderators in there, and they wouldn't be able to sort out all the spam. I'm not sure how I feel about tagging every single bounty hunter, I'm sure there's legitimate cases among them, and it would be unfair to issue a blanket strategy which would effect them. Although, I will admit the vast majority are definitely abusing the system, and don't really offer the forum all that much.Â  I've gotten a lot more strict as time passes in moderating my sections, although I must admit the bounty section in particular is a completely different kettle of fish. I'm basically trying to go through the entire section of the ones I moderate, and effectively try, and remove the backlog of spam we've had over the years. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that's even possible with the bounty section since bounty sections aren't really all that effected by the bumping changes theymos introduced, which actually did impact the announcement sections quite some bit. So, there's a ton more work to be done in that section.I don't think it'll ever get implemented, as it's rather restrictive. However, I'd like to see some restrictions put in place where only x merit or activity can post in the bounty section. That way, you'd reduce the endless alt accounts, unless of course they build up over time.

I mean, these users are doing the captcha's required to register/login so they don't mind creating a temporary email. If you're suggesting that we disallow temporary emails, that's a potential privacy concern, which effectively punishes the legitimate users, as well as those that might be malicious. Therefore, I don't think that's the best approach to this.",

I have a question: if these newbies already get tagged and doesn't have anything to lose since they can create new accounts, why until now they never learn how to hide and not linked their alt accounts? Because I've expose many new alt accounts that related with the previous busted accounts. I think if they're know why the reason they got red tagged, they will know how to play clean, isn't? but the fact is opposite.",

And taking more than he should? If that isn't an untrustworthy character, I'm not sure what is.What do you propose we do about bounty cheaters, BTW? Because you believe tagging them isn't doing any good.I'm confused here.Â  Are you talking to me?Â  Because if you are, I think you believe I don't think tagging bounty cheaters is a good idea--it is.Â  I'm referring to the mass-tagging of all bounty hunters simply because they participate in bounties.I was agreeing with your post, so I don't know where the miscommunication is.I have yet to witness these actions; the only ones I can recall that are still ongoing are those involved in the 1xbit signature campaign; perhaps I am misinterpreting something here.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 25, 2022, 12:05:31 AMQuote from: igehhh on May 24, 2022, 03:08:31 PMTheymos would never agree to that, because I believe the bounty board is the most active part of the forum (I could be wrong) and contributes more to forum activities.I understand and you're correct, but do we really need a shitposter and spammer activities in this forum? Why should we protect an useless users instead of make the forum better with less good posters? Sometimes business comes first, and the forum's main source of revenue is dependent on its activities, so I understand why the bounties and off-topic sections are still important parts of the forum; the only assistance we can provide is reporting those shitposters and letting the mods deal with them. You can only make the forum more user-friendly; I doubt shitposters and spammers will stop. Twitter and Facebook have been fighting bots for years, but the problem is only getting worse. The fact remains that one in every twelve must be a Judah.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 25, 2022, 12:05:31 AMI have a question: if these newbies already get tagged and doesn't have anything to lose since they can create new accounts, why until now they never learn how to hide and not linked their alt accounts?

I think if they're know why the reason they got red tagged, they will know how to play clean, isn't? but the fact is opposite. Most of them only know that they were banned, but they never look into why they were banned in the first place, and because they have hundreds of alts, they don't give a fck and just reactivate, use the same address, and get banned again. Then repeat step one.",
