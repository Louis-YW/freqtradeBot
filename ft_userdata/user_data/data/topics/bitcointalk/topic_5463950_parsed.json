      "body": "Only a crazy person will go to your exchange to change WMZ for something else. Your exchange rate is very high. Why should a person go and change at you, if he can easily go to a native WebMoney exchanger and change WMZ there at a much more attractive rate? For example, your exchange rate of WMZ to USDT is 1,28, and in the native WM exchanger the rate for this direction is 1,20. And naturally, there is a question of trust. And it is clear to a fool that to the native WM exchanger of trust is much more than to you.",

      "body": "Are the mentioned exchange reliable for someone to confidently trade over there?Well I won't probably blame those venturings into that exchange to use them leaving the reputation exchange that are more friendly and charges less for exchanging currencies. I personally I don't mind using Binance and pass my kyc than going into exchange that has no integrity and transparency.@Fexkomin why would someone exchange 118$ to 100$ whereas other exchange may not change higher than this.. thus, is this normal?",
