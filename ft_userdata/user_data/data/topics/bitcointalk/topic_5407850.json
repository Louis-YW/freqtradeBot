  "content": "Hello everyone,I would like to ask you if u already heared about a game called diablo or diabolo which allowed you to win btc around 2010, I can't find it anymore.  The value of btc was 0.01 and when you win for 10$ you can withdraw the money. I  stop playing when I was near to the 10$.. I had too much btc but I can't find it and I need it to resolve some family stuff. Thank you very much ! Allah bless you.",

      "body": "There's that game that's currently popular on Steam. But if you're asking about that game from 2010, that's long gone and it's been more than a decade. Before btc was distributed just like airdrops in prizes and it's not worth that much. There's even a faucet made by Gavin that gives 5 btc per claim. CMIIW.Well, we're far from that year and we're on the present and if there are games right now that will allow you to earn btc, it's hard to find unless you're into those play to earn games that you need to trade their rewards token for btc.",

It's like the story where James Howells' 7,500 Bitcoin accidentally threw away a hard drive and tried to find it again. You played the game in 2010 doesn't mean it can actually come back to find it now.",

      "body": "It appears your not being specific on what your looking out for as Dianblo isn't a specific game app but falls into a criterion. A search on my playstore and am met with various types like: Diablo RPG, Diablo Immortal etc. Perhaps if you could narrow down your search then maybe, you could find them in business.Mean while, its been over a decade and that's a long time.Family issues and the boom, bitcoin unto the rescue. I guess that's not the best way to go about a potential investment. You just might have to handle yourself as it is and learn a lesson from this missed opportunity. Hope your buying bitcoin as well. Take care of you!",

      "body": "Let's say you raised $8 at that time which equals 800BTC. Even if you can find a faucet site owner and want to claim, looking at current prices is too valuable to give up as a faucet gift years ago. I'm also not sure if the site owner still keeps that many faucet pools until this year.At the very least they can only give you $10 worth of bitcoins based on the current price.",

Perhaps you were referring to \"DiabloMiner\" instead...",
