No serious business should be afraid of criticism. It does not matter what anyone says on the internet, as long as you can refute it with facts and arguments.

I am sure we can all agree that nobody has the right to punish another person for expressing their opinion in a public forum. Is that what you want? In that case, you are in the wrong place.",

From what I have seen, almost every instant exchange out there can ask you to verify your identity if they notice a \"suspicious activity\".What exactly was a baseless claim here?And why was it so hard to positively respond to this with a cool head if you are legitimate? I have seen far worse questions and criticism. Maybe you just can't handle business or responding to critism/crisis. Hire someone who can.",
