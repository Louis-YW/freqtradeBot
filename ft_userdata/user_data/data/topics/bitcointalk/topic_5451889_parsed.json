The funds will be channeled to many aspects of the project but a large chunk of it will be used to further develop new product categories such as lending, liquid staking, native restaking, etc. Although Defi staking is live, more staking pools are being added almost every few weeks. BTT bounty program is being discussed and once a conclusion is reached, we'll launch it here. Strategic partnership is one key element for our sustainability. One of our close partners, MyCointainer, is a registered yield-earning company with over 140K+ users and has been in operation since 2018. There will be cross-marketing among these platforms for adequate exposure and in the long run, ensure sustainability. Talk of the Lending category which is yet to be launched, remember just as we stated in the whitepaper, our flexible features which will allow both lenders and borrowers to able to set various parameters that fit into their needs. Some of those include the repayment schedule, APY, repayment token, borrowing token, collateralisation composition, and much more. We believe this will make a great difference in the market.",
