Also provide the reference chart you are using for your conclusion about Bitcoin price movement for discussion purposes on your claim. Thread like this always popping out when Bitcoin make a short term rally and then fades away once sudden correction occur that erased the gain with just  a day. Atleast show the magic chart that you are mentioning that didn’t lie. Use imgur.com to upload image and share the link here so that we can view it.",

But, we've seen that bitcoin's recovering.It is why DCA is still the best strategy.",

Sometime we thought that the market is good but when chart shows a different trend, then we might end up losing on our position when a lot of traders positioned on the reversed one. I remember before, that the market is so bullish and suddenly drop then boom got liquidated on the process.",

It seems like that bitcoin was showing a good movement. The economic seems to be better and better. I hope that if we have reached the bottom and bitcoin will be going up even higher. There are only less than 1,9 millions bitcoin to be mined. I hope this will give a good impact to the bitcoin. Market is starting to be bullish again for now.",

I was able to buy some altcoins as well during the panic moment in the market, I’m just waiting for them to follow the trend of Bitcoin now and rise as well.",

You shouldn't treat the chart as a crystal ball that can tell you everything that is going to happen in the future in exactly the way you want, but rather as one of the references you can use to predict which direction the market will go in.There has been an ongoing rally in the market, however, I am still waiting for a new low for this bear season.",

Lucky to those who are brave enough to buy at that price which right now already have a good profit. Buying at a cheaper price is the basic rules in trading, and take profit when necessary. If you are able to buy at the price of $17k, its good to take profit now or you can take another risk and wait for the market to reach its peak for this trend.",

People can't predict the chart accurately and what they can do to speculate based on what they know but mostly were making wrong prediction. that's why you shall not need to trust people about that. Their TA didn't have good accuracy. The market itself can answer about this. People can think about believing in theirselves rather than try to believe in others.",

But, we don't know if there will be another dropped market price again or not before the next bullish era. This recent situation still cannot guarantee whether this time has been rising up into bullish era or not yet. This is still in the Q3 of this year. I do agree with @jossielThat is why we need DCA, we can utilize every drop market to buy and add more amount of BTC to our portfolio. But here, if there are many people who still expect for more dropped BTC price under 17k is also not a fault. In fact, if that is really dropped again, just be calm and do DCA again, so if we can really meet or not meet the lowest one, at least, we have some nearby to prepare for the next bullish era.",

Especially when the market is down, if you haven't started DCA'ing then those spots are usually the best to start with since the risk would be a lot lower compared to starting DCA when the market was at its peak. I honestly think we're just recovering from that huge dip but we probably aren't going anytime sooner to above $30k. Wouldn't surprise me if we went back to $20k by the end of the year, but imo we'd probably continue seeing this steady, maybe slow climb.",
