Then you are looking for signature design, not banner design. Both are different. Signature code is designed by bbcode which can't be with mouse over affect.If you are not looking for signature code but html banner, wondering if you know that ad auction has been paused for a while.Have you hired a campaign manager already?

Bitcointalk ad banner and rank signature that can be seen in every signature space (below every post) are two different things. You can't have a hover effect in signature space too. So you should be specific if what you are trying to be done. If its a bitcointalk ad (that usually be seen on forum ads slot) or signature space for the mentioned tanks.Edit: all were mentioned above, posted a minute ahead of me.",
