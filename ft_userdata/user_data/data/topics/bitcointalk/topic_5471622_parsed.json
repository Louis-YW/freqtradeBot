  "content": "Yesterday, I read a topic about the PATRIOT Act by o_e_l_e_o. In summary, the PATRIOT Act seeks to criminalize regular Bitcoin activity and transactions like mixing. For those who think it is a U.S. thing, please think again. The U.S. wields a lot of influence all over the world. We may most likely see its financial regulations being enforced by other countries. But this is not about that. This is about American Bitcoiners. Some of them, with whom I have spoken, say that this law which is agaist their constitutional rights will force them to leave the United States of America since the law is unfavorable to them. I have a question for them: Will you leave the country or stay and stand up and fight for your right?If this law is eventually legalized, we are going to have Bitcoiners who would be persecuted and jailed for wanting to fight it. There are going to be Bitcoin martyrs. Will you leave the country and take your Bitcoin with you, or will you stay and stand up and fight (non-violently) for your rights?",

I’m from 3rd world country which probably leaving my country as not advisable due to more financial problem. I’d rather sell all my Bitcoin rather than change country that has high cost of living. Choosing another 3rd world country is not my alternative choice either since finding new job will be hard unlike in my country which I earn decent amount. I can live without Bitcoin but I can’t live properly on other country with different culture. It’s too much adjustment for me just to avoid being persecuted by owning Bitcoin while I can sell all my holdings before this law implemented since government gives advisory before they implement new harsh law in my country.",

You don't have to flee away from your country counting on all the benefits you have enlisted above concerning you. The truth is that if we decide to run away from our country because of a law made by the government that didn't favour us then that means we'll keep running never stopping cause what makes you think you won't encounter in future another unfavourable law(s) in the country you might be running to.It's a father-land and that gives us more stands to stay and fight when things are going wrong, alien citizens won't fight for us. And another thing, having to go through the hassle and  process of adapting to a new environment starting a new life else where isn't so simple.From what I have read the case is in court yet to be giving verdict (correct me if am wrong), so it's possible the citizens might when because it's a matter of privacy which is a right.",

Unless you are involved in money laundering yourself, you can be proud of your bitcoin and how you earned them. The KYC debate has been going on for long, and I dont find any fruitful discussion from it which is why I dont comment.

And I learn this from US Democratic State. Running is part of human survival, so if the pressure from the government is high, then they (bitcoiners) have to look for a way to survive from the pressure then return later when the pressure has calm. All these Patriot Act is to threaten the bitcoiners to stop using bitcoin since they (government) cannot control the coin and they are seen that the value is higher than US dollar. So they are working a modality to control or stop the coin. But irony will be their case. But the way I am seeing things people might jail because of the bitcoin. But victory is sure.",
