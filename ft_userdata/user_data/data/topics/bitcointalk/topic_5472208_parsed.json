It’s not his business anymore on what people will do since the business is legal and no one will force people to bet on lotteries. In fact, Lotto is not that much very addictive since the result is not instant. I will understand the concern if we are talking bout here is drugs or anything illegal.",

There maybe another opportunity coming.That could be summarized like that IMO. Please update us OP on what your friend's decision is.",

      "body": "I will allow them to lease the place to set up their lottery outlet gambling is legal in that country so you should not take the blame for something that is popular in one's place, the lotto agent sees the potential of the place, he will eventually find some owners to lease their place and set up the lotto outlet, thereby missing the profit, so instead of you making a good profit without doing anything, you let the opportunity pass.Life is hard in third-world countries so instead of passing the opportunity take it, no use worrying because gambling is legal in that country it's the government's fault for allowing people to gamble.",

So is left either you should take the money or you look away and save your concerns,  but in business,  what matters is the revenue and not your feelings as long as you are not going against the government.",

I will rent it out and use it to invest in bitcoin, because from the look of things, is like he is not really in the need of money.",

There is nothing illegal about this, people play the lottery at will and they will still play it, no matter where they buy it. Let him rent it out if it brings him profit, in any case, it is not he who will sell it, but the person who will rent the premises from him. In addition, he has no guarantee that if someone else rents premises from him to sell food, that he will sell good and high-quality products, in each situation there are nuances and you cannot take them all into account, the most important thing is that this activity was legal.",

      "body": "If gambling is already legal in your country why worry about it when it's an opportunity to rent out a shop to an agent who has a good profit without doing anything. The shop owner is clearly profitable.The question of morals and conscience on gambling is up to the individual whether he/she thinks it would be good if there is a lottery agent there?For me, if it is legal and the government authorizes this, there is no doubt that the rental of shops by agents will definitely be greater because seeing the conditions around there are many people coming and going, so the lottery agent knows it is the best place for him.Regarding encouraging gambling, I say back to the individual you only benefit from the rental of store outlets.",

      "body": "I think you should ask your friend the following:- Is he forcing people to buy a lottery ticket?- Is he renting the space for criminal and illegal activities?because from what I read in the OP. Gambling is legal in your country, the guy who wants to rent it has a license, so there is nothing illegal or immoral. Your friend is seeing things from a point of view based on the Muslim religion, from what I understand. But when you look at the horrors that religions have caused to the world, then you realize that you need to put aside religion and look at the side of laws. If you are not breaking the laws then everything is fine.Your friend sold food, and nowadays many foods like sugar harm people when they consume too much, even the salt that was in your friend's store is harmful if a person consumes too much at the same time. So the same thing happens with the lottery, as long as people are playing for fun and with money they can afford to lose they won't have a problem and even if someone became addicted to gambling, that's not your friend's fault. Each person who enters the gambling games must be 18 years old, because the law says so, only an adult can play and your friend does not own the peoplePeople have their lives and responsibilities, it's not your friend who should keep saying what people can or can't do with their lives, your friend should also live his life, always complying with the laws. That's why, in my opinion, there's no problem with your friend renting his store to a lottery company, your friend worrying about taking care of his life and his family, always complying with the laws",

Let him negotiate with the tenant and extract the maximum amount for rent from him. It may take a long time until he finds another tenant, but “you won't be full” with your conscience alone. When the lack of money affects the well-being of his family and loved ones, he will perceive everything differently. Lotteries are not an “absolute evil” in this world and in the end, your friend has nothing to do with this business if it makes his moral choice easier. Lottery \"victims\" will visit this establishment, even if it is located in a different place and not at your friend's house.",

      "body": "Personally, in my opinion, As long as it doesn't violate any national laws or regulations, it's best to abandon efforts to increase your market and try to keep up with the competition, and consider offering your grocery store to a lottery agent. This way, you can still use the shop and you will still get monthly profits through the rent you receive.However, if this is too contrary to your personality and raises concerns in itself, I recommend switching to a business that is in line with your moral and ethical values, perhaps a business that offers more profitable business and attracts visitors. The best alternative is to open a culinary business because at the moment most people prefer fast food that is ready-made and easy to eat. Maintaining your grocery store will not bring any progress. Therefore, opening a culinary business will offer growth opportunities and better financial profits.",

Your friend is now battle with this. His conscience should tell him the best thing to do but he should remember money will go, the lotto business may one day relocate but his conscience stays with him. At least he has a good spot for rent, so even if the lotto renter goes another kind of business outlet that won't bother his conscience will come soon.",

It's up to you what you want to use the rented shop for. If it is used as a lottery gambling place and has a license, the responsibility lies with the party renting it. Besides, the business he ran at the shop was quiet.If at the same time there are two parties who come to rent the shop for different purposes, it is better to rent it to someone who is not using it as a gambling place.Something uncomplicated.",

It seems somehow wrong for those youtubers to promote gambling, because their public isn't mainly composed by gamblers or literate people on gambling matter. It's different, for an example, from us here on this forum promoting casinos, because this community is heavily composed by gamblers, potential gamblers and many others who have total comprehension capacity to understand how gambling works.But when the target public involves a large portion of people who don't have any notion about gambling, house edge, odds... It becomes problematic. That is the case of your friend who is going to rent his place to a casino shop. In every cases, I highly suggest him that between profit and conscience he should go for the latter, always. Conscience is peace of mind and solely money can't bring this.",

I am not too sure whether or not this is a good deal for the agent, but then again OP did not really give us any in-depth details. There might be a good reason why the agent is so eager to lease at such a disadvantage. Your friend should take his time on deciding and should not let anyone, especially the agent, rush him into a decision. When something seems to appear more urgent than it really is, especially with a deal involved, then there is probably a well-thought-out purpose behind it.",
