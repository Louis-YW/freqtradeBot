  "content": "While I sat on my couch thinking about how Bitcoin can help the society solve the issues of financial insecurity and poor money printing system. I also realised that for Bitcoin to remain relevant it need to be recognised by the society not even the government; if it must serve as a legal tender and a global store of value.It could be said many individuals both Bitcoin enthusiasts and less Bitcoin minded individuals even the so called government who tries to ban Bitcoin have adopted Bitcoin in their various capacities making use of the coin at their various interest both holders, traders, exchangers and users alike. So far political hindrances has built a bridge in the free use of Bitcoin across many nations, while some nations have free access to this unique digital asset some nations are saddled with restrictions.In all the most exciting thing is that Bitcoin is made for humanity to have freedom at last from selfishly regulated policies. The highest the government of various nations can do is set restrictions on Bitcoin but since it cannot be outrightly banned from the surface of the earth the society at large is still at the highest advantage. It will only take every enthusiast of Bitcoin to tell their neighbours who know nothing about Bitcoin its benefit and advantage and also remind those who are learned about Bitcoin that it has come to stay. It might not be the next globally accepted currency but someday it might work hand in hand with other payment gateways to make our spending more secure and decentralised. It has already begun but with time it will spread more like wild fire.",

As for cash many policies are been put in place to gradually send cash into extinction. It is either Bitcoin or we chose financial slavery",

      "body": "Bitcoin can be globally accepted if his value get stable, also the price is extremely high for a average person to hold btcs, but some can't help but being average so there is nothing wrong. Also all these scams and how easy is to just spend even year jobless but working on scams and cracks, can set you for life, but that's for us the young people, because this is the last year that financial freedom can be secured by the youth, and only way is malicious towards the numerous hollow adresses holdin milions, unless they do distribution of these wasted coins to everyone who is active, while they put efforts to get in touch with the owners for whole year and try another one, then just delete the adress. Because it all started looking so ponzi, people forgot that btc was made to be currency not investment, now is totally joke to be even considered, if you think it really deep. Its just a personal opinion. Crypto is good, but extremely unsafe, just not suitable for curency. Only the stable coins are. Most people dont even know that this coins have functions, not just investment and holdin it forever or filling the laundry",

Fiat currency is depreciating as time goes and this show that fiat can not be trusted to increase in value because inflation is natural in a country's economy. Bitcoin can be an asset for its investor or can be used for transactions depending on the holders intention. Bitcoin  wouldn't be used as the number one currency in the world due to its volatile nature.",

Bitcoin is very much independent but still, government has certan degree of influence on the currency as to its acceptance and being widespread. One of the major factors to have inhibited the currency today is the government and if the parts are changed, you would see it bloom.Hedging it only on society alone helps but, only if the government allows. What if the government makes it a criminal offence.  More of what we have now is, not having to recognise it but, making it a criminal offence that ca result in serious jail times, youvwould make bitcoin enthusiast skeptical and being skeptical on how you use your money is what we don't want. Government has a role, not so vital but,, just acknowledgement is good enough.",

Government policies have a lot of effects on Bitcoin adoption. Citizens will always be forced to obey government policies and if they disobey, it attracts severe sanctions. But in a democratic government where the people have representative in the legislature, the public can encourage their representatives to sponsor Bitcoin-friendly laws. But the issue is that most of these politicians will never allow the people to have financial freedom because it might affect these politicians negatively.      QuoteIt will only take every enthusiast of Bitcoin to tell their neighbours who know nothing about Bitcoin its benefit and advantage and also remind those who are learned about Bitcoin that it has come to stay.

When more people use Bitcoin, one can easily find someone that wants to buy or sell Bitcoin, which would reduce the influence of these centralized exchanges in our area.

      "body": "The biggest drawback to Bitcoin is (in my estimation) that it is not a literal, physical coin. Now, read the rest before you jump to the point that there are physical Bitcoins. This is different.What we need is real coins, that are electronic devices themselves, that can do one thing... hold and store bitcoin value... bitcoins in satoshi form. These coin devices would have to be:1. Simple and cheap to make, just like a dollar bill is cheap to print;2. Reasonably damage proof; cell phones are quite strong, even if most of them aren't waterproof;3. They need to be small enough that you can carry a bunch of them in your pocket easily, but large enough that they can't be lost easily;4. Being electronic devices, they need to have EMP protection, and be internally hack proof;5. It would be nice if they could transfer their value to a Btc wallet by plugging in to a more complex computer device;6. Right along with #5, it would be nice if they could display their current value, which could be changed with the owner's Btc wallet;7. Right along with the above, it would be nice if the coins were real coins that could be traded and accessed by each new owner, and tested right on the spot, to see if they were counterfeit or real.Now, I'm not suggesting that there aren't any other or better ideas to make the Btc coins perfect. And there will always be those people who want to hack them. But...The BTC coin would be simple. It would be like a little, finger-size, computer. It would be like a piece of an AXIC chip, designed for one thing... to hold Btc value. The only thing that could change the value would be if it were inserted into a special reader, that could take value off, or add value on. And, one could have a little 'checker device' on his keychain that would authenticate the Btc coin as being a valid Btc coin or not (besides looking at it to see if it looked right).What does anybody think?",
