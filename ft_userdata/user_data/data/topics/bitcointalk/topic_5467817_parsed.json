Do you know that I was once offended when I posted on this forum and when people began to reply, some used the word  OP which I thought it was an insult and I was so offended, Lol.  Anytime I tried going through the comment section, I continue seeing OP, so I was like, have I done something wrong not until I checked my  post and I saw OP then I noticed it means original poster. LolMy advice; dont give up the dream and don't read wrong meaning to what you don't know, the best thing is to ask. It is actually possible to grow on this forum, it may be a matter of time",
