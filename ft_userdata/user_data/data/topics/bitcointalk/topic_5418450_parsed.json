Especially when it comes to the higher-end coins. A verifiable chain of ownership is going to be important to verify and maintain that the owner was trustworthy, and the piece was well maintained and kept properly secure. We are dealing with secure cryptocurrency storage instruments. These things are not to be taken lightly. Especially with this market subsegment gaining acclaim and going mainstream. A chain of ownership will ensure a buyer that they are receiving a legitimate and secure cryptocurrency storage instrument (what these pieces are at the fundamental level). ¬†Who wants to buy something that otherwise has the potential to be compromised or fake? With a chain of ownership, a buyer could determine the piece was legit. So, is that a yes or no to my question about the PGP chain of custody",
