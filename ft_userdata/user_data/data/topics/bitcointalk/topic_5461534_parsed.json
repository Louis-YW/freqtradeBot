  "content": "Why are you using a new account?Because I don't want to be targeted by others.What happened?Rollbit seizes $10k from a user. When asked why the funds were seized, they didn't give a clear answer but mentioned \"The player is in profit\", which sounds like a horrendous reason to seize funds.There are other similar cases too.BitcoinGirl.club summed up very nicely (highly appreciated) - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449402.msg62338319#msg62338319Date of incident: 19th of April, 2023.What follows next?Bitcoingirl.club leaves negative feedback following the incident, explaining why they did so.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3261248Date of (-ve) feedback: 1st June, 2023Hhampuz manages Rollbit's signature campaign since 2021 but never left feedback for Rollbit.Following Bitcoingirl.club's feedback, 17 days later, on 18th June,  Hhampuz counters the feedback by stating \"I have worked with Rollbit for well over 2 years now and have never had any issues. Great people behind the scenes and an innovative casino where I've played lots without problems.\"Date of (+ve) feedback: 18th June, 2023Also important to note that the feedback was left to the profile where negative feedback was given. Although the casino's main profile is https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3067300 I think this is a clear case of Hhampuz misusing his position to counter a valid feedback. Neither he provides any reason or insight as to why the funds were seized although he claims to know the great people behind the scenes at Rollbit.A casino paying a promoter/manager and paying their players are 2 very different things. 1xbet, a known scam, pays their promoters but not players.Any casino would pay DT a sum of money to cover their shady practices such as seizing funds and don't have to give any explanation.2 flags were created against Rollbit and everyone supported the flag and provided reasons while Hhmpuz opposed the flag and didn't care to reason it.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3178https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3194I know signature campaign guys won't care to step up because Hhampuz will not take them into any campaigns in future. But I expect LoyceV and other reputed members to at least reply.",

I actually spoke with Hhampuz about this issue a while back because sometimes it feels like casinos use certain violations as a way to confiscate money, but a very good point was brought up. They cannot share some information to all of the forum. All they would be doing is making the scammers smarter by doing so. Users with a complain can ask the casino to agree to a outside ruling from casinoguru or askgamblers and some sites agree with that. You gotta realize that most of the time the accuser usually isn't sharing the whole story. They're sharing the part that makes them look like they were scammed. In most cases at least. Every now and then someone actually is telling the truth and usuaully the casino will fix the issue. I at 1 point felt like the guy got scammed but I don't know the whole story and gave the casino the benefit of doubt.I don't think Hhampuz leaving a positive trust for a casino he has had no issues with is vindicating a scam though.",

      "body": "Almost every crypto online casino is nothing else then mafias, they pretend to be your friend and are polite and helpful until you are lucky and winning big, then the problems start.I am little bit shocked to see all these scam accusing on this forum, and all problem seems to be when a player winning big, then they start to make up stories, request impossible KYC. They should get rid of their license and pay back all the money. Now with that said I don't say every casino is like this, but a lot of them seems to be like these, I been lucky and never had any problem with this, but never won millions either so maybe that's the reason. I normally only wager around $10k in a month & I am very happy where I play right now.Why can't everyone get a long and be honest, everything would be so much funnier then, because most of us love gambling and see it as a funny thing, but when things like this happens it take all the fun away. It's humans that have bills to pay you stealing from, and I am almost sure if you would have seen this people in front of you, you would not act like this, because if you see your victim it's not so fun.I don't understand this greed, you already make millions and millions and more millions, but it  does not seems to be enough... to all online casinos, stop being so greedy.Of course sometimes when they seize funds it's totally right and some people try to cheat, then they should ban them, but not against honest people.And one thing I don't understand, everyone I mean everyone, no matter of age or where you live, can deposit how much you want and play and lose... but not everyone can withdrawal winnings.If you can deposit you should always be able to withdrawal!! Always! Do your KYC and shit before anyone deposits and start playing! It would be so easy and would solve all problems, but of course it would minimize your earnings.. A LOT A LOT!It's sad.",

Always! Sorry my English is not so good and I am not a perfect speaker, I didn't mean to insult anyone.  What I saying is. I understand if someone has cheated that this can happen, but also it's a easy solution to this problem don't allow deposits before you accepted the user, if you want KYC from them take it, if not, don't do it, but then don't ask for it if them win big either.  My opinion is that right is right and wrong is wrong, and if someone hasn't done anything wrong, they should not be threat this way, but I they did wrong they may deserve it. But as I said, it's a solution to this, but if they would apply that, they would lose a lot of their income, so I understand why they don't do it. I think it's disgusting.Best regards. / CC",

LoyceV, Since you have some kind of interest to check, let me help.Since screenshots can be edited, forget about them and see what the accusation is and the roll bit response. The accuser said he started implementing a strategy where he could make easy money instead of placing blind bets. He started betting exclusively on low-odd matches like 1.003 -1.02 (He also places bets on a bit higher odds like 1.5). Quoting the accuser;Quote from: Stakemeharder on April 19, 2023, 07:53:34 AMI started to implement a strategy that I thought was going to make me money instead of just blindly betting without any thought process. The idea is to minimize your risk involved with bets and bet on extremely safe options that have low odds, 1.003 -1.02. The likelihood of you winning is high and you get the rakebacks involved. I typically would bet on CSGO over 18.5 rounds and they would hit more often than not. I must say I did lose around 5-6 of these bets on the csgo rounds. I also bet MMA with 1k bets on Israel adesanya in his last title fight, I do LOL at 1.5 odds. I bet basketball at 1.01 (Which failed more often that not) during live games. I liked Dota 2 as well just as it is fun to watch for me. I had a 5k bet at end of march at 1.02 odds for Aster to win a game in their match that lost. The majority of my bets were on random odds and not super low ones.  On April 15th, his account was disabled/banned, saying;Quote\"Hello there,Your account has been disabled permanently for abusing our Sportsbook feature.MoonlightRollbit\"Rollbit live support refused to provide detailed information about it. So, the accuser creates the scam accusation. Forum user holyarkness PMed Rollbit Razer about it, and they replied;Quote from: Rollbit Razer on April 20, 2023, 10:14:27 PMHey there,Firstly, thanks to holydarkness for letting us know about this thread!This one is a pretty standard Sportsbook abuse case that was flagged to us by our Sportsbook provider. Specifically, they were prolifically abusing bonus features that we offer alongside our Sportsbook offering.As OP has more or less included, they were told the same via our on-site support. This was not at the expense of the player as they finished in profit on Rollbit.Thanks,RazerAfter that, several Dt members, including holydarkness, yahoo62278, and BitcoinGirl.Club asked several questions to the accuser and Rollbit Razer. The accuser shared the information he had to share. Once again, Rollbit Razer replied;Quote from: Rollbit Razer on May 10, 2023, 07:21:34 PMPlease find our response earlier in the thread here.This was a case of clear-cut Sportsbook abuse, identified by our provider Betby. We explained the same to OP via our on-site support.To reiterate for anyone new here, the player is in profit.Thanks,RazerAfter this response, Rollbit Razer did not reply on this case anymore while the accuser is suspected of abusing the Rakeback system. They were placing bets on low-odd matches to wager and claim bonuses or something. The problem is Rollbit Razer did not share what he abused. This question from yahoo62278 remained unanswered;Quote from: yahoo62278 on May 10, 2023, 08:20:33 PMWhat is the abuse? He made bets that your site allows? From the screenshots I can see they weren't all winning bets and not all 1.01 odds or whatever bullshit you're saying he abused. If you don't want players collecting bonuses, then you shouldn't allow bonuses to be earned from certain bets. You offered and accepted the bet, deal with it. Him being in profit is irrelevant!!!It's insane that you penalize a player for making bets that you allow and accept. Why offer the odds if you're not going to honor them. Clear cut excuse for you guys to confiscate funds and not payout. Note: BitcoinGirl.Club, yahoo62278, examplens, and holydarkness observed the case. I guess they can share their thoughts about it. I believe Rollbit has other things to say except the player is in profit. After reading this post, You can continue to read the original post of this thread. Edit: I will take this opportunity to clear my position.I still believe the feedback from Hhampuz is valid, and there is no wrong.But, I also believe that flag opposition from Hhampuz without knowing the full case is throwing a blind shot. If he knows the full case, still supporting Rollbit, if you feel you disagree, then ~Hhampuz. Since I don't see Hhampuz supporting/opposing the flag too often, I believe he did it because Rollbit asked, which does not look good to me.",

With his years of management within the forum, for any allegation against Hhampuz to be taken seriously there needs to more than an aggrieved member not happy with positive feedback which he mistakenly sees as an endorsement of a scam.",

      "body": "No clients of mine would ever ask me to intervene in a case or give them positive feedback/support or oppose a flag from a position of power or legitimacy. I rarely even discuss these cases with my clients as I give my opinion on the matter to them in private if/when that happens. I'm not on DT1 and I've never asked to be put in these situations, at the end of the day I'm just a user like many of you, with my own opinions and thoughts on what's going on here.For this particular case, my personal belief is that this user took advantage of a system and came out ahead of it (profit). He then got called out for it by Rollbit and subsequently banned with any remaining funds confiscated. I do not see a problem with this. Had this user not been in profit, I would probably argue otherwise and give Rollbit some sort of ultimatums to get it solved. It's a matter of opinion. Some of you guys around here are extremely naive and have absolutely no idea what it takes to run a business. You can have all of your wishful thinking and your own opinions, which you are entitled to, but I am a firm believer in trusting businesses that deal in extreme volumes over single case users on this forum. I also am a firm believer in the service not having to share full details of what abuse any user has committed as that would only open the door for more abuse. It's actually quite simple - don't be an asshat and don't try and take advantage of these services and you will in 99.9% of cases never face any issues. Obviously the service can be wrong sometimes too, but most often it gets resolved quickly when that happens.I have had accounts on all gambling sites I promote without letting the client know that it's me, with major deposits/withdraws and thorough testing over long periods of time and I never face any issues. I've even been nasty to support reps just to see what would happen and never do they treat me wrong.So, if you are of the opinion that I'm in a position of power where I can silence users who have legitimately been scammed by a service that I run a campaign for - by all means ~Hhampuz. My feelings about this, and the smaller \"clique\" of users who love to farm drama and bad scam accusations will likely not change.Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",

      "body": "And why didn't you @OP login into your main account instead of this Newbie account you created today? I assume that you participated in one of Hhampuz's signature campaigns before, and you had no luck working with him, so you made up this drama.Indeed, the following proverb, \"Stones are thrown only at fruit-bearing trees.\" applies to the fact that you are discrediting a person who is one of the most trusted members of the forum and has worked for many years with many legitimate projects and casinos that have become famous and have reached their promotional goal through him.Hhampuz's job is to run & manage campaigns for which he works as a promoter and through which many hunters work in promoting a project or a casino. To be fair, I have seen for many years that he chooses his clients carefully. This manager did not gain this wide reputation overnight, and if the client who hired him had already paid him his job and the hunter's dues for many years without any issues, then why did he not write positive feedback as a result of this?Aside from the Rollbit issue, has Hhampuz forced any member here to play at any casino whatsoever that was promoted? Hhampuz is not a third party between the player, the casino, or one of the casino teams. As mentioned, his job is to promote only. It is the responsibility of any member or player to do his own research. It is unfortunate that any member violates the policies of any casino because he did not read the terms of use well or he used one of the crooked methods that led to his account being banned. He comes and publishes false scam accusations and accuses Hhampuz of vindicating scams!!!",

I've even been nasty to support reps just to see what would happen and never do they treat me wrong.This is quite clever of you and does you credit. But from what you say I have a doubt.Quote from: Hhampuz on July 31, 2023, 01:26:09 PMFor this particular case, my personal belief is that this user took advantage of a system and came out ahead of it (profit). He then got called out for it by Rollbit and subsequently banned with any remaining funds confiscated. I do not see a problem with this. Had this user not been in profit, I would probably argue otherwise and give Rollbit some sort of ultimatums to get it solved.How was he supposed to take advantage of the system without profiting from it? I believe that this hypothesis is unrealistic.",

I believe that this hypothesis is unrealistic.He's a degen, as most gamblers are, and while gaining profits he could have lost it all on a bad bet or just straight through the slot machines. You can definitely take advantage of a system and not be in profit, I've seen it myself.",

Because Hhampuz exists, hundreds of users of Bitcoin Forums are still earning from Bitcoin Forums by promoting their signatures. Hhampuz manager has been termed as an ideal idolman of bitcoin forum. Please refrain from making defamatory allegations against him.Hhampuz has never promoted a scam project and never will.@OP Thank you very much for bringing out a certain piece of virtues Hhampuz sir.",

If you have no claim at all and are simply a spectator that seems to think Hhampuz is behaving inappropriately then you have made your point, others have read it.Until or unless you are prepared to use your real forum name to make a complaint you are doing a disservice to the community therefore you should lock this thread.Quote from: JCLadisav on July 31, 2023, 01:21:12 AMBitcoinGirl.club summed up very nicely (highly appreciated) - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449402.msg62338319#msg62338319And what moral authority does that one member provide to your allegation? It is one member that you singled out from thousands and used him as an example of behaving positively/fairly but how does it bring any credibility to your claim from that one member? He is literally a nobody with no moral authority in the forum therefore what type of elevated status are you personally granting him?Quote from: JCLadisav on July 31, 2023, 01:21:12 AMAny casino would pay DT a sum of money to cover their shady practices such as seizing funds and don't have to give any explanation.2 flags were created against Rollbit and everyone supported the flag and provided reasons while Hhmpuz opposed the flag and didn't care to reason it.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3178https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3194I know signature campaign guys won't care to step up because Hhampuz will not take them into any campaigns in future. But I expect LoyceV and other reputed members to at least reply.What you are implying is that if members wearing a signature managed by Hhampuz post here, you will say their posts are fair/unbiased if they support you and any that oppose your claim will be dismissed because of alleged allegiance to the campaign manager. Do you realise how ridiculous you are sounding?Imagine if you were enrolled on one of his signature campaigns, that would be highly embarrassing for you. Maybe that is why you are not using your real member account.",
