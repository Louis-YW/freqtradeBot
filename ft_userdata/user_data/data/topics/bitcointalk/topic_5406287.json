  "content": "I transferred funds to my bitpay wallet from my electrum wallet, then to my bitpay Mastercard. I have preformed this numerous of times successfully.But this time, my funds appears to be \"trapped\". I transfer funds from my electrum wallet to my bitpay wallet, then transfer funds to my bitpay Mastercard,as usual. This time was really strange incident. When I checked to see if the funds reached my Mastercarddebit card,it states \"Unsent Transaction\", and list the funds that are trapped,also says \"Total Locked Balance\"0.009916 BTC. Under \"Spendable Balance\" it reads: \"LockedThe amount of bitcoin stored in this wallet that is allocated as inputs to your pending transaction proposals. The amount is determined using unspent transaction outputs associated with wallet and may be more than the actual amounts associated with your pending transaction proposals.\"Transaction Hash c6e957cfb8e766c95f6799e242b2b77dde17f14cc360701f8d3156431c566e4dI hope to hear from you reasonably soon, best regards,",

I have a serious headache now, what do I do??!I'm thinking of two possibilities -1 - Either the debit card has been frozen by Bitpay for some reason (not necessarily because of a malicious app, perhaps you made a payment to a buggy service, but it thought that it didn't receive any payment so it used standard banking protocol to raise a \"fraud alert\" to the bank) - you can test this by attempting a small donation to Wikimedia Foundation for example - if this is the case then you need to ask BitPay support to unlock it for you, your chances of success are higher if you have already completed KYC before this incident.2 - Perhaps there is a minimum amount that you need to send to the debit card to top it up, and you have sent somethine less than the minimum [it's not likely, given that you have successfully made this kind of transaction before].",
