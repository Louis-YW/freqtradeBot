      "body": "Sorry @av8rjeff and @minerjones, but I'm CANCELING this auction. There is not enough participation to make me comfortable with this, and the price is not worth my expense and effort. I expect it has much to do with the drama around the Titian 2FA coins. Don't send any funds. I'm canceling the flight and hotel I booked to deliver it.",
