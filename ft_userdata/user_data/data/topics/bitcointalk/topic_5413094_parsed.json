Although there are a lot of contradictory opinions about Solana lately, this asset is still one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization. If you are willing to wait 2-3 years and not touch SOL in your portfolio, you could give it a try. Next bullrun Solana may try to update its ATH and finally launch a full-fledged network, not a beta version, which is still filled with a bunch of bugs.",

For me, Solana has become a project that has a risk that exceeds other mainstream projects. We've recently heard some negative news about this project, ranging from unstable networks to major hacking cases on their network.There is no reason for me to say that Solana is the right investment and will go up this year.",

Because in online you will find many so called experts who give different types of updates without any basis. But Solana is still a top coin, this coin has high potential to do something big in the next bull market. So one must be very careful while investing and also be aware of what kind of risks one might face. Because no one can say for sure what Solana's next trend could be.",

If you think about inflation, most likely in cryptocurrencies, it is deflation if it has a limited supply. As for SOL, it has a limited supply but it's still a lot although it's on the top because of the NFT craze that we've seen for the past year and SOL has made a huge part on that thing.",

It is acceptable for a blockchain to have problems in the early days of development, as long as they try to fix it and constantly develop and improve, there is nothing to worry about. As far as I follow, the sol developers are still actively working, they still haven't given up on the project despite the recent problems. I think it's very difficult for Sol to get back to his old ATH but a move to $60, $70 is possible.",

Many companies use this network for any transaction. This is considered to compete with Ethereum much, moreover this offers a lower fee for transactions. Now we can see several exchanges also provide Solana network for transferring.If the utility is continuous and used many more, yes, I tink that this is worthy enough. But, ensure that you don't only invest in SOL, it is better to divide your money into sveeral top coins.",

To be honest i really would not give those analysts to much credit. Especially if they are just crypto influencers because 99% of them are not neutral, they just want to shill their own bag. In most cases they get access to investments into the seed or private round of a new project, which means they get the tokens way cheaper than normal people once the token becomes tradeable and for that they need to shill this project obviously.",

Don't take advice from experts broadcast in the media, I doubt their qualifications or they get paid to do it.About Solana, yes it used to be a good investment and its peak ATH is $260 in 2021. But is it still good now?, is it possible to return to the old ATh price? no one knows. Investing is risky, so you should do your own research and make your own decision.",

The bullish trend may make solana to go up again. Im sure that people aware about that. Solana ecosystem being used by so many people for their daily transactions. Im not feeling doubt if that will make solana to go up drastically once bullish trend will come.",
