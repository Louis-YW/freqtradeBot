It presently might not give us the same conclusion.Microstrategy Could Have Pocketed $1.3B if Saylor Had Bought ETHDefiant Data Crunch Shows Ether Would Have Paid Off Nicely for Software MakerMicrostrategy would have earned almost $1.3B from a stash of Ether worth $5.3B today, according to The Defiant’s analysis of data from CoinMarketCap and BuyBitcoinWorldwide tracking the firm’s Bitcoin buys. Thanks largely to The Merge, Ethereum’s native token has soared 51% since June 30 compared to Bitcoin’s 7% increase, according to Defiant Terminal data.The Virginia-based company would have also been earning passive yield by staking ETH. Staking Rewards estimates that Ethereum stakers are earning 4.67% annually, which would equate to $246M at the current ETH price.Moreover, analysis from Flashbots indicates that stakers running its MEV-Boost software earn 135% more than those who do not. Boosted rewards on a $5.27B stake could net more than $527M each year if ETH’s price is steady.Read in full https://thedefiant.io/saylor-ether-bitcoin",

      "body": "Just holding BTC and doing nothing with it shouldnt especially be a strategy for a business, Ive never really understood trying to argue in favor of that.   ETH has a system now where retained deposits are part of their confirmation network so the yield makes some sense.    So a bad strategy to retain BTC and let it sit vs actual use, the actual use has paid off is not that surprising.   Plus six months is still a random result not a proper basis to compare two assets.   The ETH attempt to implement staking could fail we dont know that yet, its far too early to declare victory but generally I do favor the concept of staking because it keeps the entire user base involved.   BTC has long since lost its mining by anyone origins which makes me sad.   All proper capitalist systems are means of production with the people, both routes are arguable I dont believe in BTC only because of that I think the alternatives explored elsewhere are worth doing; some think it only leads to fraud I appreciate creative activity and BTC can always adopt the best measures found.   Saylor is far too simplistic imo, storing any commodity forever  can easily end up costing you oil, food, gold, anything at all can decay even while being valid products.",

It appears this article shows that the argument might be correct.Better investments in terms of BTC value? Because, only ETH/BTC pair is trading stable through out 2022 like around the value of 0.07BTC with low at 0.048BTC whereas ETH/USDT pair is trading exact similar to BTC/USDT like in Jan 2021 it was around $900 and hit ATH around $4800 in Nov 2021 and trading around $1200 right now.If you calculate growth rate in USD in 2021, there are many altcoins had performed well in 2021 like dogecoins which got low around 30 satoshi in the beginning of 2021 (or by the end of 2020) and peaked up to 1300+ satoshi in 2021 (and trading around 400 satoshi right now).If they have opted for altcoins then probably they might not have stopped only with ETH which again might have got them mixed results and then overall performance might have dragged down than bitcoin investment.",

I said this was a joke. However, it opens an argument that what if Saylor invested in altcoins and it appears there are people who have asked this question already and published some articles.This is another article I found with more data. This was written on November 4.The Blockchain Center has a dashboard comparing MicroStrategy’s ‘actual’ and ‘what if’ crypto investments. Per data from the same, its current 130k BTC HODLings is currently worth $ 2.679 billion. However, if it had invested in Ethereum, the firm would be owning around 3.5 million tokens worth $5.596 billion. Resultantly, instead of being down by $1.304 billion USD, MSTR would be up by $1.614 billion with ETH.[/i]Source https://watcher.guru/news/if-microstrategy-invested-in-ethereum-over-bitcoin-what-would-be-its-valuationThis is the dashboard mentioned in the article. I will keep quiet, everyone should see this data.https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/there-is-no-second-best/I also agree on Saylor's long term argument for bitcoin as an investment. We will witness his investments in profit on 2025 or 2026.On Barry Silbert, bring your popcorn. It is not the altcoins' fault heheheheheheeee.",

I have to say that the best thing we could do about the current market situation is to make good investments unlike many people fail to do that.I know it is not going to be easy, but understanding ETH could be another investment opportunity in this crypto space as per investor perspective and investing into that is not a risk per so far observed performance tracks, but it is not bigger than bitcoin at least, which is important in my opinion as well.Micheal Saylor could invest into bitcoin or into ETH and the results would probably be the same, there will be small differences on the day to day, but the long term could be very important and that way bitcoin will win as we are all aware of.",
