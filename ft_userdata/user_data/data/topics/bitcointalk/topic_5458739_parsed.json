  "content": "I haven't seen a discussion about this fight, so here it goes. This are two Mexican warriors so I expect that this is a great war. The last fight of Navarette, we thought that we will see a upset, he was knock down by Liam Wilson. But he evetually got off the canvass and win the war and won the belt. We all know that Shakur beat the hell of out of Oscar Valdez, but he did make a comeback. So he is a hunt for another belt.Valdez is a slight advantage as per sport bookies at 1.5x, Navaratte, at 2.2x. For sure we will be treated by another great fight, and maybe it could go down as a version of Morales vs Barrerahttps://www.boxingscene.com/emanuel-navarrete-vs-oscar-valdez-official-august-12-glendale-arizona--175195",

      "body": "Yeah, Mexican vs Mexican, there will be some blood in the ring for sure.I think this is Valdez best weight though, that jump against Shakur really shows how small Valdez though against Stevenson and you can see the big difference. But you have to give credit to Oscar for showing in that fight.As for Navarette, he was exposed in the last fight, maybe he was too confident against Wilson and it's a wake up call for him.Key difference here will be the stamina as this could be a volume match, so if in the middle of the rounds Navarette gets tired, then I see Oscar taking over the fight.",

Both are Mexicans and as the OP said, if this fight became a war in and very difficult to judge and there could be a controversy, then a rematch and trilogy is needed to even settle the score.So right now, I can't see who is going to win, Valdez is already back on track, while although Navarette have taste the canvass for the first time against Wilson, doesn't mean at least for me that he has been exposed already. Just one of those fights that you don't see the punches coming and you are caught off guard. Although Valdez is the odds favorite, it might be good to throw money on Navarette, or even a draw.",

But Valdez was lose against Shakur, it doesn't look good compared to Navarette which only lose during his early days in professional fight.I think Navarette wouldn't able to KO Valdez, but he can still able to win via decision.",

His loss to Shakur was undoubtedly embarrassing, as he seemed outsmarted and resembled a punching bag. However, he should leave that behind and concentrate on his next bout. Just like Canelo, who experienced a loss against Mayweather but he came back strong and now has become a very popular boxer.",

Navarrete may be considered the underdog in this fight, but I believe he has the capability to win. He just needs to execute the right strategy, perhaps even replicating what Shakur did if possible. However, if Navarrete prefers to fight toe to toe, it could still be entertaining for the crowd, even though the advantage may not be in his favor.",

The thing with Oscar Valdez is that he usually bleed specially in his face.And Navarette is like an old school Mexican warrior that we have seen in the past. He will throw everything with vicious intent to knockout his opponents. And again, there might be no technique in him, just pure power so Valdez will have to respond as well so it might not go to the judges scorecard.",

So it's more on the psychological, not physical pain.So with that, I do agree with what others have stated, two Mexicans are entertaining to watch and will not disappoint their fans or even those who might see them for the first time. Valdez is the favorite because he is more of a technical fighter and the quality of his opponents that he face in the past. On the other have, Navarette is making a name of himself as a Mexican, just pure brawler that we love to see.",

We will have to see, the rivalry between Morales vs Barrera is different though, I mean it seems to be personal for those two Mexicans as they are brought up differently, with different background and that's why the rivalry is really that great.As compare to Valdez who resides in Arizona, or in the US while Navarette lives in Mexico.But if I'm going to bet on this fight, I might go with Oscar Valdez as more of a polish boxer as compare to Navaratte who just loves to throw a lot of bombs and it might cause him problems later in the round as he will get tired not hitting a mobile target in Oscar.",

And as you have said, Shakur is very sound and technical fighter and Shakur can't keep it with it even if he tries to be the aggressor.So yeah, just like the rest of boxing fans, two Mexicans will mean it's going to be as entertaining as other Mexican fights before and it could end up in a knockout or war for the rest of the twelve rounds.",
