  "content": "Greetings Everyone! I hope you're all doing well! As you may know, I presented this project to you all as a concept piecedesigned around the iconic Jan. 3rd 2009 THE TIMES front page layout.What I did not reveal, however, is that this release is actuallya loaded crypto puzzle disguised as a conceptual art piece!  The Limited Edition pieces of The Times Traveler contain an intricate crypto puzzle which I have carefully embedded into their design. In actuality, each Limited Edition piece is in fact a \"one off\" that has been printed from it's own unique source. You only need one Limited Edition piece to unlock the key ofThe Times Traveler, however, having a prototype or proof may help!The best part about our crypto puzzle contest is that you do not need to destroy any of the pieces to unlock the secrets of The Times Traveler, it is hidden in plain sight!  CoolStorage.org Presents...\"The Times Traveler\" Limited Edition16x20 Gallery Wrapped LOADED Canvas Crypto Puzzle Your purchase is the entry fee to receive a #011-#021 Limited Edition Canvasand register as a contestant in The Times Traveler Crypto Puzzle Contest   Once distributed, I will post one CLUE to help solve the puzzle!The first person to discover the secrets and unlock the key to The Times Travelershall receive all of the tasty BTCits that are locked away inside the canvases! (Along with some pretty sweet braggin' rights as the contest winner!)I do not think about these things before hand, I only try to create unique concepts and designs,but after researching, I do believe these are the first loaded canvases ever created.  Who will discover the secrets and unlock the key to The Times Traveler?  Only TIME will tell!  Available pieces:011 - minerjones  012 - ragilab  013 - MrCryptHodl  014015 - pinky1234  016 - Dernoste  017 - Geo  018 - MoparMiningLLC  019 - raritycheck   020 - Hookzup1  021 - Hookzup1  Price:  / $110 per canvas (shipping not included)Features: 1.5\" gallery framing and a quality 100+ year fade resistant canvas. * Mounting hardware will be included with each piece *Payment: Will PM detailsThank you all once again for your support, it is greatly appreciated!",

I have a solution! You just buy the corn to go towards this at the price BTC is now, and HODL your older devalued BTC, problem solved!   On a more serious note, we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here as I haven't set an exact price yet, however, I hear you and considered offering ppal as an option after reading your reply, but after thinking about it, if there was ever a concept piece I have designed for this space that should only be purchasable in BTC, this is that piece. Shipping is a different story, I will gladly accept ppal from trusted members for that expense. Thanks again man!",
