  "content": "This is a continuation of a previous discussion. Just as trading bitcoin with anything, such as fiat via bank account, credit card, altcoins, gift cards etc., you can also trade bitcoin for cash, or as I like to say it: cash for cash. Unfortunately, as bitcoin isn't accepted everywhere, if you buy / earn in bitcoin, you'll most likely need to get back to fiat to make purchases you can't do otherwise. Why?Well, advantages, guys. Censorship resistance, in both sides! No PayPal can reverse the transaction. Also, more importantly, privacy. Believe me, you do need privacy if you're selling like $10k+. It also comes cheaper, because banks charge a lot.  How to.There are various ways to complete such trade. Each comes with its own tradeoffs. The following is my list, but please write below your suggestions, if any (or correct me).Bisq. Rational for the most popular, censorship and privacy respecting decentralized exchange to have such option. There are two options, in fact. Meeting with somebody face-to-face, and sending cash by mail. At the time of writing this, there are two of the former (both located in Birmingham, UK) which charge a 10% and 15% premium accordingly. For cash by mail, there are more reasonable prices, because there are more offers (5). Edit: Hodlhodl and AgoraDesk allow this too, see post #5.Bitcoin ATMs. I don't like this at all, because not only do they charge extraordinarily for even small amounts (~8%), but they also do KYC. Sorry, but you can't have both. I honestly don't understand why would one want that; it's better to complete KYC traditionally on a CEX, and then withdraw all of it with minimum fees. Both options provide zero anonymity, while the latter is cheap.Use forum(s). You're free to create a thread and request for such trade in the Currency exchange board, but it comes with disadvantages such as minimum liquidity and in-forum positive feedback likely required.Trade with people you already know.I address to all of my dear forum users to take advantage of this minimum price competition, as long as it's possible in their places. Create an offer at Bisq, and just enjoy the absence of liquidity. Acquiring anonymously is priced more than $17,000. See how it goes. I myself will try it out if I need to withdraw some bitcoin.What's your opinion about this? Do you think it might be needed now that most countries have been hostile with regulations?",

Those are all fixed, if they have 0 customers for a couple of days, the people still want to get paid, the stores still collect rent and so on. The KYC is independent of all of that.-Dave",

On HodlHodl type \"In Person\" in to the \"Payment Methods\" search box, and on AgoraDesk you can choose either \"Cash by mail\" or \"Cash (locally)\" from the drop down menu.I would add a fourth method to your list, which is \"Trade with people you already know\". Have you traded with the same person on Bisq a few dozen times with no issues? Have you made friends with people at bitcoin meetups? Do you have friends or colleagues from non-bitcoin walks of life who also use bitcoin? Having an established relationship and mutual trust with your trading partner can make the process so much easier, as well as potentially allowing you to bypass using a trading platform and escrow (therefore saving time and fees) provided you have enough trust with the other party.",

No. Each time I've used Bisq to trade is with Revolut, and each time I used different seller (as my payment history in Revolut is concerned). I don't talk to them at all, I just picked a trustworthy one (who was signed up there for like 2 years) and everything went smoothly. If you've done, please answer me these questions of mine:If you don't have a reputation in the DAO, what kind of protection do you get in case such stranger wants to rip you off? Sure, he might look trustworthy, according to the offer table, but can you risk trading without Bisq?Do want to trade likewise to avoid the DAO fee?Can you become part of the DAO somehow, and set your own fee as arbitrator? Competition is what would lower the prices, and I'm sure part of high trade fees is small number of arbitrators.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on January 10, 2023, 08:55:12 AMDo you have friends or colleagues from non-bitcoin walks of life who also use bitcoin?Yes, but I don't want to mess relationships with bitcoin trades, as I may bring them to an uncomfortable situation. No friend is ever going to charge me for like 10% above the average, while he should to, according to the market price.

Nor would I want to sell bitcoin for cash whenever a friend requested it in the same price.  Did you have some bad experience in the past that makes you so reluctant to trade bitcoin with friends? I am asking because I am trading with friends for years and never really had any issues. We use Coingecko to determine the price and buy/sell according to that, without any fees of course. I even met with strangers to do transactions and again never had any issues whatsoever and every trade was done without the fee, whether I was buying or selling.",

Sure, he might look trustworthy, according to the offer table, but can you risk trading without Bisq?The point I'm making is that by this point it isn't a stranger. Without revealing too much for my own privacy reasons, there is another party I first met through a DEX and whom I have traded with probably 100+ times over many years, both in person and electronically. There comes a point where you have enough mutual trust to start trading small amounts without using the DEX and/or escrow, and then building from there. Obviously I would never suggest going off-DEX with a stranger.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 10, 2023, 09:35:06 AMDo want to trade likewise to avoid the DAO fee?It was convenience rather than fees, but no one is going to say no to paying lower fees in any situation.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 10, 2023, 09:35:06 AMCan you become part of the DAO somehow, and set your own fee as arbitrator?

No looking for people to trade with, no waiting for someone, no worrying if you are going to somehow get scammed. And so on, you put in cash and get BTC or you put in BTC and cash pops out of the machine. There is a cost for convenience.Humor, and unrelated but it makes the point. Back in the early 1990s there was an earthquake in southern CA, there were people complaining that some of the local convenience stores were price gouging / profiteering on the fact that they had things that people needed and were marking it up because of the earthquake. They actually were not, they were just that overpriced since they are convenience stores. Get in get what you want and get out....-Dave",

For smaller amounts, the easiest way to do this is to meet at an ATM and for the party buying the bitcoin to withdraw the cash directly from the ATM and immediately hand it over. For larger amounts, you can either do the same thing but at a bank where you can withdraw more than at an ATM, or you can meet at a bank and have the bitcoin seller deposit the cash prior to releasing the bitcoin from escrow. I remember you mentioning a casino before, and it is a nice option. I do wonder if a casino would take issue if they discover what you are doing, though, as you are essentially converting currencies on their premises. This is another bonus of what I was talking about above regarding trading with the same person dozens or even hundreds of times.

Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on January 15, 2023, 05:47:12 AMi always thought they were p2p type thing. but they did pull out of the usa unfortunately. decreasing available ways to get bitcoin in the process.They have always been P2P, but many years ago they swapped from a site purely listing peer-to-peer trades (much like HodlHodl is now), to requiring accounts, verification, KYC details, and centralized wallets. So although you still trade peer-to-peer, it is entirely centralized and therefore, like all centralized exchanges, neither private nor secure.Quote from: larry_vw_1955 on January 15, 2023, 05:47:12 AMi don't understand why there would be people wanting to buy btc using paypal when they could just buy it from paypal (https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto) and send it out wherever they want to.Well, because PayPal will log your bitcoin purchases and transactions against your real name and identity and hand all that information over to blockchain analysis companies. But as mentioned I would steer well clear of PayPal at all times.",

But as mentioned I would steer well clear of PayPal at all times.maybe that's why. another reason might be paypal reports crypto transactions to the irs or other government taxing authority not sure if they do but i would assume so. anyone using something like bisq or agoradesk is not a newbie and they have their reasons. no one just wonders on to a site like that and starts buying bitcoin with paypal. it's either some or all of those things or they are trying to scam.",
