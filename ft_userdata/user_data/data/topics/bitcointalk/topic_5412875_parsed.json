  "content": "For crypto assets, stability is very important - there is a token that can provide it.Cryptocurrencies in general remain a high-risk asset with high volatility. Profit is usually not guaranteed and depends primarily on luck. However, there are coins that have the greatest chance of success due to their own ecosystem with millions of users, for whom the token is not just a digital asset, but a real means of payment for real services. For example, the AVA token from the Travala.com tourism project. Started as a startup in 2017, Travala.com has now grown into the largest cryptocurrency booking portal for hotels, accommodations, and flights. You can pay with several dozen coins on it - but the maximum benefit arises with your own AVA token. It is worth talking about it in more detail. What is AVA? AVA is a Binance Chain (BEP-2 token standard) based token for use within the Travala.com ecosystem. From a technical point of view, AVA contains all the protocols that are standard for \"normal\" tokens. Its obvious value lies in the huge bonus system and the opportunity to earn. Now Travala.com offers users more than 2.5 million accommodation options, from the highest budget hostels to five-star hotels and villas. Flight bookings cover 230 countries and territories, over 600 airlines, and over 90,000 destinations. Travala doesn't have the taxes, fees, and commissions you'd expect from traditional booking sites. This means that through the portal you can receive reservations at prices, in some cases 40% lower than those of competitors can. There is a low price guarantee, which makes working with the portal as efficient as possible. Using AVA you can get even more bonuses. First, AVA is a stable and constantly growing token. Since the start of the project in 2017, when it cost $0.3, its cost has grown to 90 cents. In the wake of the hype, AVA can rise in price to $3 or even $5 per token, usually due to restrictions affecting tourism. It could be the coronavirus or sanctions restrictions that make it difficult to pay with regular bankcards. As a rule, this happens 1-2 times a year. But even if you do not guess with the conjuncture, AVA is growing steadily.Moreover, the internal policy of the project makes it possible to get even more profit. The project is guaranteed to accrue 24% per annum on the balance in the wallet. Averaging, 1 AVA is now worth $ 1 - you can evaluate the uniqueness of these conditions yourself. It is unlikely that you will be able to quickly find a bank that is ready to provide such a program. You can earn some money just inside the service. For example, for registering a friend using an invitation link, you will receive $25 - if the invitee books a ticket or hotel for an amount of $200 or more. After his flight or accommodation is completed, both of you will receive $50 for two. The number of invitees is not limited, so if you have an extensive database of contacts, you can get good money. Self-registration will bring bonus $10. Is AVA able to bring significant profit? Yes, at least 24% per annum. If you are lucky, you will be able to successfully sell constantly growing tokens and at more favorable conditions. To do this, you need to follow the global tourism industry - for example, now a huge number of citizens of Russia and other countries, who are unable to pay for tourism with their usual bank cards, are switching to AVA. This is noticeable by the sharp increase in coins in circulation, their volume has been growing in arithmetic progression since spring. It is possible that such events will become a booster for AVA, which will enter the corridor of 2-4 dollars per token by the end of autumn.",
