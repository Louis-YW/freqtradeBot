  "content": "Good day, folks, I was at a supermarket in my home city here when a lady stepped in with two policemen. I thought they were just escort, but they weren't. The woman had to call the police on the manager of the supermarket because the three cans of beef she bought earlier that day were all expired. She did not notice they were expired until she got home, and her curious daughter was even the one who looked up the date and told her mom it was expired \"as the explanation goes.\" The manager pleaded, saying he was not aware the canned food was expired because he usually evicts every expired product from the shop, but that one he claimed not to be aware of.I know I always check the expiration date of eatable items before consuming them. Things are much more expensive now, and due to that, some particular items don't really move the market and can expire in the hands of the seller, and without them also knowing, they can fail to remove them from the shop, which, if any customers consume them, would result in some health issues.Some of these canned foods have an expiration date that is always at the top, bottom, or side; please always check before buying or consuming them.Quote\"If you do eat a food past the expiration date [and the food] is spoiled, you could develop symptoms of food poisoning,\" said registered dietitian nutritionist Summer Yule, MS. The symptoms of foodborne illness can include fever, chills, stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.\"www.insider.com/what-happens-if-you-eat-food-that-went-bad-2019-2%3fampHealth is Wealth, so please friend always be cautious of what we consume, (drugs is not also exclusive but I think doctors, physicians and pharmacist are more careful on that to not deter their profession).Do you have the habit of always checking the expiration date of things you buy?Thanks for reading",

If it's in advance nation's the manager can be arrested and sued for selling expired goods which in turns will be fined to pay the victim customer. Most of this goods both consumable goods which are mostly perishable and other humanly used goods are sometimes kept on purpose by those management in other to reduce loses. I can recall an incident which happened earlier last year and it also repeated this year, I went to a big cosmetic shop to get body cream for my kid sister, forgot to check the exp date at the shop and I took the cream home, she called me later the next day complaining that the cream color is no longer as usual which I told her that maybe the company might have decided to change the cream color. She said okay. When I later check the cream container I realize that the exp date was scratched out which I believe was an intentional act by those sellers.",

      "body": "Some products you can buy after expiration date, like bread, cookies, coffee, tea for example, but not milk, meat, fish, eggs etc. But shops are looking for this, so in practise you can not find the products in shops after expiration dates. In Europe and in some other places too people can buy after expiration dates, because they are educated in buying and some local shops and markets offer this. For example, today I bought cheaper coffee in the local market, which expiration date was in February 2023. So called food poisoning after expiration date is very dangerous and can happen with meat, milk, eggs, fish, especially with canned meat and fish, and evey canned product, so buyers must be smart and educated, if they want to buy products after expiration dates. Food poisoning can happen also with bread with fungal growth, so buyers must look at that bread too.",

Reason being that they believe germ doesn't kill Africa man, which I want them to change such mentality and orientation towards handling germ or expired food because same body and soul we all have, same effects which would likely affects everyone there is not limitations if we don't carefully take good care of our body and avoid some forms of food we consumed. Just as they do say \"Man is the Architect of his life, after God\".",

I was very surprised to find out. but I already ate ðŸ™‚. Next time I will check the expiration date first. but for canned food I always look at the expiration date first.",

      "body": "This is one of the ways to prevent a health issue. The most effective way to prevent a health issue, is to check the expiration date of food or foods you consume. That is what you need to do, and it is also the most effective method. You will feel like the owner of a product you purchase is using, which will probably lead you to the person at your local supermarket, because after the purchase the customer would see the manufacturer and purchase a new product which the grocery consumer will then look at buying. And once that's done the price will increase until the price is finally reached. It is also important to note that this doesn't just happen for physical purchases. People who do this also spend a large amount on the purchase of products they find most useful, and after buying a product, they end up selling it.",

      "body": "It is very important to check all your food expiration dates before purchasing and taking your food home. From experience I can tell you that a had a bad case of food poisoning, all because I was too stubborn to realize that the turkey ham that I bought at the store was long past its expiration date. At first when I got the turkey ham out from the packing, a funky but not stinky smell was coming from the turkey ham. I looked and touched the turkey ham and it had clear cream on the ham. I still went ahead and cooked it with some eggs. Afterward like some 30 minutes later. I started having some bad stomach pains, I also started sweating and had to go to the bathroom because I got diarrhea. But that is not all it only got worst because I started vomiting all the ham and eggs that I had made for breakfast. This could have all been avoided if had only taken an extra second to look at the expiration date on the turkey ham that I purchased. So yes, take the time to check your food and avoid yourself getting food poisoning.",
