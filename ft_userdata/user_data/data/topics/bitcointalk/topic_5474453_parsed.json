I doubt too that you can stick to No KYC feature forever with the existence of regulators around. You should add the main website on your thread by embedding the URL on the picture attached or embed it on the text for the exchange name. But I doubt someone will be interested here to invest on exchange that launch presale on pinksale.",

There are no dates in the roadmap, it is not clear when what is written there will be realized. And yes, as written above, specify the address in your post. It's inconvenient to type it in manually.",

This is a kind of marketing for a startup. Let's see how the project proves itself, maybe it will grow in quality and become popular.",
