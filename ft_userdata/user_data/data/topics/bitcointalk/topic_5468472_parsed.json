  "content": "Cloudbet and their master license holder played a dirty game that cost me a whopping 1BTC (equivalent to $40,000 AUD). I fell for Cloudbet's marketing email that boldly claimed they had been \"serving Australia's crypto community since 2013.\" Their website further boasted as \"Australia's best Bitcoin sports betting site.\" It all seemed legit, so I decided to dive in and start betting.https://imageupload.io/Y2OEoBhqXPVsfDnhttps://imageupload.io/RRQmFE7ewCCvPtKBut there was a twist: I later discovered that I was in a prohibited jurisdiction, it’s illegal to offer unlicensed gambling services in Australia and Cloudbet had been banned from operating in Australia for over a year. I felt deceived, to say the least.https://imageupload.io/fTLhE7kUfnKUM3oNaturally, I reached out to their support through chat, hoping for some clarity. The representative confidently reassured me that they were \"fully compliant,\" \"licensed,\" and \"regulated\" in Australia. https://imageupload.io/p5Men0xV0phlSq2Next, I decided to escalate my concerns to their master license holder. To my dismay, they seemed to take Cloudbet's side and firmly stated that Cloudbet did nothing wrong in code words (because I barely understood what the hell they said). It felt like a dead-end, and I couldn't make sense of it.https://imageupload.io/sycGangvZDXnkhSBut then,  Just a week later, I received an automated email notifying me that Cloudbet was no longer accepting Australian players. They essentially restricted accounts to withdrawals only, scrubbed all Australian marketing content from their website, and added Australia to their terms and conditions as a prohibited jurisdiction.https://imageupload.io/NlsyQWsUgovnFzQhttps://imageupload.io/IEt9FoHjiLuXWu9I strongly suspect that the master license holder pretended to side with Cloudbet, only to bare them the burdon of having to return my money, then made them fix their act.I also received an email stating that the chat representative who made false claims about Cloudbets legality in Australia was “misguided” and it was a mere “human error”. What the hell how does that explain the Australian marketing emails and Australian targeted content on their websites homepage. They even had a blog post explaining how Australians can buy crypto to transfer to Cloudbet.Despite this, they refused to take blame for anything or return my funds..https://imageupload.io/MwiXTed5x6AYEi3On Reddit, I spotted a response from Ronnie at Cloudbet to another user facing a similar ordeal. Ronnie claimed that they allow players in restricted territories to withdraw their deposits before closing their accounts. However, the results of any bets made are void. So why haven't I received my deposited funds back?https://reddit.com/u/illermrmiller/s/O4U6ZmFsOcCloudbet now refuses to respond and so does the master license holder “Curacao Egaming”.",

In the complaints thread that can be found online  (prior to the 27th) the moderators confirm that Australia was not in the terms and conditions as a prohibited jurisdiction and that Cloudbet is at fault. In my opinion, they did cost me 1BTC. I would never have dabbled on their website (eventually resulting in losses) if it weren’t for their marketing. In most first world countries there are strict rules with what you can and can’t advertise regarding gambling. It’s a sensitive subject given the amount of problem gambling that exists that’s ruining peoples lives. In this case, we have Cloudbets  maliciously false advertising with clear cut bad intent, any court would rule losses as a fault of the operator.Quote from: ScamViruS on September 30, 2023, 05:09:58 PMWhat I found on their website is that this website is prohibited for gamblers from Australia.

It's a harsh reality but it's the truth. This argument lacks depth. Buying a BMW and later regretting it is not comparable to the situation with Cloudbet..What if the BMW wasn’t as described? What if the car salesman actively lied to you at point of purchase and you have evidence? What if the car you were ultimately sold was actually illegal to drive in your country?Would you still sit there and blame yourself or somehow shift liability to the party who made false representations?I can’t believe this is even a discussion.Quote from: Lucius on October 01, 2023, 10:06:21 AMQuote from: Abzzy on September 30, 2023, 05:53:34 PMHi Lucius, Warn players from my country?

This is far more than losing money and that I “think” I was lured in.First of all, don't post multiple posts in a row, it's against the rules of the forum - you can reply to the posts of several users in one post.Regardless of everything, you can still ask the casino to return what you lost, especially if there is already a similar case that you can refer to, but it is obvious that they (the casino) will try to avoid it in all possible ways without breaking the law. All you have to do is be persistent and use all available platforms in order to achieve what you want. Honestly, this is the first time I've come across a case like this, because first they allowed you to gamble even though by law you shouldn't have been able to, and now that you've lost you can legally ask them to return your deposit. No matter how this case ends, everything that happened leaves the impression of unprofessionalism on the part of the casino, and I wonder if the Australian authorities will take any action, given that the casino operated completely illegally in Australia.",

If it was the other way around and OP won his bets and withdrew his money successfully, do you think he would have returned the money if Cloudbet realized where he is from, that they made a mistake, and now want their winnings back? I don't think so. He most certainly wouldn't if they didn't take legal actions and sued him.Cloudbet's wrongdoings in advertising and offering online gambling services to Australians should be a separate case from OP wanting back what he lost fair and square. They should face consequences for it. OPs request doesn't make sense to me. A world in which we can gamble, loss, and then ask for our money back because we were mislead and misguided. Look around you. You are misguided by everything you consume. Awful food, sugar-infested beverages, alcohol, cigarettes, crappy technology you don't need... consumerism and false advertising on every street corner. Filter out the things you don't need in your life or live with the consequences. If you decide to gamble and lose, that's your problem. If you gamble and win but the casino won't pay you, you deserve your winnings and they are scammers. End of story.",

We saw saw anything rom the \"big upcoming lawsuit\" .  You being in Australia has no impact on you losing your money. You bet on the wrong horse, chose the wrong number or whatever. That's solely your fault and you will net get 1 satoshi back.So sick of these people here. There are members that have real problems with casinos but these kind of stories are just so boring.",

There are members that have real problems with casinos but these kind of stories are just so boring.You use terms like “free roll” and “extorting” . You disregard the ample amount of evidence online that Cloudbet don’t pay winnings when your playing from a prohibited jurisdiction, I even supplied an example in my post.You ignore the fact that gambling is a REGULATED industry, given that an operators behaviour has serious impacts on a players decisions and his/her losses.You ridicule “law suits” however Araxio was taken to court for this very same reason a few months ago, the court of Curacao executed foreign judgements and all players funds were to be paid, reason being the appropriate license was not held by the operator in the relevant jurisdictions Roelof Bijkerk was the lawyer, working with SBGOK, look it up.He is the lawyer I’m currently dealing with, and he suggests funds would need to be paid back on the back of an Australian judgement - which is easily attainable yet time consuming.. I’m surprised that you know so much more about a players rights than legal representatives that have experience in this field and are based in Curacao.I’m sick of people like you and the ignorant  blaming of the victimised players is getting boring.Quote from: Pmalek on October 01, 2023, 03:45:09 PMQuote from: Lucius on October 01, 2023, 01:08:48 PMRegardless of everything, you can still ask the casino to return what you lost, especially if there is already a similar case that you can refer to, but it is obvious that they (the casino) will try to avoid it in all possible ways without breaking the law.

End of story.       In what world is, the wrongdoings in advertising and offering illegal gambling services a separate issue? How did you come to the conclusion of losing “fair and square” when you just mentioned wrongdoings in advertising and illegal gambling services.As per Cloudbets terms and conditions, betting from a banned jurisdiction gets your account closed and funds confiscated, so how exactly is baiting users in to breach your terms and conditions with false ads, to ultimately have the ability to close accounts and confiscate winnings betting  fair and square?Also, all those examples you gave e.g awful foods, cigarettes and crap technology have a distinct difference and shouldn’t be given as examples, they are legal.",
