Just wanna hear your opinions here. The main focus of such projects is to create hype in order to gain as many users in short amount of time as possible. Most of those projects gain so many users with those hypes that they don't need any other marketing tactics. The influencers when find that such coins can be rewarding for them because the hype is already created, they begin creating videos about such coins to earn money from the advertisements. This game runs for sometime and then those early investors sell their possessions and the coin starts getting dumps.Those coins are basically useless but due to huge userbase of such coins their price can go very high in short amount of time. It's always a reality in the world of crypto-currencies, when a coin gets more users the price increases because of the marketcap. The more users mean more money invested into the project, and that means the value of the coin will reach higher levels within short amount of time.The users who invest in such coins in the initial days are the ones who make a lot of profit. I remember the time when the hype was created for Dogecoin, and people started accumulating as many of the coins as they possibly could. Although, in my eyes Dogecoin is a useless meme-coin but because of the hype its value crossed $0.71$ in value. No one expected that a meme-coin could go that high. The same happened with Shiba, and then Terra Luna. The created hype can be a very dangerous thing and those who rush buy a coin during the hype will mostly lose their investments. The ones who manipulate the market by creating such hypes have already accumulated so many units of that coin. They create the hype to earn as much in short amount of time as they possibly can. Such whales sell out their possessions when the coin starts dumping, and during the process they make their profit. The ones who buy it at peaks will always lose the game. Some of those will hold the coin in belief that one day they'll get their money back, while others sell it after sometime. That's how the market works, and the less knowledgeable investors will always be prey of the predators.",

Just wanna hear your opinions here. Every promoter or influencers will target their work on the aspects of convincing you enough on this regards on the aspects of fear of missing out, they will give you an assurance on hope that will dash out later by telling you you're more secured with them and make many instances of them making a good ground on that same aspect, this is what they make sure they do to engage people onboard to their system and later for you to begin to discover some bugs with choosing them or their scam promotions they were being paid to conduct.",

Unfortunately for most projects they cause FOMO solely to pump the token price, not necessarily to attract protocol/project usage.",

In my opinion, this is exactly what you should pay maximum attention to. At least I try to give it as much time as possible when choosing.The fear of not loosing one's money on investment begins to be the bone of contention especially in times when you're not sure of been given the access or privilege to make withdrawals, through the exchange being used or when you don't even know the cause of these embargo made on you, also there are points where you begin to exercise fear about the state of crypto market especially when bitcoin is going bearish.",
