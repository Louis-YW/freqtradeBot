Relating it to how gambling addiction got them depressed, make them later commit suicide. Gambling addiction also make them always lack money because they are always using all their money to gamble and sometimes they borrow money to gamble and lose. If he does not want his life to be like that, that thinking of gambling to earn that make him addicted and he should change. This may likely begin to convince him to stop addiction.",

There seems to be a rise of gambling addiction related topics again here on the forum. I am wondering if really more people are struggling with an addiction now or if the older topics are just not so present anymore. You can find a lot of material here that will help against your struggles. Personally, I don't have any real experience with gambling addictions, but we had other cases of addictions in my family. I know a few people who gamble a lot and even I gamble regularly since i turned 18, but it's not really an addiction. I can take breaks from gambling without having the urge to gamble. From what I learned from other addictions is that you need a clean break at least for a few years. It's hard to get back to a normal routine without the addiction and the risk of falling back is quite high.",

This is going to be weird to you OP but this solution of opening up to them is the most out of touch advice that I've heard before, addicts hide their addictions or habit from people that they love for a reason that only those addicts know, what you're saying in all of this stuff is pretty easy for you to type because you're not an addict yourself although I could be wrong about it because there are some reformed addicts out there that will do the same advice but I got to say, you are leaning too much on being an out of touch with your advice. Of course they want to do that, but they can never do that unless they do it themselves, remember that if someone wants to get some help that they need to help themselves first because outside help be useless when the person is not willing or wants the help.",

But the thing is that gamblers are not going to admit to themselves that they addicted, hence it's going to be very hard for them to open up to someone unless it's too late or a family member notice it and then have to give him or her the advise to quit gambling as it is not doing any good for him and the consequences are worst that the gambler can imagine.So it's really a dilemma for someone who wanted to help a gambler. And it takes a lot of guts for the gambler to admit and to reach out to someone before it's too late. Hopefully this will be the case, someone out there, that is really losing big sum of money and reaching out before they hit rock bottom and waste everything because of gambling.",

They should accept the fact that they have a problem first and it is almost impossible to make them admit that they have a problem. If they realize their situation, then the rest of the solution will follow quickly. The biggest challenge here is, they will never accept that they are sick. To them, gambling is the way of life just like drinking water. If I tell somebody to stop drinking water, he will call me crazy. That is exactly how an addict sees gambling.These people have serious mental problems which should be treated by serious professionals. Common people like us can’t do anything about it sadly.",

Only thing that change and made a U-turn is suddenly I lost the means to make money as I lost my job and with no money coming in, then I have to stop it until I get a job again. But this time I learned my lessons already and so I minimized by gambling activities or even quit for a year or so.",

There's a problem though, we see each other so occasionally like once a year only and this year I never got to see him. I knew that he was near that kind of problem when he kept on asking for digital cash from me although he was paying it with cash, he just didn't have the means to put it in digital cash so he had to buy some from me. Twice I deposited money in his account $10 each in our currency which is a lot of money for an average family. First, I didn't know what he was up to but when I saw him not talking to anybody and his eyes were attached to his phone the whole day, that was when I tried to talk to him. But he just said he and his wife were both doing it and sometimes they win. It's sad to see a friend go that way but it's also difficult to say anything that would not hurt his feelings. I think that's the hard part of being a good friend, there's a chance you will be misunderstood and they will cut your friendship just because of it.",

Many of them are not willing to talk about it because they are scared of being talked about as a gambler. That's one taboo that's still in our society and that's why instead of getting some help, they don't want to because of that reaction that they'll get from the people that they'll talk about their gambling addiction. The good part today is that we've got helplines globally and they can be anonymous asking for some help and find someone to talk with on how they're going to overcome with that problem.",

It's easier said than done, based on my own experience I prefer to keep it to myself because I don't want to be judged by people around me they have respected me, and by letting them know about my addiction they might look down on me, I cured my addiction without people around me that I become addicted to gambling, if you're going to tell about your addiction it necessary to people who are close to you, you should tell this to people who can understand you and who can lead you to the right path to recovery it's better to people who deal with addiction, preferably to professional because they understand your feeling and will not easily judge you.It's ok to ask for help but help that will not betray your trust and knows how to help you get cured from your addiction.",

But so far, perhaps only a few gambling addicts are willing to be open with other people, especially people who are close to them, and talk about their gambling addiction. Moreover, they keep their gambling addiction to themselves without wanting to tell people about it and that makes them deeper into gambling and it becomes difficult to cure their gambling addiction. I don't think I have found anyone who is truly addicted to gambling and then comes to me and tells me about his situation. But maybe, if I remember correctly, some complain about their gambling problems, especially when they experience a lot of losses. But they don't seem to have a serious gambling addiction. Maybe it's just the beginning of a gambling addiction and fortunately, they are aware of their situation and are willing to change their gambling habits. Hence, they really reduce their gambling activities. Some of them can completely give up gambling and even if he is invited to gamble again, he just smiles and says I don't gamble anymore.This problem of gambling addiction can spread if it is not treated seriously. Those who initially just gambled for fun but in the end, they couldn't control themselves and got deeper into gambling until they finally experienced a gambling addiction and many ended up with a serious gambling addiction. This really requires serious attention from gamblers to really be able to reduce their gambling activities so that they don't become excessive.",
