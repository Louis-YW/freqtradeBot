Enter MicrovisionChain, a cutting-edge blockchain that has been designed to solve the “blockchain trilemma” by leveraging the bitcoin UTXO model. And with Metalet Wallet, the first wallet extension based on this new blockchain, users can experience the many benefits of this emerging technology.The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model is an essential component of the Bitcoin blockchain technology. This system is designed to manage financial transactions more securely and efficiently than other traditional account-based approaches. The UTXO model works by maintaining a detailed record of all spent and unspent financial transactions on the blockchain network. Each individual transaction is recorded on a separate UTXO entry, enabling Bitcoin users to transact more flexibly, securely, and privately.https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/0*BgmOhBiH2Y0dsKNgAdvantages of Metalet Wallethttps://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*IwIdcrm6mGDZZyF2AFys0g.pngUTXO Model Support:One of the major benefits of Metalet Wallet is its support for UTXO model wallets.
