  "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience diving into the world of mining and crypto. I purchased three L3+ machines and enjoyed a nice profit from hashing on Nicehash for Bitcoin mining. However, with minimal knowledge, I delved into futures trading, following a paid signal WhatsApp group with just $500. I would enter trades with $200, experiencing some quick wins, making $50 or $100, but ultimately losing it all. Despite earning around $3,000 worth in BTC from mining, I lost it all in futures trading.Then, I stumbled upon a crypto casino online. I deposited $20 and started playing various original casino games, winning about $350, all in USDT, only to lose it shortly after. Despite winning and losing amounts like $500 or $1,000 from subsequent deposits, I eventually found myself with just $50. I decided to play keno, choosing 10 out of 40 numbers. Luck seemed to be on my side as I made over $100,000 in 14 days. That night, I moved $85,000 to a cold wallet and left $7,000 in the casino to make a daily profit of $200. Additionally, I had $5,000 in Binance. The following morning, I eagerly joined the casino only to watch in dismay as I lost $7,000 in just 10 seconds. Frustrated, I deposited $10,000 from the cold wallet, only to lose it in less than a minute. I continued with a deposit of $20,000, experiencing the same outcome. Observing my substantial losses adding up to over $48,000, I then withdrew the remaining $43,000 from the cold wallet and wagered it all in the casino, losing it. Binance also suffered, and in the span of 3 minutes, I lost over $100,000.That's my story, and I apologize if it was lengthy. I went to bed wealthy and woke up poor again.",

Take this a learning and focus on something else, if not you're gonna loss more and more as you've lost all the money won.After my initial loss, I found myself torn between two mindsets. One part of me reasoned that it was okay, and I could try again later, while the other urged me to deposit more funds in order to recoup my losses. When I realized that I had lost half of my funds, I felt overwhelmed and began making reckless bets, driven by the desperate need to win them back. In that moment, I was unable to think rationally about my actions. The shock of going from 100k to 0 was incredibly difficult for someone in my situation. The following day, I managed to make 3k, but I ended up losing it because I was still focused on recovering my losses. As a result, I have made the decision to stay away from that site because I cannot afford to continue playing, and I refuse to borrow money for this purpose. Additionally, I no longer believe that I will be lucky in that regard.",

You wasted a fortune on gambling that's the act, but the truth is that you cannot change your past. Put this failure behind you and face the future with much enthusiasm and not with regrets. Gambling is not a predictable activity which is why it is important not to trust a certain pattern. You won using a strategy doesn't guarantee that you will get theasme result in a few minutes. In future avoid chasing losses and ensure you maximize such big wins. This fund could have been invested in something else like Bitcoin would have been profitable. I am also encouraging you to have a gambling plan with a budget. You wouldn't have gambled with all your wins if you had a budget that you followed strictly. In most cases, gambling addicts might not be aware that they are gambling irresponsibly until they lose heavily or start facing financial problems. There is always a need to evaluate how you spend your money so as to certain loopholes. A gambling plan is also another means of overcoming gambling disorder.",

And yes it was a roller coaster ride, as a fellow gambler, I know how you feel when you win that big and thought that you can continue to win or at least manage your own capital. But lo and behold, just like most of the gamblers here, most of the time we lost control of ourselves, our decisions behind clouded and all we want is to get back what we lost initially and chase it.So hopefully, this could be a very expensive lessons for you and to other gamblers as well. I know it's hard to control our emotions, but just imagine what you could have done with that money that you already won without any sweat.",

Trading is also a risky activity that has similarities with gambling - unlike with gambling the odds are not known so you can't prove that it's a losing game, but the common obeservation also shows that most traders go broke. People should learn from this and don't consider themselves to be one of those special gamblers or traders that will make money easily. If you want to make money, do something that has low risk and high chance of success, like mining.the OP should have stayed in mining. at least he has something to sell after certain period of time. going to futures as well is like gambling if you don't know yet about the market. i don't know how true that he got that kind of winnings, about 100k. but then again, he lost it all in gambling. he should not have followed his ego of playing it all. he didn't even set aside like few thousands of dollars. if he will continue his gambling habits, high likely that he will soon find himself in deep debt and trouble to those people he owed from. i understand a lot of gamblers are betting it all for the mere thought of recovering all the losses, but usually, what happens is the other way around. and it is already too late before you stop as there's no more left.

I no longer feel as interested in gambling as I used to. I've come to understand that easy money disappears quickly, very quickly. I've been reading about Dollar Cost Averaging and I hope things will improve. Thank you for your support.They will improve quickly.  Take it as a lesson.  Not as a LOSS.  Accept this was your fate and step ahead.Your first step toward the right path is this.  You acknowledged the loss.  You made a Bitcoin Talk account and you told your story listening to what we think.Once you realize this was a LESSON instead of a LOSS you will understand the reasoning behind it and you will understand why it was important to you.  You could of worked for many years and earned 100 thousand the hard way then fall into a gambling addiction and lose it all.  You 'made' the money fast and lost it faster with little to no effort.  You are fine!Dollar Cost Averaging is very simple.  Buy Bitcoin every now and then.  No matter how much.  Studies show even one coffee worth of Bitcoin invested a day for years has done wonders in the past.I'm really grateful for your support, buddy. You're absolutely right, I'm taking this as a valuable lesson. It's tough when you need $100 for everyday needs and there's nothing in your pocket. I'm still processing how I ended up betting such a large amount, but I'm determined to learn from this experience. Your advice means a lot to me. Thank you.",
