  "content": "Dear bitcointalk community,After running really bad at GG poker for a month i decided to look for another casino. After reading about BC.game in bitcointalk i got curious and decided to open a account 22 of october. I deposited 800usd in eth and played only 4 hands with baccarat. All of the hands where Max bet and quickly had a balance of approx 12k. I decided to withdraw the amount and now the problem arised. I logged in to my account the next day and saw that my withdrawal was placed back in my account. No notification in email or messages. I had to get in touch with their live chat in order to understand what was happening. And this was what i got:Hello there, we need to verify some further details from you. Due to this, your withdrawal permissions have been temporarily disabled. You also cannot tip, drop or rain whilst this restriction is on your account. However, you can still play all the games as normal. To begin the verification process, please send us an email to support@bc.game, together with the following information. Subject : Withdrawal Permission OffBCGame UsernameEmail AddressOne Deposit Transaction (TXID)Commonly used IP AddressCommonly used deviceNote - the email must be sent from the email address registered to your BCGame accountKindly wait within 24-72hrs for the core team to respond. Thank you!Note! I cant withdraw, i cant do nothing with the balance exept for playing the games. I then started reading more of the reviews and came across alot of negative reviews from players. In trustpilot it is clearly is written that they have detected many fake reviews from this casino. The way all of this is handled is extremely frustating. I am here highlighting how bc game is operating their casino so the rest of the players dont fall in to the same situation. I have taken screenshots of every transaction in the site. I can upload everything. The one thing i have to say is that i think it is Linda sad that their practise in running casino is not highighted. They clearly make it hard for players to cashout and hold on to their shady practises without anyone printing a finger.I dont care about the funds. What i dont tolarate is getting played. This is my hones review of BC.game. I also demanded a permanent ban. Will never set a foot in that casino again.",

I myself using them for 2 years with no problemAlso post proofs if 72h passes . If not then no one will support you",

I don't think he waited 72 h so i don't see any scam here.Only reason he paranoid if he did something wrong like win using a bug  or something.Otherwise why can't he simply wait for 72h ? Also come to think about it  4 wins in a row with maximun bet is something unusual. Beside thst he used tonspamthe forum to promote the scam site Betnomi .",

Will never set a foot in that casino again.you're not the only one they do it with.As soon as you have a big profit, they don't pay any more unless you have paid in a lot yourself.Then they come up with flimsy excuses.It's the same in the refferal system. If your refferal brings in a lot, they just assume multi and delete the refferal.All the new accounts that are always the highest winners, etc.Support only gives prefabricated standard answers and even after 72 hours you only get the same answer, always excuses.Bc is not a fair casino they do everything to get the money of the people with fraud and scam.We are in the process of filing a lawsuit in Costa Rica and our lawyers are working on it.",

The OP disappeared he might be the scammer or he didnt even wait 72h anyway check his posts history he works for Betnomi >",
