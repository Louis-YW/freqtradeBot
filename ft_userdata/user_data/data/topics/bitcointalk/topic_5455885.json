Technically he make the statement out of frustration because none of them believe Bitcoin will survive till now and since BTC is they will always make some trash comment about it just to cause FUD.",

He has forgotten that the transparency he's talking about is just showing every transaction recorded on the blockchain for the public's view, and those transactions are not linked or attached to anyone's name. I mean, no thief will be stupid enough for them to tie their name to an address, and even when they want to send the coins to a centralized system that can uncover their identity, they have access to mixing service or they can even do it themselves by using any means possible in order not to get caught on the act.Bitcoin is just the perfect payment solution when looking at it in all its ramifications; everything that can be done with the local currency can be done with Bitcoin, and even more or less. So their deciding if Bitcoin is actually good or bad is just a waste of debate by a bunch of people who don't actually have real work to do with their time.",

They are already running out of all slanders and negative things to say about bitcoin they are literally going back now and retorted/reused all their previous statements just to say something. Plus I'm not really going to take an options trader's word for it they literally lie as easy as they breathe (Though I think that was well-established now). Funny stuff. Just a while ago I saw a post about bitcoin being racist, pretty sure they'll throw that sometime in the future when things become stale for them again. They may get an audience from the people who are still skeptical about bitcoin, as well as those who have already made their minds up when it comes to investing in the cryptocurrency giant. But make no mistake, the money's not from the people who get in this industry, it's from the people who build in it. This is not a Ponzi scheme.",

Many of the Bitcoin critics fall into this category - they read one article about Bitcoin and decide that they can comment on it as if this is something that they fully understand.Bitcoin is useful to criminals, including money launderers, because mixing exists and it's effective. But this doesn't make Bitcoin a silver bullet, because some mixers can be honeypots, or the coins can be un-mixed, or the criminals can make mistakes like using a centralized exchange. Similarly, Bitcoin can't be totally useless, because there are people who actually pay with it for goods and services, or use it as a saving tool. But how much of the current Bitcoin value comes from pure speculation - that's an open question.",

That's just how I like to or rather look at it.With the critics, government and even antics trying to rule a line that some worth tags the currency to fraudulent intents and for a means in which, people hopes to hide from the law, it really isn't that. It's traceable after all but, government interference with some financial affairs and how decisions are made on that is what crypto stands to push out of financial system. Its not about fraud.",

So to me, I see this as a deliberate attempt by agents of government & banks to poison the minds of people who would have love to invest in Bitcoin to rather see it as scam, so they could  keep saving their funds in banks where they have the utmost control over the people's money.",
