Wish the commenters were all informed about how things really work... that would've help them to be more careful.In regards to the recent crash after my comment on Saturday here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387588.msg60390052#msg60390052 Â I made sure the dip didn't continue, as I deliberately \"raised the price\" after the comment and the price responded accordingly.",
