It was clearly a beginner's luck.The more I go the better I become and I know how to analyse matches very well, not knowing the more you bet the mor you will lose even if you are the best in analysing previous matches played to predict what the outcome of the next matches that would be played.It is gambling, beginners can be lucky because experienced people can also go for the best matches and lose.",

From the start to the mid part of the game, I was always winning despite the number of choices to bet from. It goes on for like 10-15 bets, iirc, but I never got greedy into betting higher amounts until the losing part came. I was young, and I got scared, so I stopped while I still have some profits left in my pocket. For me, this unexpected luck is true, especially for those who have no idea what they are doing. But it doesn't mean we have to rely on it because soon it will run out.",

But sometimes it doesn't exist on all newbies since not everyone is totally lucky about what things they do then they lose because the circumstances still the same with other experience gamblers. For other this is just superstitious belief but there's really nothing wrong about believing on it.",

The same applies for experienced gambler when they want to gamble on new casino, after few spins they're making money and they choose to cash out all of their money because they think if they continue to gamble, they will lose their profit. After all there's no such manipulation from the gambler to make you're lucky when you playing a game for the first time, as long as you're choose a reputable casino.",

      "body": "I think beginners' luck is much more apparent simply because no one else actually talks about people being unlucky in their first gambling games, or even if there was, they're in the absolute minority so they aren't really heard that much. On the other hand, people are much more vocal when they get lucky in their early gambling sessions/tries, so it just became that way imo. That, or I'm just bitter that I lost a couple of bucks immediately which was a lot (imo) when I first gambled. Kidding aside though, if I were to choose between beginners luck vs superstitions, I'd probably opt to believe more in the former instead.",

It will sweet them as they have the luck but later the opposite will start to occur and it may later become a bad time for them.",

It is difficult to say whether the expression beginners are lucky is a kind of magnet involving an increasing number of gamblers in gambling, but considering that it has existed for several centuries, it may have previously been simply used by touts in a kind of marketing of gambling establishments.",

I remember the first time I played gambling here in crypto gambling, I immediately won 235$ in spite of everything that I only deposited around 30$ and I immediately withdrew what I won after a few hours of waiting, and then of experience if it's rare that I won such an amount as I won when I was a first timer.",

And this makes them continue the game and place bets, maybe higher than before but in the end, they lose. And this makes them curious and wants to try it again another time and over and over again.But not all beginners can get their first lucky break because there are bound to be those who experience defeat in the early moments when they play gambling.

This is because there's no pattern or certainty in gambling. Well, in some fields of it such as with sportsbetting, a player could lessen the risk of losing through detailed analysis of the players or team but still, that won't guarantee a winning outcome. Some are even being able to win back their losses halfway and some are on their last bets. We just cannot predict winning which makes gambling a game of one's fate.

At least in my personal experience I didn't really notice it. Over the years I tried out many new casinos and had good and bad starts. Same goes for my friends, so far I haven't heard a story of someone winning big the first time he played at a casino. Wouldn't it be bad for the casino to have beginners luck, because then all the gamblers would disappear again after playing a few times and move to the next casino. It's probably true that beginners have more problems to try and control themselves after a win and face a bigger risk to lose it all again. Or maybe the didn't pay attention to the first deposit bonus and think the 100 or 200% they get from the casino is their profit.",
