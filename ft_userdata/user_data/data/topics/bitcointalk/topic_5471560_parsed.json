That's no small change..... And if they're found guilty, they'll be facing multiple lawsuits from angry investors, and jail time could be on the horizon.Good thing you're keeping up with the news. If you've got any funds in that exchange, I'd say it's time to pull them out while you still can. As the poster above suggested, maybe give Binance a shot because they've got a solid reputation, and they're regulated to operate as well.",

Moreover it’s very strange to hear that you are holding the coins in exchanges. Use offline wallets or hardware wallets to always store the coins. These exchanges are often prone to hacks and breaches, so move ASAP your coins to something more reliable. Now regarding the best exchange, then I use Binance’s P2P markets to sell the coins in good price.",

On the other hand, storing the majority of assets on a centralized exchange is a bad idea, I think you should withdraw all your funds to a cold wallet immediately if you are just a long-term holder. No reputable exchange can guarantee the safety of your assets, whether it is binance or kraken. But if you still insist on leaving your assets on exchanges because you have your own reasons, you can turn to Binance or OKX, both of which are considered trustworthy exchanges. But I really do not recommend that you leave assets on centralized exchanges, their task is only to trade, buy and sell...not to store.",

Not sure which device you're using but most reputable HWs are pretty straightforward and simple to use, just like software ones, the only difference is that you need to authorize the payments from the devices",

Everybody involved with Genesis is getting hit with lawsuits. So this was not at all unexpected. Since they are NY based they make more headlines then some small offshore exchange.

Legit CEX will close your account if anything looks the tiny bit off to their security people. And they will never tell you why.There are a lot of reasons not like Gemini / CEX. These are not any of them.-Dave",

Why aren't you comfortable using your cold storage wallet if i may ask? Holding your keys is not a hard thing to do. Take note that whatever funds you have in any exchange isn't yours, because not your keys, not your coins.",

That plan of yours is reasonable and if it keeps you thinking minute after minute of something might happen to them because of their current issue which makes you think about them affecting your funds, do the transfer and then just re-do it when you think that the storm has been calmed for them. But the better suggestion of transferring it is to your own cold storage and wallet so, you have the control to your own funds and I know it kinds of giving you the lazy feels but you have to do that transfer just to calm your mind and don't mind the fees because they've always been so minimal.",

But I kind of get your point, who's not facing a lawsuit anyway? That's very common among top crypto exchanges. Gemini is facing one, so you want to move to another. Where, Binance? It's also facing a lawsuit. CZ himself is facing a lawsuit. So, Coinbase? The same. Kraken? Probably not sued in the US but investigated, fined, and so on, and its operator in Australia is facing a lawsuit as well. So, if you want to let go of this unnecessary worry, withdraw your funds. You can probably get comfortable with your cold wallet in less than an hour.",
