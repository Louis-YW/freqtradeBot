The goverment politicians are down for it but they want to know what blockchain Will be used? If it my decision then i would choose tron or ETH  Any suggestions for safest secure enough blockchain so that can carry all the transactions with good speed once my friend provide them info wich blockchain then they make it together Also guys from goverment Will get nice share of coins If they LET this coin to be legal Tender.",

A country may need more than 100k per second transaction once the legal tender is adopted in every business. Solana claimed that it can make 50k per second. No other project so far claimed to be higher than this. But when it comes to security, Solana had so much downtime in the past and so is ETH congestion. That's to be solved first and the ETH layer2 solutions can provide better TPS such as Polygon.But will the government really use a layer1 or 2 platform of today?",

It is hard to say exactly how governments will approach the development and implementation of their official digital currency, but it is likely that they will consider a variety of factors such as security, scalability, adoption... Some governments may prefer to use existing blockchain platforms, while others may choose to develop their own proprietary technology. Ultimately, the specific technology used will depend on the specific requirements and goals of the government and the stablecoin project, however, I doubt that any of them will resort to a solution based on recommendations to someone's request on a public forum.",

      "body": "From the way you post it, it sounds like this stablecoin project will be a major one, and they will use it for any transaction that happens in their country. Using a public blockchain, run by who knows who across the world, has no guarantee that they monitor it for malicious purposes or not, that probably has some bugs like the latest address poisoning attack, is very risky IMO. Unless they don't plan on having any control over the node/network, which I highly doubt is the case here. CMIIW.Quote from: bittraffic on January 15, 2023, 05:27:50 PMSolana claimed that it can make 50k per second. No other project so far claimed to be higher than this. But when it comes to security, Solana had so much downtime in the past and so is ETH congestion. That's to be solved first and the ETH layer2 solutions can provide better TPS such as Polygon.There are also Harmony, and others altcoin project who promises high TPS but sacrifice some security. OP's friend can probably fork and modify it. Just make sure that some of these projects are also a fork of another (mainly ETH), and it might share some bugs because of that. Btw, since CBDC[1] is a trend now, maybe you can suggest your government ask for some feedback on how others do it, whether they want a shared blockchain or not, etc.[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp",

You should suggest to your friend to create open source network, run a bug hunter bounty and ask people who have a good security level about the code.[1] https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2022/03/29/second-biggest-crypto-hack-ever-600-million-in-ethereum-stolen-from-nft-gaming-blockchain/",

      "body": "When it comes to choosing a blockchain to use for a stablecoin project, there are a few factors to consider such as security, scalability, and governance. Tron and Ethereum are both popular choices for building decentralized applications (dApps) and have large communities of developers and users. Both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages.Tron is known for its fast transaction speeds and low transaction fees. It also has a strong focus on entertainment and gaming applications. However, it is relatively new and has not been battle-tested as much as Ethereum. Ethereum, on the other hand, has been around for longer and has a more established ecosystem. It has a large number of developers working on it and is more versatile than Tron. Ethereum's smart contract functionality allows for a wide range of use cases. However, it's not as fast as Tron and it's subject to scalability issues.Another blockchain that is worth considering is EOS, it's also fast and has a large developer community. When it comes to security, all of the above mentioned blockchains have faced security issues in the past, it's important to conduct a thorough security audit of the codebase and make sure that any vulnerabilities are addressed. Ultimately, the choice of blockchain will depend on the specific requirements of your stablecoin project, as well as the resources and expertise available to your team. It's important to have a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each blockchain and make an informed decision.It's also important to note that a blockchain's legal status varies by country, and it's important to check the legal implications of using a specific blockchain in your country before making a decision.",

I actually prefer that fast and cheap and easy to scalable that is EVM chain like Ethereum, BinanceSmart Chain, Avalanche and other layer 2 solution it fast cheap and the community is big and those are evm compatible meaning one address can be used on multiple chain and deploy the code need minimum change",

And the government also doesn't like decentralization and they have to have full control. If they use the existing network they still need a third party who will be at risk in case of congestion or other things.We have a real example in china, they banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but they are trying to adopt blockchain and create their own blockchain. This was done because the Chinese did not want to be regulated by the party when the network was used, it was better to create their own network protocol and they were free to do whatever.",
