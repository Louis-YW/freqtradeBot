  "content": "I apologise for the informal manner of this thread...but time is of the essence. As you know, there is a situation with ColdKey. Speculation is rife; and there is evidence of private keys being compromised. For the safety of our clients, I'm releasing this PSA. We recommend to peel any ten year anniversary notes immediately. We are offering a trade in program, read in the comments. Early 2019, 21 pcs, loaded.The keys on these notes were not made in house, and we cannot verify the integrity at this time. ----------No other polymerbit notes are affected.",

I know it cannot replace it fully, but I hope it helps to compensate. Anyone who owns one of these notes, and have peeled it due to the crisis... we will offer a trade in program. We will accept these notes in return for either 1) a $100 polymerbit gift card, or 2) an updated version of this note in clear window, with our keys (unloaded). The gift card will be valid for the life of the company and can be sent/sold to other users. The note will bear the serial number of your peeled note in red, with a star.",

Destroying about 20 coldkeys valuing at load value of .13btc is almost like loosing about .4BTC..It’s not much for some OGs but big hole in the wallet for the new members..I think peeling anything related to Yogg is the right thing to do. However, I’d be surprised if there are more coins he could steal that he hasn’t already. Another thing I would say to caution folks is to take a good look at the design style and the manufacturing techniques used. I would bet that if he did this to you all now, he’s likely already hard at work pushing other loaded products to the community using an alt that will eventually be rug pulled. Be safe and be suspicious of anyone trying to sell you preloaded goods.",

This is a sad day for the community, and Yogg has truly destroyed many years of trust that took many more to build.But something I also noticed today is that the community has bonded and become stronger in many ways.
