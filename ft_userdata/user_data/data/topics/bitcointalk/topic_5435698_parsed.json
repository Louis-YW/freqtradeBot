  "content": "Making profit is the goal of every trader whether they are doing it right or wrong. All traders wish to pull out massive funds from trading but only a few care about some minor things that can help improve their trade and ensure they are implementing the right strategy for every trade they make.Trading plan is one thing that cannot be neglected and for better result it best when it is visible. It is the vision a trader runs with. If a trader fails to plan such trader eventually plans to fail. When the heat of the market sets in we often forget our plans and trade from what ever our instinct suggests. But with a written plan it will be easier to set goals, targets, limits, strategies and expectations. The more we see our plan the more we adapt to what it says, the more we understand our strategy and the clearer the result becomes. It helps in references on how productive those strategies are, if they need t be changed, improved upon or modified. Sometimes trading from our instinct come with so much emtions attached and we might want the market to do what we expect and not what it wants to do.",

Things like this are very important because after all we have to have a plan about our trading. The main goal is to make a profit, and profits cannot just come when we don't have a plan or strategy for trading. Something we have to think about before anything that is in trading is a plan.",

I don't know why many people not learned from their mistake at BSC shit coins and have planning with high risk and earn high return or profit later.I loss many time with trading due several mistakes I made, but right now I changed with my trading way and have good trading plan and priority become more patience waiting right time and right moment for entry in some altcoin. I stop totally with hype moment and better with fewest profit earn and consistency than higher profit but possibility with higher risk.",

Which includes How many times that you wanna trade in the day/week. You need to outline your profit target in trading, basically stating how much you want to gain in a given day/week. Finally you must have an exiting plans for loses, that is how much loses you could incure in a day before you leave the market without having to chase the market in order to recover your loses.",

I mean no strategies works the second time. Also there are very high chances that any particular plan works the second time, so yeah a trader should learn to adapt according to the market conditions and needs. A trading plan will only work if you have enough capital to fund if you are negative in overall asset, but yes in order to succeed in the plan, the risk intake will be more. So I would suggest trade according to the market and charts and always learn from your mistakes.",
