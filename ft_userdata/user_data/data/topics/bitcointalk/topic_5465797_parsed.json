  "content": "Years back when I started hearing about bitcoin, I used to think that it was very easy and a shortcut to success. This perception was informed by the way people projected bitcoin, that if you want to get rich quick, you should just go into bitcoin. Today I know better that the perception is wrong, because people can actually loose their hard earned money in bitcoin, leaving them worse off than when they started it. The volatile nature of bitcoin makes it to be quite unpredictable, people who want to trade bitcoin must diligently study about it, know the technicalities and terminologies of it, before venturing into it. Even at that you can not accurately predict  the outcome whether the price will pump or dump.Unlike fiat which the amount in your bank account remains what it is, bitcoin in your wallet will constantly fluctuate, meaning that there is chances that you can gain or lose your bitcoin. This confirms that the chances of getting rich can also make you poor. Although the probability of earning in bitcoin, is more than loosing in it , if the person understood how to speculate the factors that determines the supply and demand of it, also to be disciplined. So do you think that I'm correct about bitcoin, that it is not an easy way to get rich quick as some people will make believe, and it is just like other ventures where there is no guarantee of getting rich?",

I don't think anybody made through Bitcoin so easily without undergoing the process of holding and having patience with it, as the price did not just move up after an individual accumulation; it took time and years before it rewarded its holder with the benefit of holding. One thing I see as people's major problem most times is \"being misinformed.\" This has misled a lot of people into the wrong part, as what they conceive in their minds from the beginning is what they are going to work with. One of the popular beliefs of many is that if you invest in bitcoin today, tomorrow you will be a very wealthy person depending on the invested amount. All thanks to how much information is flying now, the mindset of many has changed from that belief, and proper enlightenment on how it works has been transferred to them.Quote from: Kelward on September 05, 2023, 10:38:34 PMUnlike fiat which the amount in your bank account remains what it is, It completely doesn't work like that though, although banking policies vary. Even if the money in your account happens to survive all the banking charges and remains the way it was when you deposited it, it won't be able to escape inflation, and when you withdraw that money, it will not have the same purchasing power as it did at the time of your deposit. Which means the value will reduce but the figures will be the same.",

But you said we have this perception about BTC that it will make us only rich while we do not see at another fact that it could also make us poor too. Is because of the wrong  teaching and guiding of other people. But we should not put all the blame kn others while we know we are the one who got the results about which we searched for. For example, what most of the newbies search on YT or Google about BTC, is how to earn free BTC or where to get free easy BTC. And believe me auch searching will never take you to the side of getting information and knowledge like the way you could get if you start from getting information first so you would know what are we looking at and then find the ways to earn BTC. And yes BTC is not some way to earn instant money while there are 50 50 chances of getting profit and loss but we can increase the chance of earning more profit (from 50% to let's say 80%) by doing TA and FA. Proper research makes you more profitable.",

I think that whenever you grow from this thing, you'll start to realize important points.Like you have no control over its volatility and the price keeps on fluctuating in a manner and direction that you don't know.

Today I know better that the perception is wrong, because people can actually loose their hard earned money in bitcoin, leaving them worse off than when they started it.Yes, you are absolutely right OP. Having thoughts like that (wanting to get rich quickly) in bitcoin investment is not justified. Because in reality investing in bitcoin is not that easy. Because all investors who have been successful from investing in Bitcoin, it takes a lot of time, a lot of learning and a lot of seriousness. Because if don't do all that, logically will definitely be vulnerable to losses. That's why the thought of wanting to get rich quickly, when want to invest in bitcoin, needs to be eliminated. It doesn't mean you don't want to be rich, but at least look at the process first and learn the science first. Because if you want to get something instant it is very difficult, especially in the realm of investment like in bitcoin.Quote from: Kelward on September 05, 2023, 10:38:34 PMUnlike fiat which the amount in your bank account remains what it isRegarding fiat, as far as I know, the money in the account book basically continues to decrease every month. Because with every bank, there will definitely be fees that have to be paid every month, and these fees are usually always taken from the balance of money in the account. Not to mention the issue of inflation and currency depreciation, so in essence fiat currency always has price movements, but not too big and there are always costs if for example you keep your money in the bank.Quote from: Kelward on September 05, 2023, 10:38:34 PMSo do you think that I'm correct about bitcoin, that it is not an easy way to get rich quick as some people will make believe, and it is just like other ventures where there is no guarantee of getting rich?Yes of course that's true. Because, for example, if you invest in Bitcoin, and get rich easily. Of course, everyone who has invested in Bitcoin has become a rich man.But in reality it's not like that.Because in conclusion, to get maximum results when investing in Bitcoin, there are stages. Like studying it first-then after that prepare the capital-after that go straight to the stock exchange-create a personal wallet (non Custodian)- and only after that always analyze and see the movements of the bitcoin market.Even though this does not guarantee that you will be able to benefit, at least if you run all of these options, there is greater potential for profit.",

I eventually understood it a lot more. But then my first impression proved to be true. So, although Bitcoin wasn't really created as a get-rich-quick investment opportunity, it actually was the fastest way to get rich. It must have beaten all other investment opportunities. When I first heard of Bitcoin, the price was just a few hundred dollars. Just approximately a couple of years later, the price rose to almost $20,000. No other investment can beat that growth. This is probably the reason why Bitcoin got this reputation. Imagine Laszlo paying 10,000BTC for 2 pizzas and 5 years later that amount is already equivalent to millions in USD. That growth in Bitcoin's price was unbelievably fast. But then such growth rate must also slow down as Bitcoin reaches higher prices. So its old reputation won't anymore apply.

I'm not saying that all are integrating that phrase with Bitcoin, but there are some who are misleading these newbies, telling that you can get rich in a faster way if you invest into Bitcoin. This is the reason why many people over the years are losing money.Who said to you that Bitcoin is a get rich quick type of asset? When you hear the word \"guarantee\" and other words that has the same definition as that word, stay out of it. In investing, there's no guarantee whether it's crypto, stock market or whatever it is. In Bitcoin, there isn't any guarantee that you will get rich whatsoever. Yes you might earn profits in the long run, but that isn't guaranteed as well. So to answer your question, you're right that Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick, and only newbies believe in that thing, and at the same time, Bitcoin isn't the type of asset where you can guarantee when that you will get rich when you invest into it, and in fact, no asset can guarantee that you can get rich by investing into it.",
