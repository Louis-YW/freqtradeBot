  "content": "Ok, it seems that we are going to see Loma back in action, this time it will be against Jamaine Ortiz who beat former champion Jamel Herring recently. We all know that Loma goes back to his hometown Ukraine and enlisted himself to defend the country against the Russians.But now he is back and continue his boxing career (same with his fellow Ukrainians Usyk who will be fighting AJ in Saudi). Not a cherry pick but probably a tune up fight for Loma before facing Haney, assuming both of them win.The fight is slated in October.https://www.badlefthook.com/2022/8/17/23309795/vasiliy-lomachenko-next-fight-jamaine-ortiz-agree-terms-october-top-rank-espn-boxing-news-2022",

Not taking away from the young Ortiz, but it was a good setup for him. And now look at what opportunity he has, knocking on the doors of the great Lomachenko.But then again, it will be hard pressed to see him winning against Loma, maybe we will see some ring rust early, but once he shake that cobwebs, Loma will be too much for the young Ortiz. And then next year, it will be Loma against Haney, that will be exciting match indeed.",

It might be Lomachenko's next fight after Ortiz that will be the official championship eliminator. The opponent might also be one of the top 5 ranked lightweight boxers with a name.

Based on these numbers, our AI makes the following prediction.Lomachenko has a huge gap experienced between the two Loma is the more experienced and skilled he may have a few fights in the professional record but in the amateur, he was a veteran. QuoteLomachenko had one of the most outstanding amateur boxing records, with 396 wins and just one loss. \"Loma\" started his professional career in 2012Ortiz is good but his only big fight is against Herring who is past his prime compared to Loma who has fought a lot of great champions and is still at the peak of his career, Ortiz will face someone who is two times quicker and has power in both hands and so I agree on that prediction in fact it should be higher.",

So this is a tuneup as others said for Loma and hopefully he is still in his prime and that he can get back all the belts he had once held.",

Loma will clearly win this fight, no doubt with that, the question is only whether a KO or via decision.",

Arum is just looking to milk his fighters every way they can. A very good opportunity for Ortiz, and perhaps a good warm-up for Loma. Props to this dude declining a possible huge paycheck when he was prepped to fight with Kambosos Jr. to fight for his country. A lot of fans would have watched that bout and he'll earn good no matter the outcome is. Hopefully we get to see the fruition of that fight. Right now, Ortiz's chances are not that good, but maybe he can drag the fight until the twelfth round and win by decision, who knows?",

I knew these Ukrainian fighters aren't really at their 100% until the war is over. But I hope it is still enough to secure their wins. Boxing fans, stay tuned to this weekend's heavyweight championship rematch between Loma's very close friend Oleksandyr Usyk battling against former champ Anthony Joshua.",

It appears that it has been decided already. Thank you for correcting me. I had hoped that we see a championship eliminator between 2 big names in the lightweight division because Devin Haney already has 4 of the belts and he certainly deserves a bigger event, I reckon. However, Lomachenko is a big name for our young champion. If he wins this he deserves to fight the biggest names in the division, King Ray and Tank.@cabron. I speculate 7.00 or 8.00 for Ortiz if Lomachenko is 1.10 hehehe.",
