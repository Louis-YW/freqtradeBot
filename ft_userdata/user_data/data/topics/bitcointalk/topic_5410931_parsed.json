Could the name of the file have changed?I searched '0201010420' using a hex editor but i found a lot of results (890). They all look a like starting 'D0 30' it's ending '00 00'. I don't know if there is another program that creates this order ??I don't remember putting a password on the wallet.( if there is a password I remember my possible passwords ).I used jackjack/pywallet  scanned the hard drive but found nothing.

Have the recovery programmes managed to recover any files from your system (extensions might be handy here to see if any dat files have already been recovered)?

(This hard drive İDE)That sounds like it's been overwritten or you're not using good recovery software.Have you searched the drive for wallet.dat if it's working properly - and just left that search running?",

I know Recuva but that is very casual, you would need the best in the game, probably external tools and hardware. Avoid all of these dodgy \"give me your HDD and we will give you back your coins\".Also are you sure you used NTFS format? try FAT32. It was still used back then. Always backup the data before doing format conversions.",

That is most likely a generic recovery program that tries to recover all files. However, OP is only interested in Berkeley DB version 4 files. So you'd need specific software that scans every single unallocated sector in the disk's filesystem (and this is significantly easier to do for Linux filesystems than Windows NTFS and FAT32, because of the openness of the filesystem source code) and scan for anything that looks like a table, ckey, mkey and such.But if the wallet file is encrypted, I'm not sure what is to be gained from doing this - you only need the mkey, since it generates all the other private keys and morever, it is used to encrypt all those ckeys - the password is not used for that purpose.",

I tried several data recovery programs but I can't find the bitcoin files. (This hard drive SATA)I'd suggest you to bring your HDD to expert due to these reasons,1. When you use CCleaner to delete file, it does more than marking the file as deleted. AFAIK by default it perform simple overwrite.2. Some software to convert RAW to NTFS could cause data loss.Quote from: Berkeleydb1 on August 23, 2022, 12:16:15 PMThere is another hard drive where I mined Bitcoin in 2010 and that hard drive is working and files were not overwritten, but file recovery program cannot find bitcoin qt files.
