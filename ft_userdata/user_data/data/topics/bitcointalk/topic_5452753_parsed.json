E be true say many Naija pipu dey prefer make dem go meet dem pastors or find comfort for popular culture instead of paying money go see therapist or marriage counselor. Memes, Twitter trends, and reality TV shows na e be the way dem dey take forget their problem for some time. But e dey important make we know say some Naija pipu dem dey see d importance of professional help, nd dem dey go see therapist or counselor when dem need am. Even though popular culture fit help dem for small time, therapist go give dem special place make dem fit talk about their problems nd dem go give dem advice wey go fit help dem for long time healing and personal growth. As pipu dey increase their awareness about mental health, e go cause change for their attitude towards therapy nd counseling so more people go fit embrace d benefits wey e dey bring.",

As good as e be for person to yarn with other men them or brothers wey suppose understand, the truth be say no body really care about the issues wey dey bother man or put am for the kind mental condition wey em dey face.Women go tell man say e too complain or make em be man and bear the emotional burden alone. Man go still tell man same thing or worse. Na only those wey get good heart and calm dey even bother at times to listen to person.Sometimes sef, the person wey you think say you dey talk to in order to relief your mental state, fit even be the cause or follow contribute to the issue. E always dey good to dey kind sha, because no be clear eye some people dey use wake up comot for house in the morning o.

However, since the majority of what you do is influenced by your mental state, we Nigerians don't view seeing a therapist as being particularly important. However, I think it is crucial that we encourage individuals to seek counseling and communicate to others about their feelings. When we express how we feel, it should help us feel better in some way as opposed to holding it in and having it consume us. Challenges is just driving everyone crazy.",

Â This mental health issue is something we need to look into and talk about,Â  OP you try we'll well for this topic because alot of people here fit dey get issues with their mental health but dey find I'm hard to share their personal issues so once again you try, because such persons in a much as they no fit air out go learn how to handle this particular issue from replys, this issue as we know done lead many people to suicide or remain mental unstable for life, and I urge members of this naija board to check up on their friends at large because people dey really go through alot for this our country,Â  and imagine say person for this forum mental health no dey stable, how eh wan use think well reply topics or create topics for different boards anyways to cut long tori short make eh no be say I dey cap too much, I go drop una with some ideas of how to tackle this mental health wahala.Â â€¢ Good sleeping habit - one of the reasons why people they suffer from this na because dem dey hardly sleep or observe siesta, science done talk I'm say we need to dey observe 8 hours sleep everyday but most people no dey sleep especially some men done turn their working hours to night and eh no goodÂ  imagine person wey sleep by 3am then wake by 6 to go work, when eh wake eh go dey very unstable and that go affect em mental health for place of work.â€¢ meditation - this one na another way to tackle this issue, sometimes you just need to go quit place close your eyes and begin to meditate on this, and eh dey mostly good with slow music to help you while you dey think deep, daily practice of this everyday for about 15- 30 mins go give you stable mind and help improve your mental healthÂ  and eh go make you more calm and your mind go dey at ease.â€¢ Good interactions with people - when your mental health no dey balance eh no good to dey stay isolated from people because at that point when you dey alone your mindset fit they feed you with negative thoughts like suicide, or other bad ideas, so another way you fit help yours na to interact with trustworthy people wey you fit confide in and share your problem with them, oyibo talk say \"a problen shared na problem solved\" so the best peope to share your problem with most time na older family members wey you fit confide in because most of them fit done pass through that same problem and they'llÂ  advise you on how to go about I'm.Â Another thing na exercise, regular exercise dey help develop our body not only our body but there are some good exercises wey dey help our mental health dey balanced like.Â YogaÂ Jogging Â Hiking Â Running Â Pilates. Â My brother since you say your mental health no dey stable you fit try any of the above eh go go a long way that's why oyibo say \" problem shared na problem solved \".",
