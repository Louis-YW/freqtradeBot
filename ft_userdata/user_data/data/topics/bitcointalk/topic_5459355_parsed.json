It will be looking like a shilling to you if somebody suggests a coin to buy.But, I'll give you a hint on what altcoins I am holding as of the moment. They're next to Bitcoin and that means that part of the top ones are the ones that I am holding.",

Because beginners don't have an analysis of any of the altcoins.But I will advise you, if you insist on investing in altcoins, it is better for you to invest in altcoins that have ratings from 15 and below. Such as ethereum, BNB, XRP, and doge. Because of the coins that are in this ranking, in terms of market capitalization or trading volume, they are very high. Then these coin projects are very good and have the potential to be used as investment or traded. But this is just a suggestion from me, and it would be better if you do an independent analysis of the altcoin you want to buy. Because if the results of your own analysis, whatever the results are, it is your own decision.Because crypto investors in this forum, will surely suggest almost the same advice to you. Namely, it will advise you to buy altcoins that are ranked 15 and below. because this suggestion is indeed the most appropriate suggestion.",

      "body": "this is not a good time for altcoins. If this is the beginning of a longer bull market, bitcoin gives better returns at the beginning, if the market were to turn around - bitcoin will dump less than alts. So now I recommend BTC and look for alts only when BTC breaks the previous ATH. The exception may be BNB, which is sharply dumped by the fud that has intensified around it in recent months, but it is a high-risk investment, because not only the SEC but also the governments of some countries are fighting against binance.",

However, if you don't want to keep all your investments in one basket, then you can split them by BNB, or you can look it up yourself at coinmarketcap in the top 20 coins. to be honest, Choosing bitcoin and ethereum is enough for long term investment, but if you are looking for other altcoins, then choose popular coins that are on coinmarketcap.",

So if you really 20 grand, always diversify beyond cryptocurrency. Have a good amount of gold in your Portfolio so that it can support you during bad times. Bitcoin and ETH should also form a good percentage of your portfolio. Check coinmarketcap website and check the trading activities of various coins. This will give you an idea of active coins which has demand in the market. Then take a decision. Investing 20 grand in a single coin is a big no no.",
