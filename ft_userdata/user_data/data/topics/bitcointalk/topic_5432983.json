We have had issues where bank staff fraudulently transfer or steal customers funds. Sometimes banks carryout some illegal deductions from people's account without permission. But we should not assume that Bitcoin transactions are totally protected. You must ensure you use decentralized wallets and also make sure you keep your passwords and keys safe. Someone having access to your password or keys might be quite disastrous than the pitfalls of conventional banks. Your entire funds can be stolen in few seconds if your security is compromised.  Also, in most countries where Bitcoin transactions is restricted, you still need these commercial banking services to carryout financial transactions.",

Both have their pros and cons but most people who doesn't have knowledge about cryptocurrency or Bitcoin would rather choose banks instead of having their own wallet where they have full control. It's just a matter of time before they knew it or someone might need to educate them about the pros and cons of Bitcoin and Banks.As time passes by, most of these people choosing banks would choose to switch to cryptocurrency although, the regulation might hinder it.",

For example, it is that users of traditional banks don't need to worry about the security and storage of their deposit. The whole issue is decided by the bank and deprives customers of this headache. Convenient, isn't it. Especially for those who are lazy and don't want to bother with security issues.In the case of bitcoin banking, it will be necessary to take on the responsibility of keeping and maintaining the safety of savings. Nobody else will do it for you. If a mistake is made with the record or an insufficiently reliable place to store the seed-phrase, everything will go down the drain. Here you won’t be able to turn to support, which will fix your problem, and the consequences of mistakes can be catastrophic and deprive you of everything you had.So, these 2 types of banks have radically opposite features.",

With Bitcoins, there are no unnecessary charges.In summary, the reason bitcoin is what most of us have started tending towards to keep our funds is because we have seen that in all the advantages and disadvantages that they have with normal banking, it is better and more reliable for the future.",

This is the direction I felt the thread would follow and you can imagine my surprise when I saw the direction it went! Perhaps not the very best of thread title but, its not entirely out of place.More of what am getting is about centralisation and decentralisation of which, both are definitely a composit of for owning a wallet and some local fiat bank. As much as local banks might tamper with your funds, that doesn't mean they've got any authority to do so and as such, you could fight them legally over rights to your funds.When it comes to wallets, your entirely in charge and that's cool.What would be the function of some bank should bitcoin be used for a legal tender? Do they stand in the places of wallets or something... perhaps exchanges but, that still doesn't make them any less centralised.",

      "body": "The last few years have made me question whether terms like fractional reserve banking should be covered by standard education. If yes, which other financial and economic concepts should school curriculums try to cover? I wonder how many recognize what the \"fractional reserve\" in fractional reserve banking implies.I would guess that most who grew up during the internet era, understand the importance of min maxing setups in video games. But by the same token, those same individuals who spent hours strategizing in games might fail to comprehend the importance of min maxing their financial and investment plans. Which could result in them being unsatisfied with their own standard of living.While the idea of stocks, bonds, FOREX, real estate and other markets might seem frightening and alien. They're not so different from video games in their structure and economy.I like that I don't see many negative comments when people try to compare banks with bitcoin. Even if people do not recognize differences between banks and bitcoin today. It is possible that future experience will give them a good education on the topic. A better education than they could ever have received from a school system, perhaps?",
