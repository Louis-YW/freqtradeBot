Okay, let me clarify what I know about bitcoin ETFs.Â An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a grouping of assets, the shares of which are traded on a stock market. They combine the traits and advantages of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.Like individual stocks, ETF shares fluctuate in price throughout the day depending on market supply and demand.An ETF keeps track of an underlying asset's or index's price. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of Bitcoin, for instance, would operate similarly, with the price of one share moving in lockstep with the price of BTC.The value of the ETF rises when the value of Bitcoin does, and vice versa. The ETF would, however, trade on a stock market like the NYSE. ETFs are currently available for a wide range of assets and sectors, including currencies and commodities.By making an investment in a Bitcoin ETF, you can gain exposure to Bitcoin's price without having to deal with a cryptocurrency exchange, understand how it works, or assume the risks associated with directly owning Bitcoin. Bitcoin futures make the process of investing in Bitcoin more accessible without the worry of losing your wallet password. Aside from that, an ETF enables investors to diversify their portfolios and lower their risk exposure because it is a collection of several securities, including Google stocks, Bitcoin, and more. Since Bitcoin futures ETFs trade on conventional exchanges and are subject to SEC regulation, they qualify for tax efficiency. The thread's header contains the source of the above-mentioned beneficial information, but I'll still include the link here for your convenience. https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-etfs-a-beginners-guide-to-exchange-traded-funds",
