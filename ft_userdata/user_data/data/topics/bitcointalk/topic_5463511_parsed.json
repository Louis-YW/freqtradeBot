In the real sense of it, people who go into politics are suppose to be those who have conscience because they are suppose to go and make judicious use of the people's common wealth for the benefit of the people but the reverse is the case. If someone who is not rich enters into political office, after the tenure then go back and check the financial status of that same person and you will be astonished especially in third world countries. There are suppose to be a very strong institutions melt to punish political thieves.",

The real name for it always used to be channel 1, but since it's only government propaganda they call it \"government tv\" in the free media. Different governments use the same tactics because they learn from each other. If something works for one country it may work for another. QuoteBut is politics supposed to really be about lies? Why is the polity dominating by propaganda? No, it's not. In most countries it's about buying votes and you can buy them by promising stuff to your voters, giving them freebies, lying to them, scaring them with war, or pandemic, or lack of money... There's many ways to get votes. For instance, in Russia they like to simply print additional ballots and cheat the system the good old way.",

Politice is always define to be people who craves for better and conducive place for the people but now I can't really explain what politics is all about considering the objective of most politicians, some use it as an avenue for money laundering and some as opportunity to protect there illegal business while very few are there for changes, I'm saying based on experienced because in my country we are blessed with mineral resources but suffering is like a routine business due to bad governance though I cannot generalize it because there are countries which their politicians values the welfare of the people, so in most cases you can easily identify a good country that's Gorvern by a good politicians based on there economy.",

Well, there's no need for any explanation on it because that's what they do to obtain power and wealth through the means of being into those public positions.Quote from: Odohu on August 16, 2023, 04:22:41 PMI don't know about your country but in my country, politicians buy over media empires to sell lies and propaganda to the public...

I still have high hopes that there will be legitimate political people that has the genuine political will to help it recover.Quote from: Odohu on August 16, 2023, 04:22:41 PMBut is politics supposed to really be about lies?

Politicians have told too many lies over the years and lost many of our trust, so because of what we have experienced from politicians which is lying, the new norm now is that every politician is a good liar. Politicians can say anything and make promises just to gain your trust. Until politicians start saying less and doing more, Politicians will always be liars to me and people that you should not completely trust.",

It is because we are supposed to live and interact in meaningful ways with others like us and during that interaction it is just matter of time before conflict starts to occur and we try to avoid it.Who have not lied or thought about lying just not to upset our parents before? It is a common thing, specially during childhood. Now think how a politician feels when they are not dealing with their parents but with a whole country paying attention to them and their mistakes, it is way easier to fall into a whirlpool of lies instead facing the truth and the voting base. That is why politicians will continue lying as long as they are human beings and the culture remains the same in their societies.",

Governance is an agreement to elect people into office and when they get into that office and not giving those benefits of being voted for to the large number of people then people can generalize because it is the aggregate opinion of people and not by random sampling. Agreed that some politicians try to be good but they are suppressed by the large number of corrupt ones because there are no institutions of uprightness.

The alternatives to democracy could be regarded as unacceptable to much of people. It is not always the people who elect their politicians who are at fault, here in my country people who live in sub standard conditions are politically exploited and brain washed so they will do the parties bidding, campaign and even spread the message of a party which is mostly responsible for the failure of our economy and currency. They never had a chance to study general culture and think critically and independently because the lack of education and support they never could get from their parents.",

Even tiny lies, like who took a bit of sugar from the jar, had serious punishments from our parents. In politics, whether someone tells the truth or lies has become a way to judge them. This has been true for a long time, even now. People use it to decide if a politician is good or bad. Back in history, it was really good to have politicians who always told the truth and never lied. Two Presidents, Washington and Lincoln, were very respected by the American people because they always told the truth. Americans trusted them because they believed that if someone is truthful, you can trust them. But it's different now all they do is lie.I think politicians often lie to us because many of them act like they're the most important and think they know everything once they're in power. This makes them careless with what they say and do, and they tell lies without thinking about the consequences. They do this because they know they have followers who believe everything they say, even if it's not true. These followers don't care about the truth because they're influenced by things like religion, tribal loyalty, race, and where they come from. It's like they're brainwashed and don't question what these leaders say.",
