  "content": "Blockstream, Sevenlabs and Poseidon Group are working on launching new bitcoin decentralized exchange called XDEX, and it is being built on layer-two Liquid Network.They plan to to add assets like Bitcoin, stablecoins (USDT, Euro and Swiss Franc), security tokens, Blockstream Mining Notes and other assets issued on Liquid, that could be traded peer-to-peer.XDEX is built on open source protocol TDEX and I think it will be based in Switzerland so I am not sure if they will ask for any KYC for suing their exchange.Website is already released with basic information and they plan to release Android and IOS mobile application with web platform in future.Website: https://xdex.ch/Official blog release:https://xdex.ch/xdex-the-first-fully-decentralized/This topic is opened for free discussion about this dex exchange, and I am not affiliated with XDEX or Blockstream in any way.",

I am not official representative of this exchange so I don't have any additional information other than stuff I posted above, so you have to ask developers for more details.There is a whitepaper for TDEX exchange, and TDEX is using open-source protocol that XDEX is built on, so you can check that out:https://tdex.network/",

They will obviously collect data and share it with law enforcement when needed. I think if Governments pile pressure on them in future they may pull out of the game or begin asking for KYC like Localbitcoins didQuote from: https://xdex.ch/privacy-policy/Collecting and Using Your Personal DataTYPES OF DATA COLLECTEDPersonal DataWhile using Our Service, We may ask You to provide Us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify You.

      "body": "Nah, people won't be bothered with the KYC procedure. Companies located in Switzerland don't have to follow such regulations.An example with https://relai.app a well know service there. You can buy and sell with € and with no KYC. You don't even need to create an account and you can't do it.The country is 'unusual' regarding privacy in finance, hence a lot of taxes evasions were done here before (less nowadays). I admit for the cases with law enforcement they will snitch everything (as any company would do). But Hey we're all good guys hereThis said, thinking about it I would say it's not a decentralized exchange as we usually define it. Perhaps it should rather be called \"hybrid DEX\"QuoteAccording to the blog, it is like the Android and iOS app would be launched when the decentralized exchange is launch? Or the exchange would be launched first in a way people will only be able to access it through the web, while its Android and iOS app would be available later?Firstly the apps for smartphones then a web-based version. It's my understanding of QuoteXDEX plans to release a web-based version of the platform and to add traditional securities offerings at a later date.",
