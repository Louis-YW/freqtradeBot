Why do you think this happens? What can I do?",

Why do you think this happens? What can I do?I am assuming you have read it on the Mining Chamber website which I agree is one of the best sources for mainstream overclocking of any of the modern GPU-s,however you have not read carefully that whenever there are two values like in the case you are having problems,one is for Linux the one with higher frequency and the other for Windows,so the best you can do is follow the overclock settings and put memory clock at 1100 for Windows.Do not bother going further as it won't give you a higher hash rate but it will bring you quite some crashes.",

Thank you so much for your helpI don't think you need them in Windows and as far as I know they are mostly for Linux,leave the core clock untouched at 1050 and only put the memory clock to 1100 and you should be good to go.I think you cannot add these values in MSI Afterburner,they are mostly for people who use Linux,most precisely the HiveOS system to mine as that system has developed some built in options like those for the miner software that are configurable by the users.Just go ahead and enjoy mining nowÂ  .",

Why do you think this happens? What can I do?Well i use vega series morethan 5years but above 1100 memory clock will crash when mining. And it was max memory clock for vega 64. And using ocd is more reliable than msi afterburner for vega series, dont forget use hw info for realtime clock checking. This the only true value you will get in realtime gpu underload. Overclock app on trying to perform but reality is different. Carefull what are you doing, hbm cannot be replaced if die",
