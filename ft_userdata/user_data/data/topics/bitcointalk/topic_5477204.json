  "content": "Would self-hosting an API (or something) that managed my signature be frowned upon?For example, having a price ticker scape BTC price and update it in text/BB format every 30 mins via tapermonkey or something like that to my signature destination.http://html/body/div[2]/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/form/table/tbody/tr[3]/td/table/tbody/tr[13]/td[2]/textareathis is just one way to go about it. I could explore unofficial Api's and see what could be conjured up.I guess my main concern is even if this is fair game, would it be frowned upon it changing so much?I could see it potentially causing confusion in archives and stuff, or just being annoying if a color changed or something every 30 mins even if I'm not posting.I'd like to tinker with the notion though! I've been thinking for years of something different and neat to attempt involving signatures.",

There's a random delay in checking, but on average it should be at least once every 24 hours. If you change your signature a lot, you'll just get a large archive. That's okay.

This give me more ideas like the feedback system they had via scripts.",

      "body": "Mturk was a platform for micro earnings offered by Amazon, it was kinda like microlancer , but you would do stuff like validate receipts , test/enter captcha, Identify pictures, train bots ,surveys all kinds of stuff  you had tm/greasyfork scripts  with lots of downloads that basically acted as a 3rd party vetting system about the vendors offering the jobs once enough people used it. It also had convince scripts built in.I can't believe nothing like this has been made for Bitcointalk tbh (to be fair I couldn't belive a scripted secondary platform like this existed for a site that generally paid pocket change for task, it was Amazon though.), we could do something like it right ? have wallets used under profile , signatures posted Script blocking. Payment request,hot key post inserts like payment request. Merit to post ratio. Lots of useless uses but cool! The mturk script had features like a good rated vendor posting a high paying job would initiate a chime/notification, maybe something could be made on bct without login data needed. I went down a new rabbit hole playing with CF pages/workers.I'm impressed and can't believe I missed this. Based on what I see these can host simple website and apps free,possibly forever?Worker routing has my interest in particular. Idk I'm still messing with this stuff scoping it out. Maybe a system could be built on it and really be set and forget.https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/Potential for a whole layer 2 of Bitcointalk.org user experience. not just signatures. Just thinking out loud.",
