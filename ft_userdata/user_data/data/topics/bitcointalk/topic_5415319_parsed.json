People is just too eager to gamble that’s why they are very hard to stop which force the government to create a law to properly regulate them and charge tax at the same time. I believe people will still find a way to gamble even government will prohibit people to use it. Personally if the punishment will be prison I believe I will behave myself because I’m not that compulsive gambler.",

They are mostly an assumption to get people discussing what doesn't exist. But such posts cannot be ignored because there is always an answer and in the real sense there could be genuine similar questions which cannot be snubbed.Bitcoin has brought liberty together with internet, everyone is at the liberty to chose the extent to which they want to exercise their liberty.",

      "body": "At the start of the implementation of the new law, I might stop gambling. Normally, the strictest phase of policy implementation is when it is newly released. So I probably would cease from gambling. But as soon as I observe among other gamblers that they are freely gambling online without the authorities even noticing them, I might also try. But if I see that those who are violating the law by moving into online gambling are penalized, I might as well stop gambling for good.",

Like in our country, there are games that are legal, but there are games that is underground and the police as always in the lookout. But you know what? there are still people who prefer that kind of illegal games and are willing to bet on it despite the risk of being caught by the police. So I would say gamblers will always find a way, whether to continue with their gambling thru online betting or other ways. But me personally? I might have to stop and just obey the new laws, I don't want to get caught and sent to jail.",
