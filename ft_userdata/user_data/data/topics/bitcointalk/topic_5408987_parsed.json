That's why, most project came with some solution.Supported multiple chain on their ecosystem, like some specific chain for their game activity and the other chain like \"ETH\" for their token trading.",

But of course, once eth network reduced their fees significantly, it will be a very good attraction to users and developers. But whether SOL or ETH, the games have their fair competition.",

Chains like Solana became popular because they thought they could provide solution to the Ethereum's congestion problem which leads to slow confirmation and high transaction fees. Solana does have a problem of its own like network shutdown during attacks or outage.I personally believe major ETH competitors will remain.",

Yes, that's why it will still depend on your perspective.There are projects that are good in the solana network and the same goes in the ethereum network. And both networks also has worst projects that we shouldn't invest. But if it's all about popularity.We all will agree that it's on ETH.",

If Ethereum can finally fixed its gas fee and have a limited supply wouldn't Ethereum blockchain be more attractive than every other?.Games on solana used to be touted as a match/pair made in heaven; but it has failed to live up to its expectations. With recent failings in the solana ecosystem, and the nft world on solana turned to a defi scam blockchain makes it difficult for most games to even think about switching to the solana chain. Even the ethereum chain is struggling to hold on to most of its games independently. The biggest chances of a successful gamefi is on bsc network and ethereum network too. An important note, with or without the ethereum gas fees issues, it is already the most attractive chain",

And if you compared to Solana, I think Ethereum is always better, Ethereum has more holder, meaning that you can have bigger target market, and with Solana hack happened recently people will be more hesitant to use Solana.",

What just they did is all about making them strong and a sort of healthy market competition and I believe they are providing good services to their clients for the sake of making them known to the community.
