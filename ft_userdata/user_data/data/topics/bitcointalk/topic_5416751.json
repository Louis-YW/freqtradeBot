      "body": "Taken at face value, this news might seem like a non-story. But in the world of cryptocurrency, this is big news. Because there are so few large companies that accept crypto payments, the fact that Google is going to accept crypto through Coinbase suggests that at least some businesses on the corporate level are beginning to take cryptocurrency seriously. It is a good sign for the market. Google and Coinbase's partnership will increase the visibility of digital currency, and may push competing cloud services providers to adapt similar measures. This move also helps to legitimize digital currencies as a form of payment, which should boost their adoption rate.",
