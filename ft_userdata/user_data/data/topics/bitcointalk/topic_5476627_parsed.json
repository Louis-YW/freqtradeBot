I literally don't know what to say to that, but what I can tell you is that your funds are better off in your previous wallet. I've never used a Samsung Wallet before and I believe not everyone here has even heard of it before. But if you feel safe with your Bitcoin there, then it's your choice.",

I doubt it is a cold storage wallet, if it isn’t then no it’s not safe to use. Buy a Ledger or a Trezor from their official online stores.

Well nobody will crucify you because it is your decision which you have chosen to use. In Electrum everything is very simple to use, and the only thing you need is to keep your seed phrase and the login password. Samsung is not a legit company and it has fake products in the market and if they have then they are not truthful. Therefore your coins are not save. I believed, I have seen them accepting Bitcoin in one of their Head Quarters but I not heard of them having a wallet. Anything Centralized is not advisable to use because the authorities can close or stop them at any moment if they violate the law.",

If you're not too late, I'd advise you move your funds quickly out of the Samsung wallet.Using the word dump seems harsh to me, there are many ways to tell OP that electrum is the best software wallet. Also the issue of creating just any fake wallet can happen to any wallet even open source but just as you said open source can be verified by Tech savvy people to check for bugs. As for OP I found out that the Samsung wallet seems to be a multicoin wallet if that’s the reason you opted for it I would say there are other better alternatives like unstoppable which is proven, also the best wallet for bitcoin is bitcoin only wallets and it’s should be open source and cold storage if the amount is much. So I will advice you have a rethink and choose again.

There other alternatives apart from even Tezors like Passport, Keystore and Coldcard",

What a surprise by them I guess?Anyway, storing your Bitcoin there just because they're a \"very legit company\" is dumb in my opinion. I mean you forget about the security of your Bitcoins and put it on a centralized company like Samsung.I guess just saying that you need to be ready if things do not go the way you want them. What I mean is that I don't consider it safe even though it's a non-custodial wallet just because it's still owned by a centralized company. Go follow what everyone is saying, and return all of your Bitcoins to your Electrum account. I can just imagine somebody creating his own Samsung Wallet, listing the seed phrase then selling that phone to an ignorant one who just wants a Samsung phone, and because he's involved in crypto as well, he decided to put all of his Bitcoins on his Samsung Wallet without knowing that somebody also has access to it.I'm not a Samsung phone user, and even if I do, I will not put my Bitcoins in their wallet.",

It is unrealistic to believe that those companies will always make compensation for their customers. It can be true with other things but in cryptocurrency industry, it is very hard to execute compensation when all money can be gone with a bug.Additionally a hot wallet is not safe to store all bitcoin there. It is more vulnerable to hacks than cold wallets or multi sig wallets.Recommended walletsQuoteWallet Basics:Do not use wallets that don't give you recovery data; these wallets are likely controlling your keys.Do not use paper wallets unless you're an advanced user who understands all the risks.Do not store large amounts of value in single signature wallets.Make sure your heirs know how to recover your wallets without you!Note that it is NOT recommended that novices use the Bitcoin Core wallet.

I downloaded it from galaxy store and it is introduced in samsung's official website too.The reason why we chose bitcoin was because we wanted to have control over our own money without needing a third party. Otherwise we would stick to banks and never bother with a volatile money that has very little adoption.To have that full control you need to know what the tool you use to create your keys, store your secrets, create transactions and sign them, sync your wallet, etc. actually does. That requires the tool/wallet to be 100% open source, transparent and popular enough so that it is reviewed and bug free.You can't say that for Samsung Blockchain Wallet because it is closed source and relies on the centralized company that creates it and the centralized servers it uses to sync up. So not only you may not be completely secure but also you don't know how much access the company has to YOUR money!Others are suggesting something like Electrum because it fits what I explained above. It is 100% open source so you can verify the code yourself and if you can't do that, you still know that because it is popular and has been around for about a decade it is reviewed by enough people to be considered safe.",

Even if you will manage to keep your device secure, you have to consider accidental drops (never happened to me luckily in my life), theft, damage, software/hardware problems and etc...
