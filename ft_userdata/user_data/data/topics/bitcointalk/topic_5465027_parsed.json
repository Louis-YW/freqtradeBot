Well, I guess it's high time that everyone should invest in VPN or Monero or anything to dodge IRS because what I see there is not just an invasion of privacy but also the restriction of sovereignty that crypto offers.

It's not a bad thing if you don't mind not losing your data to the government, I guess it's not especially if you have a Driver's license and have been employed. But wouldn't this defeat the point of having a crypto in the first place? That the government doesn't have any hands on the table to mess with your finances?",

Or if worse things come, going abroad is still an option for those in the US.Russia introduced a mandatory tax on crypto a few years ago. What of it? Nothing succeeded. Most of those who have crypto or use it on a permanent basis are still in the \"gray zone\" without any obligations to the state in the form of tax deductions.Until now, there are no tools that would allow to establish the beneficiaries of transactions. Therefore, let all these laws go to one place and very far away.Yes, there is some rationality about investing in VPN. I am convinced that the dawn of this direction will soon begin again, as managers increasingly penetrate into the private lives of people, which is unacceptable.",

This article is about non-payment of taxes by an individual. For example, a citizen received $10,000 from 1 person, then you can try to find the sender and prove non-payment of taxes, and if it is a transfer from 20-30 people for $200-500, then you need to take testimony from all of these people. No one will do this, and a citizen is not obliged to testify against himself and make the work of the tax inspector easier. The largest shadow market for exchanging cryptocurrencies in Moscow, you can easily exchange cryptocurrencies for tens of millions of dollars in cash there.If the law works that way, then that’s how it should be. There is such a practice in the world: the better the standard of living, the fewer freedoms citizens have, but in Russia there are a lot of freedoms",

Not sure if that will happen since most countries would likely want to tax crypto as aggressively as possible. AFAIK in my country any crypto transaction is taxed regardless of the volume, but you can still do P2P with no trouble. It is better for me since it allows me to pay less tax compared to before, although it doesn't contribute anything to privacy or data security at all.",
