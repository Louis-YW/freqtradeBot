Well, its highly surprising though because for a businessman the money matters more but there are exceptions as well.This delisting will not impact the ETH market at all because the volume is nothing in p2p compared to centralised exchanges so if there is any centralized exchange do such move will make great impact but its highly unlikely to happen.",

This was like a Bitcoin but only in the Altcoin category. Delisting it will scare more people not just the ETH supporters.I am sure we don't want that to happen. The FTX case was different. They did things which are too inappropriate already and karma got them but for ETH, I think they are still doing great despite of some controversy. By the way I check Paxful and I see that there is still ETH on their list and then there's also Stable Coins. I thought they only support Decentralized coins? HHmm.",

Therefore i would guess that this announcement and decision does not really have a big impact on Ethereum if it has any impact at all.To the reasons for his decision. I know that a lot of people disliked the fact that ETH switched from PoW to PoS and i guess it is also true that big exchanges and also big whales have a lot of power over the network now because they own so much ETH, but i also think that PoW is a consensus mechanism that is just not fitting in the world of today anymore, where the big topics are climate change and to save energy.",

As he mentioned over Twitter when asked about stablecoin is what made the company profitable, he disagrees with the following statementQuote from: https://twitter.com/raypaxful/status/160557603778127872094% of our p2p marketplace trades are in #bitcoin I understand there might be a leftover of reserve that Paxful currently held, based on https://status.paxful.com/. Nevertheless, this kind of move tells mediocrity. It conveys that the company does not walk the talk, above all, I might safely say it is just a PR/marketing move.",
