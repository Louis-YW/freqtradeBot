Bounties and signature campaigns are different.When talking about bounties, it usually about tokens and tasks on social media. They barely run bounties with signature campaigns as part of their bounties. If they have a signature campaign, its payment is in token too.When talking about signature campaigns, in my opinion, it is about campaigns pay participants in Bitcoin or stable coins. Payment rates in those campaigns are better than in bounties. However requirements from managers will be higher and you must be competitive than other participants, with good post quality history to be chosen.You can find jobs, work and get bitcoin or altcoins then convert (sell) altcoins to have bitcoin.Cryptocurrency job list[Guide and Advice] New Here?

Which is why you can use it as a Bitcoin investment medium, but it won't work for everyone. So I think the best way to invest in Bitcoin is to set aside some percentage of your monthly income for Bitcoin. And to continue this investment. Then it will follow DCA which will reduce your risk a lot. This is the investment plan and you must hold it long term for profit",

The dollar-cost averaging strategy, aka DCA, is likely the most common way folks invest in Bitcoin nowadays. Â The reason being, it lets you steadily buy Bitcoin over time no matter the current price. Â Doing so evens out how much you pay on average and lowers the chance of feeling like a dummy for buying Bitcoin at a premium right before the price tanks.",
