If it is \"mainly ETH\", then you can advertise in the Altcoins section. In particular, Marketplace (Altcoins) or Bounties (Altcoins) are boards where you can advertise services with altcoin payments.Also, it would also be helpful if you could give us a little more information about the job as well as a feel for the pay level.",

I recommend using escrow if you decide to give payment after the task so both parties are save and there is no chance of scam.",
