  "content": "Let me share you a story.A certain man all his life while working never thought he was going buy a car he could call his own, then one day fortunate smiles at him and he was able to buy his first ever car. Filled with immeasurable joy he drove the car to his work place the next day. At the close of work that very day he walked out of his office forgotten he came with a car of his, stopped a cab (public transport) and boarded home. On reaching home, his wife astonished seeing her husband from afar, someone who left home to the office in his new car is coming back home using a public transport instead of his new car.There and then she asked him, what happened to your car?Diverting this story a bitcoiners' life. We would find out that many butcoiners today have lost some good asset of theirs as a result of this kind of scenario in the story above.You hear people crying that they have forgotten, lost or misplaced their wallet phrase/seeds or even their password. Some of these stories may not be unconnected to the case of this story above. Mind you it wasn't because the man in question was careless, unserious, or perhaps whatever words that you feel could fit in for the situation. But probably because he never imagined in his lifetime that he could own a car and as such the reality never connected or linked with him even when he got his own car. Same with some butcoiners who never imagined they could make or achieve certain assets and being overwhelmed by it they loss connect (psychologically) to access to that asset consciously or unconsciously.DEVELOP A DIFFERENT MINDSET:Today, let everyone out there who's still working hard and investing hard, haven come across this story, take a decision to have a change of mindset, a millionaire/billionaire mindset so when things starts pumping better and higher increasingly in figures you wouldn't be overwhelmed cause already the millionaire/billionaire mindset was already there before the reality emerged. cause in Bitcoin anything good can happen.Think about it my friend. Just think about it!",

Although that was believed to be due to health problems such as Amnesia. I think it's not entirely impossible for a new car owner who has been used to taking public transportation to forget he got a car and instead, took public transportation he has been used to.",

It does seem like something you would expect to see in a movie or TV show. Think of it like this. He has gotten used to riding the train and using public transportation so much that it's become instinctive. He forgot about his car because public transportation is all he ever used for years. I remember an episode of OFAH when Rodney got married and moved in with his wife (of course). After his first day at work, he returned to his brother's flat like it's the most normal thing. So Dell tells him: \"can I tell you something Rodney? You don't live here anymore! That always makes me laugh.However, you can always return to the parking lot and get your car. You can never retrieve your coins if you misplace your seed or don't write it down.",

Imagine having been there and having BTC in your wallet; then you didn't mind it too much because it has little value, and you eventually forgot it. I think that's the hard part for everyone, not just those who experience it but also those who have something right now and don't seem to see its value then. It is just the hope that would make them feel that it's worth hanging on to, and if you manage to have it stashed and make it grow, it could bring you something valuable, or it could not. Either way, you would still decide what to do for that current asset. Could this be applied with everything and not just assets? Like loved ones or something",

That was an interesting and somewhat amusing story, but I am not sure how it relates to a bitcoiner forgetting or losing his wallet's password or seed phrase.It is one thing to get used to doing things in a certain way, and some people need time to adjust to the new situation, but it is quite another to behave irresponsibly toward your own property. Sure, I have lost passwords and wallets, but that was because of my stupidity, not because I used to do things a certain way.",

They are used to it and do not strive for more. On the contrary, they are afraid of big money. This is how these people live for years without changing anything in their lives. They have risen to their own level, and above that, they believe that this is not their level.But if in life they get a chance to get more, they will most likely miss it, due to their hopelessness, not even stupidity, but humility, that they don’t need more.Here you need to understand that bitcoin can change the lives of such people for the better. You need to accept this. Take the opportunity to change yourself and your thinking.But when it comes to missing bitcoins and losing passphrases for them, it's hard to blame the people who got interested in bitcoin in its early years.If you are told a story today about a new item, coin, or something that people cannot accept and believe, how many people will take it seriously?But everything else is correct. If someone is currently investing in bitcoin and writes his seed phrase on a piece of paper in chicken handwriting with his left hand, as described in a recent post, the loss of his investment will be guaranteed. But only the owner has himself to blame.",

Just like banks have a fundamental flaws that you need to trust them. People should decide for themselves which flaw is more dangerous.",

However, the situation of the man in your story and of Bitcoiners who lose or lost access to their wallets don't connect for me. Come to think of it, cases of lost password/seedphrases are almost a thing of the past now. Such were mostly for early adopters and that could be because then most people didn't believe Bitcoin would amount to anything this big. Thus the carelessness in safeguarding such vitals.

I agree with you on your view about this story, I don't think is possible for someone to forget his brand new car simply because he is not use to cars or he got the first since his life time. Change is constant so I see no reason why some one who just purchase a new car will forget his car key talkless of the car itself that's impossible and wrong story, he could forget the key but once he get closer to his car sure he will dip hands into his pocket to look for it.",

Anyway, more than this millionaire/billionaire mindset which is actually very risky, what people should be accustomed to with the advent of Bitcoin is freedom. I guess we still have yet to develop in us that independent-from-the-banks mindset. I guess many failures in Bitcoin safekeeping stem from the fact that we have yet to successfully internalize the we-are-our-own-bank mindset. Many easily forget the implications and responsibilities of becoming their own bank. For example, they got into Bitcoin but kept their funds in a custodial wallet. Or they kept their funds in a hardware wallet but stored the seed phrase in a cloud storage. Our mindset keeps returning to the old thinking that somebody is safely keeping precious things for us. That has already been changed with Bitcoin.",
