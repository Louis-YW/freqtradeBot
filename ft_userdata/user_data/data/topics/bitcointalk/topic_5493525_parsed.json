Is this how blocks mined immediately after halving would be?Despite the reduction in block reward, block mined are more with transaction fee. The total reward for block 840000 is 40.75 BTC.It was the expected one in the market,when the price of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies was in bull run.It will impact the fee of the cryptocurrency and mainly the bitcoin.This happened by two factor,one is the demand of the bitcoin was multiplied to 10x as compared to the normal time.Every one try to get some profit by investing in the bitcoin.Second factor is mostly not expected one,because the exchanges try to hold the bitcoin in their exchange.If the fee goes high,most of the traders will try to hold their money in the exchange mostly to withdraw later or at the end of the bull run.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on April 20, 2024, 12:49:02 AMWhat.... this is going to be disappointing if the bitcoin are not able to afford making transactions all because of this, this is now going out of hands and i just want to believe that its because of the halving with new block block reward that is causing it, maybe we should expect such to only last a day or two, then we go back to how we have been used to, provided that this is not the first experience in the likes of it, we can rather choose to hold than sending at this high cost. The demand for the bitcoin will be stable at the halves period,but the transaction will be reduced because of the fee in the exchange.The O.P may exchange their bitcoin to other coin and easy withdraw to the other wallet.The fee mentioned here was extremely huge like 120$ for the transaction,it’s better to hold the bitcoin now till the transaction fee for the transaction become normal one.Because the way of spending huge money for the fee will affect you in huge way.",

If Bitcoin miners have good income, profit from mining, they will continue to mine Bitcoin blocks, to receive rewards from block subsidy and transaction fee.Things are going on a good direction for Bitcoin network and miners.Hype on Bitcoin blockchain last two years comes from Ordinals as you can see some information from Glassnode Insights' report months ago.Inscriptions, Mempools and Miners",

There was an \"artificial\" injection of a rather large number of transactions (the first suspect is the Ordinals Attackers) into the mempool which has only manipulated the fee market and significantly increased the fee rate by creating this fake competition.Luckily the attack is becoming very expensive so it can not continue for long but the attack itself will not stop as long as the exploit in the protocol exists and the fake market where they sell fake tokens under the codename Ordinals exists. That is creating an incentive to spam attack bitcoin.",

The fees have been skyrocketing since the halving block and even before the halving. People use https://magiceden.io/ and OKX exchange to buy runes which increase the number of transactions. But, If I am not wrong, We had half a million pending transactions a few months ago and yet the transaction fees were around 200 sat/vB.

OP when you posted mempool was 1345sat/vB in low mode 1760 Sat/vB in medium mode and 2202 Sat/vB in high mode. Currently I see much less than the situation you mentioned. Such increase may be due to increased transactions in the market. There is nothing to worry or despair and wait for things to return to normal soon.",

Confirmation time is another bitch of a problem if you're in a store that accepts bitcoin (unless you pay whatever the going rate is for a fast transaction).  If you want to buy something from a merchant that uses Bitpay, for example, any of the altcoins Bitpay accepts are better alternatives than bitcoin.  I wouldn't call LTC a shitcoin, but it's a coin for spending.  Bitcoin is a store of value, an investment, a speculative instrument.  It just isn't a great currency.  I still love it, though!Quote from: Helena Yu on April 20, 2024, 05:27:08 AMThis is crazy someone send 0.00020330 BTC to three addresses but he spent 0.99 BTC just for the fees.
