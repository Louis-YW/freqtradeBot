Apart from that, I am at certain sites pretty well known as an honorous member (rollbit, stake), so maybe you ever heard of a Maltese Falcon there. Regarding the link, you are right, but I really have no clue how to do this. But more important, he and I worked things out so maybe the road aint that smooth, the result is ok.Also, I never ask to be trusted, I know I am, good enough for me, I am not asking for loans. I just want to punish scammers.",

A few months or years ago The user attempted to cheat RealWinner(blackjack.fun player). Lately, you are also a victim. After reviewing his profile I can see he is asking for some loans several times here in this forum. I am pretty sure the user will not pay if he gets a big loan. So it's a red signal for all the members, basically for the users who are involved in Lending. Note: OP you should include his profile bitcointalk profile link in the main post.",

He asked for a no collateral loan and did not get his offer fulfilled due to the shady character.",

We even came to a new deal, a third chance a week ago, I would get 100% of the comission and possible leaderboard payouts would be split. I also think it's a bad attitude to blame victims. Doesn't matter how naive someone is, as a human being you should never scam that person.With the new commission he aint paying, the total debt sweetlou has is already 4k.Regarding the new deal, here is this:",

Once if a person tries to scam you, he will again scam and therefore he should not be trusted. That is why we say that it takes time to develop trust but once trust is broken, it is very hard to again trust that person.",

Based on the fact that this is such a simple task to do, just claim and transfer. In combination with the potential leaderboard prices that I would split (so he had an incentive to not scam because those would be possibly several thousands), I thought he would have much more to lose if he scammed me again. Apaprently he did not and therefore scammed again. Of course I could still go for those leaderboard prices, but my current grudge against him is so big that I won't (like last time that is).",

Although I won’t blame you to trust this guy since the deal is just a commission while sweetlou seems very trusted way back when I’m still playing on Blackjack.fun.I really wish that I can tag his account for scamming you but the deal is done outside the forum which makes me hesitate to tag him a negative trust for your broken deal. I will still think about this since his act deserves a flag if this happened in the forum.",
