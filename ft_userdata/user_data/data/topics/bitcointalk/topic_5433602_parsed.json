I finished building my house and have 3000W surplus to use from solar panels. Which coins should I consider mining when I have 3000W free power for usage ?Bitcoin I think would be great with a S19 which consumes about just over the 3000 Watt at 3250 Watt but of course I know that there are better coins to mine with such device that use the same hash algorithm as Bitcoin,you can check on whattomine website or minerstat website,both give you a very good indicative approach to which coin is the best to mine.However I would still suggest you Bitcoin because in the long term you can never go wrong with the king of all cryptocurrencies.",

A \"friend\"of mine is mining on SCRYPT (LTC+DOGE) and makes around 1.8$/day, I'm not sure what device he is using though.I think he is using any Antminer L3+ because the other one,the L7 the new device at 9500 Mhsh should do fairly better than 1.8$ dollars daily by mining both LTC+DOGE which is common from people using these kind of devices.Now that I see the profit of the L7 device it is near 14 dollars daily so most likely your friend is using either an old version of Antminer like L3+ or some of the new mini miners that have come out like Apollo and the likes.The Antminer L3 in fact is in red and it can make you almost -1 dollar daily so most likely your friend either has free electricity or one of the new mini miners.",

Which coins should I consider mining when I have 3000W free power for usage ?Doge is better at short term mining, for long term bitcoin is suitable, skip gpu mining at the moment nothing can replace eth, wait till miner sell all their gpu, so less hashrate in gpu mining good for starting again, bitcoin asic tend to be mature in term price/performance, recommend to buy liquid cooler version, cus the noise from the fan is unacceptable for small home mining",

I decided to look for a few L3+ ASICs to cover the 3000W I have to spare, sound is not a problem as they'll be installed in a technical room where it is also cooler to help with the dissipated heat. Now I'll just have to find some affordable prices to buy them, and decide on which pool to connect.By the way, how is this acutally working ? The ASICs are mining on SCRYPT and mine LTC and DOGE simultaneously ? And how are the rewards distributed usually ? In the wallet on a daily basis or is there another mechanism ? I ask because I intend on selling DOGE as often as I can, and holding LTC a bit more.P.S. Thank you for the answers",

LTC miners can earn DOGE rewards by selecting both PPS+ and PPLNS. There is no set distribution ratio for DOGE, and the settlement method for DOGE is PPLNS, meaning that rewards for mining in the LTC pool will be distributed to miners proportionally based on their real hashrate.2. The halving of LTC will not affect the distribution of DOGE",
