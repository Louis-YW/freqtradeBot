But some of these antiviruses are truly good in giving us notifications on which apps should be avoided based on the contents of it. They're detecting it and that's a good help.If someone randomly downloads on the web named \"antivirus\" in general, a lot of unknown names in the antivirus field might be suggested made by cons.",

Unless I use the tool when installing pplugin only",

While antivirus software plays a crucial role in protecting against many threats, it's not foolproof. Also, they might not catch newly emerging or sophisticated threats immediately so they need regular updates.OP is right, we should not rely to antivirus solely. They may not detect 100%, we still have to be cautious. Not because we have antivirus, we’ll be careless. There are actually fake antivirus programs that create fake security alerts and pop-ups to trick users into believing their computers are infected.",
