Congrats to all Bitcoin holders, especially old holders who have the confidence & resilience to continue holding Bitcoin even though there's a lot of bad news that always comes to haunt their beliefs. Here we are now, at our new milestone. I'm sure, next year we will be at least at $150,000 #WAGMI.",

After this, there will be a price spike that exceeds the figure that has just been achieved, my assumption is that the influx of funds into Bitcoin-based ETF products is the main trigger for the strong flow that pushes the price of Bitcoin to a higher level. I still have great confidence in the huge potential that Bitcoin can generate in the coming year, its price could strengthen significantly and exceed other psychological thresholds for investors. I think what investors have been hoping for will soon come true because current market conditions are heading in a better direction, if Bitcoin adoption becomes more widespread next year, then the dream will soon come true because it will further encourage its acceptance in the global market.",

Maybe even just $120k, but I didn't do the math.Second place should be achievable after $250k.To finally topple gold, you'd need to somehow multiply that price by 6, so $1.25m at least. Even $1m won't be enough.None of that looks like it's going to happen any time soon though.",

I caught a bus going to work and decided to check some messages on a social media platform, this was when I saw the news in some people's status. I never knew it will get to the $100,000 too sudden, its just surprising. Many reasons have been given for this rise but I don't care about it. I am more concerned about how Bitcoin has silenced many critics who have predicted the death of Bitcoin.

This marks another major milestone in bitcoinâ€™s history, and a lot of people, especially late investors, are thrilled to still have a chance to profit.But the big question isâ€”are there still people willing to buy bitcoin at this point? For me, itâ€™s tough to expect itâ€™ll rise further to $120k for them to make even more profit if they buy these days.Iâ€™m really happy with the current situation and can only hope the drop, when it happens, wonâ€™t be too fast.",

How many more market cycles needed, I don't know. If Bitcoin makes its ATH in this cycle like $150,000 or $200,000, it's possible that $500,000 will be possible in next 2 or 3 more market cycles. 8 or 12 more years, is long in waiting time but time flies fast and soon we will come to 2028, 2032 and 2035 years very quickly.Trump adminstration will be only one of bricks that contribute to success of Bitcoin, but it won't be a single factor for Bitcoin success and why it hits $500,000.",
