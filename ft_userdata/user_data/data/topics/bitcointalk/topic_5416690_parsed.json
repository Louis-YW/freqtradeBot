You are kidnapping kids and selling organs, would it mean anything if I just say that? Similarly stake hasn't proved anything and unless proved they can say anything but it won't matterJust because I win more bets than I lose doesn't mean I fixed any games dumbass. I have seen people lose 20 bets on 2x on dice and why is it impossible to have a winning run?",

Casinos need to grow in terms of customers and reputation and for that they can't just focus on the virtual world, they need to make a presence in the real world by sponsoring teams and leagues and more in the real world.

I have seen people lose 20 bets on 2x on dice and why is it impossible to have a winning run?The problem is most your bet is almost precise such as predicting the score outcome which is very hard to do. To bet a perfect win in all rounds and no one can do that on multiple events such as 30+ bets in your case. This will surely subject you on match fixing because you keeps betting on same sports with same bet type with an accurate result. And also you fake your KYC which means you are guilty and afraid to reveal your identity. Casino will have the right to confiscate your balance if it was from cheating. But you can still recover your original deposit once you do proper KYC which I assume you will not complete.You are using the match fixing as your main card here since there’s no way for a casino to prove it with evidence besides analyzing your previous bet history and assumption. But they have there ToS that protects them on time like this which you agree so you don’t have any chance against them.",
