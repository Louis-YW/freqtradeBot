It has the ability to perform a lot of functions based on prompts however no matter how powerful its functionality is it cannot replace human. It cannot replace sophisticated software that can detect and prevent hacking what I feel it can do is that it can only detect floors and make recommendations so that there will be no eventuality of a hack. I honestly think that it cannot reduce the volatility in cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency market is just too broad that it requires more than just artificial intelligence to stabilize the market.",

As of the moment a lot of companies who offe SaaS sought to monetize ChatGPT's high aptitude for collecting and processing data from users and deriving a result from the prompt. This could help everyone from small corporate companies who offer SaaS, to maybe even NFT projects. As a matter of fact I think I saw one NFT project out there outright using AI/ChatGPT as one of their features, basically making it personalized and directly usable only to holders of their NFT. So yeah the possibilities are immense.",

Bitcoin with a decent amount of trades and no price regulation naturally has a higher volatility.Volatility cannot be solved by an AI, and the trading system is not broken, does not need fixing.- Jay -",

More loopholes would just eventually pop out sooner or later. Plus, afaik, ChatGPT was also involved in giving out wrong answers (that look/worded right). It's been banned from stackoverflow iirc, and hasn't been unbanned afaik.

And besides his unique abilities, there are a bunch of bugs that he can't get around.ChatGPT is a tool, very powerful and quite universal. Like any other tool, he has his own restrictions, in the sense that this is not a magic wand, not a panacea, and not even a silver bullet. Separate admiration is deserved by researchers who are looking for these restrictions, as well as ways of their possible bypass. However, now it is an extremely powerful working tool that can be found a lot of useful practical applications. Damn it, this thing easily passes the Turing test! In the sense that you cannot reliably determine whether you are reading the text written by a person, or an generated machine. And this is only the very beginning of the fascinating path. Recently, the dumps of the neural network Facebook Llam, which can be launched locally on an ordinary home computer (if he has enough RAM) appeared. It seems that this language model can even be used independently, for example, create a virtual character named after himself on his basis, feed him sparse messages from this forum from his profile - and now he will learn to generate messages in your own style, supporting the dialogs and adhering to the given topic. Of course, he will not have my personal charisma, beard and sparkling subtle humor, but is it not delightful?",

Try to think about it in this aspect. A few years ago, cryptocurrencies made an impressive breakthrough in the democratization of investment. Now we are seeing an equally impressive breakthrough in the democratization of content creation from the side of neural networks. For example, on my home computer, among other things, there is a local instance of the Stable Diffusion neural network. I haven't created an Avatar-type movie with it yet, but hypothetically it's not technically impossible. There is quite a lot of work and calculations to be done, but in principle it seems that I can do it alone, without a team of hundreds of people and without a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars. A talented programmer no longer needs an expensive team and effort to coordinate it when he has access to ChatGPT. And so on. There is a social and ethical side to the problem, because hundreds of thousands of mediocre programmers have already lost their jobs. But this is not a reason to try to stop progress, in the end, the positive role of the state may manifest itself here, of course, if it chooses to save people, not banks, during the next crisis.",
