to produce proof with more leading zeros and not even consider/produce anything with less than, say, 11 zeros.We've tried to find some variables to change in cgminer.c and driver-opencl.c, hoping to find a 'leading zeros = 8' or something, but unable to find anything so far. We realise that perhaps hashing just cant be configured to produce a certain number of leading zeros and thinking of just letting it run a lot longerHowever we are confident this code can be made faster in some way given how opencl/c/bandwidth/resources have advanced in the past 10 years since the time this code was producedAny advice? Perhaps links to some learning resources in order to code something from scratch?Perhaps some insights into sha256 collision attacks to create similar proofs?Perhaps we can modify nonce length parameters like ckpool code allows?Just to clarify, this topic is in the interests of academia",

      "body": "The hash process has a 3% performance gain realising that we want H=0 (32 bit leading zeros)since we have the value of H before completing all 64 steps of the 2nd internal hash (the 3rd hash of the double sha256)For G=any number of leading zeros (1 to 32), there is no early shortcut, since H must be 0.The whole mining process is an exceptionally simple brute force hashing to get leading zeros.So if you want any particular bit to be zero, it's a 50/50 chance.If you want any 2 particular bits to be zero, it a 1/4 chance.If you want 32 bits to be zero it's a 1 in 2^32 chance.As for \"sha256 collision attacks\" - they don't exist.If they did then you'd be best attacking the first 1000000 BTC mined sitting in publicly known BTC addresses.If you want the miner to return nonces that hash with more than 32 leading zeros (exactly how asic mining works)then 2 things:1) if you want 3 more leasing zeros it will, on average, take (2^3) or 8 times longer per nonce found - statistical fact you can't avoid.You can't speed this factor up.2) you have to change your code to filter the nonces it already finds, that already have 32 leading zeros.Since a GPU takes multiple seconds to even find a single H=0 nonce,no one ever cared about (or ever would care about) getting too much data back from the GPUThe miner will hash it again and check if the hash has as many leading zeros as is required by the pool or bitcoin,since a CPU can do more than 10 million a second, doing 2 every few seconds - who cares.With a simple tiny 300GH/s USB asic, (that is 150 to 300 times faster) it finds, on average, only ~70 nonces per second, so even that isn't really a big deal, but I still set the ticket mask to ignore nonces with less than 4 leading zeros in G.",

      "body": "The short answer is the miner hasn't found one yet. Share production is random, you can't influence that.The only way to improve that is a faster miner that can test more nonces faster.The debug logs you are seeing is the result of second level filtering done by software. The first level is done in the ASICand you never see the discarded results. The first level filter is as described above by testing the value of H at round 60.Passing this test does not guarantee the share will be valid but it deserves a closer look. Since the seond level filter never passedno valid shares were found yet. Each additional bit of difficulty requires double the effort and consequently double the time.",
