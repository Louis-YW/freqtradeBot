They receive information about the design of the tattoo to be created, the appointment date, size, and the location of the studio.After getting the tattoo, the NFT owner keeps the NFT in their wallet, ensuring that the artwork remains exclusive to them. Each NFT grants the owner the right to get tattoos based on the number of NFTs they own and the freedom to combine motifs in their own unique design.Even if the NFT changes ownership, the new owner can still work with the artist to create an original design for the tattoo. In such cases, the payment should be made directly to the artist.If the initial NFT owner transfers the artwork to another wallet without getting the tattoo, the tattoo redemption right is also transferred.The status of whether the tattoo has been completed or not can be tracked in real-time on the network. This status is a significant factor that directly impacts the value of the NFT piece.pengworks.comecekucukgok.inkhttps://twitter.com/pengpengworks/status/1682837452958908419?s=20https://www.instagram.com/p/CvAvhFsIxRi/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==",
