  "content": "They've gotten a bunch of coins with the whole Loaded incident. Whenever they get a big stack you just gotta ask yourself, how are they going to use it?Timing is key. Blackrock has an incentive to keep accumulating before they launch the ETF, prices are still too high, at these interest rates risk assets like BTC should be lower. They may just drop BTC's price now that's close to key fundamental floors.They may also want to get these coins used in a future hardfork civil war, probably after they establish the ETF and want to take control away from the crypto people and put it into the hands of the establishment via \"deplatforming\" BTC by removing it from exchanges and only allowing \"Blackrockcoin\".I can see some clusterfuck situation brewing again like we've seen before if you've been here for a minute. You just can predict these things after a while. Not sure exactly when, but something is coming. If you are not up to date with Loaded's coins drama, there's a great video on Youtube about it, just look it up.",

      "body": "I'm not looking for any drama so I didn't even take the effort to search for that Loaded's coin video on Youtube. With how you presented it I don't think a great video could be made out of it. That topic itself doesn't sound interesting. I'm just here to disagree with this hardfork possibility under Blackrock. I don't find it possible for BlackRock to create their very own Blackrockcoin. I know that this institution is manipulative, influential, powerful, and greedy, but I don't think they're stupid enough to create a shitcoin. They must already be aware that all forks of Bitcoin will be a shitcoin and will have a short lifespan.",

I can imagine how much backlash they will be receiving if they decided to start a fork war and that it will be a huge hit for their reputation.Highly likely that they'll stay totally neutral and just enjoy the fees they'll be earning.",

Of course eventually they are going to want to get the cash value of these coins so they do what they always do when they get an illiquid asset - auction it off. These coins are not going to be any different, although I must question who, as an individual buyer, is going to be able to afford millions of dollars worth of coins.",

Having a bunch of money and bitcoin is not going to really help in this decentralized network. It might have if bitcoin were using a shitty algorithm like PoS though Even targeting exchanges won't work because it is not 2011 anymore where 85-90% of the trading volume is in one exchange in one country to be able to have a significant impact on the whole market to have any influence using the price. Today the trading volume of different exchanges is low and mostly below 5 to 10% of the total volume and many of them are not even inside US for Blackrock to have any way of pulling anything like what you speculate.Besides, market manipulation which is the only thing they can do, is not going to really affect any \"fork war\" that may or may not happen.",

Not to mention most of the time you are more likely to get better pricing by buying on the open market by waiting for a dip then getting at auction. The auction buys tend to be for bragging rights and PR then for better pricing. -Dave",
