  "content": "Can I ask you to help in testing the pubkeybitcoin program in various environments, please? It calculates a secp256k1 public key from a private key in (POSIX-compliant) shell (sh, bash, zsh etc. and bc - basic calculator). The goal is that it works out-of-the-box in nearly all environments, e.g. MacOS, Rasbperry Pi, Windows XP (with busybox or something similar installed), *BSD, Android: \"https://github.com/GregTonoski/pubkeybitcoin\". I would be grateful for verification and confirmation or bug reports, improvement suggestions etc.",

Tried running on my Android since I'm currently far from my system. But the app I use can't run shell script and Terminux works better on a rooted phone. But will try later through Linux For those that are interested in running the code. To download the code just click on the highlighted green tagged Clone and click on download Zip. Or just copy the code directly.",
