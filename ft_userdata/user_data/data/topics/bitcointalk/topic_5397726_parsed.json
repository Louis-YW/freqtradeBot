The punter correctly predicted all 16 results on Saturday in the Premier League and Championship at odds of over 263,109/1, and while the majority came in with relative ease, late comebacks were needed in two 3pm top-flight games.Quote\"What makes the acca even more impressive is that there was just one draw across all sixteen games, and our customer managed to pick it out; truly remarkable stuff and we're delighted for them.\"QuoteBET SLIP IN FULLLiverpool to beat Newcastle - 2/5Aston Villa v Norwich - 4/11Crystal Palace to beat Southampton - 2/1Burnley to beat Watford - 17/10Brighton to beat Wolves - 9/5Man City to beat Leeds - 2/7Preston to beat Barnsley - 6/5Bournemouth to beat Blackburn Rovers - 7/5Derby to beat Blackpool - 16/5Bristol City to beat Hull - 6/5Huddersfield to beat Coventry - 2/1Middlesbrough to beat Stoke - 4/5Cardiff v Birmingham to finish a draw - 9/4Millwall to beat Peterborough - 1/2Nottm Forest to beat Swansea - 8/15West Brom to beat Reading - 7/5ODDS - 263,109/1TOTAL STAKE - 60pTOTAL RETURNS - £157,865.59How can you explain such fortunate winning happening for real?

Given the fact that millions of betters make hundreds of millions of bets every week and so on for months / years, such events are inevitable. Few people are fond of such huge odds, but there are such amateurs, so from time to time we see such news.",

Yupp , the bbetslip might come from the one who did it in a routine , like making the multi-bet once every week for years ... and it's just hit by few days ago , a really good luck in those people , but nobody knows indeed on how much he has done making such bbets , could be a winning of £157,865.59 mean nothing if he has lost millions dollar previously.i have experienced something like that in the past , winning on a 100x multi bbet back to bback in 2 consecutive weeks but actually have lost my huge bet 4 times bigger than the 100x winning amount , so yeah nobbody knows what might he have bbeen through.",

Of course its luck unrealistic yes, but it happened so yeah one lucky guy. I don't know, there are different hypothesis: fixed matches, time traveller, fake news, fate or supernatural influence which can't be understood or explained by the science... What most amazes me is that it's not like winning 16 times in a roll on dice, roulette or at any other gambling game. This gambler managed to pick the only correct draw result among 16 games and also predicted correctly a match which changed the result at his favour at 92 minutes of gameplay!Quote from: magneto on May 07, 2022, 10:16:25 PMPretty sure that's 60 pence as well which is 0.6 pounds.You always see these crazy parlays because they are inevitably going to happen given a large enough sample size, but you're probably not going to see yourself hit one of these in your lifetime.Heck, even Drake has hit numerous crazy parlays on Stake - but he bets so much that it is bound to happen.Thank you.
