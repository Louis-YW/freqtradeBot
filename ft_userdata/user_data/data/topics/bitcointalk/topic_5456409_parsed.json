  "content": "The \"pig butchering scam\" is a type of cryptocurrency scam that has recently gained popularity. It involves tricking individuals into sending their cryptocurrencies to scammers who promise high returns or investments with guaranteed profits. The name \"pig butchering\" comes from an analogy scammers use to convince victims to participate. They claim that just like a butcher would divide a pig into different parts, they can divide and multiply the cryptocurrencies sent to them, promising significant returns in a short period. How it is done?This scam operates on a classic Ponzi scheme principle, where early investors may receive returns to create a false sense of legitimacy. These returns are typically funded by the investments of subsequent victims, creating a cycle of deception. Scammers often use tactics to lure people into the scheme, such as social media promotions, online forums, or personal recommendations. They may present themselves as experienced traders or cryptocurrency experts, leveraging persuasive techniques to build trust. Once victims send their cryptocurrencies to the scammers' wallets, they quickly realize that the promised returns are nothing but empty promises. In most cases, the scammers disappear with the funds, leaving victims with significant financial losses. How to protect yourself from this scam?To protect yourself from falling victim to a pig butchering scam or any other cryptocurrency scam, it is crucial to exercise caution and follow best practices. These include conducting thorough research on any investment opportunity, verifying the legitimacy of individuals or platforms involved, and never sending your cryptocurrencies to unknown or untrusted entities. By staying vigilant, practicing good security measures, and relying on reputable sources for information, you can help safeguard your investments and reduce the risk of becoming a victim of such scams.",

Cryptocurrency is new and many people have heard stories of how people earn profits through it so this type of scam wonâ€™t stop now. For me the best advice I will give people is stay away from anything or people that come straight to you on social media or physically promising you that if you invest in it, it will double. Nobody on the internet loves you that much to be pestering you to come and make profit. If it were legit you would have heard about it not the promotional team coming to convince you.",

It got to a time when so many invested large amount of money since that would resultin them receiving higher profits but unfortonately for them they never heard from the company ever again. There were cases of suicide at that time.Another case I have seen in this forum that is mostly likely a pig butcher scam is this thread. This one took place at Instagram according to the victim and it's interstign to read. I'm also sure a lot of people still fall for such a scam.",

There are many names and the meaning is the same. Do not trust anyone or a service that gives you high profits in a short time. They are scammers. Promoting these services does not only mean losing your money, but you may lose one of your friends because you will be the reason for his loss of money because you are the one who promoted those services. Money is not earned that easily, and if there is an individual who is able to double it easily and in a short period, why does he not take a loan and return the money quickly?",

I embedded the link to the article just in case if anyone here would like to go into the details. My core idea was to familiarize everyone here with this scam. Of course there is dating involved, friendship involved, sometime scammers offer jobs, sometime they offer themselves as investment consultant. There are many ways they are able to lure an innocent person to fall for thier scam. The situation is so bad that you won't even realize that you are getting scammed unless the scammer wants you to know about it.",

Scammers will move around from area to area like medicine, stocks, finance, agriculture, many areas and they can use different tools to fuel their scam. Cryptocurrencies are just latest tools for Ponzi scammers.QuoteHow to protect yourself from this scam?It's easy.Control your greediness and focus on basics of money flow including inflow and outflow. It's the zero sum money game so money will move from people to people.If they promise you very high profit, you must think where is your profit comes from. From the thin air, it's not realistic. From other people pockets, likely and if so, you must think next. What will happen if no new people join, inflow will be smaller or broken, the whole Ponzi scheme will collapse.

I actually think it's the most popular crypto scam right now.

When I read the article posted by OP, I immediately remembered one case that still seems quite amazing to me today, it is about an Italian volleyball player who for 15 years believed that he was in a relationship with a Brazilian supermodel, and it cost him an incredible $800 000. I think that in the context of \"pig butchering\" he is the best example of a very well-fed pig, although I believe that there are quite a number of those who have had similar experiences, but are ashamed to admit it publicly.Unfortunately, we increasingly see that people spend more time online without socialization as it once existed, and then in search of friends or partners they become victims of an increasing number of scammers who unfortunately make the most of it. I think that one of the ways to prevent this is to educate children in families, but also in elementary school because then they best acquire knowledge and could protect themselves from such threats.",

For quite a long time people have been victims of this kind of scam, the difficult part of this scam is the stage of building trust with the potential victim, the trust is mostly in form of a relationship/friendship, i don't know if these victims are deprived of 'love' in real life, that they have to seek for it online.Once they establish trust/love/confidence in their victim, it becomes so easy to scam them, mind you that they do not just scam the victim only once, but multiple times, after each episode they always have one more lie to follow it up and drag the victim further into their pit. Thus if the victim remembers how much they have already invested, they'll choose to continue paying to get the promised reward, rather than stopping now and lose all the money invested as well as the promised (fake) reward. The scam only stops once the victim realizes that they have been fooled all along.",

Unlike a Ponzi scheme, \"pig butchering\" involves first building relationships with the victim. This may be an attempt to introduce himself as an old friend or start a romantic or professional relationship. The scammer seeks to gain the trust of the victim, which he then uses in order to get money. And the options for luring are different: sometimes the victim receives worthless tokens, sometimes he gets an account on a dubious site, where there is only the appearance of investments, and sometimes he simply loses all his money right away. Talking about investments within the framework of other topics is simply trapping. Unlike the Ponzi scheme, \"pig butchering\" is luring not with promises of unreasonably high incomes, but with trust in the words of a scammer-interlocutor.",

They get so overwhelmed and blinded by the profit alone that they do not think of the risk in which they may be involved. Just like some years ago when I wanted to buy one coin like that, I charted the seller up on Telegram and we discussed, and he showed me the coin he wanted to sell to me and asked me to make payment to him before he sent it to me. I disagreed with him, and he refused to send it unless I sent it first. At that point, I just decided to send it to him, but before I sent that USDT that day, I just took the decision that even if it's a scam, well, let him or her enjoy it. So I sent first, and the guy vanished.Thanks for the heads-up at @pakhitheboss. At least I am wiser now not to fall into these kinds of scams, but at least I can pass on the information.

They claimed to be using robots to trade so they barely make mistakes and they mostly profit. They make daily post everyday seeking new people to join them and trust them. I have almost started trusting this people, and was planning to send them a message on how I could get started, every time I think back to it, I am glad that I did not and quick came to my senses.
