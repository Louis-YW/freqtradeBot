In executing we need a safe and convenient exchange platform.Usually many platforms require users to do KYC. Why is this important, because this is one of the rules in force, The Government and regulatory agencies have increasingly tightened regulations to combat illegal activity and maintain KYC compliance but if you are looking for a simple and uncomplicated Platform it is also available and you can find it in the link sent by brother @TravelMug. But, My question is if one thing or another happens in the transaction process, are we ready?",

Do P2P trading for cash, or use anonymous ways of receiving funds. I'd avoid getting funds transferred directly to your bank account because you can never be sure where it has come from. If you are going anonymous, I would recommend working on your cybersecurity & privacy strategy to ensure that your identity is separate to your on-chain footprint. Once you master the usage of all of the above, you'll have eluded KYC successfully!",

I've done many cash trades in my life, and I've written before on why I don't think they are high risk and how to keep yourself safe when doing them:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on May 21, 2022, 01:08:10 PMYou are really at no more risk than you are most of the time you go out in public. Anyone on the street could be a criminal out to rob you. People carry cash, bank cards, a mobile phone, jewellery, keys for their car, keys for their house (with their address probably visible on some piece of ID in their wallet), tablets, laptops, and all manner of valuable objects. Lots of things which are far more valuable than a few hundred bucks of bitcoin.Every time you use an ATM, someone could be waiting with a weapon to relieve of your cash. Every time you step out of a store, someone could rob you of whatever you just bought. Every time you park your car, someone could beat you up for your keys and ride off. A face to face bitcoin trade is really no different.Take standard precautions and you will be quite safe:Choose a highly rated trading partnerDon't share unnecessary personal infoObscure your appearance (easily done in this time of face masks for everyone)Arrange your meeting during the day in a busy public location - choose somewhere with CCTV if you want, like a large shopping mallBring a friend with youOnly bring the amount of money (bitcoin or fiat) that you are tradingIf legal in your jurisdiction, bring some kind of weapon for self defenseThere is also a useful guide from Bisq here: https://bisq.wiki/Face-to-face_(payment_method)",

Considering that operation chokepoint is real and banks are squeezing on/off ramping potential, its important to have a way of getting in an out of crypto and the only guarantee method that works no matter what is p2p trading weather that's online or in person. A bank can't stop people from meeting up in person/online and exchanging directly with eachother.. When you find someone you trust and have had a few good trades with, then you can continue trading with them. You don't need to find a new partner every time. Meet up and trade $100. If the guy isn't an ax wielding murderer when you trade, then try again next time with $150 and so on. After 10 trades or so, your not going to feel like he's working some elaborate scam on you.Sign up to my exchange and post an ad for an in cash person meet up and see if anyone messages you.wild-west.trade.

Its not as if you could reverse the transfer. I realize I maybe a little paranoid, but this process is new to me! Same also is with my ecpe here, I don't think this kind of features and functions is what I've been used to seeing, well as for me, it is better to go for the ones we know to be the real exchanges and engage their services while making use of secured cold storage wallet like electrum is more advisable in times of uncertainties like this, better to play safe.",

Direct P2P with a stranger is safe as long as you meet in a crowd place and trade for little amount. It's more safer if Bitcoin adoption on that's country is already big, so it's already normal if someone have Bitcoin, not like people already think you're rich because you have Bitcoin.I will not even engage in P2p in any public place. This option will be good for a country that has adequate security. In a country where there is a high rate of criminal activities this option will not be ideal. You can be robbed even in a market and the police will just be watching. People are not well informed about Bitcoin in my country so each time they hear that you owned Bitcoin they think you own one and above of the currency. They are not aware that the currency can be owned in less than one unit. This means there is a public perception that any Bitcoin holder is a millionaire. The consequence is that you become a target to criminals. I check Agoradesk and I was pleased that they offer deals in my local currency and it is not compulsory to register by email. I might use their service in the future.",
