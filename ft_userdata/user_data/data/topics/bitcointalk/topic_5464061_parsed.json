I also researched some debit cards for the OP but I tried to check them in the list and all of them were already included so I think case must be closed here. As OP got the exact answers.",

      "body": "isn't this something that Crypto.com as well as a couple other crypto bank platforms offer? Crypto debit cards to be precise. I've done my fair share of internet digging these past few days and I found that a project in the EU is doing something a little interesting. They're basically tying cryptocurrencies and banking to offer decentralized financial solutions or something along those lines. One of their feature is this crypto card you can fund with either fiat or crypto which is really cool if I do say so myself (I have little idea about how crypto debit cards work so to me this is the equivalent of troglodytes discovering fire), among other features that sounded neat on paper. Might wanna visit them out but I'm not sure if they cater to the rest of the world already. go here",

Also, most of the Crypto Debit Cards are currently for US and UK. Not many countries are supported yet. I would love to see Binance or Coinbase to go worldwide with their Card.",

Some of them are nice (Binance) some are junk (Wirex, Spectrocoin etc) IMO. Bitpay was expensive if I remember correctly but I had one really long ago. Coinbase closed by account/card without providing any explanation. I've heard Revolut has started offering BTC wallets which could be used to both fund the card and transfer the coins away via the Bitcoin network but I haven't checked this feature myself yet.",

      "body": "I also want a virtual VISA or Mastercard, that is funded by crypto, but finding one seems like a pain in the a$s(especially non-KYC).The problem is that most of those platforms require ID verification(which is pretty difficult to me) and the cost of issuing such virtual card makes things worse.There's a new service called Swissmoney, where you could get a virtual card funded via USDT. They also require KYC and I haven't tried them yet. I don't know if they are legit or a scam.I've used Paywithmoon in the past, but unfortunately they aren't active right now. They used to offer prepaid VISA cards.Also there are services like pst.net and Wallester, but they are focused towards people, who are using virtual cards for Facebook Ads and Google Ads.Good luck trying to find a cheap crypto virtual card with no KYC.",

Most of these things require KYC and I don't think giving up $5 for your details is worth it. You might want to check out privacy-focused debit cards, although most of them end up as a scam.",

If it's prepaid, then both FCF Pay and Ezzocard websites provide them. Possibly Coinsbee as well, but the cards might be less reliable or only work in the US. These are cards you can buy with crypto.Reloadable cards on the other hand are hard to come by without KYC, although if you have Binance then their own card should work fine for that - also Binance Pay is useful for websites with that option.",

I think @Ratimov might update the OP soon since he notice already this topic which needed his help. An updated summary really helpful but it will be gigantic list already since th competition on crypto debit cards goes insane which even exchange already have their own version..",
