  "content": "IF it is not good about, that there is not much information on the subject, it was given that:QuoteThe US state of Louisiana is allowing financial institutions and trust companies to provide crypto custody services.Last week, Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards signed a bill requiring participating Louisiana financial institutions to “implement effective risk management systems” and adequately secure the crypto assets they hold, whether in a fiat or non-fiat capacity. However, we are told that:“We are sending a clear message that Washington is ready to begin working with the private sector to advance this technology for the benefit of all Washington residents, employers and workers.”Source: https://dailyhodl.com/2022/06/24/us-state-passes-legislation-allowing-financial-institutions-to-offer-crypto-custody-services/",

      "body": "washington is not in Louisiana last time i checked...anyways..before today businesses could be custodial services anyway in many many states.Louisiana followed the NY bitlicence scheme where businesses had to register as a \"money transmitter\" to be allowed to operate.this bill is not ALLOWING custodians to be wild west do as they please(as was the case before 2020). its actually a bill about calling them money service businesses(money transmitter licence) and getting them to follow money transmitter business regulations whether its fiat or crypto, if they wish to start offering such a service.whats actually changed since 2020 is that now institutional banks can now apply for this 'bitlicence'-esq permit to operate crypto custody/services",
