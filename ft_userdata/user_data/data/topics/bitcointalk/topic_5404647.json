Wages normally do grow to be adjusted for inflation.No, I didn't get a raise wages even though we really feel how bad inflation is right now. Maybe the government has thought about it but so far it seems that it has not been realized. Worse, the 30% increase in fuel prices more than before was not matched by an increase in wages, this is the worst so far.Quote from: kryptqnick on June 30, 2022, 02:58:58 PM2.

The risk is loss due to fluctuations or loss bitcoin due to user error, the rest bitcoin is a profitable investment asset in the long term.",

People keep saying similar to that, as it is safe haven but people disappoints whenever something global happens such this downtrend of all assets where people expects it will remain to its stands.Imagine you want to avoid your money get devalued by inflation that is something around 5% or so yearly then you invest (as you suggest) your money to bitcoin and then this shit happens where it dumps at almost 60%. Its like your money get affected by 12x the annual inflation increase rate. Then people keep telling you only lost when you sell. True, but it still a lost, same like by the inflation, where your money never decreased by numbers yet it decrease its value since prices of goods increases.",

Why else would he buy so little, as the deal is very profitable? Especially since he is already known for his grand bankruptcy in the past. All in all, I wouldn't put much trust in his laser eyes.",

Bitcoin isn't out of the global economy, so if inflation happens then Bitcoin will act accordingly. People will need more cash and they might start sales which will lead to more volatility in Bitcoin price. So I don't think Bitcoin would prevent global inflation anyway.

You can do it repeatedly and with a predetermined holding duration. The fact that in the future Bitcoin will show the ferocity of the price you cannot forget.Nothing to argue about, but good to start a discussion to get a proper understanding. It's just about how one seizes the opportunity, if they realize bitcoin is a potential asset that can bring them profit then they should invest it for money they can afford to lose.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 30, 2022, 07:13:04 PMThis is not really correct to say because new Bitcoin is created with mining every day so it can be considered to have inflation, but difference it that inflation is much lower compared to fiat currencies.This understanding is correct, the inflation percentage in bitcoin is much smaller than fiat because bitcoin has a supply limit of only 21 million. While fiat can be printed indefinitely and continues to improve over time. Awareness of the benefits of investing in bitcoin is not necessarily based on how well you avoid inflation. Bitcoin is a much better potential investment asset than other well-known investment instruments, and its low inflation rate is just another contributing factor to why bitcoin is worth investing in.",
