      "body": "The sole purpose of the forum is to acquire knowledge about bitcoin and possibly spread little knowledge they also have. The ranking is just a way to distinguish members on how well they most have contributed and also to gain the benefits from most of the incentives like the signature campaigns on the forum. Other than that the rank doesn’t measure or quantity your knowledge. As regards your question it is not that senior members or even merit source are not acknowledging the work of newbies but most of the created threads by newbies this days are just recycling of previous posts and merit is meant to be shared to a post you found worthy or learn a new thing from. Newbies can get merits from their contribution to the forum by answering questions or even ask relevant questions and not necessarily creating threads daily. Currently getting merit is even easier currently if you are actually a quality poster, because they’re high ranking members that have threads you can submits posts or threads that you feel are worthy of merit to. And if they find it worthy it will be merited",

Those newbie ranked members in the past aren't newbies right now because for sure they ranked up already. Those who are ranked newbies as of this moment are either the ones who just registered a few days or a few weeks ago, or they are simply newbies who are posting bounty reports from their bounty campaigns. More merit = more motivation? Hmmmmm I don't think that's always the case because even low ranked members can still contribute in their own ways. I'm pretty sure that these high ranked members that you are saying see those low ranked members out there, and they know which are contributing or not, and if they see that they're contributing, they will give merits to them.",

It seems many of them arrived here with ideas on merit and ranking up already. I used to read of newbies coming to the forum because somebody recommended them a place where Bitcoin is the main discussion and where knowledge could be gained.If I remember it right, I got into this forum because of Primedice. That was during the earliest days of my Bitcoin encounter. There was no merit back then, but when I got here I never even thought of ranks. It was this curiosity that actually brought me here. Lately, I noticed that merit seems to be a topic among newbies already. I wonder how it becomes a motivation to somebody who has just arrived.",

And they seem to know that creating a thread especially in this section talking about merit can bring them benefits in the form of merits.

Avatar is something very common among online platforms. I immediately wanted to wear one, too, but I couldn't find it in the settings. I later on realized it can only be worn by higher ranks. Aside from those who are placing bids in the collectibles section, I don't think it is common among brand new users to make one post after another in just a matter of minutes. As far as PM limits is concerned, nobody probably came here to send PM to different users except those who came here to do business.",

Regarding what you think and your question, newbies' efforts are always appreciated and encouraged with merit, but if you are not getting the merits, that's a clear notice to you that you are not putting in enough effort. So try hard and put more effort into your topics and comments. Create helpful topics with a good idea, give reasons why the idea is good to emulate, and give the disadvantages and advantages of it, and you may likely get merit; ask a very reasonable or genuine question, and you might get merits too. If you look very closely, you will see there are some newbies who already have above-average 5 or 10 merit. They obviously started with some good posts, and even before they started, it was not merit that motivated them; they first of all motivated themselves and created some good topics, which earned them merit.So, motivate yourself and do quality work; don't wait for merit to motivate you, or else you might not get any merit any time soon.Quote from: Basiyu on May 26, 2023, 10:16:32 AMi beg your pardon mr am not a shitposter and am not pleading for you to give me merit,i know what i must to earn merit,as you can see the topic i posted is a significant one,as an expert that you are you should give advice to  newbies not using condemning words on me thanks.LOL, don't take is personal, @Lovesmayfamilis is only scolding you, perhaps you can take it as a challenge upon your self to make a little push up on your post quality. He (@LMF) have not practically called you a shit poster yet, but I think your post is convincing him to conceive the thought to do so.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange👺👺",
