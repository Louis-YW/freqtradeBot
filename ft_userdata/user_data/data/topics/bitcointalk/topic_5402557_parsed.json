If you meant red/negative trust feedback, AFAIK it's not appropriate use of trust system.Quote from: badluckalways on June 14, 2022, 10:33:24 AMplease answer Is he a rude and disrespectful person?yes or no I can't answer such question without human translation (not Google translate) of his posts to English language.he ask from all arabic members to give me negative trustThis is a misuse of trustSome of them refused because they did not deal with mehow he ask from them to get me negative trust , this is bad things He just opened a topic to insult meWe are here to insult each other or to benefit from each otherI hated the Arabic section because of this bastard",

He is really rude. He is an Arab despicable person.This sounds too much like a soap opera.  Any dispute between two members needs to be resolved by those two members.  Trust is not managed by the moderators, so one can do anything about it except the person who left the review.  No one is going to tag Kavelj22 for being rude, that would also be a misuse of the trust system.  If Kavelj22 is leaving trust ratings that have no supporting evidence, the community will notice and very likely remove him from trust inclusions.  Regardless, he's not in DT so his reviews don't show up as \"Trusted.\"  الله يحييكم",

      "body": "I don't know Arabic but I google translated the page;Quote from: Kavelj22 on June 05, 2022, 09:24:27 PMThe member badluckalways had tried to insult me ​​in one of his posts and also in a private message after I posted a warning about another member who wanted to request a loan. It turned out to me later that it was his alternate account. In addition, he left me a disparaging review on my trust page. Of course, this is not important because he is not a member of little importance and has no evidence for his allegations, and he left the same evaluation to the supervisor Omega.Today I found out that two other accounts posted the same rating on my trust page, which confirms that they are all alternative accounts for one person, and one of them is the member bert1587 who has negative ratings after defaulting on a debt in 2021: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=2852592 It is the only account that has a negative rating while the other two accounts have unreliable ratings.The third account: killerbitsler https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3481804I request other members to leave a rating on his trust page especially members of the DT list and this is not for me but to warn other users from dealing with Any of those accounts in the future. Personally I have left the appropriate evaluation.I think you deserve the negative feedback, especially after creating sock puppet accounts to spam trust feedback. It looks like you are guilty of being a scammer, and now you are trying to pretend as though you are hurt.Tell me these are not your sockpuppet accounts1. Loveinday72. medomad58743. Lalas63784. bert15875. happybtp5476. killerbitslerAlso what's the point of spamming the reputations board with different threads complaining about the same thing and then getting them locked?",

Real proof where we can be convinced of what you are saying, your words only aren't.otherwise, you are looking for the same thing here, to \"rate\" someone just because of your call (I guess you expect a negative tag) without any deal with that user.do you find anything strange here?",
