  "content": "In the future, all computers will be reversible. Reversible computation will be many times more energy efficient and computationally powerful than any possible irreversible computation. Reversible computation is the future.Unfortunately, reversible computing has been mostly ignored by the media and academia. Hardware manufacturers are not proactively researching reversible computation, and few people are working on reversible programming languages and software. Reversible computation is not very popular because unlike 'artificial intelligence', 'GPT', 'quantum computation', 'nuclear fusion', 'Elon Musk', 'Theranos', 'information superhighway' , '2020' , the phrase 'reversible computation' is not a buzzword. Humans are attracted to buzzwords similar to how flies are drawn to sources of light that zap them. Yes. Humans are unwilling to educate themselves on what is truly important, but they instead follow all the other sheep to the end of the cliff like they did in Turkey https://www.foxnews.com/story/450-turkish-sheep-leap-to-their-deaths. But the commenters here will probably ignore everything I say and just go on some non-sensical rant about how I should not cite Fox News because Fox News is very bad. Please focus. Fox News is completely irrelevant to the discussion.Landauer's principle states that it takes k*T*ln(2) energy in order to delete a bit of information. Here, k=1.38*10^(-23) Joules/Kelvin, T is the temperature, and recall that ln(2)=0.69314... For example, if you have a gigabyte of random bits and you want to replace all of those bits with zeros, then you will need k*T*ln(2)*8*10^9 energy to replace all of those bits with zeros. In practice, it will cost much more energy than simply k*T*ln(2) per bit deleted in order to overcome thermal noise. If you use irreversible computation (regardless of whether it is CMOS or any other kind of hardware and regardless of technological improvements), then you should expect to spend more than 100*k*T energy per bit deleted. k*T*ln(2) is not a lot of energy at room temperature, but we are about to realize the limit of conventional irreversible computation since it becomes difficult to improve one's computational hardware well before reaching Landauer's limit. Up until about now, it has been easy to ignore reversible computation since The only way to overcome Landauer's limit and compute without spending >>k*T*ln(2) energy per bit deleted is to try to compute while deleting as little information as possible. Energy efficient reversible computing is the type of computing where one computes while trying to delete as little information as possible to save the >>k*T*ln(2) energy that one would otherwise dissipate. Right now, we do not have profitable reversible computing hardware, but we have reversible programming languages, so we can develop more reversible software and reversible algorithms in anticipation for the reversible computing hardware.Now, energy efficient reversible computing will be difficult to get off the ground. Part of the reason for this is that reversible computing has some computational overhead. But the computational overhead is quite surmountable. By applying strategies such as a good solution to Bennett's pebble game to reversible computation, one can turn any conventional irreversible algorithm into a reversible algorithm which means that the process of computing will require a little bit more space and time but as a tradeoff, it will require a lot less deletion of information. This means that reversible computation will eventually outperform conventional irreversible computation, but this also means that it will be difficult to make the first profitable reversible computers.There is no theoretical limit to the energy efficiency of reversible computation. Reversible computation is good for general purpose computing (one should compare this with the hyped quantum computing which is only good for a few specific computations). Why don't more people know about reversible computing? Why are academia, the media, and technology corporations not yet interested in reversible computation? It is now the time for people to become interested in reversible computation since we are getting to the point where our computation is energy efficient enough and close enough to Landauer's limit that we will need to start thinking about reversible computing.I have brought up the topic of reversible computation before, but I have decided to bring up this topic again because reversible computation is too important to only mention once.P.S. Do you have any good suggestions for buzzwords that describe reversible computing? Could we use something like 'ultragreen computing' , 'green computing' , 'adiabatic computing' , 'pre-quantum computing' , 'isentropic computing' , 'perpetual motion computing' (ok that was a joke), 'injective computing', or 'vladimir computin' (I apologize for this joke)?-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

Lol^256.@digaran  you wrote: maybe in another universe (which doesn't exist) , answer: This is not consistent with any science, currently lacking confirmation or denial - it cannot be confirmed or denied. Quantum physics allows for the existence of multiple universes.The laws of quantum physic are not applicable in the real world, and there is no space-time beyond the one universe we are in, there could be more in other dimensions which are hidden from our sight, but all the dimensions exist on the same plane of existence as we are. Things don't just come to existence randomly, everything was designed perfectly and the one God created the universe does not seem to do redundant and no use jobs, multiverse with different versions of us, or even with different creatures seems to have no practical use, since the one we are already in has more than enough space and resources to house trillion times more creatures than we could think of, but that is about another topic, this topic is about a new magical technology which only OP knows and cares about, a technology no one has ever heard of, just like some certain dead coin promoted by OP.Quote from: Filicius on May 31, 2023, 06:05:48 PMWhat started like an academic talk rapidly became a stream of insults and reproaches.

So at that point, we will need to focus much more on reversible computation along with other improvements.\"This is something tesla has struggled to replicate with their self driving AI.\"-In other news, Tesla is just an overpriced overvalued stock bubble because people worship Musk because they are completely and totally braindead. Nikola Tesla is rolling in his grave.When computation gets replaced by partially reversible computation, Intel and TSMC (or whoever comes next) will work on reversible optimization,compression, and branch prediction. But first, people need to figure out the physics and how to construct an energy efficient reversible logic gate since reversible branch prediction will be useless without reversible logic gates. And when people figure out how to make energy efficient reversible logic gates, they can build non-linear feedback shift registers to make a profit (well, at least if everything goes well). After we have reversible NLFSRs running and making a profit, people will work harder on optimizing reversible CPUs for reversibility.

You can play with this language here. http://topps.diku.dk/pirc/?id=janusP or here https://topps.di.ku.dk/pirc/janus-playground/ . The features of this playground are quite limited. There are limited types. There is only one type, namely the integers. You can choose for the integers to be the full ring of integers of the integers modulo 2^32. There are no 64 bit integers, Floats, Complex numbers, etc. And to get into reversible programming, it is best if we had a partially reversible language instead of a fully reversible language. Here is a paper on such a language https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08475 , but along with the paper, they also need to publish a sandbox so that we can write programs in this language because I am not reading the paper unless they provide a playground.Of course, I found a quantum computing playground. Hmm. This is putting the cart before the horse. Before people should get all hyped up about quantum computing, they should do something more reasonable like energy efficient reversible computing. Or at the very worst, they should investigate both energy efficient reversible computing and quantum computing at the same time.Here is how computing should progress: Classical irreversible computing, i.e. regular computing==>Energy efficient (partially) reversible computing==>Quantum computing.
