  "content": "I have been silently reading and watching people's post.. It's mostly filled with worries and lack of faith, bitcoin is here to exist and there are no alternatives. The technology has been recorded already so I don't think anything else would come break the efforts they puts in building bitcoin and blockchain Technology. It's just as computer is being built which includes;1. The first Generation of computer which was built with a vacuum tubes ( At then I believe there were Thomas who didn't believe on that technology but today where are those people)? calm down bitcoin still have a long way to go.. 2. The Second Generation of computer which is solely built with transistors or discrete transistors was then and upgrade of Vacuum tubes.( Yet there were Thomas that kept saying for how long will this last), I believe so..3. Third Generation of computer was then an upgrade of second Gen, that is being built with Integrated Circuits which was far more better than 1 & 2 generation computer. So why killing your self just know bitcoin haven't reached up to 20 years or 30 years.4. Fourth Generation which was then know for microprocessors also better than 1, 2, and 3.5. Fifth was also the upgrade of 1 to 4 generations so it is to come till whatever generation to come..Inclusion and summary, Why don't we have this mentality towards bitcoin and know its the latest Generation that has came to stay which through bitcoin we had a blockchain that featured all forms of technologies in the world, and yet you think one day bitcoin price will fail you? My dear this is No to my answer because those who witnessed those 1 to 3 Generations of computer aren't there again so in essence why not buy bitcoin and hold and think of 20 years to come and more, if only we can centered our heart with the progression of computer then we would patient enough not to talk about price of bitcoin at this present moments.So please bring down your tension and feel free with bitcoin since there are more things to explore with this current Technology.NB.

During the rise of computing, there was a much more tangible and understandable level of progress. Since Bitcoin was beyond, it has been beyond comprehension and therefore harder to understand its progress technologically. To the average person, Bitcoin has always been Bitcoin. They aren't aware of the upgrades it has gone through from version 0.1 to 24.0.1. Until they learn more, it is always the same thing to them. I suppose the same could be said about computing except that the increase in functionality, speed, design etc was all in your face...and also, supported by corporations and governments with almost no adversary to its growth. Bitcoin on the other hand, has the largest adversary of all...all of the interests that are involved in keeping the modern day fiat money/reserve banking system alive, These interests will do whatever it can to hinder peoples comprehension and faith in its progress, and profit from the Bitcoin market.You can't blame people for being worried about Bitcoin and what it will do to their portfolio. It is attractive enough to put your savings into it, but it is volatile enough to make you worry. I do agree that at this point faith should be higher...though since we've seen growth from $0.01, $0.1, $1, $10, $100, $1000 to $10000 to $80000 ath...it's hard to trade or hold an asset at $20-30k without being worried about revisiting much lower price points. It's innate to be worried considering the monumental growth.",

While this shows a trajectory of how many wallets are being created and the projected growth of future wallets, it's actually entirely inaccurate as to how Bitcoin is being adopted. Anyone can create and fund more than one wallet, in fact I believe this would be common among Bitcoin users who use Bitcoin every day. If this is standard practice, this would only become more so over time. It's likely that Bitcoin wallets will exceed internet users in the future, if it has not already. It's also not an indicator of how many internet users are using Bitcoin. Internet users is also inaccurate. There are bots, servers, botnets, proxies, etc. which all could be more than one internet user or many users controlled by one user. All of the data relating to internet users is as accurate as trying to determine how many actual individual people hold Bitcoin from how many Bitcoin wallets have been created/are currently funded.",

Although Bitcoin and blockchain technology have come a long way, there is still a ton of room for improvement and advancement. More and more individuals are starting to understand the potential advantages of using Bitcoin every day, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come. Therefore, if you think Bitcoin has potential and you have the means to invest, it is undoubtedly worthwhile to think about doing so and holding on for the long haul. However, before doing so, please do your research.Right, also why should people may not be worried about Bitcoin is first, Bitcoin has been around over a decade, and its technology has proven to be secure and resilient. While the price of Bitcoin may fluctuate, the underlying blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin remains stable. Secondly, Bitcoinhas a finite supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, which means that it is not subjected to inflation like fiat currencies. This limited supply is also a reason why some investors see it as a potential hedge against inflation. Thirdly, Bitcoin is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network. This gives us more control over our own money and reduces the risk of centralization and manipulation.",
