  "content": "When it comes to securing your bitcoin don't forget about having good basic security practices on your laptop, desktop and mobile devices.That means always using a VPN whenever connecting to the internet, with a good antivirus and anti-malware software, preferably connecting through your own hardware router. These viruses and malware can be programmed to steal your personal information including crypto. Of course you never want to connect to any public Wifi connection without a VPN.I use Malwarebytes browserguard extension for many years that prevents you from visiting suspicious or unsecure websites, known phishing websites, etc.This browser extension is free for many browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Apple Safari, etc. You can also get it free for your mobile device.For antivirus I use Windows Defender and the paid version of Malwarebytes which is very cheap if you get it from Newegg.com.Windows Defender and MB have real time protection but its a good idea to run a manual scan at least once a week. I'm not very familiar with Mac or iPhone but I believe they have pretty good built-in defense against virus and malware. They should considering what Apple charges you haha.Besides that I would advise to stay away from any and all altcoins because they are complete garbage when it comes to security. Not a day goes by when you don't read about some stupid altcoin project getting drained of tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars.When will people ever learn??==============For more advanced users you can choose to connect to free third party DNS like Google DNS or OpenDNS. Also disable WebRTC and IPv6 on your web browser.Also good practice to disable third party cookies.Also a good idea to disable Remote Access that can allow someone to take control of your computer. Remote Access is meant for allowing a legit tech support person to take control of your PC for troubleshooting purposes but this feature can certainly be abused by bad actors to steal your personal information.",

Else, if one uses a public server for his light wallet, his addresses can be linked and his privacy may be gone even if he uses Tor, just because at some point in the past he may have been using a CEX.",

Definitely helpful to have a strong computer and security in the first place, maybe not clicking on suspicious links would help you even more because you're preventing them any chances of entry.",

To protect your Bitcoin, good practice requires that you use wallets you are in control of the private keys, then never save your private keys and every other secret information on the computer or mobile phone irrespective of how strong they may be. This step is more important than having laptops and phones with strong computing power. I'm not disputing that good computers and mobile phones are not important neither do I challenge the fact that a secure computer and mobile device is bad, they are just one aspect that comes after good practice. If you repose so much confidence in the security of your computers and mobile devices, you might be tempted to save sensitive information there and that is dangerous.",

Aand I have been using Windows computers for over 10 years, and so far, I have never had any problems with bitcoins being hacked or any security related issues. So in my opinion, a strong PC is a computer you use properly, using genuine software...It's not true that if you use Linux you're safe, and anyone using Windows or Mac is at risk. As an investor, normal user, I think VPN, or Google service is enough, unless you are a criminal or doing illegal work then you need high privacy protection and use tools like Tor.",

I would also like to say that in favor of Linux, by talking about it, you OP only prove that you have never tried to watch a video on setting up Linux. There may be more than one, but several lessons would give you a good idea that for the purposes you are talking about now, basic knowledge about Linux is quite enough to use it. Besides, you are too calm when you say that you use Windows Defender; this âguyâ already gave several holes in 2023, so you donât need to trust him, just like all the extensions that monitor your every move. VPN can disconnect at the wrong moment with the slightest connection problem, which will reveal your real IP, but you will have due confidence that you are protected.Quote from: headingnorth on April 06, 2024, 01:51:54 AMWhen will people ever learn??Â    https://truelist.co/blog/linux-statistics/",

While it may offer a better chance of good security set up, even a low budget device or gadget like even perform better in the hands of the right user. It's agreeably more about responsible behavior or irresponsible behavior while using the internet, because am very sure that anyone won't just be hacked if they never really left some crumbs of information carelessly on the internet or gave permission to apps without reading properly. Also, using offline wallets should be a better security option for storing any kind of coins that is invested for long term or even short term.",

If you give it a chance youâll probably like it more than windows. Linux is fast, linux is secure. You can run games on it via wine, you can edit videos and do many other things which you do on your windows PC. There are only a few paid programs (often Adobe products) which are not available on linux but these programs are becoming cloud/browser apps slowly and that means theyâll be running on linux too.Just give it a chance, linux is freedom.",

Come to think of it, it's possible to have strong PC and mobile device security like you have said, but would you agree with me that a Bitcoiner can still carelessly leak the security phrase of their wallet to the public? There are many ways a Bitcoiner can expose their security information without even realizing it, and it's a lack of proper knowledge and other mistakes that causes that. That's why, as I said above, to obtain an optimal level of security, it is in the hands of the Bitcoiner.Â Someone can have the best security device in the world, but once they mistakenly download any malware unknown to them, they are finished. Hackers have different ways to attack your device; it could be through emails, receiving any file, or even downloading an image. Keep your detail offline like @NeuroticFish have said, and you will be safe.",

What I am trying to say is that irrespective of the sophisticated devices you use, the safety of your assets and funds is right in your hands, and this is determined by the way you store your keys and where you store them.
