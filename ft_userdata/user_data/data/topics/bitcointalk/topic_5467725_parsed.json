  "content": "Nigerian have used up to $56.7 billions USA dollar from the past years to this year. Only the amount will tell you that Nigeria is not playing with bitcoin. Di transaction of bitcoin in di country dey increase every year. Only dis I know plenty people don join the technology. As I said in the oda thread, wen Nigeria go adopt bitcoin everywhere go be stew. Di acceptance go dey skyrocket. And one of the thing wey dey make people dey accept bitcoin na because the Naira e no get value and im dey devalue every Month. Dis one too will tell the world say Nigeria is very much involved in bitcoin. https://dailytrust.com/nigeria-crypto-transactions-hit-56-7bn/",

The first thing I will say his how did they racked this stats because Omo he suppose to get the right numbers. The easiest way will be through exchanges that KYC but what about the other ones like decentralized exchanges where anonymity Dey. Abi them just take the amount of Naira wey don comot from exchanges. Even so the P2P wey we Dey do with each other selves that one too no go Dey accountable. Make we just agree say this number is just for Exchanges and I believe the actual number go pass like this. Seriously this numbers will be increasing because the best way to save money as a Nigerian now would be to save in bitcoin rather than in any fiat",

If not Nigeria for dey boom by now and e for come attract foreign tourists wey for make Nigeria a site of attraction. So far, I no doubt that figure and if I am not mistaken, that figure is likely more than we think or they have presented here.

I am impressed with the figure, and I know that it will keep increasing because our currency is depreciating, due to poor economy and inflation. As more people are getting worried about the way the Naria depreciates every day, it gives them reason to think of an alternative way to save their funds, and this is where bitcoin will be the only option. Gradually, the youth will know this secrete and bitcoin adoption will increase.",
