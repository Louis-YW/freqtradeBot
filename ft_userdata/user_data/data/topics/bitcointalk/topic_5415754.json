  "content": "Hello everyone! I'm a newbie in this forum, but I've done some research and would like to offer some advice to my fellow newbies. I am aware that I am open to correction and that I am not in the position to offer advice, but I believe that the following points will be of assistance to my fellow Newbies.1. As newbies, Never respond to unsolicited messages from people offering you financial advice or any other form of offer; they are virtually always frauds, and if you respond, the con artists will find a way to convince you. Please make every effort to avoid strange messages..2. Newbie avoid day trading and mining Unless they have a thorough understanding of bitcoin, because Most people who engage in day trading, which are very professional also lose money and you cannot mine effectively with your PC and must get specialized ASIC rigs which very expensive, so as newbie stop thinking about mining. 3. Make sure you have an emergency savings account for fiat currency in case any emergency demands arise before investing in bitcoin by conducting some basic research.4. When you first start investing in bitcoin, do not anticipate becoming wealthy within one to two months. Rather, you should wait one to two years before you even think of taking profit from it. 5. Purchase Bitcoin and withdraw it to a personal wallet so that you may genuinely own it; never keep it on an exchange or web wallet. This is because exchanges are vulnerable to hacking and are not secure.6. Pay close attention to backing up your wallet (the software that contains the key to your Bitcoins) and, preferably, keeping it offline in a secure area. Typically, you write phrases words, on metals, on a piece of paper and hide it in private places likey two places. 7. Due to the fact that these tokens are scams, beginners should stay away from altcoins, tokens, and ICOs, at least initially until they understand more about Bitcoin basics. 8. Don't put too much pressure on oneself to know everything about the world of cryptocurrencies right immediately; it will take time to completely understand it. It takes time, effort, and continual learning to develop the full potential of your virtual money, whether you want to utilize them for trading or regular transactions.Thia post is open for corrections from everyone in this forum, I will be glad if I have more corrections and guide.",

      "body": "2. I will also advice newbies to stay away from trading but to learn it very well first and they should only use the money they can afford to lose. But about mining, newbies can be rich enough to afford ASICs, lucky to have a good environment and government that would favour bitcoin mining. But he has to research more to be able to know if it would be profitable. Cloud mining and other types that someone will want to mine for you is what newbies should avoid.3. Some people are from underdeveloped and developing countries, their fiat devalues significantly and they do not like to save in fiat, example are some countries in Africa, Asia and South America. People in many countries in the continents I mentioned do not prefer fiat at all, or better prefer the fiat of the developed countries like US or UK. Some people from developed countries like Europe, UK and US may still think about fiat. But fiat is always fiat, they always devalued by the government.5. What do you mean by personal wallet? Custodial wallets can be personal wallets too. It would be good to refer to the wallet you are talking about as noncustodial wallet or private key wallet.6. What should be backup is the seed phrase, which can produce the keys. The keys can also be used as backup, but in this time of HD wallet, seed phrase can be the backup. More than one backup is advisable.",

And they don't show you those segments or put enough emphasize on it. Traders mostly talk about the good sides, when they generate profits, and shill certain trading platforms. Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM3. Make sure you have an emergency savings account for fiat currency in case any emergency demands arise before investing in bitcoin by conducting some basic research. You should only invest the money you don't need for more important expenses. Don't put money into bitcoin or any other traditional/non-traditional assets expecting to make profits if your bills aren't paid, your family isn't taken care of, your bank loans haven't been returned.    Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM6.

This is what newbies will have in mind and start to trade and loss more and more.But some people just want to provide signals, these kind of people should just be avoided because they speak more about the profit in a way new traders will pay them money, giving the new traders some signals that may let them start to fail in trading.",

I think he doesnt mean to offend or lecture others with such boasting message. He just reiterate that mining should be done properly and mind that he is also a newbie who probably not have much knowledge or tried mining. I think what he is saying is isnt simple to set up on a pc without any useful or efficient accesory for mining. But what you said is right. Its about factors like you mentioned.",

Even the users with high \"forum ranks\" are still vulnerable to these kinds of scenario that you're describing.#1, regardless if it is a DM or even an email, never respond since they would likely verify that you are indeed the user behind the email/username that they're contacting through a \"blaster\". Not related to the forum, but I receive an email back then that warrants my response. Never ever attempt to respond to those messages.#2, I don't think that \"newbie\" forum rank users should be prohibited in going for mining. Encourage them instead to research really really really thorough before going through mining. Is it going to be profitable despite the electricity cost in their country or not? #3, I am pretty sure this applies even outside crypto. In short, just do not rely too much in crypto for your source of income. #6, they also have the option to engrave it in a metal plate though it would be preferable if they engrave it by themselves for obvious reasons. Nobody likes that \"$5 dollar wrench attack\".",

Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM3. Make sure you have an emergency savings account for fiat currency in case any emergency demands arise before investing in bitcoin by conducting some basic research.I believe this is one of the reason most people can't HOLD when it comes to crypto investment, most of them don't always have back up funds, they always use all their funds to purchase coins. Which at the end whenever their is emergency, they always end up selling their coins gradually just to solve problems even if they are at lost, i believe we should always have emergency funds. Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM4. When you first start investing in bitcoin, do not anticipate becoming wealthy within one to two months. Rather, you should wait one to two years before you even think of taking profit from it. Newbies always have wrong perspective before joining the crypto space, most of them have been brainwashed buy lot's of people, they always hear positive things about bitcoin so they believe bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, they believe immediately they start bitcoin they are already rich which is wrong, that's why whenever most of them see ponzi scheme they always jumping into it which at the end they will lose money and they will endup blaming bitcoin for their lost. Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM5. Purchase Bitcoin and withdraw it to a personal wallet so that you may genuinely own it; never keep it on an exchange or web wallet. This is because exchanges are vulnerable to hacking and are not secure.Since buying and selling of coins take place on exchange, most people will just buy coin on exchange and they will ignore it their because it's easy accessible their, but we have to think about the effect, exchange can be easily hacked, we have seen lot's of exchanges that have been hacked in history or crypto which lot's of people lost their money their, I think the best thing is after purchasing your coin from exchange, then you should move it to your wallet which we are in control of the private key, because not your key not your money, if you are not in control of your money then it those not belong to you completely because you can lose it at any moment. Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM6. Pay close attention to backing up your wallet (the software that contains the key to your Bitcoins) and, preferably, keeping it offline in a secure area. Typically, you write phrases words, on metals, on a piece of paper and hide it in private places likey two places.Your private key should be secured properly, if anybody have access to your wallet private key, then all your funds are gone already, the user can easily import the private key on his mobile device and will send all your coins out without you knowing, so your private key should be properly secured. I think it's better you carve your private key on a metal plate than a paper, because paper can be washed away and incase if their is fire incidence, the paper can be easily burnt, but if you get a multiple metal steal and carve your private key on the metal plates and hide them in different places incase if you lose one their will always be a backup. Also everyone should avoid securing private key on application, your private key should be secure in a place that their is not access to internet service to avoid being hacked. Quote from: SOKO-DEKE on October 03, 2022, 07:59:55 AM7. Due to the fact that these tokens are scams, beginners should stay away from altcoins, tokens, and ICOs, at least initially until they understand more about Bitcoin basics. I don't always advise beginners to participate in ICO or IEO, I dont advise then to invest in new projects, if you don't want to invest in bitcoin, then I always advise then to invest in coins that have been long in crypto market.",

I guess that’s mostly how we learned in crypto, making mistakes and losses at first and only by then we acquire learning. Only few of us here started with more knowledge and experience which end up less mistakes and losses. However, what matters the most is we never resort into quitting just because of few losses, instead we strive hard and work hard to be more successful and profitable in the future. Also, it’s an advantage if we can find good mentors around, but based on my experience, it’s okay not to find one too so we will learn on our own and become more independent in crypto.",
