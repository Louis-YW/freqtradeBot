Thanks to the Philippine government you're now forced to quit a very bad practice. If you're feeling panicky now that you're finally leaving Binance, you should have felt more panicky before when you're keeping your funds there. Do you trade all those \"hoard of bitcoin\" that you're storing in Binance? If not, don't consider another centralized exchange. Surely, you must have already heard of hardware wallets and Electrum and BlueWallet and so on. If you trade but only a small portion of your funds, then keep only your trading funds in an exchange and the rest in a self-custodial wallet.",

You should probably ask this on your local board if you want to compare how the members here feel about your friends' recommendations. On the other hand, why won't you just give us names instead? I don't see the point of waiting whether people will recommend you the same service or not if you want to check reviews, to begin with.",

Hardware wallets are a strong consideration to me too but I like the convenience of being stored in exchanges so I can quickly sell off parts of my investments.",

If that's the case, I am sure Binance might temporarily halt service in your country and will eventually resume after obtaining proper license. But why are you holding your bitcoin in an exchange? You are risking yourself of losing all your funds. I know you said you don't care, but if the amount is large enough, you will start caring when you won't be able to access your funds. Now is the perfect time to move your funds from an exchange to a \"self custodial wallet\". Now do your research on those kinds of wallet and chose the one that you think is the best.",

Binance is a custodial third person platforms and it's not recommended in the first place, what I will advice you is to move your coins off the exchange regardless of whether they will operate in your country or not. Keep you funds off the exchange to be safe from any threat to your investment in bitcoin.I will recommend you withdraw your bitcoin to external wallet like electrum wallet. The wallet is light and safe software wallet or better use a hardware wallet like ledger. But if you want an exchange, I think Okex is a good choice to buy and sell but not recommended for keeping your coins, you can use Kucoin as well but they don't have liquidity as big as Okex but still, not a recommend place to store your bitcoin.",

On Kucoin and Bybit, we can speculate that both of them have a chance to be the next biggest exchange in the cryptospace, however, MEXC be careful, I reckon. I do not have any proof that they selectively scam people but I would not trust this exchange over Kucoin and Bybit.",

Words are cheap. I understand if one is keeping a little amount in an exchange for easy and quick trade whenever necessary, but if you're keeping everything there and you say you don't care, I highly doubt it. Unless it's an amount that's too small that you won't be losing a second of sleep if it's lost, you sure care about losing your precious and hard-earned Bitcoin.But if the intention is to be able to \"quickly sell off parts of my investments\", why keep everything on an exchange? Keep that part you intend to quickly sell if the price target is hit and keep the rest in a non-custodial open-source wallet. You don't have to buy a hardware wallet if you don't like it. You actually don't have to spend to safekeep your money.",
