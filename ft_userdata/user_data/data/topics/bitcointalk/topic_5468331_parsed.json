And today the results of the first public test of the new connector appeared online. It was conducted by the authors of the YouTube channel HardwareBusters. Specialists visited the Linewell laboratory, which produces power cables for many well-known video card manufacturers. There they ran a series of tests on the connector and connectors, attempting to simulate the most common scenarios that would cause a 12VHPWR to melt.First, experts tested the connector in normal operation, applying 660 W of power to it. And after 50 minutes of stress testing, the 12V-2x6 only reached 46.5°C. Then the specialists began trying to melt the connector using incorrectly connected connectors and strong bending of the cable. But even in this mode, the 12V-2x6 was able to easily maintain a power of 640 W, heating up only to 42 °C.https://t.me/HomishTG/6219",

I wonder if this means a bull run for gpu mining will happen soon.",

      "body": "The biggest issue I had with power connectors was always with the modular PSUs and the +12V would typically melt. Usually the GND was always fine but the +12V had a tendency to easily melt.No idea why. Maybe because I plugged and unplugged too many times and it widened the female connection or maybe the pins were sitting at an angle instead of being flush and straight. No idea. Rarely did I have issues on the other end where it connects to the GPU. So it wasn’t like this faulty connector mentioned in this article.",

And I have never liked hot video cards, because with more power there are always more problems when mining.",

However you know how it is, until you get a mass distribution you can never tell if something is reliable or not. Take cars for example. Manufacteurs put in billions of dollars of R&D and they end up having to recall many vehicles leading to billions of dollars in losses, obviously they wanted to avoid this but they couldn't because you cant really get a real world exposure during their R&D testing phases.The same happened with all these GPUs and power connectors overheating. It was up to code but it was failing anyways for other reasons. Poor contacts or poor conductivity materials could be one of them.",

But in my opinion, the new connector should have been tested better, because it is not such a complex product as a car",
