You'll notice if you try to quote theymos' post from 2014 explaining how the Legendary activity requirement is calculated, you'll meet the same error, triggered by the concat function. Remove/rename this function and it will let you post the code quite happily.Quote from: OgNasty on June 18, 2022, 06:15:48 PMWhat makes you think it's cloudflare blocking this?Try it yourself. You will be hit with a CloudFlare \"Sorry, you have been blocked\" page. You don't even need to try to make the post; hitting \"preview\" will do the same thing.",

It's weird, because any text that's written to a post is recognized as text from the forum software, and so should from Cloudflare. I don't think the problem has to do with \"attack with back-end execution\". It's rather just a bug. How do I know? Try previewing this post which includes the php format intro and runs normally, and now try previewing this post, which is the same plus the next sentence; it will fail.",

Why did I had to listen to you! This looks like a similar problem reported by mocacinno back in 2017, when he tried to write \"cmd.exe\" in the post, but cloudflare did not allow it.theymos later changed the settings on cloudflare, so maybe he can do it in this case as well.",
