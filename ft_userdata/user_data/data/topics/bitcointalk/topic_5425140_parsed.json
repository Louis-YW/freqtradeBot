      "body": "So Coinbase commerce allows you to backup your seed phrase in google drive, but not to restore it from there?You can try their wallet and see if that works for you:1. Download Coinbase wallet: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.toshi&hl=en&gl=US2. Open it.3. Select \"I already have a wallet\" -> \"Restore from Google drive\". The app will then ask you to choose the google account  you want to connect to.4. Type your password.",

      "body": "Confused. If you are using coinbase commerce you have 2 options for your wallet. Self managed and coinbase hosted.If you are using self hosted, then there should be no 2fa authentication since it's your wallet.If it's coinbase hosted then they should be able to verify who you are recover it since you had to go through a compliance review and such sine they are holding your funds.-Dave",

      "body": "I'm assuming it's self managed judging from your situation. I did make a test account to be sure and was asked to setup a 2fa. It's kinda weird that there seems to be no way to decrypt the cloud backup unless you're logged in to your account. This is the only way I found, see: https://youtu.be/XhGIMGqyUlII suggest informing the customer support about this and see what they can do for you since coinbase commerce hold the decryption key.Quote from: https://help.coinbase.com/en/commerce/privacy-and-security/seed-phrasesThis means that Coinbase Commerce can’t access your funds (because we don’t have access to your Google account) and neither Google nor someone who has gained unauthorized access to your Google account can access your funds (because Coinbase Commerce holds the decryption key).Here's a bit of hope for you op: I found a thread with a similar situation and they were able to recover the account after talking it out with the support.Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/k2dzt9/i_am_a_merchant_using_coinbase_commerce_i_got_a/Redditor: Did you ended up getting your seed phrase back? I'm basically in the same situation as you, got my seed encrypted on google but dont know how to access it.OP: Yes I have full access. They were able to allow me to bypass it this one time as a courtesy and I was able to get in and reset everything on my account it took about three weeks in total in about four or five exchanges in emails",
