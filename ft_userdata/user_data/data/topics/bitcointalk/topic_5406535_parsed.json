Therefore we always know which transactions are valid without having to run post-checks by our nodes. After the valid transaction has been started, before the users accepts it, we give the receiver the possibility to go through the block explorer that lines up the history of the tokens he just received. We provide the basic layer of security on our Private Chain technology for the end users (against forking, double spending, hashing collisions, ...), the only thing they have to do a final check to make sure the transaction looks \"normal\" and then accept, in other words there's no need for computing power of our end users in order to use our chain.",

      "body": "Imagine…Imagine a technology that warns you every time your transacted legal document has been sent back to you in an altered form, without you knowing it.Think of an ever-vigilant entity, able to be installed on top of every existing antivirus program, making sure that the file you download has not been tampered with.Visualize a strategic partner that is there for you, every time you need to discern whether you have received a genuine email from a trusted source (be it a company's CEO or your bank's prompt to update your login credentials) or from a fraudulent / scamming group of imposters.Picture a trusted friend consistently running to your aid when your Healthcare establishment, Logistics company, Finance institution, Voting platform or Supply Chain enterprise needs to safely transact your customers' private information without exposing it to the network.And envision an innovative ecosystem where you have total control over your transacted cryptocurrency assets, even when you have mistakenly sent them to a wrong address, due to a single character mistype. Cryptocurrency transaction cancellations and/or reclaiming have never been possible before - until now.Welcome to AnuuTech Ltd.AnuuTech is a blockchain company built from the ground up with an entirely modular concept in mind, and bringing a unique, innovative way in how transacted data is validated and protected.Our modular technology consists of 4 building blocks, each having its own individual documentation, available on our website (https://www.anuutech.com/). These 4 building blocks act synergistic to guarantee that any type of data transacted through our ecosystem, cannot be modified or corrupted during transfer, intentionally or otherwise, without being detected.These four building blocks are• Proof of Hash, our consensus algorithm which is well developed and for which a fully working prototype has already been created.• AnuuTech Network, a new multilayered, totally secure and scalable network solution, providing faster connections, functional groups and a modular solution for blockchain technologies.• AnuuTech ID, an advanced form of identification and access pass on the AnuuTech Network• Private Chains, offering our users the ability to create their own chain, one that will contain only data and transactions relevant to their addresses.Our proof of concept (the Proof of Hash technology) is already created.We invite you to a ZOOM call so we can demonstrate it to you live. Just drop us a mail at contact@anuutech.com and our team of professionals will be quick to respond back.You can think of Proof of Hash as an extension of every possible program, website or application, an integrated code weaved into third-party systems if you prefer, which function as the ultimate layer of protection individuals or companies will ever need to safely transact their data.Modularity is the core value behind our technology. This means that it offers for virtually any type of data to be transacted through our network, totally safe from modification (intentionally or otherwise). And if modification of the transacted data does occur, Proof of Hash will be there to always detect it and warn you before you take any further action.Data can vary between, but not limited to:• a legal document (Real Estate deed, notary or lawyer contract, a private patient's database from a Healthcare establishment or their personal medical examination results, an employment hiring contract, an Education Institution database etc)• an NFT (even if your wallet gets hacked, you will be able to prove the ownership of your token). In comparison, buying an NFT is like buying a car without papers. PoH enables companies to create documents of ownership that are sent whenever the NFT is sold or transferred, making it much less appealing for hackers to steal NFTs.• a music's / video's / image's metadata• emails (we allow software companies to integrate PoH into their build that confirms the integrity of emails and their senders)When other companies use our technology, we have a business plan that will provide our investors and our company with income.
