It's a year I would never forget coz my life would have changed drastically if Covid 19 hadn't messed things up.Fast forward to 2023, I have been able to accumulate some few BTC from my monthly pay check and the news of Bitcoin spot ETF approval arosed my hope again that BTC might kickstart the mini bullrun before the halving but the reverse was the case as BTC fails to hit the $50k mark.While reading some crypto news earlier today, I came across a survey conducted by Bitget towards the end of last year in several region of the world where crypto investors share their anticipation and investment plan in crypto ahead of 2024 pre and post BTC halving and seeing 84% of the people saying BTC will cross the previous $69k ATH while also confirming they are increasing their investment ahead of the pre-halving makes me feel 2024 might be another good year for me.Although some expert suggested that people should be careful as BTC might trade around $30k - $60k within this period which makes it even a more dicey situation but overall, I think the post halving might bring the good news everyone has been anticipating.What are your thoughts, do you think this survey reflect the true percentage of what to expect or not?",

      "body": "I don't care about the prices reflected by the analysts in the first place. Secondly if it is about investing then every dip is a buying opportunity. By accepting the Bitcoin ETF, this should be a sign that Bitcoin is still able to grow, especially in the price of Bitcoin. This has become a reflection of Bitcoin's long-term fundamentals, plus the deterioration of the dollar or fiat currency in each country as well as public perception of inflation in each country.If you intend to invest then make sure you buy and buy when the Bitcoin price drops and save. Sell when you feel like you have enough. If you worry and focus too much on someone's analysis, I'm sure you won't be optimal in investing or will even suffer losses due to being swayed by rumors and slanted news.",

I'm bullish for Bitcoin and I'm expecting many things about Bitcoin because even if there is not a catalyst this period, ETF investors wouldn't let it down because they are have struggled with SEC and has bring it, they wouldn't want to be ridicule of their investment, same goes with Microstrategy that has bought a lot of Bitcoin since it went lows.QuoteAlthough some expert suggested that people should be careful as BTC might trade around $30k - $60k within this period which makes it even a more dicey situation but overall, I think the post halving might bring the good news everyone has been anticipating.What are your thoughts, do you think this survey reflect the true percentage of what to expect or not? How can we be sure of this survey is not a cook values to speculate the public. I think we might go higher than these prices but then again, it's not something that can be achieved in a day or a year, it can be even 2026 before we will see these price that I expect to see bitcoin and I just hope when bitcoin start moving, we don't see bad news like we had some months back of FTX collapse and also Celsius bankruptcy.",

But one thing is certain, bitcoin will eventually reach its new all time high after seeing price dips or price correction in the market. However, instead of getting bothered if ever bitcoin price will drop drastically, then let’s just see it as another opportunity to buy and hold. If we can’t maximize our profits this coming bull run after its halving, then at least we can start preparing for the next bull run ahead by continuous DCA and hodling.",

It's a year I would never forget coz my life would have changed drastically if Covid 19 hadn't messed things up.I believe the COVID-19 issue back in the years 2019 affected everyone both that people that are not into crypto but old things passed as they say and the current situation is what you should focus on because the upcoming BTC halving will be totally different from what we have experienced in the market.Which mean you can still change your life but everything depend on the decision you make now that market is still in the correction stage. Therefore, don't let the old decision beat you down to the extent that you make the right decision.Quote from: TheVeteranAngel on February 03, 2024, 05:39:52 PMFast forward to 2023, I have been able to accumulate some few BTC from my monthly pay check and the news of Bitcoin spot ETF approval arosed my hope again that BTC might kickstart the mini bullrun before the halving but the reverse was the case as BTC fails to hit the $50k mark.You shouldn't be surprised that reverse was case of BTC price after the spot ETF was approved because most of this investment companies don't join early and they will want to manipulate the market to gain some point and also increase their bag.Continue with your monthly DCA and seized the market downtrend opportunity before they start to pump the market after they  (BlackRock, Fidelity, etc) had enough profit out of the market downtrend Quote from: TheVeteranAngel on February 03, 2024, 05:39:52 PMWhile reading some crypto news earlier today, I came across a survey conducted by Bitget towards the end of last year in several region of the world where crypto investors share their anticipation and investment plan in crypto ahead of 2024 pre and post BTC halving and seeing 84% of the people saying BTC will cross the previous $69k ATH while also confirming they are increasing their investment ahead of the pre-halving makes me feel 2024 might be another good year for me. People always make their own predictions based on what they believe and the volatility of the market will choose another trend but what you need to know is that no matter the downtrend after the halving happens, the market always reaches a new ATH price.All the current downtrends are just an opportunity to accumulate at a low price before the bull run.",

It's a year I would never forget coz my life would have changed drastically if Covid 19 hadn't messed things up.Unfortunately you're one of two types of people who don't make money after buying bitcoin, which is pretty hard to do. The first type are speculators who try to leverage it, go against the trend and are forced to hold money on exchanges to do it. The second type are people who can't afford it, and here's where you fit in. You couldn't afford to invest, but you did it and later had to sell because you had no money saved up. QuoteAlthough some expert suggested that people should be careful as BTC might trade around $30k - $60k within this period which makes it even a more dicey situation but overall, I think the post halving might bring the good news everyone has been anticipating.Here's again what I said earlier. If you know it's going to go up sooner or later, but can bounce between 30k and 60k, why wouldn't you buy and hold? That's right, you can't afford a drop to 30k because you have no money to live on. Your plan is to spend all your savings on bitcoin and itf it breaks the ATH by the end of the year you'll sell for profit and if it goes down to 30k you'll sell at a loss. That's a really bad plan if you ask me.",

On the other hand market will start to move in the upper position i think it will break its last all-time high after this halving event and will make it a new all-time high after the halving event.

I think that we need to exchange as many dollars as we can for it, I think we should trade things for it, I think that we should sell our goods and services and accept bitcoin because at the end of the day if you're using it and getting paid in it then you have more flexiibility with the currency.",

I believe that Bitcoin will rise again after halving because people have an expectation of a bull run after halving, I have been in crypto since 2016 and that's how it always goes. Personally, I think that it's never too late to buy Bitcoin if it hasn't reached its ATH. Bitcoin is a coin that always surpasses its all-time high. Bitcoin ETF approval doesn't have an impact right now but keep in mind that Bitcoin halving doesn't have an impact on Bitcoin's price immediately, it happens slowly and starts to rise in winter. I think that Bitcoin ETF and the upcoming halving will play a significant role in reaching a new all-time high that will be higher than 100K USD, we will probably reach 200K USD.",

Well, in my opinion, I think a lot of people have a bullish sentiment post-halving. However, I believe we'll see a shakeout pre-halving. The reason is that institutions would be willing to buy low and ride it to the top of the bull run. In any case, let's be smart and play the game with them. May I see the link to this survey?",

The price doesn’t beats the all time high the year of halving but it rather gets close to it. The reason why many people actually think bitcoin will beat that past trend this time around is because of ETF approval and which everyone thinks will skyrocket the bitcoin price. We cannot say the hype around it wouldn’t have impact on bitcoin but the trend will still follow its path no matter the ETF hype and this past dump after the ETF approval has just proved that to be true. What my advice continuously is never place hopes one bitcoin price pumping soon, do not place a time duration to take profits rather out a price target for profit taken. When bitcoin reaches the your price target you take partials to be on a safer side",
