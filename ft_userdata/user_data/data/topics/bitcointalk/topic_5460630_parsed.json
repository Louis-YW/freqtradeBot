I can not recall the people that their Twitter account are hacked in a way they the account will be used for malicious reasosn and people will be scammed. This type of hack is very common with those NFTs in a way that fake NFTs are sold. People should try to know when a Twitter account has been hacked. It is good to deal with a platform directly instead of relying on social media. But those sites can be hacked too, keep that in mind.",

It's hard when a popular personality account is hacked because his followers listened to these popular personalities and they are likely to lose their funds, so be sure you are familiar with the posts of these personalities if suddenly they post something unusual like promoting a new and dubious project so your won research if the account is still good.It's not okay to put your 100% trust in personalities, many investors lose money from trusting too much, Here in Cryptocurrency investing, DYOR is very important every investor should know and apply this concept.",

I guess his twitter account will be going back to him once he makes appeal to the twitter foundation. This is not something new but i kinda feel how easy hacker to take over twitter's account that owned by others. It seems like that hacker become even smarter these days. I knew mostly these hackers were coming from the phishing email that being sent to the victim's address.",

The title already described the complete identity of the hacked twitter account. It’s impossible to not know uniswap unless you are not trading altcoins which is ironic because you are posting here on altcoin discussion.

It’s impossible for Hayden Adams to be a victim of phishin since he is well known on coding as he developed the first successful defi DEX. Probably his account got brute force while his account security is weak.",

Then this kind of scenario is not new, either centralized or Dex, that's still number one, the unfortunate thing is that the users are the victims.Anyway, maybe uniswap won't let its users lose their trust in them, maybe they just need to triple the caution of hackers like this so that uniswap doesn't lose patronizers.",

This is why SMS 2fa should never be used. Especially when the site had a leak with the phone number of the account owner.",

So I don't think he has securely protected his own account, in the first place.That's why it's surprising that he should be aware of this since he has started a project that's known to many knowing that it's got a better security. Well, it differs from people to people and I think that he's got on this one and likely very confident not knowing that he's already targeted.

That is why Youtube live cryptocurrency scams are populous, and in some degree scammers try to deceive their target by interacting with user who have a high user base. So in that sense, those who have influences have a high and diverse security risk. What is essential is to apply basic digital security recommendations, for each people no matter whether they got a high likelihood of being targeted or not. That is because SMS 2FA is truly ineffective.",
