The greater cryptocurrency community is not much better because they fall for scams (they are dumb), and they worship stupid people because they themselves are stupid.The Bitcoin community cannot stand any criticism because they are in a cult, and how dare I criticize Bitcoin. I will criticize Bitcoin when it needs to be criticized.

The few crazy people who go around here telling outlandish lies and leaving negative feedback for attention really are a small segment of the community. Using the ignore button when you come across them can save you a lot of heartache and you’ll be able to enjoy the mostly nice folks here.",

However, I usually don't categorize people in such a way. Who are Bitcoiners really? Drawing such conclusions from a few sentences exchanged online, like here, seems unjust and unwise. People have diverse opinions, and it is true that some can be rather passionate about their views. I get that vibe a lot. But aren't we all guilty of similar behavior? In fact, if we take a step back and reflect, we may find that we all, at times, display passionate or strong-willed behavior about topics we deeply care about. Would you not agree?",

You are a shithead. You have spiders in your pituitary gland, and you have mushrooms in your bladder.Ok those insults made me laugh out loud. I'll give you few tips for social communication anxiety though:1. Try to see good in everyone.2. Let your starting point for listening to be humble. 3. Instead of seeing people as stupid or evil enemies, first assume that they have good intentions and pure motives. That they want to be constructive, but sometimes they just need a little help with it.5. Do not presume, ask. and listen when they explain to understand their point of view. Even when it's hard to do. It's a good practice for empathy.I see you as a smart guy who is just having hard time. Try to recognize your feelings and accept them. You are angry, yes, and you think it's because of others. You can try to change others, but i am guessing you are starting to see it won't go as you planned. So maybe you need to find another solution. Maybe there are more feelings inside after you accept them as part of you. And the fact they are not coming from outside. Good luck with that social communication and have a great day.",

UH BUH BUH BUH. UH BUH BUH BUH. UH BUH BUH BUH. That is anti-intellectual.But he is doing exactly the same to almost everybody that disagree with him, that means that he is anti-intellectual according to his own logic?His whole argument is the next: anyone who agree with me is Intellectual and everybody else is:Quote from: jvanname on October 05, 2023, 05:42:42 PMfuckersQuote from: jvanname on October 04, 2023, 08:23:17 PMpile of trash.Quote from: jvanname on October 03, 2023, 09:44:33 PMshitfacesQuote from: jvanname on October 03, 2023, 07:39:11 PMfuckfaces.And many other derogatory adjectives. When OP joining to the forum he publish some kind of academic work here about some new kind of POW that can help science?But it seems that nobody here takes him seriously, he needs to understand that this is a internet forum not a board of academic reviews.He actually said why its own RCO-POW algorithm is weak:Quote from: jvanname on July 19, 2017, 02:00:10 PMOne disadvantage of RCO-POW problems is that these problems will not be ASIC resistant since reversible computing devices will be in a sense certain kinds of ASICs.So basically who wants to have a coin that is vulnerable to some kind of attack?His so named shitcoin have some structural issues :https://github.com/jvanname/circcashQuoteNo subsidy halvingSupply increases linearly (to better advance science)Mining reward remains constant12.5% of newly mined coins will be sent to a development fund. The development fund will be cut off after the following two conditions are BOTH met:No halving means limitless supply, that sounds like fiat money or just another shittoken. Also 12.5% of each block will go to his development fund. What a surprise… But according to him this is in favor of science… His latest argument is: Bitcoin is the ultimate shitcoin for having a useless mining algorithm.But the mining algorithm of bitcoin perfectly solves the double-spending problem. Anyway i am not here to convince an empty head that doesn't want to listen anythingAll those controversial posts are only made to try to promote his shitcoin but lately he was really angry against anyone who disagreed with him.Summarizing he is a troll, don’t engage with him.Regards.",
