So never join or trust this kind of Scammers.Scammer Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3480193Scammer Post Archive: https://archive.ph/KUCJWFake Airdrop Link: https://awsous.com/event/NTc2NzQ0NDMyNl9naXZlYXdheQ==Fake Airdrop Archive: https://archive.ph/sQS0HThis guy is also posting this scam in many boards in this forum. So my opinion is that this is a pure scam or a trap by a scammer. Because they are offering 2× return which is surely a trap. That website saying if you have 2eth that will return you another 2 eth. So don't believe this kind of scams in anywhere in crypto world.So never fall into this kinds of traps. They are asking to connect your metamask or Wallet connect so that they can easily steal your hard earned crypto assets.Many newcomers fall into this kinds of scams because thay aren't aware and trust without any research.",

It would really be interesting to conduct a social experiment where someone approaches random strangers on the street and proposes to them a similar scheme like, give me $100 and I will double your money in no time. You wouldn't find many people interested in the deal unless they are certain they can overpower the person physically if it had to come to that. I wonder why people drop their guards and can't use common sense online?!",

My friend is one of those lucky airdrop participants and earned $10,000 (ignored the airdropped tokens for years and she later found out in her old phone that its value had a massive increase) in a single airdrop. Many beginners started into crypto because they are empowered by these airdrop stories. And without any friends to guide them properly, they will be scammed soon if they cannot catch up with what is necessary to learn and avoid here in crypto.    To make it safer for beginners. Stay away from airdrops unless they learn the precautions.",

Maybe best to scan carefully all things what we see especially if a platform is offering free tokens to avoid losing all our hard earned valuable coin in a blink of an eye.",

It can't be said a project is been promoted, in which one still have to do research about the project visiting their official sites and Social Media handle or track them on portfolio trackers to see how genuine the claimed airdrop is. A reliable airdrop promotes a project not just a random distribution of funds. Just like the very first introduced in 2014 that promoted Auroracoin. This is one of the cheapest scam I have ever encountered.",
