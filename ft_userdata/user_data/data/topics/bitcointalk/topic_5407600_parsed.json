  "content": "Hi there, i am the owner of 8bethub.comWe started off on the wrong foot, as our gambling platform was put through some tough criticism which most was accepted, and worked upon. I would like to take this opportunity to address our negative trust feedback and try show you guys how we have sorted it out, and that we are not a scammy casino at all. I will start in order, with @RHavar 's feedback: \"Running a pirated casino, which makes it impossible to trust (e.g. in their announcement claims \"We use a sophisticated coin selection algorithm tailored to 8bethub\" which is just some text they copied from bustadice without going through the effort of making their own coin selection etc. etc. \"I understood his point and agreed to him being upset about it, however, what we meant in the description of our website, although sounded similar, had a different meaning as we work differently to bustadice, and offer more coins to play with, hence why the words being used, I understand they meant something different, but so did we. We are not a scammy pirated casino at all, and we have had a dozen of people come from here and trust us with deposits, from which we gave withdrawals too.To fix this, we have eliminated the similar homepage from 8bethub and now we are fully working based on the play page only, whilst we create our very own design.Secondly, @devans ' comment: \"In addition to obviously plagiarizing large parts of bustadice.com, 8bethub is also using bustadice's code without its permission. \"This links to the above, as the part we got inspired from them was totally removed, all text that was any similar, also removed. The codes he is referring to were the scripts on github, also removed and we are working hard to make our own scripts. However, the backend to our site is fully ours, completely different, as you know how hard it is to copy a website's code entirely.To fix this, we have removed all similarity in the mentioned parts above.Lastly, @TwitchySeal said \"Using someone else's work without their permission. Red flag. \" which I hope we have covered by now and you may please check, here 8bethub.com as I am happy to work and change anything else you may have an issue with.I sincerely apologise to have started like this, and would like to say I am myself an ex player of both bustabit and bustadice and I admire both platforms, to be seen by them, even in this negative manner was a wow moment for me, I am trying to prove that we deserve a second chance, and all feedback was as you can see taken in and worked upon.I would like for those things to potentially be understood and the negative ratings removed so that we may continue here, starting fresh.",

There is no software needed, I hired an experience website developer with vast experience in blockchain coding as he created other crash and dice casinos before mine. I can of course prove this, I paid him quite well for the job. The website is authentic and fully ours. Yet no, as this was me purely apologising, we did not steal, copy or take anything, those people i mentioned are unhappy with the fact that we had similarities. I brought this here as a gesture of goodwill, and removed everything they had said, not because I scammed anyone, or copied, i simply listened to them and wanted to make everyone happy!",

You cannot think that as the negative comments were all taken off, there is very little to nothing left of the homepage, which was the page they had problems with. We operate only on the play page! I have proof to back everything i said, all changes, all transactions, proof of deposits even etc.Quote from: yahoo62278 on July 25, 2022, 10:20:08 PMIf you had all this money to pay a developer and players and whatever else, why not just spend a little more and buy the license from bustadice/bustabit owner? You would have saved yourself a lot of headache by doing so.It is not about all this money buddy, there is no need to buy a license from bustabit, as we are not a crash website. Why buy it from bustadice since we copied nothing either, or are they the dice-casino license owners? Did they patent it? You are right, if i did pay them i would save a lot of headache, but apart from the github scripts (aka the martingale code for example, that is online available to use) nothing was used from their code",

It could have saved you a lot of trouble. However, it is not too late.Precisely my point, I get it, because we got inspired by some very little design aspects, i admired their work, nothing was copied 100%, not even half. But fair, I have taken all of that down, now the website has 0 plagiarism, I also understand I should have had nothing from the start, but in my opinion it did not! In their, they thought it did and out of respect I took it down, and publicly apologised.The casino is totally legitimate, there is deposits, withdrawals, from IP addresses around the world, I would really not be able to fake this, I have all of this as proof. Not a single withdrawal issue or deposit being missing. Sure! the backend is totally fully ours. Again, I should have not even used anything similar, or the github similarity, it is all done, it was a mistake that will not happen again. I listen to every feedback, nothing was stolen, copied or faked or anything else. Their permission should have been asked for from the start even for the little elements we got inspired from, which I am at fault and coming here transparent to say. Also. what does this honest review campaign consist of if you dont mind expanding a bit, I would like to know.",

It's crazy how some DT just give out neg tag at any slice chance, and if Bustadice has no problem with other start-up casinos using some of their content, I don't see why some random internet users who aren't related to Bustadice would take matters into their own hands. The site has yet to defraud anyone, and no withdrawal issues have been reported.The red is excessive; he admitted his mistakes and made amends; I hope the DT reconsiders and gives him another chance.

I did email the bustadice mail, maybe that is why. Yeah, thank you for that, it is what I am trying to do, to improve the casino so that I can offer the best services, hopefully with that, trust and a new chance will come too.",

It's crazy how some DT just give out neg tag at any slice chance, and if Bustadice has no problem with other start-up casinos using some of their content, I don't see why some random internet users who aren't related to Bustadice would take matters into their own hands. The site has yet to defraud anyone, and no withdrawal issues have been reported.I disagree. Don't you think it's fair to warn the community if you, for example, find a project with a plagiarized whitepaper or fake team members, or a casino with a plagiarized content and an unlicensed script? Quote from: igehhh on July 26, 2022, 08:07:47 PMThe red is excessive; he admitted his mistakes and made amends; I hope the DT reconsiders and gives him another chance. Everyone is deserving of it. Cheers! It's a matter of opinion. You are free to exclude the mentioned DT members from your trust list if you don't agree with their opinion.Quote from: igehhh on July 26, 2022, 08:07:47 PM@devans what do you think? ( Bustadice admin)I suggest you read the OP's post again, and also the trust feedback left on his profile.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=3486549 devans    2022-06-27    Reference    In addition to obviously plagiarizing large parts of bustadice.com, 8bethub is also using bustadice's code without its permission.I know that plagiarism, even little, or even if chanced or removed, it is in the end still plagiarism. But what I am trying to get across is that the only parts that were in this discussione were some text elements on the homepage, that were simply close in meaning, not exactly the same at all. I meant something totally different too, which I did explain, however, I did remove that in order to try show that I will improve the platform. And about the code, nothing was plagiarised from bustadice's code at all, the gitbhub repos should have never been used either, and I did makje sure to get this point across to my team by removing the person who thought it would have been a good idea. That is why I am taking this here, as althought his post was valid, there was some sort of misunderstanding too, and I cleared that, improved on that too I hope.",
