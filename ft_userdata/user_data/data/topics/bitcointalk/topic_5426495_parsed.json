You need to carefully study the project and evaluate all the risks, and there are a lot of risks here. I prefer to invest in well-known projects, the price of which has fallen by 80-90% from ATH.",

I am not a crypto newbieFTX is not a decentralised entity and that says it all, if you read my question very well I stated that how risky are Decentralised Finance projects, FTX is a crypto exchange running as a fully centralised platform.",

I think 70% is manageable but if it goes more than 100% and up to a thousand, those are unbelievable APYs. Another thing, the platform itself isn't known yet.",
