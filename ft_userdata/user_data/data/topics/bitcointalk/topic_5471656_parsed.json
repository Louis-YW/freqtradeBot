And the judges being very indignant about putting him behind bars despite his \"altruistic actions\" like providing money for charity lol).",

Maybe some are really disappointed on how justice system works but we still need to trust them how they gonna role this case out and for sure they also want this guy to be in jailed because the amount affected to all users globally is so huge and authorities want to serve justice to them.The case still rolling so we shouldn't get angry to the personnel working on this case and the only thing we can do for now is to follow the case then hopefully people will find a justice to those scamming incidents made by SBF to them.",

The world has never been fair, especially when it comes to centralized systems and leaders. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if SBF got away with it or received a lighter prison sentence. But I want to ask, we always want freedom, always oppose the government for our right to privacy, but why are we now being scammed by the SBF and need the government? If we want to be free, free from management and control, we need to protect ourselves and that is the price of freedom.",

His parents are also somewhat known in the legal industry. As far as the justice system goes, this guy is kind of untouchable, unless those involved in the proceedings of his case grow a backbone and try to prosecute him and send him behind bars for a long time. He's very clever with making those donations and setting up those social events while he had the chance to. He gained a number of allies that helps him with this case. They'll just prolong this case until no noise can be heard anymore, and he may not be acquitted - but he'll surely the lowest sentence possible for his case.",

At worst for him he'll serve a few years in prison. Or maybe there won't be any jail time at all. Every adult person should know that the law does not apply in its full force to the rich and the influential. It's the poor who can be imprisoned for years for stealing $100, but the rich always deserve a second chance and deserve pity because of their circumstances lol.",

The scam man must be punished at very expensive cost and even so he can not bring money back to all of his victims.

I am sure, so I agree with you, that SBF will get a softer sentence than any speculative, proposal sentence from community.I only wonder and also I am curious to wait for what sentence he will get after all. Especially he lives in the USA, that is a nation with good Separations of Power but I believe laws will be bend to serve SBF. He will get benefit from it with a soft sentence.",
