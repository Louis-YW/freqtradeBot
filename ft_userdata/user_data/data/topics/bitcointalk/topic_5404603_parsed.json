I think you are?It seems that you are using macOS and installed Electrum 4.1.5 would you mind trying to install the latest one which is 4.2.2 and test and maybe it is just a bug.If it didn't solve the issue like on the reply on the Github page try to enable the debug logging. You can find this feature under tools>preferences>general and then check the write logs to file and reopen the Electrum and make a test transaction again if the error show you can now close the Electrum and check the logs.Let's see if you can find the reason and issue under that logs you can share it here to help us identify the issue.",

I managed to find something not related to Electrum directly but a fork for it for an altcoin. https://githubhot.com/repo/qtumproject/qtum-electrum/issues/115The user experienced the same type of error and the fix was a simple settings change in something the software calls \"Safety Check Level\". Electrum obviously doesn't have anything like that, but it's interesting nonetheless that this error pops up after the alleged signing takes place and the the user is trying to broadcast the transaction.",

Therefore there's a high chance this error comes from a prior version of Electrum, that was later removed. Electrum developers get used to doing these changes.
