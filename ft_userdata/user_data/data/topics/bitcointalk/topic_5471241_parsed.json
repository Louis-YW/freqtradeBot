I have come to notice that there are so many people that have been ignored by others based on the kind of things they do or if they are not worthy of being trusted, and so on.Now, my question is, can someone who is ignored merit the same person that ignored him/her without knowing that he/she was ignored? And will the merits still go to the profile that ignored the merit receiver?Why I asked the question was because, some days ago, I was scrolling through some interesting discussions and I saw a profile that said unignore. It was like I ignored the profile without myself knowing, then I unignore the profile. (Because I don't want any profile to be on such a list on my profile).So I am asking this same question again: can someone who is ignored merit the same person that ignored him/her without knowing that he/she was ignored? And will the receiver revive the merits? Finally, if we get merited by someone, many people like to know who merited them (like me), so, for instance, I got merited from someone who I ignored. Will I still see the profile or not?",

Will I still see the profile or not?The obvious answer to that question is YES,  forum members actually put other members on ignore list without even noticing it and sometimes come to notice it when they actually come across such profile again when they are trying to read or surf the forum like said. Well, about receiving merits from the supposed users you  ignored, I think it very possible because the users wasn't the person that actually ignored you so technically it very possible for the ignored users to give you merit if your posts and thread are worth it.",
