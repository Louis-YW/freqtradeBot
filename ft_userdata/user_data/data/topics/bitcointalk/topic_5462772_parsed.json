  "content": "I just want to outline some features that destabilise people from embracing bitcoin, I know that bitcoin is a personal race and it's nice for someone not be distracted on what it dreaming for, and secondly should not allow friends to underrate it's determination upmost in bitcoin race, its a self decision to patterned with bitcoin investment. The following are what I notice that affects someone who wants to invest in bitcoin ■ procrastination ■ past failure ■ Discouragement ■ Distraction ■ comparison Procrastination This is one of the main things that seen causes problem for investment, during time of investment what that will make the plan not to accomplish or delay your plans is a procrastination, I seen a procrastination as a delaying action that makes people to lose their preferable opportunity for investment, its good when come up with idea and you make a good decisions which a procrastination can not course a setback Past failure This fact make investors lose interest to invest in bitcoin, but this should not make a lover of bitcoin not to continue it's investment from in bitcoin, to be a perfect champion in investment \" despite that I'm using bitcoin as key studies\" you have to ensure you cross the hurdles of past failure, because when you are looking at the future you don't to be poison your future with your previous or past experience, a risk takers are tantamount to lose or gain in any investment, in summary don't use your past failure to face the present, and an investor should not be short sighted person because you failed in the past doesn't mean you shall never give investment a second trial. Discouragement This is similar to procrastination and this is one of the factors that deprived people a successful investment especially in bitcoin due to the information they obtain about bitcoin. Most of the people in social media that is being known that invested in bitcoin did not take chances of Discouragement from people before they invested and become successful, it's clear that a champion will believe on its paths to make its dreams to come to reality. And note: for investment opportunities you don't need someone to encourage you before you invest either in bitcoin or any.DistractionDistraction is one of the most weapons that will get someone  distracted  during learning of bitcoin investment, as desperate person to learn bitcoin should know that Distraction can never be a barrier if you have a concrete determination of learning and investing in bitcoin,  you not allow a Distraction to take over your opportunity, and if you want to be successful in bitcoin you should be aware of Distraction. Comparison A comparison should not be allowed to discourage you not have the understanding of bitcoin investment before, one of the setback some people experience in bitcoin investment is comparison, learning is the key and we have to be patient to understand the notion of bitcoin This is my note down of features that destabilise people for investing in bitcoin",

And so they are discourage to invest and then just go on meme coins thinking it could be the way as well.So for me, there could be some factors what the OP has laid out. But in the end, we really have to understand how everything works. The best thing to do is just stay with bitcoin at least for one whole cycle before you complain or procastinate.",

Maybe you haven't because you're also new to this, just like me. The question is, how did you learn about these features? Did you figure them out from news or something else?",

      "body": "I can not agree more with your all points, because these are the some main points we all as newbies have to face, for example, one of my friends who wanted to invest in BTC is in procrastination. Why? because he is currently thinking about which time will be best to enter into the market, He has no past experience which might have held him back the only thing I am observing is he did not want to accept losses in crypto, he wants to make a 100% good entry means from a point where the price of Bitcoin will never go below instead always go up. We can all this scenario as, \"trying to time the market\" and belive me not a pro or 10 years experienced trader could time the market 100% and we all have to agree on that but we could increase the profit ratio by adopting some techniques for example, by doing DCA etc.",

From my daily learning and understanding, permit to say Bitcoin is not all just bed of roses, you do not expect every time to be in a win situation... You should prepare yourself for the loss and you don't expect to fail at al times. This is one reason bitcointalk.org can be of great importance to those who believes in the system, make enquiries, study on our own so we know when to buy and when to sell... This are basic tips we should abide.",

You can add dozens of more reasons like that.Speaking about Bitcoin, the biggest discouregement for potential investors is the fact that Bitcoin is a purely speculative asset with huge volatility. It's impossible to make a good approximation of what its value should be. It's impossible to predict where will it go, aside from the correlation between halvenings and bull markets. So people will continue to invest in stocks, real estate, commodities, because those can at least be attempted to be predicted.",

      "body": "[quote/] DO NOT POST SESC LINKS Very nice question 👍. One thing that mostly affect people going into Bitcoin oisthat they mostly see it as a get- rich quick system. Obviously the main goal of investing or mining is for profit making but many people believe that it's a actually a means where they can just get rich overnight without putting in much effort. This has cost a lot of people in a very bad way and they often discourage others from going into it cause it didn't work for themPeople have to be made to understand that they need to commit and pay the price to be successful. That's why platforms like this was created to help people gain enough knowledge about itBitcoin Forum is a large online community where members discuss about issues related to digital currencies . Every member has the free space to share their views on any topic they know about which is also useful to others on the forum.[/quote]",

I assumed your points were going to be the volatility of bitcoin or the fact that one has to be digitally lyterate to use bitcoin, or something along those lines. However the “features” you listed are not distinctive to bitcoin, these are common factors that are present in the human mind and discourage people from taking the bold step to start a business or an investment.",

      "body": "It all boils down from people having not enough knowledge on Bitcoin, that's what keeps many people stopping from buying Bitcoin. The uncertainty and fear that they've got for being lack of it makes them hesitant into buying it. Those factors that you've mentioned, I don't think that it has something to do with buying, it's more of a personal factor why we're feeling that. Well, maybe those really are what you've seen or what you've felt but it's on you and you know the reasons why you're feeling those things and keeps you away from buying bitcoin. Because if a person wants to buy, he'll buy and he has decided to do it before the major bull run comes. It's all about the little information that a person knows and how decided and strong willed he is in doing a purchase.",

Most people have lost the opportunity to get some profit from investing in Bitcoin because they are waiting for the price to get to an all-time low. They keep procrastination until it will become more expensive to buy. The problem is that even the fiat currency they are holding is losing value every day. I have also seen friends that refused to buy bitcoin because they lost money in some altcoin or scam crypto project. So they allow their past failure to determine their current decision. Due to this failure, they have decided never to invest in cryptocurrency again. Discouragement and distraction are caused by FUD. When people pay more attention to the media than credible information, they tend to lose focus and become discouraged because of FUD.",
