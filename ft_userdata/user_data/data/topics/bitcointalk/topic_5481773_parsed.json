PGP signature is used to verify that file is truly from the legit source and not the fake one. You can also use it to encrypt and decrypt messages.",

      "body": "just to make it 100% clear: you don't get pgp keys from some \"random\" website... You create them yourself on your own device.If you like a gui, on windows you can use kleopatra. On linux there are gui tools included in most distro's directly. Personally, i wouldn't generate keypairs on my cellphone (it's a matter of convenience and security. But i guess it might be ok if you used an open source, vetted smartphone app to help you out).I usually just create them from the terminal... Just make sure you don't download keypairs from the internet... If you download keypair generated by a thirth party, said thirth party can sign and decrypt in your name!!!",

      "body": "You can generate a PGP key pair using GPG on your local machine. If you're on a Linux system, GPG is often available by default. On Windows or macOS, you can download and install GPG from the official GnuPG website.gpg --gen-keyThe key generation process will prompt you for various details, such as your name, email address, and a passphrase. Follow the prompts and provide accurate information.After generating your key pair, ensure you create a secure backup of your private key. Losing your private key means losing access to encrypted messages.You can upload your public key to PGP key servers. This allows others to find and download your public key, enabling them to send you encrypted messages.gpg --send-keys <your_key_id>When someone sends you an encrypted message, you can use your private key to decrypt it.gpg -d encrypted_message.gpgWhen you want to send an encrypted message to someone else, you'll need their public key.

If you want to use the terminal, Mia Chloe already suggested a possible solution for you. I would like to share again. If you have a Linux operating system, consider using this tutorial [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message (Linux Only). If you do not understand anything, I am always here to help. But, you haven't said which operating system are you using at this moment. If you are using a mobile device, it's not possible to use PGP software with a terminal only on mobile devices. Also, there is another tutorial for Windows users which you may want to check. Re: [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message - Fingerprint",

Would like to know how you communicate with the person  owning pgp keys. I found few sites but don't know if I can use any random site to generate them.Yes, you can generate pgp keys with many websites but I don't suggest you to generate your pgp keys via any website. I would recommend you to use freely available tools to generate your pgp keys. If you're a windows user and you like the Gui based applications then I suggest you to use Kleopatra gui based application for the task. I have heard that Kleopatra can be used with Linux distributions also but it's basically a good choice for windows users to generate their pgp keys. Kevinsguides has a great tutorial on his website that teaches you each step to create your own pgp keys with Kleopatra application. Here's the link of that tutorial:  PGP Encryption with KleopatraIf you are a Linux user then I also suggest you to follow the tutorial of Learn Bitcoin as that one will teach you in detail that how to create your own pgp keys on Linux. He's really written a detailed tutorials for the Linux users who want to avail pgp encryption. If you're an Android user then go with OpenKeyChain, and if you're an IOS user then you can try Instant PGP.",
