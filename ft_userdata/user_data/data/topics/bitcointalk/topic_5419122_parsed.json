But for Twitter users, I think this is not good news for them.And if this implementation happens, a large number of Twitter followers will surely stop using it and look for another social media platform that doesn't mind paying a monthly fee.And from what I have seen, it is supported by billionaires around the world and the chances of this happening are high because binance itself also supports it and so on. But I hope this proposal of Elon Musk will change. Because even if only 1/4 of the 110M followers on Twitter are left, MUSK will still get a lot of income every month because his total profit on Twitter is around 220M$ from the 27.5M followers that are left all over the world.",

Millions of companies including celebrities willing to verify accounts than have tons of fake accounts concocting them.Musk has not yet said anything about Doge for Twitter payment yet but a lot of Doge fan awaits for a word about it while buying millions of it already. Seem we have expected too much.",

I started to see so many complaints about that whici is understandable caused by they hate to pay a few dollars for monthly subscription which is a shame. I guess twitter's traffic was also getting helped by the bots. I can imagine how many people from third countries will think about that. Im sure they will be going to go out from twitter too. I will support this idea caused by for the real people and it would be quite cheap but not for bots in twitter.",

Forget it, even if 8 dollars per month is not a huge sum, I can think of several ways in which I can enjoy my 8 dollars way more than by verifying a Twitter account.",

Of course, there are twitter users who monetized their brand and name in that platform, but what about those who are just using it to check for news and stuff?",

      "body": "Goodbye to bots I guess. I'd reckon it'd be okay for people who need the verification badge to pay especially since Twitter does accommodate a huge number of users so the influence there is pretty big. It probably wouldn't work out for some small-time influencers though but big-time ones shouldn't mind it. It also paints an additional layer of guarantee that the account is legit for their followers so it's a pretty cheap price imo. If it goes past that though then things might become different. From Elon's tweet as well it seems like there's still various benefits added to the monthly charge, so I reckon it's all good.

Of course, there are twitter users who monetized their brand and name in that platform, but what about those who are just using it to check for news and stuff?I think there's some type of confusion here regarding what Elon wants to do. Verified Twitter accounts are ones that have the blue badge in their name, basically guaranteeing their identity or something similar to that. Regular users can still browse Twitter without any limitations, that \"Verification\" tag is only for users who aim to let their fanbase know that they're real and that it's not a scam.",

But along with paying the monthly fee to use the platform, it will also feature a verification system to eliminate bots and fake profiles. I personally do not have an issue with rich people paying $96 a year for Twitter verification. This will be good for celebrities, politicians, athletes, and social media influencers because it will allow them to see who is really following their Twitter accounts. Having verification to access Twitter will also help reduce and clean up spam.",
