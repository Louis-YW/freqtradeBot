Considering that it has not yet been listed on some other exchanges that people have confidence in like binance, I'd say their predictions may just be right as I believe a listing on binance can make the target of getting to $0.1 a reality. If you choose to invest there, keep a close eye on your investment.",

      "body": "Sweat price predictionsthis is not financial advice!!! Something about Sweat Sweat coin is a cryptocurrency with big potential because it has a good idea promoting walking and rewards you with crypto cold SWEAT. It was founded in 2016 by Oleg Fomenko and Anton Derlyatka as a Web 2 app but in 2022 they launched the Web 3 sweat wallet, the US launch was in September 2023.Things that can make SWEAT boom in the next bull runBurning sweat has a big potential for burning coins because it has an enormous supply and the burning system has shown big results till now. They burn coins in every transaction; there were 2B coins confiscated from inactive users, and 1.6b are being burned in 8 moughts. There are a lot of prize draws that take some sweat to participate. The biggest sweat burn will be the sweat game cold “hero”(I will tell you about it later) for more info https://trioanime.com/sweat-coin-price-prediction/",

The biggest sweat burn will be the sweat game cold “hero”(I will tell you about it later) for more info https://trioanime.com/sweat-coin-price-prediction/The fact that SWEAT tokens were/can be confiscated from users is a big red flag especially SWEAT is a project that prides itself of being decentralized and bring a part of NEAR's decentralized network. If it's truly decentralized, the team should not be able to confiscate user's asset for whatever reason - active or not. Also, the concept of burning tokens and deflationary tokens is much more scamming in hindsight. For a token that is inherently inflatable, burning x number of tokens doesn't suffice anymore. I'm not saying it's a crappy project, I was anticipating the launch last year as well especially since StepN was all the rage but I'm not sure the market is big on these specific type of projects anymore though.",
