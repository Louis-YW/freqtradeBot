As for what will be the price in the next 10 years which from today is 3 halving away. I will say the ATH by then will be more than $400k although with the recent ETF impact a bit, I expect more adoption which to me should reduce volatility if not o will have gone for a value like $600k. $150k in this coming halving, Atleast a x2 to it in the 2028 halving to make it $300k and then another x2 in 2032 halving to make it $600k.

Such users should be able to figure out for themselves how to migrate their wallets.

Anyways leaving family for 10 years although it's sounds more like an abstract question but the impact is very high and I bet you a majority of hodlers will want to pull up nice after the long lost time.If you come to think of it, just like Upgrade00 mentioned, your coins should have experienced 2 halvings of which the profit from such long term hodling would have been huge. After checking prices. I guess the next thing to do is to check making sure all offline backups are in place because losing them would be the greatest nightmare.",

We can agree that it's normal behavior for the person to go straight to where he buried his gold the very moment he regains freedom. So, @OP, before you can act according to the reply you gave, that means you must have had so much Bitcoin in your wallet before being imprisoned. If I were in such a situation and I had Bitcoin in my wallet, then I might go straight to check the price, but if I don't have any Bitcoin, I will go find my family.This is just my opinion.",

I'd be focused on staying in shape and not giving up so that when it's eventually over I can take my revenge. If there was no way of knowing time and how long I have left before the end of the sentence, I'd probably go crazy within a year or two.
