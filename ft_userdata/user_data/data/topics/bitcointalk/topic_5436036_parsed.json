Many people have already became a victim, most are not into crypto and they are blaming the banks. If you are from Nigeria 🇳🇬 be very careful, the hackers form any +234 numbers and send them this PDF file, there are more than 5 people within my area that have received the same PDF, there are too many news about money vanished from bank accounts that's why many people are scared now. I have deleted this shit over 20 times already but the sender keeps sending it back, if you know how I can block the sender ( hidden number ) please do share. God bless",

Hackers do not give up easily and every time they surprise us in unimaginable ways. But in this case it is surprising that they actually succeeded in draining the bank accounts since these transfers can be traced. Also, transfers are supposed to be confirmed via e-mail and phone number. Did they really succeed in breaching all these protection measures using the pdf file?As for Metamask, there are warnings issued a week ago about a new scam method called \"address poisoning\", which makes the victim send crypto to another address of the hacker, different from the original address he wants to send to.https://cointelegraph.com/news/metamask-warns-crypto-users-about-address-poisoning-scamQuoteCryptocurrency wallet provider MetaMask is warning users of a new scam called 'Address Poisoning' used to trick users into sending funds to a scammer rather than an intended recipient.When MetaMask users send or receive cryptocurrency, it appears in the wallet transaction list. Clicking the transaction displays more details, including the token, the amount sent or received, and a short form of the third party's address.Source : https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/metamask-warns-of-new-address-poisoning-cryptocurrency-scam/",

But I understand that MMS can do this, but it will also be a little problematic with PDF files. To do this, as described, it is necessary to rename this file to an extension for photos or drawings.And you are right that scammers probably do not use their phones to send such files, but use mass mailing services with fake or purchased phone numbers.I was interested in the fact that someone could send an SMS with files, as I also receive a lot of spam and advertisements with links, but fortunately, I did not have to receive direct file sends.Thanks, OP, for letting know about this scam.https://tech25s.com/how-to-send-a-pdf-file-in-a-text-message-a-few-methods/",
