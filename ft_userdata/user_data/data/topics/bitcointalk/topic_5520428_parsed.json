  "content": "What drives prices in a free-flowing market? Supply and demand.Here's what the \"supply\" looked like to average consumer investors in years past:* They have only heard of Bitcoin* Their mechanism for buying digital currencies only allows Bitcoin* Non-Bitcoin alternatives are new and scary, and there are a lot of reports of them failing* What few competitors Bitcoin has don't do anything that Bitcoin doesn't already doHere's what \"supply\" looks like today:* There are thousands of currencies out there people have heard of* Many of them have big established brand names like ETH, DOGE, XRP, etc.* Any app that allows you to buy Bitcoin also gives you the same seamless access to thousand of other currencies* While there are still a lot of scams, the big established altcoins are now seen as safe* There are currencies out now there that are far faster, cheaper to transact in, and still perfectly safeAnybody convinced that Bitcoin can never ever go down in price because of the 21 million Bitcoin limit is missing the forest for the trees. The average consumer investor does not--and need not--limit themselves to Bitcoin, and technically-speaking, Bitcoin has no inherent advantage over its competitors, but alternatives have inherent advantages over Bitcoin (although most consumers aren't exposed to any differences between currencies in any case).Yes, there is a sudden surge right now in Bitcoin's price, and massive new consumer investor adoption of digital currency apps: we're currently seeing a new load of millions of new investors get on board the digital currency market. But I would posit that these new consumers haven't yet learned what other consumers already have learned, but in time they will learn. In other words, they are simply in a different place on the learning curve.But they are definitely going to learn, which portends a massive democratization of asset prices: the overall market cap of the market will be spread among thousands of instruments instead of just a few, since they are functionally interchangeable.Focusing on the 21 million coin limit for Bitcoin is like saying your one acre of land is going to go up in price forever because your land's location is absolutely unique, which it is. But that's not how markets work, and it's not how supply and demand works. Scarcity only covers the \"supply\" side of the supply & demand equation. Thoughts?",

Yeah I agree first mover advantage doesn't last forever but they fail because something came up that was better than them in what they do. Don't forget it's the standard of digital assets So if another Bitcoin can exist with same history that surrounds Bitcoin,trust,adoption and community Then it's possible. 2. Yeah profits beats decentralization, that's because many haven't been educated or see the essence of decentralization and disadvantage of centralization. If Centralized system was so good, Bitcoin wouldn't have survive this long. There are People that still care about Decentralization and might increase as Centralization continuously fall. 3. Again education and lack of knowledge. As adoption increases the vulnerabilities of these 'safe' tokens would become more pronounced. About the inflation you had to give example with lands and APPL and not other cryptocurrency. They can resist inflation but for how long There's a reason many tokens with great utility has spranged up and died but Bitcoin still remains.",

And my thesis is that much of the new entries into the market are not yet aware of competitors--but the entire industry is very busy trying to teach them (and they have $billions in rewards by teaching them).firstly basing a thesis (university level) on highschool level means you miss many pointssecondly.. no desire is not the same as demanddemand is the actual people willing to hand over money for an item on the market.. desire is just the fanclub, emotional sentiment of people who know and like what they see in media /life and wish they could have itmy point was more of the supply side.. because although the total supply went from 10.5m to 19.8m between 2012-now.. the exchanges never actually had 10.5m-19.8m... the exchanges(market that set price) only had ~ 5m->2m on the market supplyother factors in play of market setting prices is that people dont trade whole btc.. did you know that a market price can change wildly without the need of large/small supply.. a market can change by simply the price differences between each orderEG even with just 0.01btc supply and 5 people wanting 0.002btc each, the price can be different in 2 scenarioswhere by the sell orders are0.002 $97800.01       vs     0.002 $978000.002 $97800.02       vs     0.002 $978010.002 $97800.03       vs     0.002 $978020.002 $97800.04       vs     0.002 $978030.002 $97800.05       vs     0.002 $97804same supply same demand, yet one version the price only changes by 4cent the other changes by $4..but with all that said, bitcoin is not reaching ~$98k purely because \"first crypto' or \"21m\".. its up at this level compared to other crypto, because bitcoins cost of mining is ~$50k at the most efficient method on planet. meaning no one wants to nor willing to sell below $50k, and if the market ever did test the new bottom everyone would want to buy it at new bottom because there is no way to obtain it any cheaper by any other method(like mining) so it sets the bottom value support currently to be at $50k as something to start the speculation above that amount.where as other cryptos underlying value is far lowerdid you know that ethereums minting cost is only $50.. meaning that the speculation premium of eths todays price is 68x where as bitcoins base mining cost is at about $50,000.. meaning that the speculation premium of btcs todays price is 1.98x also the reason why eth is speculating at such a premium(way above base cost) is not because everyone loves and wants eth..its at a inflated bubble premium because bitcoiners are manipulating the price of eth by using it as a arbitrage route when trading the bitcoin markets, causing eth to inflate even without anyone really holding onto ethereum for very longin short the ethereum market price does not correlate to how many people which to adopt and hoard eth long term. its just a market tool for people to loop through other coins to get back to btc's main market pairand as i said about desire people dont need to demand btc from the market. they can desire to have bitcoin via mining or selling goods or other methods of utility to get bitcoin unrelated to market purchasingthe desire for bitcoin is different to the market demand",

But consumers don't care about decentralization anymore, and most people buy their bitcoin using an app or a broker or through an ETF. For almost all investors in Bitcoin today, Bitcoin is just a name on an investment app or in their broker's screen. Quote- No censorship.Nobody even knows what that means, let alone cares about it. Most consumer investors looking to make a profit from Bitcoin aren't trying to avoid their government finding out about their holdings (nor could they since they mostly use centralized, KYC'd brokers to buy Bitcoin).Quote- No smart contract to rug pull, mint massive new coins, no way for founders, developers or governments to freeze your Bitcoin wallets and seize your bitcoins in your non custodial wallets.Again, as I said in the OP, there are hundreds of established altcoins out there now that are very stable and clearly are not scams. Consumers have a lot to choose from now.Quote- Best blockchain in security.The Volvo gets the best security rating of all of the cars, yet Volvo's market share is less than 5% of the market. Why is that? Because most other cars are pretty safe too, and consumers don't don't care about the difference between \"super safe\" and \"super duper safe\".",

Fixing that trust will take time, along with strict regulatory measures.Unlike Bitcoin, which people view as a solid investment, altcoins often struggle to show their true value upfront. Add to that the flood of repetitive altcoin projects, it just confuses people even more.And another problem I see is that exchanges don’t help much. They’re quick to list any hyped coin because they’re chasing listing and trading fees. So without stricter regulations on altcoins, trust in this market will remain limited.",

Some old brands have held on (by drastically changing the products) but most fall by the wayside because they can't evolve.And if you don't think there are lots of people convinced Bitcoin cannot possibly go down in price you... don't read enough posts on Bitcointalk .Quote from: franky1 on November 24, 2024, 07:45:00 AMbut yes looking at any PoW coin and checking the hashrate and then doing some mining cost calculations using a base cost of this generations hardware(network hash divide by this gen asic hash=total asic units multiply by unit cost) then split over 2 years of coins produced by network to get a fair ROI of hardware.. then add electric at a reasonable base of $0.04 per kwh for number of units, then divide by blocks of the hour then coin per block you can get a pretty good idea of the bottomline support 'value' per coin that sustains any PoW coin to then speculate aboveAll I can say is that this conversation is about ten billion lightyears from any consumer investment decision today. Nobody cares about any of this when they click on the \"BTC\" button on their investor app versus \"XRP\" or any other symbol. The key to understanding any market is to truly understand how the product in that market is actually used. Right now BTC is a speculation instrument alongside thousands of others--but it happens to be the best known (but that can change over time).Based on it's technical limitations, Bitcoin will never be able to compete with newer approaches for things outside of the realm of investment instruments. As such, many of Bitcoin's competitors can do what Bitcoin does--as well as other things Bitcoin cannot do.When you evaluate any technology, always try to understand what actual problem it is solved: how does it make people's lives better? Then, ask yourself what products in that technology area solve that problem the best. Saying a product is expensive to produce, for instance, is not a value to any consumer. In fact it's a disadvantage.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is in a rather special place due to its dominance and institutional adoption. With over 50% of the market share of cryptocurrency taken by Bitcoin in 2024, events like the Bitcoin ETFs, each attracting billions of dollars in investments, give even more support. Even though some altcoins might give you quicker or cheaper transactions, Bitcoin's got that \"digital gold\" vibe going on and is clear on the regulations, so it's still the go to for big-time investors.Furthermore, market cycles suggest that Bitcoin tends to lead price movements and capital does not tend to flow into altcoins until after Bitcoin's rally stabilizes. This interplay between Bitcoin and altcoins shows that they are not interchangeable but serve very different roles within the ecosystem. The scarcity of Bitcoin and established trust make it more than just one among many; it remains foundational to the cryptomarket and influences how other assets perform.",

Bitcoin is just a button on their app. The major brokers and app makers are now in charge of protecting consumers (and regulations are in charge of protecting the brokers). Most consumers will assume, therefore, that when they select a coin to invest in on their app, it will be fine--and probably 99.9% of the time they will be right.

I've met several individuals involved in the space, and the only ones who used third parties were either day traders or people who had no idea what is bitcoin and just wanted short-term profits. Everyone else practices self-custody.My evidence is the massive amount of Bitcoin held by major brokers like Coinbase and Binance, for instance. And then there are thousands of products by smaller players as well--as well as up and coming large players like PayPal and major banks and traditional brokers. And then there's the ETFs. Most of the market is, \"day traders or people who had no idea what is bitcoin and just wanted short-term profits\". That's why everybody is actually here .And self-custody itself is not an indicator that somebody values Bitcoin's technical details. People self-custody ETH, XRP, Haypenny currencies, etc. which are all effectively centralized. From a technical standpoint, of the major digital currencies, only Bitcoin is meaningfully decentralized (and I've argued elsewhere that even Bitcoin is not absolute in this sense), but Bitcoin is only 55% of the market right now. The market is evolving past the original notion of Bitcoin and its goals--and yet Bitcoin will not evolve. Thus it will go the way of the IBM mainframe, fax machines, typewriters, and so on, from the demand standpoint.But this is all a bit of an aside. The point of the OP was that Bitcoin's 21M limit doesn't drive Bitcoin's market price, its consumer demand does.",

I would guess (from their reports and on-chain activity) that Coinbase, Binance and other smaller exchanges like Kraken would hold no more than 3 million bitcoin for their customers only. Then, we have the treasuries; about 2.8 million bitcoin there. There are 14 million bitcoin left. Who owns those? People who exercise self-custody.QuoteMost of the market is, \"day traders or people who had no idea what is bitcoin and just wanted short-term profits\".Again, what's the evidence to that? It's clear to me that those people are into bitcoin only temporarily. The organic rise in market value is due to the reduction of the money in circulation, which happens because big players invest long-term.Unless you mean \"most of the market\" in terms of \"number of people\", in which case I don't see how this is a meaningful metric.",
