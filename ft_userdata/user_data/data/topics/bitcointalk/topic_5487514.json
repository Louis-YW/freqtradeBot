As a notice, you have to know that these scammers are also individuals around us who may look normal during the day, but at night take up a second identity, or who look normal without a computer or a mobile phone from where they scam people. You have to be generally careful with people both online and offline. There was a story the other day shared by one of our forum members about how he saw a close family member trying to check his phone QuoteAt some point a cousin said to me that... Let me see your beautiful phone so I gave it to him, then I watched to see what he was doing in the phone. I found out he was trying to penetrate on my wallets but unlucky for him that they are all on passwords and at his notice that I am being observant, he began to point out those wallet Apps in my phone that... What App is this and this and this? What is it used for? And suspiciously, he was only after knowing what my wallets Apps are such as the Binance exchange, Ethereum and what I uses them for.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5487374.0These scammers online are sometimes our close friends, family offline. If they have no remorse stealing from people online, that evil heart will grow colder and one day will have no remorse if he decides to steal from you. Be as vigilant offline as you are online.",

There was also a very powerful bull rally back then, and now it doesn't seem like a coincidence that I was hacked just then. Perhaps the criminals even hacked me earlier and were just waiting for me to enter more cryptocurrencies into my wallet. I advise everyone to have antiviruses, I haven't had one yet. And also, in no case do not click on links in suspicious emails.",

Because of the many scams and hacks in the crypto space, crypto holders must take every necessary precautions to protect their coins, especially now that we're entering bull run, a lot of scammers will be enticing novice investors to scan projects. My addition will be to see every unfamiliar links that is sent to you as a potential scam, even if they were sent to you by your loved ones, because they might have ignorantly forwarded it to you as received.",

      "body": "Where there's money, there will be more rats around trying to steal and scam people who just bought Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The best thing to do is creating more awareness and alerts against these rats, starting from this forum, friends and social.Just this morning while getting a haircut, someone there was talking about a website where he received 0.2Bitcoin approximately $13,000, he was flexing ad it's a very significant amount of money in our country, I had to step up and ask him if he could withdraw them, he answered by no, but he is going to deposit 0.02 for the fees as 10% of the whole fake amount, my responsibility was to explain to him how this website is a scam. Unfortunately, he was even afraid or jealous to share that website so I can alert others, he didn't listen or believe that's a scam.So unfortunately, some people even with many alerts against these kind of scam, I think they are just so greedy, that's why scammers are everywhere because they have victims.",

It's crazy season and the scammers are very active.  Yes you are right, Almost after every 2 daya I receiving mail from fake binance to update your app. App is apk files and I strongly believe that it's contains malware which could drain my wallet balance or at least access to my cloud storage. I have not cold storage yet for holding as I am a day trader and I am using Cex for trading but I have staked more than 1k$ for staking ETH in Metamask and 500$ in Keplr wallet. I have stored my phrases in hard copy because whenever scammers got access to your PC,they will steal phrase from your cloud storage. Scammers are active Telegram, Twitter and mail and mostly airdrop hunters are being scammed.",

Some of those links sent by those reputable people or crypto influencers you follow might not even be the ones sending those messages because many of them are getting their accounts hacked and the hackers target their followers since they know most of them shill better opportunities to their followers. Others might have share those links out of ignorance that it is malicious because them too do not sometimes do due diligence on the things they share. One thing OP hasn’t added although is mostly connected to Altcoins is never connect your wallet to any website for any airdrop if you must do it then let it be with a fake wallet.",

So guys... be safe out there and protect your coins. It's crazy season and the scammers are very active.   I've seen the same upsurge you're talking about. While I receive the occasional \"you got 1 bitcoin on this certain exchange, you need to verify your account and register to claim it\" or something along those lines, as well as the Nigerian Prince email (LOL), I'm not quite sure if it's just me being very particular with the crypto scams during these instances or if they definitely increased in strength and numbers but the bottomline is, hackers are bound to get massive bags during this time period cause we got a lot of newbies who are just so ignorant about the crypto world, or people who are easily blinded by the prospect of a large sum of money which is the very thing these scammers hook them with. Perhaps besides actually acquainting yourself with these scams, and building common sense of course, you might wanna master self-discipline and skepticism cause 9 times out of 10 that's what's going to save you from losing all your money in the crypto industry, where you're a single click away from losing all your shit. Be smart, be skeptical, don't do stupid things, do all of this and you're sure to never lose a single dime out of your cold and hard wallet, as easy as that.",

You should have a cold storage wallet, and that is either a hardware wallet or an airgapped wallet, you will store the large part of your funds in this offline wallet, then you can have another online wallet that you would use to store funds for spending on the go.It is also worth mentioning that your funds is only as secure as the device you store it in, so you must pay good attention to your opsec and ensure you don't brag about your BTC funds to anyone.",
