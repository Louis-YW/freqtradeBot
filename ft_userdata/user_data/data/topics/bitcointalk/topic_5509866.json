That is a good point, but perhaps an agreement could be reached with governments, with how normalized cryptocurrency is today and taking into account that countries like El Salvador officially accept it, I believe that despite having some enemies He would have a few allies, but if not, at least he reappears anonymously clarifying who he is NOT, as if to take credit away from the impostors who try to make believe that he is satoshi haha ​​I deduce that at this point if he is still alive he must be swimming in a sea of money and living a great life and if not, I should",

Why not rather divert this energy on getting informations that can build your knowledge on how you can use bitcoin to establish for yourself some financial stability, security, freedom and privacy. We all know who is Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg etc, but that doesn't change our financial status just by knowing about them it's rather how we make use of their invention to our advantage that creates wealth for us. So in essence focus on making use of bitcoin that's at your disposal and worry less about who Satoshi is cause that won't top a cent in your piggy bank.",

If that's true, it would be worth around $63 billion now, putting him in the top 10 richest people in the world. If you had that much money, it’s probably best to stay quiet and enjoy life without the fear of being robbed, or even worse, killed.",

Revealing his identity will create a threat to his life and may be the end of his life as he has bitcoins worth billions of dollars, this will attract the attention of criminals and the government will also trouble him and may continue to make his life difficult with various accusations.

Not all mystery end up been solved like Jack the ripper though they are different view/speculation but personally not really interested on Who or what Satoshi is. He has prepared everything carefully. If Bitcoin wants to succeed with a decentralized concept, it must grow naturally, without a leading figure because anything that comes out of the leader will be misunderstood or interpreted as investment advice that causes price movements. A similar scenario happened to Dogecoin when Elon Musk tweeted on his personal X account (even though he is not the creator of Dogecoin). Let Satoshi remain a mystery, everyone should respect his privacy. What is more important is what he left for all of us.",
