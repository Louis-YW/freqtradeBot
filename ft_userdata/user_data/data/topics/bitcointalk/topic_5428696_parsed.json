  "content": "Hello, I hope you all are having a good day.I wonder if any of you could help me with little issue I have with the interface of Trezor Suite (the Windows app). Basically, for some unknown reason when pressing Ctrl + - the interface gets smaller, it zooms out but it does not zoom in when I press Ctrl + +.in consequence, I have got an interface stuck which letters and graphics with are too small to serve a purpose.Â  I tried uninstalling and installing again and used the \"restart app\" button in the settings section of the app, to no avail.I tried to find a config text file in the installation folder of the app or a way to open a console, but I could not find either, any ideas?",

Man, thank you. It totally worked.I had tried to solve this for weeks (I also tried to find articles about this issue on internet). Weirdly enough, this had been a problem in this computer only and not on other ones I have tried Trezor on.Since this little problem is solved I will proceed to lock this thread. Have a good evening!",
