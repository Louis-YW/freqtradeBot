The problem in my opinion is that the creation of that debt doesn't happen at the expense of those who create it. To be precise, when the government creates debt, it's the people who pay it. Different entity takes the loan, different entity pays back the loan.Besides the central point of failure, which in a completely free enterprise system doesn't affect the entire economy but only the merchant, it incentivizes reckless spending. The reason is pretty simple: you only think carefully when you spend what is yours. When you spend somebody else's money for their good, you're prone to spend it recklessly. So more government spending is more reckless spending.",

If they are not beneficiaries of the system, the will agree for a fix in the world by fixing the problems caused by money with bitcoins seeing how things are. The system is bad already without any sign of being better if the new change is not adopted, the system is possible to collapse and make the world more unbearable.

On account of bitcoin's monetary policy alone, it will certainly cause it to be unstable and as an effect it will be difficult for it to fix money because of this.

Even during the primitive era, there was probably already murder and theft and robbery and rape and arson all kinds of crimes. When human civilization used the barter system, it doesn't mean there were no wars and conquests and bloody seizures of power and otherwise. I am in agreement that fixing the money, which is dirtier underneath than how it all appears from the outside, would contribute in fixing the world, but it can only do so much. It's probably obsession to think of Bitcoin as a technological panacea. Truth be told, there's no silver bullet that could fix the world.And I think this popular line is not originally coming from Bitcoin Magazine.",

Africa has abundant resources that can make the continent a prosperous one, yet its nations are highly indebted. These lending organizations use loans to manipulate and control the economic sector of their debtors which includes devaluation of their local currency making the dollars stronger. Bitcoin could help to reduce the dominance of dollars in the global sphere which might make international trading less 'dollarized\" but it is not the only solution to the economic woes of developing countries.The main problem of most natural resources rich but economically poor countries is corruption and bitcoin might not be able to fix it. Until the leaders of these nations focus on using the available resources to develop these nations and not on embezzlement of funds, their economic problems will remain.

Yeah, We love Bitcoin. That doesn't mean we must support it blindly, and not think of another side. Also, I believe this slogan means being for the financial side, not social or political. A simple word can be used for various things. Take \"Script,\" for example. The same word is used by movie directors, which means the story and plot of the movie. When it comes to a web developer, He means it as web application script. In this case, Fixing the world means fixing the world's money system. Surely bitcoin won't be able to fix everything outside of the financial system. But, It will help in many cases, such as privacy. People won't know how much money you have; no one can search for it until you let them know. Banks and fiat money are here to stay at the end of the world.

The problem is that there's not enough gold to make enough gold coins to cover all global transactions.The same thing can be applied to Bitcoin. We could make Bitcoin the one and only global currency, but the Bitcoin Core blockchain cannot handle all the financial transactions in the world.
