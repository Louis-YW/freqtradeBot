In addition Blockchain.com changes its APRs evry month, so maybe in one or two months, the ROI for this crypto will be lower than that. And if it's for stable coins like Stompix thinks it is, there are DeFi or GameFi investments more interesting than that (2x times higher at least).",

If you hold bitcoin instead of 7% USDT ROI, you will make more money in bitcoin. Be expecting bitcoin to get to all-time-high by next year or in 2025 and you will make multiple of the money.

To go higher Bitcoin needs more buyers. So why people would wait 2024 or 2025 to buy it a higher price, rather than buying now at a lower one. People know how Bitcoin is volatile, so IMO they will stay more cautions than in the past and they won't buy it at a price near its previous ATH so I don't think BTC could print a new ATH in the coming years. We need more adoption for that.",

I advised him not to go for it but to buy bitcoin which will give better return if he can wait and let the price to increase, that the return he will see from holding bitcoin will be far higher than the return he will see from the 7% USDT.",

You already wrote the difference of passive from active there but maybe more information can be found on that link or on what type of activity we will do in order for us to get qualified for the respective rewards. If I'm going to try this, I will only do the active one's. Why? It is obvious that it gives higher rewards and then I can move my assets including my capital out of the website immediately if I choose to. That way I can lessen the risk of whatever can happen to me or to the website.Passive rewards on the other hand is much lower, yet maybe we are required to deposit a hefty amount. We all know how it works right? That's it, we need to idle our capital on them for a longer time. So the risk is also much bigger here.",
