Fewer available BTC on the market with the increased demand that has been evident since the beginning of this year should have quite the opposite effects to those you describe.Quote from: Blisszi on February 24, 2023, 06:13:51 PMBTC will continues going down if the major shareholders did not turn up to increase the strength and volume of BTC  , BBC market news shows that the number of people trading bitcoin in 2020-2023 has drastically reduced compared to 2013-2015 figures, that if this continues BTC will suffer insufficient pumps. Just listen to what they write and say on the mainstream media and everything will be fine  - it seems that their \"experts\" have some bigger problems with mathematics, because it is stupid to say that 10 years ago more people traded Bitcoin than today.Quote from: Blisszi on February 24, 2023, 06:13:51 PMIf the system continue suffering price creeping, am afraid BTC may end up into another revolution of losses.You are obviously still under the impression of what happened 1 or 2 years ago, so you don't understand that losses are an integral part of trading on every market. In addition, Bitcoin has grown by more than 50% compared to the bottom (below $16k), and you are talking about some kind of \"price creeping\" - first you need to look at the real data, and then draw conclusions.",

There must be something quite wrong about this, as someone who has been here for 10 years I can tell you that the number of people who are trading bitcoin right now, is x100 more than 10 years ago. The figures in 2013-2015 being more than the 2020-2023 period, the period when bitcoin reached the ATH prices? Are you kidding me? I need to see some proof of this, because I call it a straight up lie, a FUD spreading, a method to manipulate the market to make people fear holding bitcoin and nothing more, its not just a lie, its literally done purposefully to spread fear, nothing more and factually wrong.",

Due to the fact that they are patiently waiting for BTC to touch $20K before they sell it.Well, there are many analyzes according to BTC price charts and references to historical data, which explain the reasons for rising or falling almost every day on various groups, be it websites, telegrams or others, but I believe BTC will go to $ 30K in the near future.",

When you hear the same phrases being said with ease like \"it could all collapse at any moment\" or \"Bitcoin price could go to zero\"  it's clear why most people don't want to \"take risks\" in the long term.I agree, they Not Going To Make It.",

I've been in the crypto space for more than 4 years already, and it's my first time that the word saga is being used with Bitcoin.  I don't know if I'm just ignorant enough to not see this word being connected with Bitcoin.Overall, I'm kind of getting what the OP is trying to share with us, but this is just pure speculation as always. Revolution of losses, Bitcoin Saga, BTC been taken from the system or whatever terminologies they are, it's just pure speculation. To all newbies out there, don't take what the OP shared or at least just don't read it. It will make your head ache.",

If ever there are dumps that will be experienced, I don't think it will be a huge one and it won't take much time for the price to recover again. Blank swan event is unpredictable and I think each year, there will always be one.This is another reason for the price to decline and the severity will depend on the damage of that affected company but let's hope that the incoming one will be less brutal than last time so that it won't have a domino effect with the other like what happened with the FTX exchange.",

Bitcoin is not a security there are no shares and there are no shareholders. Bitcoin right now is following the macro and we are still dealing with sticky inflation and its by stocks and crypto might of peaked a few weeks back. You need to realise that unless CPI is reduced then rates will have to be much higher, right now we are pricing in another 50 bps by the Summer. If inflation is still hot we might price in 75bps or 100bps and obviously stocks and crypto will suffer.The way its looking we might peak at 6% interest rates.

Well, just understand and observe since Bitcoin was created, hasn't the value of Bitcoin increased a lot since 2008 until now?         That's where you should see Bitcoin's stability, there is a lot of FUD's out there but even once the value of bitcoin has not dropped much because, in a short period, bitcoin has recovered and even exceeded the price that most of its holders did not expect.",
