Â  So, till then let's start:And if you think x-mas is coming and there will be a lul the incoming transactions, I have some bad news for you:The difficulty adjustment is coming in 24 hours and the current pace is 5.4%, that means 95 extra blocks have been mined compared to normal, a thing that might change to less blocks mined next period, meaning less capacity, which you guess it, means higher fees!",

I think OP has thought a better solution to bring all those fee related issues in a single thread. Let's discuss about the fees here from now on.",

I'm not pointing any fingers toward miners, in fact I believe that they deserve to have some extra fees sometimes as a reward for their contribution to the Bitcoin network. The high fees aren't caused by miners, those are caused by the ordinals. I'm not against the miners nor I'm against the developers as they're also trying to fix the issues. it's an issue in the network that we all are facing and we all should work as a community to solve the issue. I hope that the developers will soon find a solution for the issue.",

There is a significant number present here who does both, that is recieve & send, they are the ones who are getting affected because of high fees. 15k Satoshi is still a significant amount as transaction fee. I remember a time when 12 Satoshi or above was considered high fee. I did pay the same amount when I made a transaction using my Electrum wallet. The fees would come down but the vulnerability has exposed how developers are slowly making Bitcoin in accessible to small investors. Which for me is not a good signal if we want Bitcoin adaptation to go to the grass root level.",

As you can see, even these damn wallets have their advantages - while everyone pays high commissions, exchanger wallets have fixed commissions (which provides short-term benefits).

But whatever you do, don't spread this, it's FUD, it hurts our dreams of becoming millionaires without doing anything!Still I see this topic as an advantage as we could centralize data here and have it as a refence, no need to search in 100 topics what the fees were or how much that guy paid one month ago.As for the fees themselves, yeah I expect bit of dive, it's Friday and the western world turns its attention to Christmas, it will be probably the longest weekend (23-26) with very low incoming tx. But that won't make them extra cheap or go to 10sat/b there are currently 208vMB, that's already one and a half day of blocks waiting above that level, not considering that hitting 10sat/vb a ton of exchanges will start consolidating dust.",

Hopefully they'll get tired of all this and decide that it's time that they stop making money out of these ordinals and the people that's paying top dollar for transactions.

Good!Going by the bitcoin press and blogs:QuoteThe survey was conducted in May 2023 and found that found that 52% of Turkish adults aged 18 to 60 have invested in cryptocurrencies, a 12% increase from 40% in November 2021Quote47% of Nigerians Engaged in Crypto-Related ActivitiesI'll spare you the math and say that just two should account for close to 100 million users, now assuming by user you mean a guy who makes a tx at least a month, right, then we need 3 million tx a day for these guys alone!!!!!When we will truly reach those levels of acceptance, whom do we fix and eliminate?For half of the Europeans to withdraw their bitcoins to their own cold wallet and do nothing with them after, we need at perfect batching solutions, so 1 input 1000 outputs, segwit only nothing else, Â 90 days of blockspace. For the whole of India to do this we need, you guess it, one year!!Who do we eliminate or tell to fuck off and not do a on chain tx then? Â First is ordinals, then it's consolidating inputs cause you can just use coin control, then mixers, then it's casinos, next a restriction for coins to be spent under 72 hours, then...what? We start culling people who own less than 0.0001 as it's considered dust?To lighten the mood a bit:",
