This always happens, as their cost is too highYou can expose some money to fiat which has less volatility if you are affraid.",

      "body": "If miners are concerned about volatility, they should secure some funds to purchase energy. They don't get less fees when Bitcoin is pumped; rather, the network becomes congested, and they charge more. They should consider how they will manage their energy bills in the future. They should have a business policy because they are here to make money, not lose it. So they must either invest in fiat to buy energy or secure funds in fiat during a bull market. As a result, they can easily survive a bear market.",

The bitcoin miners you mentioned are not all miners, these are a handful of very specific mining companies that were facing the energy crisis and had to sell their bitcoins to cover their costs. For example Core Scientific is a company that filed bankruptcy recently so obviously they liquidated what they stored not because of profit, etc. but because of their terrible financial situation due to bad business model and lack of foresight. Some others like Iris Energy had built their big mining operation with loans, but the lenders don't care about the financial and energy crisis, lower bitcoin price, higher electricity price, etc. they also increase their interest rate and the farm has to pay a lot more while earning a lot less so they have to either go bankrupt and shut down or sell their stored bitcoins to be able to pay their debt.This is not the same for all miners around the world.",

Falling prices in Bitcoin is expected in crypto, but the current energy crisis may have surprised some, reason for the sell off by some miners.Quote from: ChillyMatthew on December 29, 2022, 05:56:46 PMWhat I'm wondering here is if there is a way for miners to hedge against shrinking margins? Do you think hedging strategies could help us stay solvent amid the bear market?As a solo entrepreneur, you hedge up profits when the prices are high and the cost of operations are low, so then the reverse happens, you would be able to survive through the winter period. Publicly traded companies operate differently and like all businesses during time ob market downturn they would need to cut costs (by laying off workers or cutting down on production) and maybe have diversified investments in other niches that could bring in profits.",

its not.if you calculate the validators at a 300w PSU of a normal PC . vs coins. and compare that the the old PoW mining. its about 95%there 99.95% WAS a projection thinking there would only be like a dozen validators(they were only counting the main custodians, like coinbase and a dozen others)in short ethereum PoW was about $900 underlying cost value with a $1.4k market (1.5x speculation) and now ethereum PoS about $45 cost value with a $1.2k market(26x speculation) if you add up all the asics vs validators respectively (and compare it to market price respectively)I thoroughly enjoyed your explanations of why core scientific declared bankruptcy, what is your enlighten complex view on the other two big ones.Compute North, the second largest bitcoin mining hosting provider in the US, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., once one of the largest public Bitcoin miners in the US, warned that it may seek bankruptcy protection  As far as the 99.9% , I was getting that from https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ethereum-blockchain-eliminates-99-99-of-its-carbon-footprint-overnight-after-a-successful-merge-according-to-new-report/QuoteA new report from CCRI (Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute), commissioned by ConsenSys, reveals that the transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake has reduced the electricity consumption and carbon footprint of the Ethereum network by over 99.988 % and 99.992%, respectively.FYI: Just because a power supply has a max rating of 300watt does not mean that PC is using the full 300 watts.I had an 600 watt power supply and according to the UPS data was only drawing between 80 to 120 watts on average.https://energyusecalculator.com/electricity_computer.htmQuoteWe estimate that an average modern desktop PC will use approximately 100 watts of power,",

      "body": "Bitcoin miners have to sell. Their revenue comes from the Bitcoin they earn as block rewards. So, if they want their operations to continue, they will have to liquidate their Bitcoin every now and then. Well, if they wish to keep their Bitcoin for some time for selling later on when the price is much higher, they could probably choose to use them as collateral instead and take a loan. But the point is Bitcoin miners can't be HODLers forever. However, if the price is so low vis-à-vis the energy expenses, among other operational costs, then the option would be to shut down. And since Bitcoin's price is cheaper than the cost of running business, as franky1 have mentioned, isn't it, then, logical to just use the money intended for the operation to directly buy Bitcoin instead? Business could resume anytime things get better.",

      "body": "What I see from these miners is that they have to be able to use renewable energy sources and reduce the huge electricity costs to run a bitcoin mining company. If they still pay exorbitantly high electricity costs, they will be depleted and unable to hold onto the bitcoins they have earned from mining.After that, I wondered how much tax they have to pay the government to run the bitcoin mining business but I guess the tax is not that big either. Supposedly, those who have accumulated more bitcoins than others can sell their bitcoins when the bitcoin price peaks and then invest in renewable energy sources so that they can replace the energy sources they use. Maybe we can ask in more detail about the company that runs the bitcoin mining so we know what the real problems they are facing are.",
