New casinos also comes with baggages likes 1. Experiencing several issues like game loading or lagging.2. Experiencing errors when trying to deposit or make withdrawal.3. Lower withdrawal limits.4. Limited currencies accepted, most prefer Fiat still. 5. Lack of games collection due to limited software providers. 6. Lack of online reviews about them, some even have their ways with fake reviews. If you want try them out then make sure that they have an announcement thread opened on the Bitcointalk forum, few new casinos made it to the forum and still turn scam, they are been dealt with by raising an alarm and red tagging their account, This spreads information all over the forum and outside the forum, at least many are saved from becoming the next victim.Compare this to if the new casino has no Bitcointalk ANN, it will take time before many people know that the casino is already scamming their users, on the long run, the casino must have made a handful of money from scamming their customers. Information is very vital when dealing with new online casinos this days.",

Sometimes the people that created the casino may not be able to market the casino very well and because of low profit in a way the casino can no longer function, they just stop the casino and not allowing people to withdraw.I too will advice people to just try the casinos or other gambling sites on this forum instead. If it is a new casino, they should try it with little amount of money. They should try the ones that have signature campaign which are able to market their gambling sites on this forum. The gambling sites that I have gone for on this forum have active signature campaign and also having active announcement thread.If it is a new gambling site that is not in this forum, I do not try to register and this has been the reason no casino has scammed me before. I am not saying that new gambling sites can not scam, use very low amount of money to gamble on such gambling sites.",

If a casino is interested in getting active user from the forum, they would come up with exclusive offers. I don't see anything wrong here. Those offers does encourage members to check their casinos and engage with them for sometime. Being a new casino they would have some glitches and would have fewer games than established ones. I don't think it should be considered wrong. It helps the casino aswell as it helps them to work on their infrastructure when the traffic is high. Following your suggestion means not encouraging a new casino to expand their business. I don't agree with your points.",

Like the signature you are using now, haven't they also just created an ANN on this forum, as you said, we all still have to be careful when promoting a new site, Especially those who don't have a reputation on this forum, it will obviously take time for them to get a good reputation on this forum. I see that there are lots of new casino sites on the forum lately.I'm not saying that this is something that attacks your signature campaign, but we all know that nowadays all casinos have to create an ANN on this forum if they want to promote their casino seriously, not jokingly and half-heartedly in promoting it. at least gaining trust and traffic from this forum by holding a signature campaign will be greatly appreciated by the community, my advice is also not to gamble at a new casino before there are reviews and reputation of their site from this forum community.",

I'm sure that scam casino owners are just doing it repeatedly, after countless of scam casino they had made, they have the idea on how to evade their victims and the law on the crime they had made.Even if that certain scam casino is red tagged, has an alarm or has a very bad reputation here and everywhere, if they want to scam people.

Therefore, outstanding bonus and other remarkable freebies from casinos are not the only factor to hold on to because a casino that initially plan to exit will eventually plan the exit and eventually run away.

In the first place you're looking for a casino to benefit from yourself, from the rewards, the programs, and freebies they give, and reputable casinos should be your top pick. New casinos are tried and tested by others because they're looking for something reputable casinos don't have. It can stem from the type/variety of games, KYC, rules and regulations, and stuff like that. Thing is, new gamblers don't need to think of that, at least not yet. They'd probably get some trial to a reputable casino before even trying to mind stuff like those imo.",

Without putting out bonuses and offers how do you expect these new casinos to attract new users from the forum to expand their user based if not through those exotic bonuses. Reputation is not built in a short time, it takes years and these new casinos deserves to be given the benefits of doubt as did to those old casinos in the forum when they first arrived. Like @Oshosondy said, the only cautiousness to apply is not by refusing to make use of these casino's but in making use of them for our gambling we should deposit money we can afford to lose in case of a scam happening. QuoteNew casinos also comes with baggages likes 1. Experiencing several issues like game loading or lagging.2. Experiencing errors when trying to deposit or make withdrawal.3. Lower withdrawal limits.4. Limited currencies accepted, most prefer Fiat still. 5. Lack of games collection due to limited software providers. 6. Lack of online reviews about them, some even have their ways with fake reviews. For a new casino these experiences can't be falling short of them certain collection would be lacking so it's isn't a sharp end for conclusion , any old gambler that have tested varieties of online casinos shouldn't see these \"garbages\" as something to not worry about for a scam, with time they will improve in those features and errors.Reviews are a good way to know about the repute of a casino but new casinos may not have those much reviews you might be looking for as they are just new into the market. Though some reviews are paid reviews  so I don't 100% place my points on reviews.",

The only difference is you can never predict which one is going to be buster in the upcoming future. It’s better to focus on the existing popular casino that has proven themselves the trusted casino if a new gambler is starting their journey. Then once they get the feel for everything they can start exploring new platforms. Most of the time we keep switching for the undeniable offers and promos and then most of them just switch back to the original platform once the offer is fully availed. We know very this is game of investing, saving on offers and then putting more into profits. I think they shouldn’t be warm about it but they should be taught how they should start their journey. Start with reputed casino, then slowly explore others.",

Lack of games collection due to limited software providers. 6. Lack of online reviews about them, some even have their ways with fake reviews. These are common errors that could easily be noticed at cheap online casinos that are in the business of scamming their users. This can be easily detected, and I can say that the casino owners might be less prepared and have a smaller target audience. If not to run a good scam the way most of these online casinos do, they need enough funds and manpower (in the aspect of developers in different areas) who will help them put things together in order to gain people's trust. Scamming doesn't just come so quickly; it takes time to build trust with their customers. Most of these online casinos that have scams in their minds just operate like Ponzi schemes.What they do: First, they might have a specific amount that they have gathered either through scammers fund-raising or one person who is rich enough to volunteer to sponsor their activities; they raise one among the best in the market to make their platform appear competitive among others; they give some favourable games that will be pleasant to the eye; and of course, they give a good welcome bonus. Just as you have mentioned, they can set up the system to automatically choose winners in a specific range, which they can be able to pay at that particular point in time due to the limited resources at their disposal. When one to two people have successfully withdrawn both their winnings and their deposit, their trust system will begin to grow. Others will hear from the first customer's testimony and will have to try it out. With the money people are pumping in, they will have to gather player deposits to pay a few other players of their winnings. When they have enough customers and their targeted amount has been reached when the customers least expect it, the casino will exist without any warning. We can never be careful enough; we just have to try our best, as some scammers are so good at drawing up their scamming strategies that people won't even suspect their objective from the beginning until they begin to unleash it.",
