So you can call and verify the story with the family father. (as he still use the number now) He speaks good English.Also his son is a Java script programmer, student, familiar with crypto currencies.They don't have jobs. And very few personal possessions.I have full chat history, and email corresponandce, from the house rental web page. (can do a screen share). Also correspondence with the local government, who provide the security for the rental contract. Since they are registered refugees in Norway.They surely get some benefits from the state.But I can imagine it must be quite a challenge to move to a new country, with only the minimum amount of personal possessions and funds. Norway is very expensive, compared to Ukrain. That's why I came up with the idea to help sell this interesting phone number, to give them a good start.100% agree it's good to donate to Ukrain directly. And my close family advice against renting to refugees. Especially since Norway already is one of the biggest donators to Ukrain.Still.... If we can help them get a new life here, there is no biggie F U to the aggressors.Thank you for your interest and consideration.",

You have to go via Germany and Denmark.There are ferries from Poland, so that would be the quickest route surely.These guys stayed in Czech for some time, before being accepted into Norway.Hence, they needed a phone number while staying there.",

That might help some people in a less then ideal life situation. Appreciate the offer. Do you think they would actually arrange this auction?These guys are surley more well off than many other Ukrainians, since they actually made it to Norway.And the state here provide fairly for them.In terms of Norwegian standards, they live as poor here. And has low chances of getting jobs, before they learn the local language.That's why I thought it would be a good idea to auction off this number, to give them a start boost.If you think there is a chance the charitable organization would actually auction this phone number off, please make the contact. Maybe +420 and 69, carries a little strong symbolism for such organizations?",
