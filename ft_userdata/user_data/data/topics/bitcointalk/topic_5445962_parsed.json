If anything I believe with banks being  affected which were suppose to be their clients safe house,it's clear crypto is the only answer and price is expected to keep soaring.",

He can even afford to pay to have a dinner with Warren Buffett and that's a lot of \"learning\" for him.Maybe the drop that we recently saw was due to him but then as I look at the market, it's all good and up again. So it seems that the market was quite affected by it but then it has recovered so fast that it makes it look like there's little to no effect at all.",

Does anyone know how many btc does justin have to dump on us ?Bitcoin dumped because FED hiked rates again exactly at the time when it dumped that's why there was a pump first about 30 minutes before the FED's announcement because people were speculating there would be a pivot. Since there was no pivot some traders dumped fearing the following decrease in stock prices would affect bitcoin. Why wasn't there a bigger panic? Probably because the stocks have taken into account a possible hike and because bitcoin is slowly decoupling from stocks.Bitcoin doesn't care about a shitcoiner like Sun and his schemes. Shitcoins don't affect bitcoin.",

I might be wrong but this is my own observation of the recent price movement since the beginning of this year.I do not think the news about Justin Sun being sued by SEC will have an effect on the Bitcoin market.  Remember Justin Sun is sued not because of BTC but of manipulating the volume of TRX through wash trading.  If something is about to be affected, I think it should be TRX and other cryptocurrencies to where Justin Sun is affiliated.The current price retrace of Bitcoin to sub $27k  and temporarily pointing toward $25k is not because of this news but the current interest hike announced by FED[1]. With the announcement, somehow fiat money gains its strength even though banks are failing.QuoteBitcoin slid 4.8% to $26,895.88, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 4.1% to $1,726.58, following a big move higher on Tuesday.But somehow as of this reply, Bitcoin price already recovered above $27k.[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/bitcoin-rises-ahead-of-key-fed-decision.html",

Justin Sun was sued together with some celebrities including Akon. SEC alleged that these celebrities promoted Sun's TRX and BTT as if they had interest in them. We know that banks have been on the news for the last few weeks, maybe they want to shift the people's attention to the crypto space. The banking sector have gradually lost it's reputation this few days, maybe they want to also dent the image of some key players in the industry to also give the sector a bad name. The impact of this suit on the price of bitcoin will not be much, hopefully within few days bitcoin will recover.",

Everybody knows the drill if you offer some promotion/sale to the US market the US SEC rules and regulations must be obeyed. No matter how powerful anyone maybe once he offers unregistered bounty programs not to mention multiple which were done by Justin Sun he has to face the consequences.I am glad that the 8 celebrities that promote the movement are also sued because some influencers are the reason why most newbies are victims of scam projects.",

The dump was imminent to happen, there are just some factors that adds it. If he dumps it, it will just be temporary, it will recover in no time.",
