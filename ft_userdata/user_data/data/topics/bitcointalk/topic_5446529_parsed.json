TREADHow to do conclude that Apple is simple to use, just try to copy the videos and music from Apple iPhone to PC and try the same from Android to PC and you will know the difference If you were using the Apple iPhone, you must be using the famous blue wallet, the same wallet work in Android as well and you may use it. You may use Electrum wallet too on your mobile but i don't like it because of its limited features on the phone. It works well on desktop / Laptop.",

      "body": "Well, I understand Apple can be very attractive because its ease of use and how fluently their hardware works with their software, but the freedom a good android phone can give is also very worth the change if you ask me. I have messed with Android before, installing ROMs, customized kernels, etc. It is more open and that is something anyone into Bitcoin and free software should appreciate a bit. As for the wallet, I also recommend you to try the schildbach wallet, but be aware that wallet has a different mechanism to back your wallet up. It does not show your seed as other wallets do, instead it creates an encrypted file which contains your seed/private keys.Once you encrypted that file, you are supposed to upload it to your personal cloud or save it in your PC, so if you lose your phone, you can download the app again, transfer the file to the new phone and decipher the keys. In other to do those things, you must not forget both your encrypting password and the pin for payments. Â If you have any other question about that wallet, let me know. I used it for several months.",

You will be directed yourself in choosing a wallet.Select wallet >> Next >> select android version >> Next.When it comes to that stage, the question will arise how much we know about bitcoin.

In the choice of a new user type, blue wallet does not enter the name into bitcoin.org.Even without checking each column what criteria are required (optionally) from Control to Fees and what features are you looking for from 2FA to SegWit, only four wallets appeared according to the instructions namely Bitcoin Wallet, BitPay, Electrum, and Unstoppable.I recommend Blue Wallet and started using it on Android after the announcement made by @theymos at November 15, 2022, 02:36:52 AM (Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts) after an incident that happened to one of the major exchanges with the intention of making funds more secure.Choosing and using Electrum is also very good, but in my experience, Blue Wallet is easier to use on Android than Electrum.What we need to say is that the OP can make his own choices via the path we provide via a bitcoin.org search.",
