      "body": "Firstly if your transaction is giving the information unpaid then it hasn’t been broadcasted that either you mistakenly click save instead of pay. But since you said there is a memepool fee error might meant that the server you’re connected to has a minimum of fee set above that which you pay. There is a an icon at the bottom that allows you to change sever to any one but I wouldn’t advise that rather you should increase your transaction fee instead. Check https://mempool.space/ for the fee estimation. Then go back to send icon again click on the unpaid transaction and you will see pay click it and then it will take you to fee rate adjustment then adjust it to the right one and then confirm your payment and it will show on the history few seconds later as unconfirmed. If it still persists then use the change severe and change your server or just log out of the electrum wallet and login back in again. This should solve your problem",

What you meant is transaction fee and not gas fee; which is associated with Altcoins, some newbies might mixed it up. As for the RBF it is only possible if the transaction has been broadcasted with low fees and it’s pending or uninformed. But this one still looks like a saved invoice. Wait OP are you using the wallet with seed or private key. Hope it is not a watch only wallet because that’s how it will save the transaction till you send it to where it will be signed (non-watch only wallet) and then broadcasted",

Sorry...Usually Electrum only gives options based on speed, but sometimes it's not very accurate...However, instead of guessing what actually happened regarding the status of the transaction, my suggestion is to provide a few pictures regarding the transaction... such as screenshots or screen records if necessary... that way, many people will understand better and will also provide suggestions regarding what steps to take. what you have to do.",

You cannot get a transaction ID for a transaction that hasn’t be broadcasted. The unpaid transaction is just like an invoice you created because the fee you use is way below the minimum fee rate of the sever you’re connected to. Also the network wouldn’t automatically pick that transaction themselves you will have to broadcast it your self. Check the replies on the thread again and adjust your fee or if it is the total balance in the wallet reduce the amount you will send and leave that which will cover for the fees",
