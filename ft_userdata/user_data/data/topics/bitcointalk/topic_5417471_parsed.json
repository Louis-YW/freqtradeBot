  "content": "What happened:: Cryptoplay.io casino has rigged fairness and changed hashed server seed. My friend made 10 deposits to hit keno 500x on the same pattern on a new seed(over 35000 rolls/nonce) for days but this seed was the definition of \"bad luck\" before we exposed how Cryptoplay changed game results. He took screenshots at different nonces to save Hashed Server Seed to verify fairness after hitting 500x on this pattern. Over 35k nonce, he gave up to deposit and decided to play with the lowest possible bets to see how far the loss streak can go. He hits 500x on this pattern and decided to verify the seed on the PHP verifier. He changes the seed to see the server seed that must be used to verify bets on that seed but the given hashed server seed doesn't match with the Hashed Server Seed on his saved screenshots. After checking different screenshots and comparing with the Hashed Server Seed given by scammers aka Cryptoplay casino, the Hashed Server Seeds are completely different:The original Hashed Server Seed:  Code:fc86f14b39cb68ef55a9c0f8133494fa5f340a1b17b5af0d285af6247507815aAnd Hashed Server Seed on the bet after changing seed to verify previous one: Code:4d15ef41be8c0d1ac427924e71bd249d5c44587d95262b54fa3127a6321c1203Same nonce, same client seed different Hashed Server Seeds mean scammers have changed Server Seed.We have screenshots of other bets, you can check below links.Quote from: nc50lc on January 13, 2020, 04:33:00 AMImportant note: The 'Server Seed hash' won't be used for the computation but it acts as an assurance that they won't change the server seed to manipulate the result.Experienced users can confirm why Hashed Server Seed is important to save for verifying bets so Casino didn't manipulate the game result after the user makes a new seed. As you can see on the saved screenshots, Hashed server Seeds are different on the same bets of this seed, clearly scam. Cryptoplay scammed my friend and he lost $700 on this seed.  Support clearly ignores my questions and keeps repeating  to check modified Server Seed \"Go check the bets on the PHP verifier and send us screenshots\". First Mario tried to \"explain\" why there are different Hashed Server Seeds on the same bet, he first tried to close case by simply telling it is \"display error\" but I told him I have more than 3 screenshots taken on different nonces/time. And on his second attempt to explain: Mario: Code:\"Server seed hash is a warranty that can be applied to max 1 bet\", \"It would only work for one bet, this is why the hashed seed is a warranty only for the first bet, otherwise it proves nothing\" So logically it means, hashed server seeds change per bet/nonce?! The worst part is Sam(manager) came to chat as manager but he refused to answer any of my questions, he didn't explain why the Hashed Server Seeds are not same on same bet/nonce. Sam: Code:\"My colleague Mario explained it to you in the most comprehensible way possible\" I shouldn't expect more from the support team of a Cryptoplay.io scam casino, none of my questions are answered and they tried to make it more complicated on provably fairness subject. They simply rigged the game results to scam users and get caught. Cryptoplay(Cryptoplay.io) is a scam casino that manipulated game results, and rigged seeds to scam users!Link to scam casino:  Cryptoplay.ioProofs:  https://ibb.co/album/nqdWCx (You can check same nonce bets but different Hashed Server Seeds, btw I have googled seeds as you can see on open tabs.)https://ibb.co/album/RTc9kw",

It doesn't make any sense. Some players make make thousands of bets, you don't expect them to save the server seed for each bet. it's gonna take days to verify the fairness of the game. Not to mention that the player need to change the client seed too every time the server seed changes otherwise the whole pf system would be useless.Obviously they are deceiving their customers by pretending their games are pf while they are not.This casino is to be avoided.",

      "body": "In order for a casino to be provably fair, it needs to commit to the server seed before the bet is placed, and allow for the player to provide some additional input to be combined with the server seed (often referred to as the \"client seed\"). Once both the casino and player commit to their own respective seeds, some operation needs to be performed on both seeds in order to calculate the outcome of the bet. Due to the fact that the same calculation done to both seeds would produce the same outcome if repeated, after each bet, the casino will need to change either the server seed, or add a nonce that is also part of the calculation that will change after each bet. I personally think using the same server seed, and a nonce makes verifying bets easier for the player (which, in turn, will add trust to the casino), however changing the server seed after each bet will not invalidate the provable fairness, provided the hash of the server seed is known to the player before they make each bet. In this particular case, assuming the screenshots are genuine, it appears there are two different server seeds for the same bet. If the casino cannot provide the actual server seed that hashes to fc86...15a to allow the player to verify the outcome of the bet, the casino is not provably fair.",

A user can easily edit the image with 'Inspect Element' and put a different seed to defame the site. I don't consider the evidence to be conclusive enough especially when my inquiry didn't reveal any irregularity in the fairness script.  It was the first time I saw different hashes on the same bets, then I checked other screenshots to see if maybe I did something wrong but all screenshots have the same Hashed Server Seed starting with <fc8> but on the website, the Hashed Server Seed was different after post-reveal. You can check proofs to find the different timestamps on screenshots stating my HSS is different.  It was not for a single bet btw, I have uploaded min 3 photos of HSS starting with <fc8>. Regarding the last lines, please check screenshots and tell me how fast the user should be to click F12 find the area and paste my own code then took a screenshot to show(Check timestamps on pics pls). BTW, I have google open tabs where I have searched both HSS and Client Seeds after losing my 5th deposit without a single withdrawal. If I knew Cryptoplay is going to scam, I should look for screen recording software to prove the hashes gonna be different which is impossible to know for user without taking a new seed and reveal the previous Seed.This seed was 5 days old, and I lost 5 deposits doing high bets on this Keno pattern(check SS) then I decided to continue this tomorrow. After losing my last -$170 depo, decided to stop chasing this pattern(over 35000 rolls on the same pattern, the same seed which is weird - 7 times higher than the average hit for 500x Keno on 9 tiles-(5300 in average per 500x)).  I hit 500x Keno on 0.1^7 CPC dust aka demo money, changed seed right after hitting 500x to verify seed, (bingo!)  HSS don't even look similar, I understood I was scammed at this point.Quote from: nc50lc on October 19, 2022, 05:16:33 AMIf it matched, then that BetID's revealed server seed hash was really the value used by the casino, not the previously presented different server seed hash which is different.And that's not provably fair since they've initially presented you a different hash for the same BetID.Given the one-way nature of hashing functions, there shouldn't be any other server seed that will produce the same hash.If it didn't match, you should ask the casino to present the 'server seed' that results with fc86f14b39cb68ef55a9c0f8133494fa5f340a1b17b5af0d285af6247507815aSupport says, our rigged seed is all you need, go verify and you will see every bet is PF, and ignores all my questions let alone asking what is server seed of HSS starting with <fc8>. They say Hashed Server Seed can be applied on the first bet of any seed. My theory is they found the perfect Server Seed that matches with my Client seed that gives the worst possible results on this Server + Client Seed combination(Weird, it hits 500x after 35k bets on this seed) since I chase a single KENO  pattern till it hits 500x. After hitting 500x on zero bet and changing seed, they instantly changed HSS to the one they used to cheat me,IMO.",

Changing the hashed server seed post-reveal is one of the nastiest things I can imagine a house doing. However, I tested the site with over 50 bets and I didn't see any irregularity in the site. They reveal the upcoming server seed's hash before we set the client seed (which is a good thing). I tested the results using my custom script and everything is in order. The server seed hash didn't change for me post-reveal.When we saw the difference it was also a shock for us, Assuming OP is honest. I do not see why should he be making up an story unless he lost too much money with them, they had a profile with us and OP wanted to ruin their reputation.It's possible that the casino is selectively changing the seed (Everything are saved in a same server, right?). When a user is winning big or winning good money maybe they are then changing the seed so that they do not need to pay the player.There are review sites and there must be other people who have experienced the same before. Have we checked them yet?stop suporting scammers. the site is rigged",

Unfortunately, he has been inactive for the past 1 year.That user also has not logged into the forum since April of last year as well as also carries a -3 trust score from my view. I doubt he cares if he gets anymore tags as it looks like they have abandoned the account.Well, after some very long time, he logged in recently (9/7/2023 4:26:44 PM) and made an announcement after cryptoplay which was a self moderated thread. Members tried to comment in it, and he deleted all the replies and closed the thread after a few hoursArchive - https://ninjastic.space/topic/5466020I wonder what he was trying to do.",

The team didn't know anything about his reputation here as they weren't very familiar with the forum. Later they received a few responses in telegram after the ANN was published which forced them to cancel the deal with that user. I was in discussuin with them for few days.",
