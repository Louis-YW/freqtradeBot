Anyways this is cool,  and primary investment principles,  but more also when you talking about investment,  after the theoretical framework for your investment you also need technical analysis of the market most especially in altcoin,  technicality like when the right liquidity to consider as an investment tool most especially in unready listed coins on the exchange. But if you are not good at reading chart histories of the various projects due to high volatility in altcoins,  I suggest you stick to less volatile and less risky assets like bitcoin to minimize your risk of losing.",

This is only advisable if the potential income is greater than the interest rate to cover the debt and eaen at the same time. On crypto investments, debts is indeed crucial and subjective due to the volatility of the market. It’s a high risk high reward since you can pay your debt and get huge profit if you invest on the right time and right coin such as Bitcoin.A one time bull run can give you sufficient profit to cover interests rate and even the loan amount itself.",

Your post is on investment guide or advise so I will add that it is very important for an investor to have a full knowledge of the project to invest on. Don't rush for project that is new in the market. Those that are new have not tasted the heat in the market and may not survive if they are not good project. That means if they don't survive, you have lost your money. You also have to take note of how much you want to risk in investment, your risk appetite should not be of greed but of reasonable possibilities of return on your investment. Invest moderately and gradually build your confidence.",

But I want to point something out here is: If you want to invest in cryptocurrency then you have to understand or distinguish which type of investing you should do. Whether it's Holding or Trading. Because both have different strategies and different outcomes too. In fact in both types, you have to choose only one or diversify your portfolio for better gain. For a newbie, I suggest they should start their trading sessions in BTC only because BTC is less risky and less volatile and provide the best outcomes compared to alts.But still, according to your name I think you prefer to trade in alts or I should say you want to diversify your portfolio for best outcomes but let me tell you something what I you do know this token or coin will never bankrupt of run away with all of user's money then why risking your assets in the names of diversify to invest on different ALTs which could go bankrupt.",

Evaluate your financial situation: Evaluate your current financial situation, including your income, expenses, debts, and savings. Determine how much you can invest without affecting your other financial obligations.To me, the amount that a beginner should use depends mainly on their source of income. Because if you think of it, using or starting an investment with $50 for someone that earns $80 is not fixable and aside the income their monthly expenses should also be considered. After all one should invest what he or she can afford to lose so if a beginner decides to DCA $50 on a monthly basis when his income his around $80 dollars with time he’ll find himself need that money that he has invested and since we’re dealing with crypto you never can tell what the current price might be at that time. And again, for beginners I’ll advise that they should focus more on bitcoin. Dealing with altcoin as a newbie with no experience is more like gambling with a very high probability of you falling for a scam project. So they should buy more bitcoin and if at all they want to diversify their portfolio then they can do so just little amount of altcoin and when they become better at analysing a project then heheh can start increasing their altcoin allocation.",

Holding Bitcoins with some good amount of money can be the best thing.A beginner should usually be exposed to the benefits first to get them motivated. Now I see a lot of newbies getting into crypto because of FOMO and they get stuck in scam coins or worthless meme coins later on.It is clear that bitcoin is the recommendation that I always say. If we can hold it firmly then believe that it will bring us profit. The strategy used will also vary, but what I do is with the DCA strategy.The problem I often hear is that those from beginners sometimes say they don't have that much money to buy bitcoin, they think buying bitcoin should be according to the current price (buying 1 coin right away), but that's not true at all.",

However, a general rule that you should apply so you have no regrets is to only invest what you can afford to lose, as the cryptocurrency market can be very volatile which can lead to sudden big profits and big losses.Do it to the best of your ability once you've prioritized your essential needs. If you do it periodically when you have extra cash to accumulate, and in the long term you will definitely get a good return if you have the patience and firm belief to wait for the right time to sell it.",

Altcoins like ETH are no doubt, because they are always side by side with Bitcoin, always following the price of Bitcoin and even ETH also reached its latest ATH.

Continued buying will gradually multiply assets and further increase profits. That will grow the best profits. Do not have to force it, as beginners just use the money they have for investment and do it regularly, it will be a good opportunity.",
