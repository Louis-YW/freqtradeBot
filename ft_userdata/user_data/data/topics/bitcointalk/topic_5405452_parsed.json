  "content": "I have read a few posts on here but I havent seen my exact scenario answered, however if I missed it please lmk as I would hate to waste people's time repeating stuff!   My current situation: -Live in a small condo with available circuits 110V/20A  -I purchased 4 Goldshell Boxes and 1 Goldshell CK-Lite miner --2 KD-Box Pros @230W/each (https://www.goldshell.com/product/kdbox-pro/) --2 CK-Box @215W/each (https://www.goldshell.com/product/ckbox-2/) --1 CK-Lite @1200W (https://www.goldshell.com/product/cklite/)   My current plan is to run the 4 box miners on one 110V/20A circuit and my 1 Lite miner on another 110V/20A circuit   Total power to run on circuit: 230W, 230W, 215W, 215W = 890W So, per my understanding the circuit can handle: 110V x 20A = 2200W x 80% rule = 1760W So, should be good?  Total power to run on circuit: 1200W  So, per my understanding again the circuit can handle: 110V x 20A = 2200W x 80% rule = 1760W So, should be good?  My box miners are going to be powered by 2 of the following 750W PSU (1 PSU per 2 box miners) -Breakout Board Power Supply Kit for 12V DIY Projects: LED Lights & More (parallelminer.com) And I planned on plugging my CK-Lite miner and the PSUs running the box miners each into one of these PDU/surge protectors (so purchase total of 2 these strips) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00077INZU?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1  So, some questions I have are as follows: 1.) If the PDU I linked is 15A, and is going into a 110V outlet (15A x 110V = 1650W), is that sufficient for my Lite-Miner since it is only 1200W?  2.) Would this same PDU therefore be sufficient to plug my 2 PSUs into that are running my 4 Box miners? Would I calculate this off the power of the 4 box miners (890W) or the 2 PSUs (1500W)? And should it be fine either way? 3.) Also, the amazon link provided also sells a 20A version with PDU/surge protection, however the 20A uses a NEMA 5-20P plug. Would this work better for my 110V outlets bc it would protect devices at a higher total Watts? (20A x 110V = 2200W) 4.) Can I even use the 15A version of the PDU, if the circuit is 20A? Or do those need to match up? 5.) I have read before that if it is a 20A circuit that you don’t even need a PDU for protection, is there any truth to this? 6.) And is surge protection from the amazon link good enough at 1800 J? Thanks in advance for any insight you can give on this!",
