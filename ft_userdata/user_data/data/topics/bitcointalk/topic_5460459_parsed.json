We do have P2P on many sites but yes KYC is the basic criteria almost everywhere, also I don't know about the amount but anything above 2 Lac in an unknown account through Google Pay can also be flagged by IT Department. Also you can't do it with a foreigner because sending payment would be diffcult. Tough case man",

As of now, @pawanjain is the only candidate willing to go ahead with this since their thread pointed out to a possible solution to this specific issue but other than that I can't find someone who is trusted enough.If not, you need to go through the various hassles of providing your KYC to centralized exchanges such as Binance for conducting P2P transactions. Bisq can be another possible solution but the amount of people using them is likely very low and you can never find a seller soon enough for you to finish off your trade. Try contacting @pawanjain and see if they are willing to do the trade.",

In all case if he agrees then he won't be looking for small transaction. I am not sure what amount of INR purchase of cryptocurrency is OP looking for but it should be a big amount as small amount of P2P purchase will not help the selling party. OP should send a DM to pawanjain to check whether he would be intrested in a trade.",
