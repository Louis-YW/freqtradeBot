Binance stated that the LUNA/BUSD, LUNA/USDT, LUNA/BTC, LUNA/ETH, LUNA/UST token pairs were removed and terminated after the price dropped 99%.Many investors were surprised and did not expect that the delisting would be carried out so suddenly. However, Binance said this step needs to be done so that investors can avoid even greater losses.What do you think, can Luna still live again?!",

This is a perfect politically correct statement. Now you can not talk negative about CZ at all. He has taken what he thought was right. I am really sorry for the losers who are directly helping these pump and dump shitcoin inventors to make their money.",

However, for now the Binance exchange has re-listed LUNA, but it is still not certain if it will recover in the near future because the market is still not supportive of any recovery at this time so it is only natural that for now there are still investors who are disappointed because they have been harmed by decrease in the price of LUNA in the market.",

This is a big shame for binance and CZ was suggesting luna to did buy and burn mechanism but who was the guy that stupid enough to buy the hyper inflation coin like that? this mechanism will make only people who bought at the dip become the next millionaires and those who invested before the hacker will still lose their money.

As a small time buyer like me, I think it is still good to have some LUNA because there's still a chance for them to rise and I believe  CZ will help them on this and possible will give more advices so they can rise again. The coming days will be more crucial for LUNA and let's see if they can recover from this or will declare a bankrupt later on.",

If you bought when it was relisted you would of made crazy money.Only reason I can think is because they stopped the chain and the supply increase was capped. Before it went from like 100M coins to like over a trillion and hence why so many zeros in its price.Even if you bought at 1 cent you would be down big since it reached a low of $0.000005 or something similar.",

I don't know if you can find out for yourself and verify the information spread on social media. I am also quite skeptical about the information that other people mention and share, but the truth is that this happened in the locality where I live. Sharing with you about the person I know of, he hanged himself, and neighbors discovered his body when he couldn't be contacted and discovered the smell of corpses wafting around. And I know it's not only happening in my country because in the past few days I have also read information about suicides related to their having lost all their assets from investing groups and KOL. I think this is true because the amount of money is very large and with ordinary income I am thinking it is almost the property they have accumulated in a lifetime. And can you understand that feeling if you put yourself in their position? I personally have felt that this life is difficult, but the problem of money and material things never makes me think it will decide mind \"life or die\" because this life can control them.",

Those who buy when LUNA is re-listed are indeed very big because I see prices going up thousands of percent, of course those who buy at the base price can earn 100x more, but the fact is that with the increase it doesn't give anything to early investors who buy high prices, which for maybe a little but what is stuck in the current price is much bigger than I expected.Actually there are a lot of conspiracies about the luna problem who don't know what actually happened about the price dropping so deep 99% even though they will fix this it won't work 100% in my opinion.",
