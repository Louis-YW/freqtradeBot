Thanks Sir, however, i do not need any guide as what is required is what is stated above. That is the procedure needed.  If Trade is Bank to Bank then there is nothing else to verify. Seller's bank communicate with buyer's bank. It is just as simple as that. Yes there are other procedure but for this, the procedure remains this way.Thanks again",

The problem is that you want to buy half a million Bitcoins, or at least it seems so from what you wrote - that's why I asked you to clarify if you mean maybe 500 000 satoshis or maybe 500 BTC? If you still insist on buying half a million Bitcoins, then calculate for me how much money is needed for that and why do you think that anyone on this forum could have so many Bitcoins?As far as I know, only one crypto exchange had a larger amount than that in their possession, and that's because they keep it for their clients.",

So you are already admitting that you are guilty since you are not defending yourself properly. Assuming that you are a legit buyer, How the heck you will transfer money to your customer if the transaction is bank to bank and also who will send first because the amount of Bitcoin that you are looking is greater than the current total holdings of microstrategy.

      "body": "That is where you might have gotten it wrong. But first like my clarify, then i need 500,000 BTC and that was what i means not 500,000 satoshi. Of course, if i did not make another post, does not mean i have not gotten the first one posted years Months back. It does not need to wait.  You may think that no one here has it one the entire company does not have it. Am over 10 years in crypto as to source for what i needed has never become a problem. Remember i needed 500,0000?  Now i am selling. Tomorrow i will need. The quantity require for purchase and for sale depends on my source and post. In both cases, you will find me but let me tell you something more. The fact that i seek 500,000 BTC pieces does not mean it has to be in one tranche but you are been told that even if you have up to that, buyers are capable of procuring. Never make a mistake of thinking no one has. You can only know from whoever speaks up.As every order does not mean it is for an individual, every offer is not necessarily for an individual.It pains when people get worried for thing that don't concern them actually. See many calling others ripper as if they even had a business before.Quote from: Lucius on October 01, 2022, 12:12:46 PMQuote from: bitcointradeagent on September 30, 2022, 10:01:13 AMwhat exactly is the problem with the post?What i posted is what i do and that is it, if it is a treat to anyone due to hatred thereby hitting on negative score, that is their problem not mine.

Besides, what's stopping you @OP from buying with an exchange or perhaps, buy from sites like buy.bitcoin.com. Oh I get, your a middle man and as such, you wish or hope to act as an escrow to this transaction with hope of getting some percentage from the trade. Good enough, you've got zero reputation and hope anyone would be willing to deal with you with as low as 0.000001sat. You cant get that from this forum man, those who has the sort of volume your requesting definitely knows better than to deal this way.",
