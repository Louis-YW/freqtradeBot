  "content": "It is laughable how these scammers are so shallow minded. They think people are not informed to know what is obtainable in the Crypto industry. Although some newbies still fall for their trap but I think this trick does not have achievable attempt on me.This mail was sent at the early hours of the day from scammers because I know for sure that trust wallet can not stoop so low to demarket their products in such a demeaning way. If you read through you would discover that there is a link provided by the scammers which I suspected it to be a phishing link to get access to wallet or possibly requesting for key phrase too and I was wondering when trust wallet began to do wallet verification otherwise wallet be suspended. So far to the best of my knowledge, third party wallets are just service providers and have no right to request for verification purposes otherwise they might be dumped by their users. If any wallet ask you for KYC then it means that they are not serious for business or they are scammers in disguise.Be careful how you click links of such nature in your mailbox so as to avoid hearing stories that touches the heart.",

Because among these thousands of email recipients, there will be some crypto users who have no idea about such scams, so there is a high possibility that they may fall prey to these scammers. So it is important for everyone to be careful here, otherwise mistakes can be made many times without your knowledge. You have done well by creating this thread with the warning, those who are inexperienced new crypto users will be warned after reading this thread, it is helpful for them.",

I remembered when i was newbie I opened phising Metamask website and putted my phrase key then after doing multiple attempt to open wallet i recognize it's that its phising attempt. Scammers doing different tracks to cheat. some tricks are easy recognized like mail, telegram dm while some malware attempt are not easy to recognize and hackers got access to our wallet. These attempts are made through games, software and when we download it from unknown sites , malware leak our personal data.In online work we have to be smart enough and shouldn't allow scammers to break security.

Possibly, some one must have been monitoring your wallet address or possibly the attack sent in form of nft has a dust effect on wallets that triggers transactions waiting for the wallet owner to approve of it.I think you moving your assets out from that wallet was the best  smart option taken so as to protect your funds from being stolen. If you read that thread, you will find out that the nft is definitely a dust attack on wallets so it will be in a good idea one who received such do the needful gbby transferring away their assets from the corrupted wallet before the unexplainable happens.",

When you are giving out emails to third-party service providers make sure it is not your primary email or phone number. Having a casual mail or phone number for such registration and transactions will be the best option to avoid attacks on your main accounts. I have seen people lose money because they exposed their main emails to exchanges and their email was hacked when hackers had access to the exchange.",

So I do not think trust wallet could send such a message.  Right from the time I first saw the mail I knew it was a Scam attempt and as you have said, it might not be far from the truth as I have been receiving unsolicited messages in various languages all in my junk box including this one I uploaded here for view. It is possible that there is a data hack somewhere which might have revealed information or details of clients registered with such organization.It is so dissappointing to see such a thing happening and the organizations seems not to care about it by informing their clients of the hack while advising them to be on a high alert if they keep receiving unsolicited messages from scammers or elsewhere. Maybe they are afraid of legal actions for the reasons being that data got hacked as a result of their carelessness.",

If any wallet ask you for KYC then it means that they are not serious for business or they are scammers in disguise.Well, there is actually a non custodial wallet that does request their users verify their wallet addresses, how they implemented it is that, when you request for that your address be verified from the app wallet, they will connect your address to a third party verification partner which will also connect your address to their partner centralized exchange, if you are already verified on that exchange, then your address will be automatically verified, you will be returned back to your wallet with a message that your address is now verified.But if you have not passed KYC verification on their partner exchange, then the exchange will ask for your documents and every other required information for the verification, once you submit the requested documents and get verified on the exchanged, your address on the non custodial wallet will also get a verified badge automatically.. The verification is very optional though, its not mandatory at all, i think they implemented solely as a way to discourage fraud in between the wallet users..",
