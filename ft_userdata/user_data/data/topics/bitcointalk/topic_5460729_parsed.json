Was not expecting anyone to read this post, let alone a hero member like you. Thank you for taking the time on reading it and pointing out the issues on this post - this is greatly appreciated! I believe the moderator has moved it to its proper category. I totally agree with you that over the past few years, coins with such claims have come and gone, it is for that reason that we created PVC Crypto. We just like most cryptocurrency enthusiast are tired of such events so instead of putting our trust in another unknown coin we decided to create our own unknown coin. We started mining bitcoin back in 2017 and due to our nature we did not purchase any coins we want to earn it by running our own mining rigs, surprise surprise big mistake. My thought process was sure if bitcoin prices goes down I will still have my hardware I won't be saying that if I knew bitcoin will reach 60K. My goal here is not to convince you that PVCC PVC Crypto is any better or that we would succeed. One thing is for sure we know that we put our heart into this project since its first block back in July 2021 you may not see this block as we have gone to multiple iterations.I will address a couple of your concerns and then leave it at that, I will not convince you or to change your position on the matter I will simply state the facts, at least facts from my point of view.1. How come they are not on any exchange? For a while our development is private we actually have a private Facebook chat group while we are putting this project together, we made a lot of mistakes and we had to take down 3  versions of the project as of the date we are listed in a growing exchange https://xeggex.com/market/PVCC_USDT we have to Markets USDT and BNB and in talks with couple of other exchanges.2. Coins claimed to be backed by gold but they cannot sustain their presence on the market - Since the inception of PVCC PVC Crypto we allocated 3oz of gold on its Gold Reserve which translates to a coin backing value of $ 0.000000117834 This amount is only one zero more than Shiba Inu and this will grow year on year. To date, we have established a partnership with a farm that pledges 20% of its net profit for the purchase of PVCC PVC Crypto every harvest. This will simulate economic movement and drive demand for PVC Crypto. We are also putting together a Rice Wholesale where people can buy rice at a discount if they use PVCC PVC Crypto.3. 4 years based on one of of its blog  - According to historical data at Investing.com, Bitcoin's price never broke above $0.40 per bitcoin in 2010 but did manage to hit that level in early 2011. Then in February, it crossed $1. I admit we are not as good as the mighty satoshi nakamoto as a matter of fact this project is his project as it all stems back to his code. Furthermore this project has no employees and all its developers and early adopters/miners are all volunteers. We are not venture back nor have any investors at least not just yet.4. I consider this a dubious project, people beware of this project, even their founders profile are questionable. - I think it is interesting that a lot of cryptocurrency users, miners, or investors did not have any issue supporting a project whose leadership's whole existence is still in question until now. The reason is the code - our code is public just like every other cryptocurrency, and as far as our gold backing it works in the same way as the Gold Standard if we stay true to our ideals of 1PVCC to 1mg of Gold and ensure that we have such reserve people may trust PVCC PVC Crypto (as of this writing we are in talks with gold storage services which will publish actual gold reserves). If we break that promise the market will lose confidence in PVCC PVC Crypto and will start dumping it.As I have stated before I do not wish to change your opinion regarding the matter I simply need to state my facts. If you feel there is something we should do to make the project better feel free to reach out at admin@pvccrypto.com and we will gladly look into it for consideration.
