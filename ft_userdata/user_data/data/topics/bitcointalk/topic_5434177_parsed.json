Now, once they control which people have cryptocurrencies, don't be surprised by later taxes or confiscation attempts.I understand that there will be people who will declare them out of fear, but those who do not declare them and take the minimum precautions will not be caught.

In Argentina, there is a large shadow market for cryptocurrencies, because there are 2 dollar rates: official and shadow.",

Interestingly, all cryptocurrencies held by citizens are subject to declaration, and this array will be taxed in the future. However, we have quite a few tokens in our wallets that have no value and are not traded anywhere. In any case, this may be at the time of filing the declaration. How will the tax be calculated and collected in this case?But in general, a tax of 1.5 to 2.5 percent of their price is very good. In this case, it is better to pay it and not worry in the future.",

Imagine, India has a tax rate of 30% on crypto assets. That's not a silver lining at all. Those taxes are not the same. India's 30% is a tax on profit, as high as it is, you only pay that if you made a profit, so you can still enjoy the remaining 70%.Argentina's tax is way worse, because it's a tax on holdings. Imagine buying BTC at say $60k (with the money you've already paid your income tax on), making 70% loss and than your government reaching for the 1%-2.5% (or even 10%) of whatever's left. And what's worse, it's not said whether it's some sort of one-time charge, so presumably it is a regular tax, which you'd be expected to pay every year. That's pretty sick.If there's any silver lining - it's the fact that it's only payable by a \"high earners\" (however is that defined). Standard move to prevent people from raising up and revolt. Rich (but not super-wealthy or influential people) have always been considered a fair game for governments. They don't have enough voting power, they're not numerous enough to riot and general population don't like them too much.",

He would have also realized that these guys can bribe the officials to not investigate them if they do not declare their assets in crypto or stocks.What he will now do is come up with a harsher policy to tax the rich and elites who are hiding their funds. That will mean he would need to implement a regulation around it. Seeking reforms using policies and regulations never works unless you handle corruption, he needs to first focus on that area of concern and then think about generating revenue through tax for his countryI looked at forecasts for Argentina, where experts promise inflation of 200-300% this year.

Argentina stands out as the only country in the region where the acquisition of digital dollars surpasses that of other cryptocurrencies by nearly five times.The report reveals that amidst economic turmoil, 60% of Argentine crypto purchases on Bitso were allocated to dollar-based stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, with just 13% of purchases dedicated to Bitcoin. This contrasts with Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico, where stablecoin purchases ranged between 31% and 40% of total crypto acquisitions.Notably, these stablecoins emerged as some of the “fastest-growing” cryptocurrencies in the area. Bitso’s analysis reveals that approximately 26% of the average portfolio of users in Argentina comprises stablecoins, driven primarily by the country’s economic environment. Bitso attributes the significant demand for stablecoins in Argentina to the prevailing political and economic context, where citizens seek alternatives to combat inflation and currency devaluation.\"",
