Searching this ~100 bit space is pretty much hopeless.Sadly, as Charles-Tim said, you will not be able to recover it.Sorry for your loss, take better care of your private key next time.Quote from: Turing0x on July 25, 2022, 09:53:11 PMwhat is the maximum WIF missing characters that can be recovered  ?There's no simple answer to this one, it depends on their location. If they're randomly distributed, then I would hazard a guess that the upper limit is somewhere around 10 missing characters (would still take a lot of compute power and time though).",

What do you have? Text file? How are you sure the rest of characters are correctly recovered? Do you miss beginning or end?If there would be less characters, but maybe randomly distributed, I would say my WifSolver could help: https://github.com/PawelGorny/WifSolverBecause you have many characters missing, if you lost the beginning you may use much faster version, build for GPU: https://github.com/PawelGorny/WifSolverCudaThat program would not work if you have your characters missing at the end. Then you should try to convert problem into simple brute-force tool like BitCrack.There is also 4th option. If you know public key (address has outgoing transaction) we may use Kangaroo, normal or modified for solving WIFs (https://github.com/PawelGorny/Kangaroo)Let me know if you need hep with any of tools, we will try to find the best approach.

      "body": "In a German coin forum a user has proven to be able to recover up to 20 missing characters from the end of a compressed WIF key in a rather short amount of time, but he always also needed the public key of the private key for fast success and somehow it's also restricted to P2PKH legacy addresses (he and his business friends seem to have a big GPU farm at disposal and some self-made software tools for such number or recovery crunching, no particular details regarding software tools and amount of GPUs used were disclosed). Uncompressed keys should work, too, but his claims were verified with compressed keys only.He offered that as a recovery service. I had many doubts, especially regarding compute time. Multiple challenges have been setup for this guy starting from 18-20 missing characters at the end of the WIF key which he solved in a shockingly low amount of time.I was really impressed.So if @Turing0x's case meets the constraints and he's desperate enough to give it a try. Disclaimer: I don't know the user from the German coin forum personally nor can I say anything how trustworthy he and his service offering actually in a real recovery case is when real coins are at stake. All I can say: multiple challenges with 18-20 missing characters from the end of a WIF key have been perfectly recovered. No errors in any of his solutions for the challenges.If @Turing0x is interested, I can try to contact that user and assist to establish communication. I have no business relation with that user.",

By default they work on specified range of private keys, which is easy to find having lost end of WIF. As I wrote in my post there is Kangaroo version modified by me which allows search in more complicated cases, when missing characters are in the middle or in the beginning. The fact if key is compressed or not, does not matter.",

If you have the public key then you don't need the address regardless of its type, since any address type can be derived from the public key.I don't know why a public address would be needed at all and I know that you can derive any address type from the public key. But it's not know what kind of software they use/have modified/tweaked as their recovery tool. As I'm not active in this private key finding game, I don't know the algorithms involved and why this and that might be needed.My knowledge is limited to some cornerstones, like (I might be wrong should I missunderstood some Bitcoin details):* a private key and the assoc. public key likely have a unique and singular relation* there are likely ~296 public addresses for every public key, simply due to the fact that the hash space is reduced by 96 bits when you take RIPEMD160(SHA256(public key))Anyway, I have no idea why that GPU farm recovery tool would have to fiddle with a public address at all. The main playground with missing characters aka bits of a private key and its public key should be the elliptic curve stuff. For a known public key any derived address type is known and fixed, there's no ambiguity on the path public key --> public address types.Only reason that comes up for me is that a recovery client might not know the public key as you usually don't have to deal with it. The recovery constraints for this case here imply address reuse as the public key must have been exposed on the blockchain by a previously spent UTXO from that address.",
