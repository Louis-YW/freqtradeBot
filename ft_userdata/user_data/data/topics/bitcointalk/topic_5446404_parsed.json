      "body": "In addition to what SamReomo has suggested above, check if you're pointing to the correct configuration file. Sometimes you just mess up with this, and it looks to a different data directory. If you're using the command line, add Code:--conf=/<your_directories_here>/bitcoin/bitcoin.confQuote from: SamReomo on April 04, 2023, 01:29:21 PMCheck for firewall rules: If you have a firewall configured on your system, it might be blocking the Tor or Bitcoind traffic. Make sure that you have allowed incoming and outgoing connections for Tor and Bitcoind.It's unlikely to be a firewall issue, unless the OP altered those rules. In all systems I've tested, Tor and Bitcoind work fine with default rules.",
