Altcoins have made people millions $$, coinmarketcap reports daily volume of trades to 20.000.000$. Total marketcap is 1.1Trillion USD$ as of writing.Gambling is gambling my friend. Obviously HODLing a fresh altcoin is stupid as fck.bcs of instability and frequent large dumpsBut trading is a good thing overall.",

I was trading before but I stopped along the way due to continuous excessive losses.",

This is the advantage on using small exchange like MEXC profitability wise for being first on tokens that is not discovered yet.Quote from: swiftxi on May 22, 2023, 01:06:01 PMIm sorry but trading an altcoin gambling ?

This project doesn’t have any future plans and you literally relying on luck here that someone will ape on useless meme coins.Also stop sharing referral link. That is not allowed here.",

Now if he is making profit from the strategy he is doing, he just repeats it until he gets a profit, that's how simple it is to understand.",

In terms of trading actually you can choose to go for decentralized exchange or centralized exchange it's all your choice, but I am always going to go for decentralized exchange to trade.

Trading an altcoins is not gambling per se if comparing it with visiting gambling sites and betting on casinos and matches, but people use to say it is gambling to let other people know how fast they can lose money because most altcoins are highly volatile.The meme coins that you mentioned, it is like you were just able to buy and the coins increased in price, not that you are actually good in trading and I will advice you to withdraw some of your money because I see you lucky because no good trader will advice anyone to be trading meme coins.",
