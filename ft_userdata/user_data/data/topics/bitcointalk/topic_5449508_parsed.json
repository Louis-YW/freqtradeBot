  "content": "Hey! new in the forum. Starting a new development and I'll be having lots of questions so I finally stopped lurkingÂ  I'd like to have different opinions on how the community sees investing in projects that are also backed or fundraising in conventional VC. I'm developing a project that bridges crypto with real assets and foreign investment, due to function and structure we can have those things separate:Conventional money > Conventional instruments > Conventional operationsCrypto > Own chain > Crypto operations > DAOOne of the warnings I read a lot is the risk of scam if the VCs get exclusive tokens, but in our case they would not, different paths. In fact the project is so young that funding it entirely with crypto is possible and desirable, but we can't go100% crypto operations due to regulation (and to give crypto investors the same perks and insurance a FDI investor would get). Real assets imply playing nice with local codes necessarily. Let me know your opinions and advise in this regard, thanks.",

      "body": "I regularly invest in any projects that are backed by at least a few big VC. My main criteria to invest in projects that are backed by some good VC like binance labs, coinbase ventures, and many more. I used it as bench mark caused by as long as the project backed by those VC and it will be possible for the token to be listed instantly on exchange site that was also a part of the vc itself. A project backed by so many good VCs = hype. As long as the tokens that owned by VC will be locked for the long term and im still having time to dumped on their ass. As a crypto user and i would prefer to invest in a project that is backed by crypto-related VC.",

      "body": "Thanks for your opinion is totally valid and I was overlooking that altogether, sadly all the funds were focused on AI when SVB got bank walked so conventional venture will be slow for a while. In our roadmap we had starting with crypto by then so it wasn't a big let down.When I refer to VC I'm talking more in the conventional sense, things like angel investors and conventional funds which don't usually touch crypto, like YC. There is a new wave of VC that includes crypto like BoF and Tecra. And then there is crypto investment in a VC format like Binance labs and all chain funds, unless they plan on sending a check that can be registered on my central bank (which they could because they are working together in a sandbox) it would not count as FDI. I did actually asked that to Binance on Twitter and they had no answer.Regarding the formers, what would be your and everyone's views?",
