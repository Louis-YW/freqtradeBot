He has not been active on here for a while but is on twitter. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3378495I was hoping for a response but as of now....nothing.Sealed Box:Opened with hot air gun showing no damage to the box / rip to open:Inside holograms:Removed with almost no damage, now that I know I could take it off without any damage.The stain was breakfast burrito grease on my fingers nothing else.The box was shrink-wrapped but as far as I can tell it's generic shrink wrap. Was waiting to test / setup the device till I heard back from them about this. I sent messages on Nov 18th and 19th, and have not heard.So for now I am just putting this out there.The device SEEMS secure, but if you can't be sure it's the device that is supposed to be in the box what's the point.-Dave",

I know you can't open Trezor wallet without destroying packaging, but scammers can easily clone this...especially in China I have gotten responses from him here and on Twitter before so I went with those for contact.I fully understand that boxes & packing can be faked. BUT, and this is just my opinion there is a difference between Dave getting in more or less on his 1st attempt while eating breakfast and a determined person getting into the box.Cards on the table, they are sold on Amazon, as of now anyone can order one take it out of the box, reseal the box and ship it back.Amazon does not check returns that closely and if you send it back with a did not want it goes back into stock, the next person winds up with an empty box.Now Keystone looks bad for something that could have been handled with a better glue and a security hologram that, to be blunt, didn't suck.I know all holograms are not secure see here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401502  but some are better then others and there are other ways of adding to security to them, even if it's just cutting them a bit so removing them at all is more difficult without damaging them.-Dave",

Both then opened with the void look like they were supposed to when pressed back on. Now that I know I am fairly confident I can do even better.Nothing is going to be perfect, I agree with the fact that with the cost spending a bit more on better glue and holograms is worth it.-Dave",

Next person, rips open a security tab, takes off 2 security holograms opens the inside pack and gets....a deck of cards or something similar to keep the feel and weight the same. Yeah, that is going to be a PR nightmare.2) Scammer builds a bunch of their own devices that don't require any of that. People who don't know turn it on go though the scammers setup and bad things happen.Nothing is ever going to be perfect, and I really don't expect them to. Once again as I said above a few extra pennies for better heat resistant glue and another few extra pennies for better holograms would help a lot.This is not going to fight supply chain issues. It from warehouse to customer issues. As I said here in the US at least they sell through Amazon AND if you order from their site they SHIP though Amazon.And we all know Amazon takes just about everything back and puts it back in the warehouse to be shipped out again.-Dave",

Yeah, that is going to be a PR nightmare. I have been thinking about that in the past as well. I sometimes order stuff online to have it delivered to my address (person to person), and the shipping company is obviously not going to check the content and verify it's what I ordered. Unless it's a trusted seller, you could end up with a brick in a box. Good luck proving that's what the other party sent and you aren't lying and faking it.Some people have suggested making a video of yourself opening the package. That's not a bad idea. At least you can prove the brick was inside when you opened it. Couriers in some countries allow the buyer to open the package in their presence. That's also a good way to go about it, especially for expensive items. If you open it, and there is a brick inside, the courier is a witness to it.

People who don't know turn it on go though the scammers setup and bad things happen. That's like the fake Ledger HWs that were sent to people following the data leak incident. A cautious person shouldn't fall for that. You ought to know where to go and verify the authenticity of the device and the instructions provided with it. If you are buying a Ledger, that's https://www.ledger.com/, not https://www.daves.fakeledger.com/. Getting phished is a serious problem, but you overcome it with knowledge, caution, and logic.",

Coldcard for example has the serial number on the secure bag, that they ship the device in. With that kind of security I feel pretty safe, even if you can fake anything with the right effort.Seems like a big problem to me that they sell trough amazon. Amazon is by far the last platform that you should trust with a secure device like this. To me it seems that with many mainstream hardware wallet brands it is more of a marketing now to be \"secure\" and their main focus is to sell as much devices as possible to people that have no clue about bitcoin. In any case chances will still be pretty low to get your coins stolen in comparison to a badly set up computer wallet.",

They have been in use in various industries for years with no issues. Still does not stop someone from printing their own bags.All of the security devices I have used for things other then BTC have come in destroy to open packing. Not saying it can't be faked or duplicated. But, if you are going to make it destroy to open, at least make sure the glue makes you destroy it.-Dave",

The situation is not quite standard and most likely there really were difficulties with finding and returning the package you canceled. After all, they also can't return the money until they make sure that the package has been returned to the sender. This is standard procedure and no reason to call them a scam. I'm not trying to defend and shield them, but show a little patience and perhaps the situation will clear up.

At the moment I have close to $200 of RAM missing since the company receiving it says they never got it and USPS has it delivered. So, I have been going in a loop. Did USPS scan it at the wrong address? Did it fall off the loading dock? Did the box get kicked behind some other box and until someone moves the other box it's never going to be found. USPS is washing their hands of it since they say it's delivered. And the company getting it is saying that until they scan it in it does not exist in their facility. I have been dealing with them for over a decade with no issues. So I trust them not to run with my stuff.So yeah, it's an issue, but when dealing with multiple points. Warehouse, drives, different companies it's what happens from time to time.If you can't deal with stuff like this happening every now and then you are going to have to stop ordering stuff online.Even now, I am online chatting with Amazon support about an order they messed up twice. It has taken so long to deal with this issue that I could have gone out and gotten a part time job and earned more then I paid for it and bought a new one locally......-Dave",

Or maybe you do work for a hardware wallet company (in secret...) ?The path to progress... yeah sure, you are going to ''improve'' and save earth by calling something a $100 scam without any proof. I work for hardware wallet company called dkbit98stone and I can sell you my latest hardware wallet that is best in the whole universe, but I will give you 10 models to chose and you can change your mind 20 times  I just don't like when people call something a scam because they want ultra fast premium royal service, and when they are changing their minds like wind blows.It's easy for me to call ledger hardware wallet a scam, but I never did that.Quote from: DaveF on January 07, 2023, 01:29:12 PMEven now, I am online chatting with Amazon support about an order they messed up twice. It has taken so long to deal with this issue that I could have gone out and gotten a part time job and earned more then I paid for it and bought a new one locally......Last time I had problem was when I ordered laptop battery.Seller didn't sent me correct tracking code, I waited more than Keystone buyer, they never replied to any of my questions, I never received battery, but I received full refund in the end.",
