Or Bitcoin is going to be a continuous process of digital currency.This means you're not yet acquainted to what bitcoin really is, the value you create with fiat is the same found with bitcoin and it acceptability, when we called it a currency and a decentralized one indeed, then it's a general medium of exchange anyone can adopt it's acceptance, though bitcoin is not acceptable in some countries but that doesn't deny the massive adoption it has and the trust people created in using it because it has great economical potentials and values than fiat, and when we talk about currency, only accept this that bitcoin is the only recognized cryptocurrency and will always be, you earn it, spend it, hold it and exchange it, bitcoin has cone to stay.Quote from: Onyeeze on February 09, 2023, 01:59:29 PMReferring Gold as a digital currency and others digital currencies that has being into existence before arrival of BitcoinGold is not a digital currency, it's an asset of investment that has been in use over a long time, bitcoin is both an asset and a currency, no other digital currency has been in use before bitcoin except for sone assets like gold and others.Quote from: Onyeeze on February 09, 2023, 01:59:29 PM their no longer existing and now Bitcoin has taken ground of other digital currencies.Bitcoin has not taken ground from others, it has always been the first digital currency and asset, others comes in after it which makes them a pirate copy of the first decentralized digital currency, also as a matter of fact, other digital currencies are centralized but bitcoin remains decentralized.Quote from: Onyeeze on February 09, 2023, 01:59:29 PMWill the technology of bitcoin continue in future time.Yes, base on what we have today and the future it has.",

      "body": "It has enough of a life span for you and your children's children to use it that should be enough because fiat does not have a infinite life span and will collapse. The only way btc will reach end of life is if people stop using it or if all btc is lost by forgetting private keys or sending to burner addresses. That would take 100 of years and there could be changes to the btc code to help with that if it becomes a problem. I say digital currencies have a longer life span then physical because you do not lose digital currencies in the same way that fiat currencies can be lost. I have lost many euros in my life time. What you are asking is hard to answer because no one knows what will be in the future but we can say that btc is designed to last many generations and future generations could come up with a solution if btc popularity or usage is decreasing. Gold might not be used as a currency forever it depends on what other precious metals we find. We find find new resources in space and gold becomes less popular as a way of storing wealth. We do not know what the future has planned we only know that btc will be around for a very long time. It is only gaining in popularity since it has been created.",

Bitcoin is now the digital gold but it now  equates store of value and so fast r, it has been doing very much alright. Based on technological innovation, I think there have never been any technology that can beat bitcoin in terms of digital finance. So far, to the best of my knowledge, bitcoin has surpassed the world largest market capitalization. Which means that bitcoin has created a strong digital market base so it would continue to exist as it takes the lead in the digital market and finance.",

We know Bitcoin will survive if it has some kind of use case... and currently it has several uses, for example :1. Cheaper remittance between countries. 2. Cheaper transactions compared to traditional Fiat systems. (Bitcoin Lightning Network)3. Pseudo anonymous money4. Trading as an commodity. (like forex trading)5. Sore of value and a possible counter against hyper inflation in many countries. 6. Unrestricted transfer of wealth. These are just some of the use cases for Bitcoin, but there are loads more... so while this is the case, it will exist and it will be used.",

Miners have nothing to do with the life span of btc instead it is people using it as a currency. ASICS would not exist if the difficulty was low enough we only have them now because we have a lot of people mining and the competition is high.",

Bitcoin is software, there's nothing truly permanent about it, because software can change. In Bitcoin changes that are incompatible with existing rules would cause a network split between old and new versions, but if majority of users supports some change, the smaller chain might eventually die.I can imagine that in some distant future bitcoiners will decide to destroy coins that are inactive for too long to make Bitcoin even more deflationary.

You don't need to keep pondering on what could be the long time effect of outcome of Bitcoin anymore.

BTC is a code on the computer that a holder has control over it, no one can destroy, control, or even make BTC vanish. It is on the people if they will stop accepting BTC. The fixed total supply of BTC will make the price goes up and down, no one can break the code and even change the protocol of BTC, that is why there are many forks of BTC that are created but they are not the same as BTC.",
