  "content": "I use profit percentage as my restriction to not overplay too much. I usually set 100% of my initial deposit as target profit before I stop gambling. Sometimes my bankroll got busted before I hit that target which means I need to stop gambling for the day and move on for tomorrow. I use this method after suffering a huge loss by just chasing more profit even though I already gain so much money. I admit that I don’t have satisfaction on just winning because I don’t have limit goal before.Now, I manage to play in moderate way and increase my profit in general because I already control myself on when to take profit and stop gambling for good. Are you using using same method on limiting your gambling crave? What’s your percentage goal?",

Are you using using same method on limiting your gambling crave? What’s your percentage goal?My profit percentage is kind of similar to yours. I aim for 2x or 100%. Sometimes I get more than this and many times I go busted.But whenever I am in profits I make sure to have got at least 100% and more after which I quit gambling for the day.",

I am not saying someone should go for low odd, but where my prediction went today.",

Are you using using same method on limiting your gambling crave? What’s your percentage goal?I focus on a profit range of x3-x5. If you take a higher multiplier, then the winnings will be too rare. If you take lower multipliers, for example x2, then it will be too stupid and sad for me, because one day winning 100% of the budget and losing the same 100% the other day, I will lose all the money without any interest due to the bookmaker's margin/casino. This is true for other multipliers (house edge) but it is much more fun to get x3-x5 at least sometimes than the maximum x2.",

I think many people has same as OP preference on gambling session to control there expenses but you will never enjoy your gambling experience if you are limiting yourself. It’s better to not deposit an amount that you can’t afford to lose to avoid this kind of commitment.",

Not that it has mattered for me, since after some days doing that I entered the loss field anyway. Some people adopt a bankroll management strategy to recover losses and revert the situation. They try making 5%-10% of total bankroll in a daily basis. If they make the goal percentage they are done for that day and if they lose the goal percentage they stop as well and come back next day until they reach the final goal or until they go completely busted. I was following a youtube channel where the youtuber was doing this consistently and responsively, but I confess I've lost the will to keep following this content due to my personal losses in gambling.",

Not that it has mattered for me, since after some days doing that I entered the loss field anyway. Funny how this situation is too relatable to any gamblers out there. We all know that our luck will always run out so whenever we encounter a win streak, we tend to be hesitant whether we continue gambling or stop. My strategy when this situation arises is to stop when I lose 2 to 3 times consecutively to avoid losing all my winnings. I tried not stopping before and try to continue despite the continuous lose streak and end up losing all my winnings and my bankroll.",

I agree that sometimes you win 100% and sometimes you lose, but whatever the upper limit is you're good as long as you keep the lower limit similar. So one day you win 100% but the next day you start with half of your total money, meaning that you play only with the starting money and withdraw the profit. If you lose you're back at the starting point, not at a loss. This method also works for other limits like 50% win - withdrawal, 50% loss, and you are still left with the money you came with.",

Given the risks and nature of gambling, one single game can either make/break my whole profit situation where there is that potential of continuously betting.I answered that my gambling profit percentage limit is below 50%. I do not mind having a low profit but the fact that won and my initial gambling money is higher when I first entered the casino, I consider that as a win on my book. Maybe it is also because I view gambling as a means of potentially earning money, not as a means of entertainment.",

When you download the bet application on your phone and do your registration and funding of account then you are bound to keep playing when you lose, you rebet because you want to recover. So this has not worked for me as I find it difficult to control over betting in a day until I had to delete the app before I can be able to control that. Now playing manually from the game house is a little controllable than online and I set some limit to play .",
