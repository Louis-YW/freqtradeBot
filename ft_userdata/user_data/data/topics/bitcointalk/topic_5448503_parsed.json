Let him know that addcits are not adviced to reduce the amount of money they are gambling with, that addicts should stop gambling and go for self exclusion. You know more than him about gambling is the truth, you can get some news about what ended the life of some addicts and how chasing money with gambling will only lead to depression, thievery or illegal acts. If trustworthy, tell him how you trust him, but that you are just saying how gambling addiction is not good at all.",

As a friend what you can do is to talk him and his family and probably knock the sense out of him. Actually that's up into him if he really wanted to change for the sake of his family because after all even if you do all of the possible things to help him and he can't help himself or trying to help himself, you are just wasting time.",

If your answer to the question is NO then I think you shouldn't put the burden on yourself when that friend of yours became a gambling addict. The only instance that I think you should also take the blame is if you forced him or hyped him too much without giving him any warning.",

Unfortunately many of us become addicted to, maybe there are individuals here who got out of their addiction because someone help him or it is ourselves who says that we need to stop gambling already.And even if says that he should stop gambling, then how will you know that he will listen to you?Maybe you can talk him out of quitting or at least lessen his gambling, but that is the only thing that you can do.",

Not because you do want to help, you'd already provide the help; think of the consequences. It is never advisable to support an individual in gambling because of the risks involved. But no matter what, and if the cited situation is true, be a friend to him. Help him morally to regain atleast his mental state. Also, try to accompany him with other activity not involving risk and money such as sports and the likes to somehow calibrate his drive to gamble. Also, do not blame yourself for everything because that's his decision in the first place. It is solely dependent with the gambler on how would he end up after playing; broke, victorious, or just fine.  Lastly, seek for professional help becaause addiction is not something to be cured in an instant and with ease.",

You can continuously remind him about controlling his compulsive gambling since you're friends but his choices and decisions will rely on the risks that he could take.
