  "content": "Hi guys!I am proud to announce that our small team is almost finished with the development of a silent, tiny, powerful, energy efficient, Mac mini-sized Bitcoin miner - Moon Miner! Ideal for striking Crypto Gold in Solo Mining or just for experiments with Bitcoin.We are planning to start manufacturing two variants, with the same design / power consumption but different hashrate (and power efficiency).Moon Miner v1: Power consumption: up to 300W on the wallHashrate: up to 4 TH/sSize: Mac mini-sized devicePrice: TBDMoon Miner v2:Power consumption: up to 300W on the wallHashrate: up to 8 TH/sSize: Mac mini-sized devicePrice: TBDWe are finalizing the designs, and hope to provide photos/logs from real devices within ~1 month.Please feel free to ask any questions you might have in the thread below or via email hello@moonlabs.company.Welcome to our website https://moonlabs.company where you can join our mailing list for the product launch announcement.",

Note that it says Mac Mini size but it's 200mm x 90mm x 140mm so, I guess it will be 14 cm in height, unlike the mini who is flatter and wider, probably because of the fan. Without being an expert I would say it's doable, the noise...that is something else.",

The Apollo uses Bitfury chips.I highly doubt they could have come up with the >8million $ it costs for the litho masks alone much less design costs + Foundry production costs to roll their own.",
