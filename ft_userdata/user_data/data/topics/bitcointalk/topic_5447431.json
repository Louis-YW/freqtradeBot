How much can you really going to get from a dug addicted gambler?-DAveI do not want to start a discussion here, so please do not take this post as opportunity to discuss \"punishment\", however, my understanding on option C is rather a criminal proceeding (resulting in imprisonment what in my jurisdiction is a penalty for theft) than a tort litigation. from yogg, we will never see a single satoshi again.and now, back to the poll I like the idea of option C, but you're right, going after him in order to hold him accountable for the funds he stole in trying to sue him, isn't going to go anywhere.  I've had renters take off without paying the final months rent and stuff like that..and spoken with lawyers about how to go after them , and they've all simply told me it would unfortunately be a waste of time and money since I knew they likely didn't have any.What’s the old saying, you can’t squeeze wine from a stone, or something like that. I do think going after him legally, as in being arrested/spending time in jail, and potentially being prosecuted by whatever governing body who would do such a thing where he lives in France would be a good thing.  You wouldn't have to spend any money of course for this option too. Trying to get governments to act of course is the potential hold up here (we all know how true this can be with the Titan mess going on).I suppose I'm going with options B as well.",

I have his address, his last phone number and I know he's broke as hell... So yeah suing him is pointless. Jail sounds better. he's a real pussy anyhow, he couldn't even stand 1 hour where I live in the USA FFS, he has it so nice in Rouen...  Edit - I have tried to do this, but nobody wants to be involved whom I know that speaks Francais....",
