If this happens and Ethereum becomes a better target for institutional then it is finished, many altcoins depends on Ethereum but the whole market depends on BTC, what do you think will happen Yes you're. I didn't even see ethereum was starting to leave from bitcoin's domination. You must also aware if the chart is looks very similar between one to the each other. Decoupling bitcoin was not easy. I think that you are judging it too early. You shall take a look at the chart between both again. Ethereum was still following bitcoin anytime. There's no reason for it to decouple from bitcoin. At least not for this time but anything can happen in the future.",

Just because it will change to POS doesn't necessarily mean it will not be affected by the Bitcoin price. We have many POS in the market, remember that and they are not as dominant as Bitcoin nor Ethereum. I want to see the logic behind this claim but if it does happen then I would be also joyful about it since I have been an Ethereum fan for ages.",

Both trying to recovering but not in comfort zone till now. Today both coin make red candle that showing the dependency on each other. Coin circulation of ETH is much more than BTC.

Let's be guided as we look forward to what ethereum has for the industry. Perhaps this is the case, but it's going to be short term though. Maybe there are news about ETH protocol change. Yes, it's a big chance, however, I'm seeing ETH taking over, BTC will continue to remain on top. Back in 2017, (for those who have been here already), there is this so called \"Flippening\",Â  when BTC was about $1k-$3k price and ETH was about to break the $1k barrier. But in didn't happen as BTC remain the dominate coin.",

Bitcoin is a true pioneer of the crypto market and the current market dynamics is very much dependent on bitcoin itself. ETH has a long way to go and with its ongoing transaction fees, ETH can never become a market leader. We may start seeing some institutional interest on ETH once it moves to POS algorithm which may increase its price. But when comes to driving the market, ETH is still too small!",

For that, I don't know if that which you're speculating will ever happen because for a very long time ETH has shown itself useful as a smart contract with massive utility, yet its price hasn't measured up to what benefits it presents to the crypto industry. Sadly, there are new projects coming out with their own blockchain and smart contracts and that's beginning to split the strength of Ethereum through competitiveness. If we go by what utilities Eth has for this industry, its price ought to be as high as what Bitcoin is now or even higher than that.",

Well that's fine and we are happy for it. I think this because of the upcoming updates on eth. Btc can still catch up soon and it can leave eth behind once bull run returns.QuoteEthereum becomes a better target for institutional then it is finished,On this part, im not sure if you mean they will invest on eth and prioritize it over btc or you mean they will put restrictions over btc? But either of the two, it is still fine. Like I said earlier. Btc can still catch up no matter what and if ever they put restrictions with eth, we stil have a btc. Also I don't think the restrictions will be permanent, same with that they did with btc before.",
