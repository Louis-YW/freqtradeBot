They always play really attractive football in bundesliga but never can win the title or be in top 3 teams and in champions league they are really bad.",

Leipzig is currently two goals down to Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich finest new signing Sadio Mane's name is on the score sheet. As the match is going, Bayern will likely get more goals because the likes of Muller haven't scored yet.So, the glory is going to Bayern Munich as that of the England Cup went to Liverpool today and I was a beautiful game.",

They should have done much better and they now need to bounce back fast once bundesliga starts.I was surprised that Elversberg could win Bayer Leverkusen, when Elversberg scored 4th goal already at 72nd minutes and Leverkusen only had 2 goals, people would have been predicting that the match could go wrong against Leverkusen. This season has not yet started, we do not know the full capability of each club, just a match against an underdog this way may go wrong, but not common though, we can see other clubs in Bundesliga winning but with odds that are not that encouraging.",

But how much value does the German Cup still have for Bayern? It's not a prize they really want, but I think they feel obligated to win all the national prizes. The battle for the cup is now completely open due to the loss of Bayern.",

Right now left four team in DFB Cup semifinal from Eintracht Frankfurt, SC Freiburg, RB Leipzig and VfB Stuttgart. Seems excited with VfB Stuttgart are bottom standing team in Bundesliga but success lead until semifinal stage and waiting will make another surprise will lead to final? Based on four teams have qualify to semifinal, seems RB Leipzig is more favorite team winning DFB Cup season 2022/2023 than Eintracht Frankfurt or SC Freiburg.",
