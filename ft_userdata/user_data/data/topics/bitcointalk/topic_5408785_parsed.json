Too bad mate that is a huge money and losing it without proper explanation is kinda frustrating. But you sure thats not really used on such dapp? Maybe you connected to other solana dapp which is also part of the hack method of hackers.",

There are few solana dexes out there and also one or two on solana wallets like slope and phantom wallet, there must have been a leak somewhere, I think right now we haven't gotten the exact 100% answer to where all the leakage comes from, with the look of things its going to take time.",

And the slope developers of their mobile are so stupid to used a centralized servers in sending mnemonic code in plain text.And there is where the hackers found the exploit, have access or hack the access of that sentry servers get all the mnemonic code and then siphon everything they can.All I can say is this is criminal negligence on their part.",

After the hack that happened there won't be many users who trust even back up with a new wallet that is transferred to another wallet. Slope is a fatal error because it does not carry out maintenance and scalable audits. If I see from their official statement on the medium that they are still actively diagnosing the lost user assets. Then from his official Twitter, he proposed negotiations with the hacks in order to return the assets that had been taken. Like giving up and not wanting to replace lost assets.Medium Source: https://slope-finance.medium.com/slopes-official-statement-regarding-the-breach-b964e70af0d6Twitter source: https://twitter.com/slope_finance/status/1555653747077877760",
