  "content": "December 15, 2017, in the world media news the first line is about the popularization of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin(BTC), the price of which was 17800 USD per crypto monad on 15.12.2017, all in anticipation of the launch of trading bitcoin futures on CME. In recent years we have heard many criticisms of eminent experts in the fields of economics, banking, cryptocurrencies, and all sorts of businessmen, tycoons, politicians, the prospects of cryptocurrency development. Despite this - most of the predictions never came true. Critics have sounded many, and not unreasonably, since there are traditional economic laws that are contrary to successful replacement of fiat money with cryptocurrency. However, we become witnesses and participants of the “economic miracle” of the 21st Century. The point of this article: forecast the future prospects of cryptocurrency development and replace the traditional, in particular, we will focus on the world leader in the cryptocurrency market - Bitcoin(BTC). Both criticism and exaggeration of the role of the cryptocurrency will leave to the “experts”, will describe only the publicly available facts are clear for all peoples.   So, the facts in figures: under the guidance of astrophysicist Greg Laughlin from the California University, were withdrawn more than 12 thousand planets, including Earth. The basis for the calculation of the cost of laying the following parameters: age, mass, temperature planets, mineral composition and other (17 parameters). The most basic affecting the cost is the suitability for human life. As a result of a number of complex calculations was calculated the approximate cost of the Land. The price was 5 quadrillion USD.    How much is it? A quadrillion is a thousand trillion. In comparison here are some data of the world economy:  1) Derivatives:  - the lower limit of the size and volume of the world market is about 630 trillion USD on the condition of contracts (futures, forwards, options, swaps, etc.). - upper limit is about 1.2 quadrillion USD (exact dates unknown). 2) The annual report of the Credit Suisse Research Institute titled Global Wealth Report 2016 the researchers analyze the dynamics of the world wealth and its distribution among the population. In 2016, the authors noted a moderate growth of global wealth, up to 256 trillion USD. 3) Global (global) the money supply is estimated at 80 trillion USD. But directly cash - equivalent of approximately 5 trillion USD. Only cash dollars in circulation (notes and coins) more than 1.5 trillion USD.  4) Another figure, also close to the nature of cryptocurrency, the market capitalization of world stock markets in October 2016, was $ 65.6 trillion USD, and also: the market for government debt securities (only one US national debt is nearly 20 trillion USD), corporate bonds and real estate. 5) The total world gold reserves is near 183 600 tones and it is over then 8 trillion USD (1250 USD /oz).   The separate issue is that to date there is no clear answer, yet, who is the founder/owner/controller/protégé of cryptocurrency Bitcoin(BTC), the answer is obvious, the United States, it is possible to trace the reaction of state institutions, very soft and restrained policy, don't you think? If some dictator, some small (or even large) countries decide to make their own decision in the matter distribution of hydrocarbons, it is immediately destroyed, removed, overthrown. Why Bitcoin(BTC), which provides a potential threat to the world reserve currency - the US dollar, quietly gaining momentum, without any severe restrictions by the US, on the contrary, allowed to exchange, write loyal draft law? The answer is obvious, it is a project of the United States, created fully support, with the aim of strengthening its economy and accordingly - world domination. This factor relate more to the positive aspect than negative. Of course, it is necessary to monitor the dynamics of the official US policy towards Bitcoin(BTC). A separate issue requiring detailed analysis.   Given the above data, as well as gaining momentum trends in the development of cryptocurrency market and its level of capitalization, the global economic investment attractiveness, we can predict the real potential of Bitcoin(BTC) in the coming years. If you make the assumption, quite reasonable that the cryptocurrency can substitute 5-10% of the global money supply, the potential value of cryptocurrencies can be estimated at 4 - 8 trillion USD (1.5 - 3% of global wealth). The share of the Bitcoin(BTC), in the total cryptocurrency market and will keep a leading position and to cover at least 50% of the capitalization of the market, respectively, the share of Bitcoin(BTC) will potentially have 2 to 4 trillion USD. Given the fact that the issue of Bitcoin(BTC) will not exceed 21 million coins, as well as the fact that in the near future 2018-2020, the turnover will be about 3/4 of the maximum scheduled amount of Bitcoin(BTC), the approximate potential value of 1 Bitcoin(BTC) will be in 2020 near 120 - 240 thousand USD. Maybe more, maybe less, depending on a number of factors, ranging from legal permissibility, further access to exchange, the possible large-scale international military escalation, speculative demand, and etc. If we assume the potential of cryptocurrencies in the amount of 5% of the “global wealth”, which is quite possible, given the accelerating pace of cryptanalytical economy, the potential cost of 1(one) Bitcoin(BTC) will amount to 400 thousand USD by 2020 year.    Superficially it is necessary to mention and other cryptocurrencies dividing them by class: - High class: like Bitcoin, Ethereum is very promising too.  - First class: Litecoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash.  - Second class: the rest of the TOP 20 market capitalization.  - Third grade: the outsiders of TOP 20, newcomers.   By the way, back to the speeches of leading world bankers and other experts on insecurities are the real assets of cryptocurrency is interesting, and what is achieved after the abolition in 1971 year of the “gold standard” a huge amount of dollars. The US, in an ever-increasing public debt, funded just on the basis of the pyramid, while the current interest is paid through the placement of new government bonds!? Or remember, what was rate and stable currency, the Soviet ruble, to USD in 1991 year, and how much savings lost population in the Soviet Bank!? To be continued... © Oleh Khoroshko, 2017.

HOWEVER, THE VALUE REMAIN THE SAME,120-240K IN 2022..The initial article is very hazy and difficult to understand due to the formatting and lack of clarity. Yet, I think you are speculating that Bitcoin has been made by the United States to gain some kind of \"control\" over world assets.Not that it matters really. When things are at this scale, it is virtually impossible to control anything. No matter what the conspiracy theorists think, it is pretty much impossible to govern the outcomes if you try to control EVERYTHING. The continued failure of US agencies to influence almost anything beyond little pieces of land as per their demands is proof of that. Just see how they were caught unawares by the Taliban in Afghanistan. This is because things happen way too randomly. Even if a nation state or a collection of secret agencies made bitcoin and crypto with some dreams of world domination, such things eventually become part of actual society and there are too many influences. Although, I pretty much agree with your price target for Bitcoin. What is exciting to see is that how will more of the value from the lower level cryptos will begin to move towards the secure bitcoin network.",

Please follow the dynamics and do not miss the last opportunity to purchase a highly liquid asset at an affordable price. The forecast for the next 2 years is to achieve a minimum level of 120K.Thanks everyone & see you soon!",
