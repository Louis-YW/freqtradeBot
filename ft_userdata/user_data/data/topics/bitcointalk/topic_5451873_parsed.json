Hope you don't mind sharing some links to the official website for this project and also, showing some white paper or road map for this development.",

Also, how does Verus PBaaS compare to other blockchain technologies in terms of transaction fees during periods of high network activity, such as during airdrops or ICOs?The network is actually extremely easy and simple to use, you can launch your own cocanour blockchain without any token or blockchain or even your own liquidity pool and so much more without any coding at all. Verus is a 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake blockchain. Attack ResistantTo successfully attack the Verus blockchain, more than 50% of the validation power is needed, called Chain Power. A 51% attack would require a combined value of over 50% of both the chain‚Äôs hashpower and its coin supply. For technical information on VerusPoP read the whitepaper (opens new window).VerusPoP provides a decentralizing effect on the network, incentivizing holders to keep nodes online to support the network. Even if a change in network hashrate happens, the PoW/PoS ratio stays the same: 50/50% READ MORE: https://docs.verus.io/overview/verus-proof-of-power.html------------------------------------------NO company:Verus is a decentralized public blockchain, a community driven project in the true spirit of Bitcoin. Anyone can participate and contribute, no matter who you are or where you come from.Fair LaunchVerus had a fair launch, meaning that everyone had, and still has equal opportunity to collect its currency through mining and staking. For Verus this means:No ICO has been heldNo founder or developer feesNo premineNo commercial interestsNo rent-seeking behavior--------------------------------------Transaction fees and high-volume is not a problem Verus is a fractal blockchain. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkgUVjx_g1M",
