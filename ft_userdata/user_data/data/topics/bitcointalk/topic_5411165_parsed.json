I can't find it in your provided images above. Posting more evidence here and reporting it to DTs will help to temporarily put neutral or negative trust in their account here on the forum.

      "body": "Looking at this now, you kind of hang in the balance as, OP can't unnecessarily compromising his or her Identity by sharing the details OP used in account creation or submitted for account verification on Fortunejack.com platform. The issue might practically arise from OP not using his or her actual details as on his or her documents in account registration but again, this is normal as, most users in the cryptospace are not into sending there actual details online during account creation. This could be the reason why, OP might have failed in account verification. But,Why should an account be regarded as \"full verify\" only to be said that it \"failed verification\", and blocked suddenly.On the contrary, \"fully verify\" might not translate to \"fully verified or verification successful\" as the later could simply be starting that, all necessarily details have been uploaded and is being processed.Just my thoughts but, its left for there support and account on the forum to state what's going g on thereAnd I'll also encourage OP to follow up with the support and forum representative with hopes of getting to the root of the issue and solve it if possible.",

      "body": "At this stage, I do not want to break the business of this bookmaker. I do not rule out that they mixed something up. But all my subsequent inquiries were answered very quickly and briefly. I had to write here on the forum.Are you asking me for proof? I only have email correspondence. It might prove something. My account is locked and I can't take screenshots of bets or chat conversations. I'm more hopeful that the bookmaker's representative can finally answer my questions...I will describe how it was:I made the usual bet long before the start of the match. Won. Asked to withdraw some of my money. Received a letter that the withdrawal of money is delayed. then I received a letter that in order to withdraw money I need to pass a KYC check. In the upper right corner of the screen, the button lights up - verify your account. I clicked on this button, they are asked to show proof of identity and confirm the face on the camera. I did it all. An inscription is displayed - verification is successful. In the upper right corner, the inscription changed to identification verified. I wrote to those support that passed your check and please give me my money. The next day I received a letter saying that I had not passed the KYC check and therefore my account was blocked! I ask - how is it, yesterday I received a message from your verification service that my account has been verified! Why are you refusing to give me my money??? to which they answered - that I did not pass the test and decide the final one and you can’t even write more about this!Further, all messages in the same form ...Today, apparently after the creation of this topic, I received a letter from them in which, apparently, as it seemed to them, they wrote a little more -https://prnt.sc/VlNaRKyOVrvXBut with this answer, everyone also leaves me at a loss ... What information did I provide incorrectly? Why is all my money being taken away from me?? I didn't provide any information at all! after checking the documents, all fields are filled in automatically! and even if something is filled in incorrectly, why are you immediately taking all my money? and not trying to solve this problem?",

Thanks for the update. I assume Drukkola will deny these allegations and keep insisting that his account was fully verified. Maybe that initial message when the player submits their documents should be changed not to say that identity verification was successful. I am not sure what exactly it says. Something like: your documents have been received. You will be informed about the status of your KYC as soon as possible. @Drukkola do you have anything to add and explain why you have two different identities?",

      "body": "Update regarding the case,We froze OP's account under the username 'Drukkola' 4 days ago, on the 22nd of August cause of the request of our payments team.As per the behaviors of our identification system, it automatically sends out KYC requests to the FJ accounts that tend to have a chance of having an unusual activity. So was the case for the OP.On the same day (22 August), the OP uploaded only the front and back sides of the ID to the system. Note to mention, to complete the standard KYC procedure, the account needs to upload, the front/back sides of the identification document and the selfie picture of the account owner. In this case, only the first one was completed and no selfie was submitted. As per system requirements, the KYC failed.After the first failure, Drukkola tried to complete the KYC the second time, but this time the user uploaded both front/back sides of the ID on top of the selfie but the violation part comes in place as the document he uploaded was different from the one he sent in the first try. Note to mention, that the new document the OP uploaded did match the selfie he sent on the second try. Cause of the fact that there was a match between the 'fake' ID and a selfie, the KYC system automatically gave out the notification of the successful compilation (Even though the submission process was successful, our Customer Support Department did notify the OP that the final decision letter comes after the part of the team reviewing the case).  According to our procedure, our Fraud and Prevention Department manually reviews the case after the successful submission of the documents. We did follow the guidelines and after finding out that there were different documents used in the first and the second attempt of the verification process, the corresponding account was terminated.FJ owns all the documents we mentioned above, including the IDs and a selfie of the account associated with the case. However, we don't have the legal right to publish it publicly without particular notice from the official entities or from the user himself agreeing to the fact of us doing it so.We think the case must be considered closed, as no proofs were provided from the username against us. If there's anything from us to add to the community to make all of this fair and transparent, we're more than welcome to do so.Tornike is also known as ampera.",
