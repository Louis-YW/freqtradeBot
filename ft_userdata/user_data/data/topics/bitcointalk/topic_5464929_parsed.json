      "body": "When you sell something, you should be more precise in some details, because otherwise it can lead to unpleasant situations. For example, here you claim that the account is \"unlimited\", but you state the following in the shop :Quote*30 days warranty. *account is for one person only. *Do not change account information. *Do not change the password. *Do not add or delete a profile. *Do not ask me refund or back your money read description After buy product. If you break the rules, your warranty will be voided.Which means that after 30 days you can refuse to extend the use of the service for any reason. Also, you are not selling an account here, you are selling the use of one profile within that account, which is a big difference. The price of $10 may be favorable for some, but for the same price I buy a completely legal Premium UHD account and use 4 profiles simultaneously on 4 different devices.In addition, in most countries you can no longer share profiles outside the household if you do not pay extra, or you cannot share them at all.",
