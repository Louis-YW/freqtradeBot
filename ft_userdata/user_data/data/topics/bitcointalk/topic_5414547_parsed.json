      "body": "Why bothering yourself when you can use Type A (computer) to Micro USB (phone) cable. According to the hardware wallet article:Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-nano-s-interface-first-look#:~:text=One%20screen%20and%20two%20buttons,inside%20a%20list%20of%20itemsThe Nano S can be powered on using any micro USB cable, connected on a charger or on any computer's port. It will immediately prompt you to a quick tutorial where you'll learn the following: left or right buttons are used to select a choice or to move inside a list of items.I do not think you should be bothered about this if not looking for a means to use USB stick to connect it with Android phone. I am not also certain if the USB stick it comes with it, but not included when I checked it on a store. You can as well also purchase OTG kit if you want to use it with Android: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-otg-kit.",

However, here it is: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s-plusIf you scroll down on that page, to what the package boxk contains, it tells it clearly:Quote from: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s-plus1 hardware wallet, 1 USB-C to USB-A cable, 1 getting started leaflet, 3 recovery sheets, 1 keychain strapSo no, it's not a cable like Nano S had (micro USB), it has an USB-C cable.I will add:Since any proper micro USB data cable worked with Nano S I expect any proper USB-C data cable will work with Nano S plus, so if you have different needs, you can easily adapt.Even more, you can easily find on the market (I've bought myself very cheap from AliExpress) adapters from USB-A to micro USB or USB-C (see this post for an example) or adapters microUSB->USBC or USBC->microUSB.Of course, you can just buy the Ledger OTG kit if you don't mind paying a little extra. It contains 3 cables:Quote from: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-otg-kitmicro-USB to USB-C, micro-USB to USB-A and USB-C to USB-C",
