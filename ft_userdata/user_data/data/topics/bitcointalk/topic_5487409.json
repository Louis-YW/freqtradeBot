However, 90% of these are going to be true so still, it's a huge amount of outflow from the exchanges. I surely think we will see some huge volume before Halving. Maybe a new ATH? Let's see.",

But is this withdrawal challenge an event by an exchange or whales trying to kill our bull run vibes?",

      "body": "Some exchanges basically leave sometimes the customers deposit at the deposit address for long periods of time before sweeping it. They do this due to fees pretty much. Sometimes if fees are low they can sweep their customer deposit BTC at once.But this doesn’t happen daily or weekly, unless it’s perhaps a large transfer. So they might seem like a exchange withdraw but it might be leading to an exchange deposit, only this data lags because the BTC aren’t swept immediately.",

Cryptoquant says that there are still available bitcoins in OTC market and it does not drop to zero.I think of this like demands on OTC market, higher than previously, can help to reduce selling pressure on Spot market. In the past, if sellers on OTC market fail to find buyers, they will sell in Spot market and affect price directly. Now they no longer have to do this so by this thinking, I see positively that even capital from Bitcoin Spot ETFs have yet come to Spot market, it is still good.",

Look, this is nothing different with those self pro claimed professional trader is promising to get rich by trading, in his group he will share his fake signal and he wrote \"trading is high risk of losing money, DWYOR, myself (self pro claimed professional trader) won't liable with any losses\". They create the statistics, but they didn't completely trust with their own stats lol.QuoteDisclaimer: Exchange balances presented are derived from Glassnode's comprehensive database of address labels, which are amassed through both officially published exchange information and proprietary clustering algorithms.

Let's see.What you have to do is go back and look at how many times we have seen these outflow events and then go back and see how many times they were right and how many times they were wrong. Then you have to look at how many times there were outflows from exchanges but they were moves to other exchanges that have not moved the coins to their cold storage / known address yet.And so on.But it does make a good headline.-Dave",

Let me know your thoughts on this!  I guess this information is correct because I have seen another chart where it was represented that exchange reserves are getting too low for the first time since 2017, which means people have started to move their funds to their wallets. There are some buying pressure as well. If that chart is correct, then this chart is correct as well, and this is good news, to be honest. We are heading into the bull run (I guess we are in a bull run already), and people are taking out their coins from exchanges. This will make bitcoin more decentralized. If exchanges hold a large amount of Bitcoin, it is risky for Bitcoiners.",
