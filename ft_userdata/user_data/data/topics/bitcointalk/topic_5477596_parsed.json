      "body": "So let me try and get things straight here. You are like running a promotional campaign, which is for casino sites where users are required to do some particular task in order for them to earn a reward that they can use to place a bet either at any casino of their choice or at any of the casinos they perform the task at. As I can see, anyone who wants to participate will need to have an account with your site first, which is where the task will be allocated to them on a daily basis, and they will complete and report their task back to you. If that's the case, I will see that this is just in the form of a bounty or shilling, and the only connection it has with the gambling section is that you are trying to promote some casinos that are listed or are partnering with you.",

I cant say it is review site since there is no review at all, but it works like review site where the main purpose is to get referrals through the offer provided in the site. Of course will be no KYC asked because I have never seen review site or affiliate site that asked KYC from their members. KYC will be asked in the casinos only as the main service and the one that usually being regulated. I'm not sure if affiliate site is also regulated by license or government but I have never heard such a case before.

There is no review site or affiliate site which give guarantee that there will be no issue in the future. If an issue happen, we cant blame the affiliate/review site because once we join in a casino through a review/affiliate site, we should be ready for any possible issue that may come in the casino. Unless you are talking about issue for the reward offered by the affiliate site, this one is different case and it is the responsibility of the affiliate site.",

Indeed it is a casino affiliate website where user needs to register themselves to get task. It is not a casino therefore the question of KYC is out of context here. How are they providing users with tasks to earn is new in the casino affiliate industry. It seems like they are sharing the rewards of affiliates with their users in the form of tasks and each task would require some kind of investment. That is all I can gather from what is written in the OP. They have named only two casinos as those are the two names displayed on their home page, so trust won't be an issue for them.",

It's popular among online shoppers because they could collect cash-backs and points, giving them a sort of discount from their online purchases.For playing in casinos, if some of the fees go back to your pocket, then long term it could be considered as a small reduction of house edge.OP, welcome to BitcoinTalk.",
