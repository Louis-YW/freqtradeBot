  "content": "Firstly we want to say a big thanks to Daniel / PolymerBit for these unbelieve notes and for taking the time to visit us! Stay tuned for some very exciting potential future developments! Daniel suggested we could look at either selling a few of the notes or auctioning them to raise some funds for the hub.We're posting here to showcase the notes and hope to update this page soon for any folk interested in getting a note! Take a look at these! We have notes ES003/ES004/ES005/ES006 available (We'll have a few one display at the hub aswell!)Lastly, imagine in the future we could do this ---> https://twitter.com/SatoshisPlaceUK/status/1578885029757087745 -   Stay tuned as physical bitcoin note IRL use is in discussion!",

Sorry, but unless I'm missing something, I don't think that you'll do this in the near future. Not as in that movie.As I see here such a Polymerbit note costs 17.99 GBP if unfunded (i.e. as collectible). So if one also put 0.001 BTC onto it, it should worth twice as much, hence exchanging it like in that movie would be very bad business for the one holding the note.",

For a collector nearby it may make more sense to come over for a pint and also buy a collectible, instead of ordering it over the internet... (I don't know though if I'm right on this).",

Still deciding (Feedback welcome!) on how to setup the sale of them (Set price / auction etc) i would sell these notes without auction and take as price preference e.g. the maastricht 2022 note from the Mitchell webshop, which has the same features:https://www.coinsofnakamoto.com/notes/polymerbit-mif-2022-sample-prints",

The black square with IIIS is typically added into the note, which in this case makes it \"exposed\" to show how the private key is protected. This is also why you can see that it's overlayed on the design.Essentially, these are prototypes that were given to Batesresearch with full permission to either auction, hold on to or destroy. All the proceeds from the ones gifted will remain with him, and I'm glad that we can all support his great cause.",
