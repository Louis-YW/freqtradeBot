You can engage in bitcoin transactions using P2P and centralized exchanges. Bitcoin has little or no role to play in the current currency problem of Nigeria because the economy is fiat driven. A large number of business transactions in Nigeria are done through the Naira. Also, most businesses in the country are not accepting bitcoin which is a major problem. The main problem is that even if you exchange your bitcoin using P2P you might not have access to fiat because it's scarce. Even banks don't have enough physical cash for customers. If Nigeria had many businesses that accept bitcoin, it would have been much better because the system is fast and reliable.",

Maybe you should get register on opay and deposit some cash in it to make these kinds of transactions easily. Since all these issues happened, Ive not had any issues with opay and I've been sending and receiving money with it. Ive also done a lot of data subscriptions.QuoteIf the FG should lift the ban on crypto exchange in the country I think it will help to Forster the development of this country and also help the youth financially.Federal government only ban banks from interacting with any form of crypto transactions.
