      "body": "Previous Case #1: Fundraising for the Floods disaster in PakistanBackground. It has been 3 months now since heavy Rainfall has flooded the various cities in four provinces of Pakistan. The media has reported more than 100 cities affected and caused a large number of causalities. The unexpected floods have left many families homeless and they are miserably living under the open sky waiting for some aid from all of us. Those millions of affected people have lost their houses, agricultural crops, and animals. Now, these people are in very miserable conditions, living without shelter, thousands of them displaced and having no food to eat and no medicines to fight disease.Disaster Description:As reported in media worldwide, the Pakistani nation is passing through a very difficult time in its history, heavy monsoon rainfall and consequent floods have badly affected 2-3 Million since June 22, destroying at least 100 thousand houses and damaging around 200,000 or more. Sind & Baluchistan are the most affected provinces in terms of humans and infrastructure. Only in Baluchistan were more than 500,000 livestock killed, 3000KM of road destroyed completely & 129 bridges damaged. Nation Disaster Management Authority is working with humanitarian agencies to support and provide necessary aid to affected families. The Thar district of Sind is also affected by these heavy rainfalls. The vast majority of people in this district where most people live in Bush houses have been complexly destroyed and affecters are living in the open sky and waiting for some aid to rehabilitate them. https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2022-000254-pakhttps://www.ndtv.com/topic/pakistan-flood[/s]Humanitarian Gesture from BTT Members:Now I as would like to raise funds from the Bitcointalk community to provide shelter materials, food, and medicines to these people through my trusted friends to as many people as much I can. As you know I have already launched one campaign for the COVID-affected people [I still have some leftover funds in that campaign, will use them here.] and provided food to needy people around me.
