      "body": "I don't undeerstand anything from what OP want. Does anybody actually understand the meaning of this topic?OP, what do you mean by \"I need Uphold or Gemini for rent $$\"? Can you be more specific, thus your topic can be understood?Quote from: TanveerMughal on February 25, 2023, 07:40:08 PMstill waitingYou may be waiting for eons unless you state clearly what you actually seek.Make sure you write your wish in a coherent matter, in coherent sentences, with subject, verb and all necessary information. As of now nothing can be understood from your topic. You need uphold? Uphold what? And what is that -- you need \"Gemini for rent\"? Gemini is a big exchange. You want to rent the entire exchange? Perhaps you should contact the owners in this case - Winklevoss twins",

That's it.So let me see if I get this straight, OP:- registration to a centralized exchange implies KYC, right? So those having an account at Gemini are individuals which gave their personal information to the exchange- you need \"Gemini account details\" -- so what does this mean? The usernames and passwords of those having an account at Gemini exchange?- if you are actually requesting usernames and passwords of Gemini customers, then you are practically asking people to doxx themselves for 5$?Do I understand this right?",

The member keeps his $5 for every transaction.TanveerMughal, don't need to ask for the account details.",

The member keeps his $5 for every transaction.What you are saying makes sense, yet this is not what OP requested. Let's re-read what he said.Quote from: T3PR00T on March 09, 2023, 09:59:32 PMTanveerMughal, don't need to ask for the account details.Quote from: TanveerMughal on March 09, 2023, 11:24:53 AMSo basically when you give me your upload/gemini account details, i will make a simple agreement with you about i will use your account only for withdraw brave batsWhat do you understand from here?From my perspective I clearly understand that OP actually wants your account and its credentials for personally using it.Furthermore, for making this request even more shady, why does he need accounts only from certain countries? Why not from every country? And what rent is OP talking about? Renting someone's account? Paying his own rent with BAT? I believe that either OP is unable to speak English or he is trying something very shady (maybe similar to the scam you found earlier). I am very curious to see OP's answer to my questions.",

I don't think anyone is going to do that. I sell -uphold accounts, but they are for more than $100.",
