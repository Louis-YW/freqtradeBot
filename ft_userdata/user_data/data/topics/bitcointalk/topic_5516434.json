  "content": "Alright fellow bitcoiners , it's a beautiful evening and we are currently at $68k plus currently experiencing a pull back. Anyways this thread isn't a speculation thread as the title suggests. Well some of us have been in the crypto space for a relatively long time while others not that long. Well this thread is more like a quick 10 mins quiz. Let's GO!!!1. Everyone likes flexible transactions and nice fee's well that was the initial aim of the SEGWIT protocols however what year was it implemented? 2. what is the average size of a block ?3. well talking about mining bitcoin blocks, exactly 144 blocks are minned per day is this true?4. If mining hardwares were doubled does that mean number of blocks Â mined per day would be doubled ?5. well Satoshi Nakamoto is called \"PSEUDENONYMOUS ENTITY \" because?6. How many Halloween contests has been hosted on bitcointalk? 7. what year was the biggest altcoin Ethereum launched?8. Did you just answer the previous question well you were supposed to skip it it's a bitcoin quiz remember?9. How many BITCOINS are in the first bitcoin address (THE GENESIS ADDRESS)?10. Speaking of the genesis address, why wasn't its coins spent? 11. Now a bonus question, what year was the digital GOLD launched?12. If Satoshi sends some bitcoin to Mia can Mia do an RBF without CPFP first?Now for some TRUE / FALSE questions13. The genesis address is a SIGWIT address.14. Bitcoin is a volatile currency.15. I can receive bitcoins with my change address.Please keep your answers as short as possible (a sentence if necessary is ok)Could you answer them all?How did you do with dates?Stay tuned for the answers and see you in next week's edition  This thread is self moderated to prevent spamming!!",

      "body": "Perhaps I'm not perfect but from a quick Google search and with my little forum knowledge combine here is my answer.1. It was implemented in the year 2017 August by Peter wuilier but he first introduced it in a conference in 2015.2. The average size of a Bitcoin block is approximately 2-4 MB, since the introduction of SegWit in 2017 but it can vary depending on the transactions included.3. An average of one block is mined every 10 minutes, so it's probably true that 144 blocks are mined every 24hrs.4. The Bitcoin protocol's difficulty adjustment mechanism makes it difficult for blocks mines per day to be doubled but it could increase based on my knowledge which could be wrong. 5. because his true identity has remain anonymous ever since. 6. I have been only here for 2 years, and only two Halloween contest have I witnessed. I don't know the exact number that has been hosted. ..... still making research. 7. Skip8. Skip again.9. The Genesis Address has nothing less than 50BTC in it. 10. The coins in the Genesis Address were not spent because Satoshi Nakamoto never wanted them to be spent based on my own gesture or but folks have other opinions about it. 11. The Paradigmic event of Bitcoin took place in 2009. 12. No. Mia is not the sender, only the sender can do the Replace By Fee (RBF) action without CPFP. 13. False. It's a Legacy address14. True. Bitcoin is a volatile currency.15. False. You can't receive your change address since it's created for leftover funds in your wallet.",

The protocol was first developed in 2015 but was activated on 24th August 2017 by Pieter Wuille; it is more for transaction malleability than for scalability, 2. 1MB is the average size but since the SegWit fork where transaction are base on weight units it is 4,000,000 weight unit (assume 4MB, if all transactions are in SegWit) 3. No the 144 blocks are the average to be mined a day base on the average 10 minutes to mine a block but this does varies and can be more or less due to the mining rate (difficulty) of the hardwares which are sometimes more or less than 10 minute 4. It will be base on the hashrate if it increases the block will be mine faster but doubling its doesnâ€™t necessarily mean it will function twice.

So if someone else knows the answer to that question, he also needs to answer it?I think since you gave it in quiz form you should have given some rules regulation.Â  For example:Â 1.Â  Posts may not be edited or deleted.Â 2.Â  You can answer as many as you want.Â 3.Â  After you post, you cann't post a second time unless someone else is replying.Â 4.Â  If no one can give a correct answer then I will.Â 5.Â  One's correctly answered question cannot be posted a second time.I think it should be like this. But it is not compulsory for you can do whatever you like.Â  But it is better to maintain quiz topics like this. Thank you.",

Everyone likes flexible transactions and nice fee's well that was the initial aim of the SEGWIT protocols however what year was it implemented? The main goal was actually to fix the transaction malleability while also increasing the capacity.SegWit was \"implemented\" a couple of years before its \"activation\" (around 2015 IIRC) and the implementation was improved until it was activated in 2017.Quote2. what is the average size of a block ?Usually it is about 1.7 MB but sometimes the protocol abusers spam the chain with arbitrary data injected in the witness parts of transactions and increase that.Quote3. well talking about mining bitcoin blocks, exactly 144 blocks are minned per day is this true?Nothing in PoW which is based on chance, is exact Quote4. If mining hardwares were doubled does that mean number of blocksÂ  mined per day would be doubled ?The number of blocks found per day would be doubled until we reach the next difficulty adjustment target which is 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks under normal circumstances).Quote5. well Satoshi Nakamoto is called \"PSEUDENONYMOUS ENTITY \" because?Because Satoshi was an entity that was pseudenonymous LOLQuote6. How many Halloween contests has been hosted on bitcointalk? I don't really follow that!Quote7. what year was the biggest altcoin Ethereum launched?Who cares Quote8.

How many BITCOINS are in the first bitcoin address (THE GENESIS ADDRESS)?0.18225651BTCQuote10. Speaking of the genesis address, why wasn't its coins spent? You should ask Satoshi why he never touched any of his coins including what is locked behind the Genesis block's key.Quote11. Now a bonus question, what year was the digital GOLD launched?Who cares Quote12. If Satoshi sends some bitcoin to Mia can Mia do an RBF without CPFP first?I find this question a bit weird  RBF is for transactions where you are the spender. Whether the parent is confirmed or not you can spend it and mark your tx as RBF. CPFP can be used for unconfirmed transactions regardless of the RBF.Quote13. The genesis address is a SIGWIT address.False!But it can be  considering Genesis output is not an address to begin with, it is a P2PK output (without address) and like those who made a P2PKH address from the public key and sent coins to it, one can create a P2WPKH (and any other type) from that pubkey and send coins to it too...Quote14. Bitcoin is a volatile currency.True!Quote15. I can receive bitcoins with my change address.True!",

Is Segwit considered among the average?SegWit is not something separate to not be considered. It is part of the protocol and witnesses are part of transactions so they are part of the blocks and are contributing to the size.Back in 2017 with the SegWit soft-fork the capacity limit (1 MB block size) was changed from being base on size to be based on weight (4 MB block weight). To put simply bitcoin blocks have been able to be bigger than 1 MB; and the more SegWit transactions with bigger witnesses these blocks include, the bigger their raw byte is going to be.You can see big blocks here with 4 MB raw byte size if you sort like this:https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks?s=size(desc)#f=id,hash,transaction_count,size,timeBut because not all transactions have witness (people still use legacy) and not all witnesses are big, the block size is usually about 1.6-1.7 MB.",

People still use Legacy but they are using Segwit more than past years, it's good adoption for Segwit and can help other Bitcoin users too by minimizing effects on Bitcoin mempools.Segwit spending transactions, Segwit spending payments, and payments and blocksize charts can elaborate Segwit adoption and unused Bitcoin block capacity. Many Bitcoin blocks are not full in capacity.https://transactionfee.info/charts/transactions-spending-segwit/https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments-spending-segwit/https://transactionfee.info/charts/payments-and-blocksize/This chart for Legacy to SegWit inputs transition is interesting. It shows that Legacy usages are dying and Segwit usages are increasing a lot and recently it is about 97% inputs are Segwit, 3% inputs are Legacy.https://transactionfee.info/charts/transactions-segwit-transition/",
