  "content": "A group is doing this to collect personal information of crypto users with the tempting offer of Ledger IPO. They are collecting important information like name, email, phone number of crypto users. I saw this ad multiple times today on Facebook, and realized it was a scam. But many crypto users may have already given their information, so that in the future they will sell that information to various places. There is no official news about Ledger's IPO, so whoever is running this campaign has no good intentions, they are data scammers. Facebook page link: https://www.facebook.com/mmprotrust",

      "body": "I believe that my data was already compromised before through them and that's why I've received some fake emails telling me that they've got me a new Ledger wallet and I've won their raffle. And with that image, as Facebook and the same just as google ads, a potential scammer/hacker can easily advertise their words and links through the said social networking website. They're no longer too strict with policies on who's able to advertise through their platform and who's not. As long as someone is paying for that sponsorship or advertising, that won't matter to them. Before, they've banned ICO advertising but later on lifted it so I guess these scammers are taking advantage of it. Ledger has already made a warning at the top of their website about potential phishing. And I believe that form will lead to that.Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/Beware of phishing attacks, Ledger will never ask for the 24 words of your recovery phrase. Never share them.Quote from: https://www.ledger.com/phishing-campaigns-status#StopTheScammersONGOING PHISHING CAMPAIGNSPhishing attempts are targeting Ledger customers.[...]",

      "body": "Thanks for the warning.Looking at the original page of the paid ad's it's obvious it all kind of be scam.We should always be careful what we click online this days because anyone can pay for ads nowadays on any social media and they will just appear in almost everyone's page. Apart from selling of the collected information I believe they should also have other means of trying to manipulate the collected users data, either other forms of trying to hack through it's device or something. Selling of the user information can't just be their only reason behind this kind of scam.",

The purpose of adding the Facebook page link is that crypto users can remember the name of this page, so that even if they see fake ads, crypto users can be careful. I have not shared the link of the post through which they steal the information of crypto users. So I don't think there is anything added here by which any crypto user will give their personal information to these data scammers.",

Went to their Facebook page and after digging into the details realized that they are nothing but scammers. I think this topic needs to be in this Beginners & Help board, because there are many newbies in particular, who are more attracted to these things, and easily submit their data.It also happened to me that a few days ago some people in my friends list shared with me on messaging, that registered to get an iPhone by submitting the same type of data. I won't just talk about it, there is a large section of newbies in the forum who do bounty and there are many projects out there that get KYC verification from those bounty hunters for simple payment. And later it turns out that most such projects are scammers. And in the meantime, they already take what they need to achieve So I would say to them, stop giving data to these scammers in the hope of making a few bucks out of greed.",

Maybe they follow the standard and no harm done but collecting information especially personal one might lead to a more potential scam later on. Since there is no official announcement from Ledger then how come marketing it already? Obviously one reason, to bait some or many for a wide scam.Nice share OP. This is very helpful.",

Facebook is dirtier than Google, the process of running an advertisement is similar to Google but the reach is absolutely amazing. They are only targeting specific genres & segments of users. Not everyone can see such an advertisement which makes this advertisement more effective. As we know idiots are everywhere I am sure they have already gathered tons of email addresses and phone numbers. The only way such advertisements can be stopped is by mass reporting them to Facebook.",

It seems like a very poor control by FB.Otherwise, Ledger has already compromised its user base several times, so I hope that this kind of scam does not have a big impact, or at least it is reduced to a minimum.",

For all of them, profit comes first, regardless of the fact that they know very well that they are promoting anything and everything through their services, without almost any verification of what it is about. They have made sure that the laws protect them very well, i.e. that they are not responsible for the content that is displayed on their services through the advertisements that they provide. Even if they end up in a situation where they have to pay a fine, no matter how big those fines seem to us, for them it's just a small part of the profit.Quote from: examplens on April 12, 2023, 09:50:29 AM~snip~Otherwise, Ledger has already compromised its user base several times, so I hope that this kind of scam does not have a big impact, or at least it is reduced to a minimum.Exactly, because as far as cryptocurrency users are concerned, I generally think that no company is responsible for as much data leakage as Ledger. I don't mean only e-mails, but complete data including e-mail, phone number, full name and address. I wonder how it is possible that they are still at the top after everything, but it is obvious that most of those whose data was leaked were not too worried about it.",

After the Ledger data leak already a lot of scams have happened. Now it has become a favorite product of scammers to target users and gain information. No doubt it is a good hardware wallet but the problem relies on the servers that they have to store customer's information. Thanks, ScamViruS this topic is helpful.",
