Padyan registers an account on December 10, 2022, at 06:23:11 PM and goes directly to this thread to post at 06:30:57 PM the same day.hansonaric was even quicker. He registered today at 09:50:49 AM, and made his post just one minute later - at 09:51:05 AM. I guess it's just coincidence. Amateur hour, the two of you. For your next shill post, may I suggest you create an account well in advance before actually posting from it.",
