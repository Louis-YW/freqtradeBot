  "content": "FTX was known to be the world's second-largest crypto exchange before collapsing in late 2022. Investors were \"rekt\" and crypto/Blockchain tech got a lot of bad publicity. The company is now bankrupt, but SBF is trying to bring back customers' trust by \"making them whole\" again. If FTX pays its customers back, do you think it will rise to glory again? Or is it game over for it? I'd be surprised if FTX makes a comeback after so much disappointment from mainstream investors. If it does come back, it's going to need to change its branding just to help gather new investors into it.What do you think about this? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

If, FTX exchanges can recover all their customer's funds, I think regaining the trust of consumers is not as easy as turning the palm of the hand, IN FACT, their consumers know that negative things like what is currently happening to FTX, can be done, what else in the future, the same thing can also happen again.For this reason, whatever the FTX exchange does, they don't get the trust of the public anymore, they are already deterred and give up on the FTX exchange.",

Even with the new management, it's having hard time recovering. We can have a comparison with those exchanges before that have been at the peak of their popular like bittrex, there's not that much anomaly with them but with just due time, they've lost what they've got.So, with this issue on FTX, they need tremendous luck if they're thinking that getting back the trust of people will be that easy.",

That was posted in November 2022, 3 months ago. In more recent news:Sam Bankman-Fried Needs Tighter Bail Restrictions, Judge Says\"A federal judge said he was not satisfied with a plan that lawyers for the disgraced FTX founder struck with prosecutors to limit his use of encrypted messaging apps.\"I don't think SBF is able to make anyone whole at this point. This thread topic is old, outdated and most likely invalid news.So my answer is no. FTX will not make a comeback. Words of a new CEO were spread in the last few weeks though I don't think that will come to fruition. If there is a new CEO, maybe he will provide some sort of compensation to rebuild some trust and make good face for himself. I don't see why anyone would want to become the CEO of this company though.",

People keep money where they trust that it is safe .No one will be willing to joke with their haed earned money.If FTX happens to fix their problems and come back to the market many people will be skeptical to join the exchange This is because the trust they have in this change has already been betrayed so trust can only be betrayed once and not twice that is why many people would not use the exchange",

If a man builds a thousand bridges and fucks one goat, people don't call him a bridge builder but FTX has never built a thousand bridges, instead, moved on doing of the second one. If FTX wanted to stay in business, they would be more careful.Firstly, they'll never be able to get their reputation back and secondly - it will cost more than they'll profit.We will definitely get another exchange by ex FTX people because it's the business where they have experience and know how to operate.

Can you name a company that scammed people but did rebranding and conquered the niche again? Not rebranding but if some ex FTX members establish a brand new exchange, they'll may succeed because to be honest, people rarely do deep investigation.",
