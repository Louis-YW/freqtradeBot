I mean, the warnings are there since forever and this year, through these topics (since February!!) the information is clear, more present and .. scary.I don't think that the topic is unnecessary, maybe this one will be seen by those who missed the others. But really, how many wakeup calls are necessary?I've read, sadly, also about people trusting - pretty much blindly - that they'll get refunded. That's a clear mistake. I urge everybody give it a good thinking and do better.",

Those are traders that are doing a hundred trades a day, scalping every few dollars in a price change, a thing that's impossible over BISQ, for them, it's like asking a forex trader to move over and use an airport booth currency exchange.It's simple in theory to ask everyone to move to dex but for some DEX are simply not offering what they want.Quote from: mk4 on November 09, 2022, 09:12:30 AMWhat's funny is that this event was a repeat of history — sort of like MtGox v2; whereas FTX, an exchange that people trusted a lot(just like people had heavy trust on MtGox back then), ended up having insolvency problems(presumably, things still aren't 100% clear) in the end.Way too many differences- FTX had not that huge market share- FTX hasn't been hacked and didn't get assets stolen- Mt Gox wasn't attacked and stabbed in the back by Bitstamp",

In addition, we should not forget how easy it is to buy the affection of all those naive investors who have some kind of role model in people like Bankman, CZ or Musk - and while they add billions to their private accounts, 95% of those who try to trade with cryptocurrencies are left with nothing.Nothing has changed in the way this game works, and nothing will not change in the future - some new CEX will appear with some new token and everything will start from the beginning.",

      "body": "Will this be bad in the future?I didn't experience the Mtgox event but I've read it. Right now we are led to trust Binance, because they have quite a large number of users. I first learned of my exchange using Poloniex. But after some problems I moved to Bittrex. But since there are some conditions that make me not believe in Bittrex I went to Binance until recently. So far it looks like it's still making me comfortable, but I don't know what I'm going to do I didn't expect there to be a Mtgox volume two. Hopefully that's purely a problem and won't have an impact on the exchange. But if I look at the last CZ statmen on twitter, he looks like he wants to make FTX belongs to him, after he even admitted to selling FTX cheaply. CZ doesn't seem to want to be like the Luna Terra case either.",

The exchanges have blindfolded investors into believing that they are the good custodian and they are best when it comes to assets management so that they can trade anytime but that hasn't always been the case with exchanges, they cannot be trusted because at any slight problems and difficulties, they use peoples fund as bailout as we have experience from SBF, FTX and Alameda, this is bad for the crypto industry and I hope the affected investors learn from this mistake.",

We probably have to go through multiple of these style events, including the mt gox to get there, but we'll eventually get there. It's ultimately for the better, it's just going to take time to actually do it. There probably needs to be a little more fine tuning done to the process of P2P exchanges though, since the protection offered is generally a little less, although when it comes to talking about centralised exchanges, the security is only as much as you trust the exchange at that time, which obviously could be zero.",

For example, one can not use bisq on their mobile phone (they don't have mobile support) or a computer with very low resource or else it will freeze. I have experience with the latter back then.You also can't use bisq to trade futuresI think the most important message is, never use centralized exchanges as wallets once one is done trading.",

They are all drowning and they're taking with them their users' money. And not only centralized exchanges and centralized platforms for lending, investing, financial management and whatnot but also centralized tokens and coins. But it seems that while there is always a call to stay away from centralized products and services, they are actually proliferating. Their users increasing. Their volumes reaching huge amounts. And they often carry with them the term decentralized or decentralization itself. So we all should be wary of what's being promoted as decentralized. Platforms providing swaps, staking, opportunities to earn from contributing liquidity, and so on claiming to be decentralized are all but decentralized. Let's all be cautious, everyone!",

Binance announced that they withdrawn from the acquisition and it is understandable. FTX is too big and it has to obey US regulations. We know that since the trade war between the USA. and China, US. regulators are more careful and stricter with Chinese companies and companies that have Chinese board members. Binance have problems with it definitely and perhaps their withdrawal from the non-binding deal is partially because of US. regulations.QuoteOverall, the downfall of FTX exchange is not a win for Binance or other exchanges.Binance will have less strong competitors but you are right that in short and medium terms, it is not good for all people, all entities that are engaging in cryptocurrency industry.

It's always full of bad news.Dex exchanges are not 100% safe as well but they are better than Centralised exchanges, now even Binance exchange is not safe because it's also a centralised exchange, I believe that's why CZ planned the whole SAFU Fund, he knew something could go wrong.",
