Of course thats the thing about memecoin, they are sidechain or uses other network to launch since there is not much use case for them. So why make a blockchain that are meme, maybe focus on a real thing instead naming it dogefuck chain.",

We already see this scene so much better for new traders to avoid this project because this is just another obvious scam in the making. But I doubt they can accumulate investor because most of the people especially those veterans are smart enough to know which is fast scam and which is not.",

Over 510 out of 600 ETH has been raised.My personal advice here is to definitely stay away from that project. First of all those bold claims about being a new groundbreaking blockchain are absolutely worthless if they have no proof for any of those claims. Even if those claims would be true it would still not be that special because there are so many chains out there now that are offering all of those features.And then of course there is the name. You are trying to launch a big new crypto project but you choose a name that is more fitting to an absolute shit tier meme coin.",

No it would really be still remaining to be that a meme coin on which i do fully agree that we do know on what comes next when dealingup with memes unless if its been hyped up like Elon then it would shoot up, but if not? For sure you would really be losing an investment . I dont really usually believe into those presale sold outs despite on having that huge money been attached into because i did have a bad experience when it comes to those kind of claims about huge funding or support from the community because we dont know that those who bought on the presale are really just that a few of those people who are part of the team and trying out to scam out people and dumping all the way to the flooronce it do hits up on exchangers or even when its still on DEX. Not totally shocking situation and it does really happen, trust me!",

During this week there will be an intense promotion with an injection of liquidity and within a short period you will find that investors are trying to buy for fear of missing the opportunity, then all liquidity and profits will be withdrawn and the currency will die.In such currencies, with low market capacity and limited listings, an amount of $200,000 may lead to an increase of more than 50%.if the listing is on scam exchanges, they may help them by faking volums.",

Can't you see that almost 98 percent of the shitcoins are failing?It's because no one wants them. Only 2 percent have survived because they prepare a big budget. They can hire popular influencers using this money to market their coin and they can also do some trading manipulations. This is where a project can turn heads.",
