I don't know how true this post is and if there should to be worry about talking about chatGPT in programming space.I just want to ask coz this sounds like sarcasm to me lol.About the improved payserver, well, that's all good to me though.https://twitter.com/ElectrumWallet/status/1616542181115990016",

      "body": "I don't know what to think about this. First I thought it was a joke, but there is a screenshot there showing what they asked ChatGPT to do. Still, I am sure they wouldn't just blindly rely and use random code created by an AI. I have seen people correct ChatGPT for correctly adding two numbers together and it apologized and said it made a mistake. Maybe if you told it that the code it produced is completely wrong, it would believe you and make something else. Someone who claims to be a JavaScript developer has already rated the code as being of low quality.https://twitter.com/zeBookie/status/1616735293134065664",

How can there isn't one JS developer in Electrum?I think the code is very small and easily readable as can be seen in this commit. Also I guess they tagged ChatGPT to gain attention from people as chatgpt is trending on Twitter in multiple countries and is very famous now. I am sure code must have been reviewed before deploying. I think it is not correct to use harsh words for devs. They are doing extreme hard work for Electrum development.",
