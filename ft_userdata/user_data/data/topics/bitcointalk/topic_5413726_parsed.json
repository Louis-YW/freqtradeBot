Farmers also plan to add fertilizer to fields after the harvest, and shipments of fertilizer are being delayed.Max Fisher, chief economist at the National Grain and Feed Association, which represents most U.S. grain handlers, said rail customers reported at least one railway would stop taking grain shipments on Thursday morning.Most major U.S. railways have already stopped accepting new shipments of ammonia fertilizer and other potentially hazardous materials, said Justin Louchheim, senior government affairs director at The Fertilizer Institute, an industry group.Louchheim said fertilizer producers are now evaluating how much storage they have for ammonia that cannot move by rail, and whether some can move by truck.The potential rail shutdown looms just six weeks before most Midwest farmers would begin applying fertilizer, said Josh Linville, fertilizer director at StoneX Group. About 40% of the U.S. fertilizer supply is on a rail car at some point before arriving on a farm, he said.Railroads have until a minute after midnight on Friday to reach tentative deals with holdout unions representing about 60,000 workers.Worries about service interruptions boosted prices for corn-based ethanol at several hubs and kept sellers out of the market, said Josh Pedrick, a managing editor for S&P Global Commodity Insights.The Association of American Railways (AAR), which represents railroad companies, did not immediately respond to request for comment on grain transportation.The work stoppage would be keenly felt in states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Nebraska, from which grain is hauled via rail to ports in the Pacific Northwest for export, said Thomas Lahey, domestic freight manager at grain merchandiser Columbia Grain International. Grain elevators in the upper Midwest move soybeans to the PNW mostly via BNSF Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway and Union Pacific, he said.U.S. Class 1 railroads transported nearly 1.5 million carloads of grain in 2020, including 691,000 carloads of corn, 340,000 carloads of soybeans and 248,000 carloads of processed soybeans like soymeal and soyoil, AAR said.ENOUGH ANIMAL FEED?U.S. chicken producers rely on about 27 million bushels of corn and 11 million bushels of soymeal every week to feed their birds, the National Chicken Council said. Much is moved by rail.\"Any disruption of service could negatively impact the welfare of the birds, and ultimately impact production at a time when Americans are already dealing with record food inflation,\" council spokesman Tom Super said.In North Carolina, a pork and poultry producer, local grain growers do not produce enough corn to feed all the farm animals, said Bob Ford, executive director of the North Carolina Poultry Federation.\"We'd be in trouble if they went on strike for very long,\" Ford said. \"We'd run out of corn.\"Wayne-Sanderson Farms, a Georgia-based chicken company owned by Cargill Inc and Continental Grain, is working with local corn producers to augment feed supplies if needed during rail disruptions, spokesman Frank Singleton said.The beginning of corn harvesting in the southern United States, a main poultry region, \"will relieve some of the pressure\" on feed supplies, he said.Some rail customers that feed livestock do not have enough soymeal, said Fisher, of the National Grain and Feed Association. In a worst case scenario, that could force some producers to cull animals.Railroads also ship hexane, a chemical solvent that crushers use to extract oil from soybeans, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of Soy Transportation Coalition.\"Any slowdown or stoppage of rail service – especially on the eve of harvest – would significantly impact farmers' ability to meet customer demand – both domestically and internationally,\" Steenhoek said.(Reporting By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek in Chicago; Additional reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago, Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Canada, and Stephanie Kelly in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)https://news.yahoo.com/u-railways-halt-grain-shipments-212922735.html....This sounds a little like serious business is going down.US railroad workers are going on strike. Which will shut down critical shipments of fertilizer and food based commodities. The impact may not be felt over the long term. But next year's harvest could significantly decline. Shipments may still be made. Fertilizer and cargo might be hauled by truck, rather than train. But the cost would still rise. And many farmers and food production operations might not be able to afford it.This is a critical time, when americans might recognize the anger and react to prevent a future crisis. But I have a feeling most will ignore this news and be caught entirely unprepared if a future disaster occurs.It is a strange thing to feel compelled to warn people. Knowing full well most are determined to ignore these news events as being \"pessimistic\", \"negative\" or \"conspiracy theory garbage\".They say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I wonder if there was an era of human history where people worked to prevent crisis. It seems as if all of our problem solving is based purely upon reactionary measures.",

Probably not, people are wired to ignore problems they do not understand until they are hit in the face by them, there are probably many causes for this but one of the most obvious has to be the confirmation bias, in which people disregard any information that does not fit their world view.So if someone out of their ignorance believes this is not a big issue then they will not stop to think at all about this and will simply think this will have no effect at all on their lives, and even if you could eventually demonstrate to them you were right, they will still disregard such evidence by just claiming you were lucky or other similar weak arguments.",

They aren't sitting by idly assuming everything will be alright. With potential record-breaking grain prices on the horizon, farmers need rail service more than ever and the railroads know it. The smart ones are acting now to prevent problems later.",
