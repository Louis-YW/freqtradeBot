It will look good and also people will find it interesting to read. Your title made me click but your post hurts my eyes. That's right OP should buy and use a copper membership and at least fix the post about full details or provide an image to be able to interest this forum user.If the OP is paid for promoting a casino site but only the post is listed for a promotion then it is not appropriate to get a salary from the site he is promoting.I don't think a post like this will get forum users interested in what is being promoted but instead will only give an opinion about the OP's post which is not very good.I am a simple user, I am not an employee / partner of the siteFor a moment, if indeed you don't get a salary and are not a site partner, what is your goal in promoting a gambling site, even though this situation does not give you any profit at all.As far as I know, there will never be anyone who wants to do a promotion on casino sites that don't provide a salary and are not profitable for someone who is doing a promotion.It seems useless, but it's up to you because you are promoting their site while you are not a site partner.Quote from: Bitinity on January 05, 2023, 09:59:12 AMQuote from: sativaindika on January 04, 2023, 08:21:20 PMI am a simple user, I am not an employee / partner of the siteSo what is your main purpose of making a thread for this casino if there is no advantage/benefit for you? It is your 2nd time creating a thread for casino, the first one is for luckybird but seems you put a referral link on that thread. Will you responsible for any question/feedback by giving an answer or maybe a help if there are some people from this forum play in this casino but experiencing an issue? Yes, I am not a partner/employee of the casino, but what is stopping me from promoting this casino as a player who likes the design and games that are there? I've been playing on this site for over a year and have had no problems, I don't think you will either, BUT, if something happens, I will try to help you as much as possible in my power.Do not look for hidden meaning where there is none.According to the design of this theme, I am editing the theme in a successful bird, after the end I will edit this theme as much as possible. If you have guides on theme design, I will be glad to read it.Thank you",
