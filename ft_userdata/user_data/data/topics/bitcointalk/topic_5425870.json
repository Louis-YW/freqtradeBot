And these are the media that are manipulating Cryptocurrency industry and that sucks a lot. These are some mastermind people that are controlling this industry. And somehow these people should have to exit and this could be the new era for Cryptocurrency. That's the reason I won't believe these scam accusitions.",

The ECB is drowning and it's trying to sink its claws into everyone and everything to keep itself afloat. They should rather be worried about the countries in the EU who despite signing EUR acceptance haven't done so after many years of being in the union.

This is a good example of how various central banks across the world are struggling to adapt to the changing financial landscape and how they continue to try and paint Bitcoin in as negative a light as possible. The ECB's report is nothing but an attempt at discrediting the cryptocurrency, and it doesn't take much reading between the lines to understand that they don't like competition.Unfortunately for them, the facts have a bad habit of getting in the way of their rhetoric.",

It does not matter how severe the bear cycle is or will be, the bear cycle does not affect the BTC network, only its price, which happens only for the meantime, and that surely can't mean the end of BTC. These claims are just made to make people hate BTC so they would not control their own money, which favors the ECB.The ECB has no fact against BTC and that's why they have no claim at all, or a very weak one. BTC does not have any issues with its security, the network cannot be controlled, mining is going on fine and the hash rate is very high, the BTC network cannot be breached or hacked or taken over by a miner or mining pool, if any of these things ever went or goes the other way, which it obviously can't, then the ECB or any other centralized body can now talk about BTC's last stand, but until then they can only deceive people who are not knowledgeable.",

How can this be true when everything that's been going around since the launch of BTC just goes against that claim? ECB has some vested interest in bringing down bitcoin or POW mining to be precise. They have already created a certain proposals for the EU countries which are still being debated but the motto of the proposal is to ban any type of POW cryptocurrency from the soil of EU. So it's no wonder that ECB is making statements essentially demeaning bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. However, these are speculations! It will definitely be tough if the ban proposal is passed in EU parliament. But even then, that will be temporary. As EU miners will shut down, the difficulty will reduce. So a lot of old miners from different parts of the world may come back into action to fill in the blank. So I personally don't see a reason to belive in ECB and its statements.",

They're not saying the Argentine Peso is dead, because that one doesn't pose a threat to their own power. The only reason they talk about Bitcoin, is because Bitcoin has potential.
