For bitcoin or any other crypto to be a legal tender can also help in the adoption but that is what IMF is against. IMF will only say their own, since they have been telling El Salvador to reconsider what they have been talking about making use of bitcoin as a legal tender, El Salvador did not listen to them which is great. IMF can not also be a threat to any country that wants to make bitcoin a legal tender, they can only say but they can not enforce.",

It is despicable how they've tried to blackmail El Salvador to reverse course but withholding money they had been planning to give to El Salvador to help its people.Bitcoin has made very clear that the financial powers that be are afraid of it and are mostly just concerned with keeping their own power.With so many forces against Bitcoin, and constantly spreading misinformation about it which most people are all too keen to believe, Bitcoin's ascendancy and adoption will be slower than we might hope, and there will be setbacks, but its future is undeniable. People being born today won't even think twice about Bitcoin being a totally normal thing and a great currency of value when they are adults.",

Since bitcoin was created, it has received hate from governments and organizations around the world but it has survived and thrived. That means these institutions are interested in bitcoin or not, it is never a serious issue. IMF or China, they don't like bitcoin as their right, bitcoin doesn't care and will continue to grow without them.",

It is not about countries adopting, neither about rejection of bitcoin adoption or anything like that at all. This is just about the fact that there are risky assets in crypto which we all know, and most of us do not even invest, and it should not be done by big banks either, that's it. The misinformation going around on twitter is just too much, I can just tweet \"IMF thinks bitcoin is the future and fiat will die\" and you guys will believe that too?

So in the future, their not accepting bitcoin is not a problem that we need to worry about.Honestly, I would be happy if governments and banks accepted bitcoin, but if they don't accept it, it doesn't matter to me, I will still use bitcoin my way.",

After reading it can be said Cryptocurrencies are not a threat to the financial system, and could be part of a solution to increase cross-border payments, according to the head of research of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Carstens says that the technology behind cryptocurrencies can also improve payments in general.

They pool billions of dollars in lower interest rates and lend that money to the countries at a higher interest rate and earn spreads. That's pretty much what they do! So they are acting like any other commercial banks when it comes to crypto currency. Majority of the commercial banks have a negative view of cryptos and IMF is no exception. That's fair from their part. Does that mean crypto industry will slow down? Oh hell no! We are far more resilient now from any such comments from any big businesses or personalities.
