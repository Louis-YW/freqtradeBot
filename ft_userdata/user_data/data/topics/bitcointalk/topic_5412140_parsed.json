Now money tends to follow other money.Investing in value increases your equity faster than it increases your money (and there's the chance it won't increase your money by much compared to investing in where other money is likely to follow - where it's already been).I don't know what you mean but following money that well. If something's overbought, it has a higher chance of becoming more overbought or overbought again than it does of being oversold.",

Money is a convenient tool for a normal person who uses money precisely as an assistant / tool to improve their standard of living and empowerment. Plus - if you do not steal money, but earn with your mind, knowledge, experience - this is also a good indicator of your level of development!Money, like many entities in our life, can be very useful if used correctly, or be a terrible poison if used incorrectly...

I have heard so many quotes about money, but I have not heard about following money or being followed by money.But what I think your thread should discuss according to your title is - Money is a motivating factor, when you don't make money you will be afraid and doubtful that you can make money. But once you start making money, you will be motivated to make more money. So, money is a motivating factor.",

So I feel it's true that if you seek joy from yourself, money is a very small thing, but in today's social prejudices, they dominate most people's lives.

What's your take on this?I'd say this is more a judgement about economic policies than anything else, Capitalism is the best of all the worst options that we've found. Free markets in most cases will work out the most efficient means of production and bring down prices for everyone. However free markets are open to abuse so they need strong and wise regulation, which is the hardest part. Governments tend to work on very small time scales like 4 years, but businesses are constantly having to adapt to new conditions every day. There are also some areas where potentially the government should have more control because the private sector can and does abuse it. Things like medical care, power and water supplies should be very carefully managed for the wider public benefit.",

But often money is made into a god as if they forget that money is also a double-edged sword. Make a person forget who he is. Why is money so motivating? because in this day and age without money will be an obstacle. I admit everything costs money but that doesn't mean money can buy it.
