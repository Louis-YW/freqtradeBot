I recommend you find any project with testnet and join the testnet group of that project, you will get the most practical experience from which you will have your answer.He already made a thread on the acquisition of testnet reward before finding out about testnet itself. Firstly, I don't find the reward of testnet worth the while, because the number of people interested are usually high,so these reward are so insignificantly small. As much as bitcoin talk help on every question on cryptocurrency, the definition on testnet can be search engine can help out too. Don't wait on testnet, this is the best time to purchase those coins and 100x",

This divides the two blockchain and inhibits coin transfers this technique prevents testnet coin from being transferred to the mainnet original network this solved the testnet 2 problem and prevented fraud Mining was also resolved current testnets don't raise the cryptocurrency mining difficulty this makes mining bitcoins in a tesnet so easy that it nullifies their value testnet are identical to their original network except for mining and marking genesis blocks if a new implementation works on the testnet it should also operate on the mainnet.",

Testnet is that you participate in the process of testing and evaluating the quality of a certain blockchain and you are called a tester. These days, serious and quality projects before the product launch eventually they find users to test their product and they will often have a reward to thank those who have shown interest in the project early stages of their project. Must say these days testnet is becoming more popular than airdorp or bounty and the rewards from testnet are well worth your efforts.",

It is one of the steps that developers of blockchains have to take to test the function of a blockchain network. The test is important so as to avoid the risk of losing real money - as it is carried out without using real crypto assets. Once the testing period is completed, the network will now be launched to mainnet. Tokens/coins used for testnets have no real value, while those used on mainnet have real value.

In general, testnets seek to guarantee accurate comparisons, take chances, identify the optimal model, and ensure quicker mainnet builds. To effectively test complex networks at scale, each blockchain network has its own testing methodology, standards, equipment, and certifications.Since Ethereum is a protocol, this implies that there are numerous separate \"networks\" that adhere to it but do not communicate with one another. You can use the network for use cases involving development, testing, or production. It is a unique Ethereum environment.

If you see testnet, then you are in test mode. This illustrates the mainnet mode will also work according to the ongoing testnet mode. This is not much different from the beta.If you create an app, before officially launching it to the public, then you must launch the beta version of the app as a feasibility test.Likewise on the Ethereum blockchain. Before the official version of the token is released to the public, a testnet version will be developed as a trial.",
