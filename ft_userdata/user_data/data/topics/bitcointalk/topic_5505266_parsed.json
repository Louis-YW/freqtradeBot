He simply wants to hoard it first, before the other countries such that we've got a higher accumulation of crypto as compared to the others.While this is definitely a softer stance as opposed to his previous perception of Bitcoin, he doesn't outright acknowledge the benefits of Bitcoin. I would very much prefer if his stand would be backed by the mention of the specific benefits of Bitcoin as compared to traditional fiat. Backing it by the fact that Bitcoin is a new form of currency, and that US has to be first seems to be superficial in nature.",

It looks like he is someone who until recently didn't know about Bitcoin much, nor did he care, but has been forced by electoral interest and is slowly learning things. But better that than having a Bitcoin hater as a candidate for US president and ahead in the polls. I wonder if he could become the first to print currency to buy Bitcoin as Saylor says.",

He doesn't understand Bitcoin most probably, but he can speak abundantly in favor of it because he's been told what to say. He's got speech writers and teleprompters. So he can shill for Bitcoin, make promises in favor of Bitcoin, present a vision for Bitcoin, but I bet he cannot speak of its specific features when he's not reading or when he's on his own because he probably doesn't have a wallet or hasn't made even a single Bitcoin transaction.

That is the property of the free market. For them to sustain that price, they would have to sustain the demand of Bitcoin. Once they are unable to purchase anymore, then the demand drops.Bitcoin's market cap is 1 trillion dollars as of now, and major institutional investors only hold a very small percentage, think 1%. They can continue to purchase, but it gets more and more expensive as they attempt to buy more Bitcoins. When the bubble pops, then they would be at the losing end. That is why companies evaluate and don't overpurchase Bitcoins.",

Is anyone noticing that whenever Trump mentions anything relating to Bitcoin, price just goes up on the air or am I the only one? He talked about paying US debt with Bitcoin, but there was no statement on how he intends to do it. I don't think it is possible to wipe $35 Trillion National Debt With Bitcoin. Maybe he has a plan to hodl the coin for a long time and use the profit to offset some of the debt. Trump is a politician that needs support and votes and he is using diverse means to get it, but the attention he is giving to Bitcoin might be an indication that he is interested in it.

Just like gold Trump is seeing Bitcoin as a future currency that will make determine how economical strong a country is. He doesn't want rival nations like China to stockpile more Bitcoin than the United States. This might be his reason for calling for the halting of Bitcoin sales.

I wonder why he would liken cryptocurrency to AI, are they the same? He just wants people and intending voters to perceive him as a crypto saviour, which is not so. Trump's presidency will never stop the US from clamping down on crypto fraud or regulating it, so I wonder what he is going to do differently if he becomes the president.Besides, if he claims that the US should not sell its crypto asset, for what use will that be for the rich US government that barely has $14B worth of Bitcoin and always wants a centralised system? This amount is even way more than what the US government splashes on foreign aid yearly.I wonder how the selling of Bitcoin affects the US investigation and advancement in blockchain technology so as to regulate it properly, so what is the point of Trump? To make matters better, the US is dominating in the crypto space with over 21% of the population already adopting it with a huge sum of money committed to it already. I wonder how they will miss out as he claimed.",
