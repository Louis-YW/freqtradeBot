The idea behind it is really interesting, it should be possible to merge every computer in the network into a neuromorphic supercomputer. has anyone of you heard about that or had experience with it?if anyone already has information about the coin, I would be really happy if you shared it with me! Thanks a lot!dear greetings Camila",
