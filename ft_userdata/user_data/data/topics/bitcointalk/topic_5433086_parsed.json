      "body": "It looks like miners moved to United States after China shuts Bitcoin Mining down.  It is possibly due to the lower electricity and of course Bitcoin mining in USA is legal making most of the mining farm company to move their farm in the country.  It was stated that miners will do well in New York and Texas[1].  Next to USA is Kazakhstan.I think there are country that has cheaper energy but the problem is the Bitcoin mining regulation. In addition here is the list of top 8 Bitcoin mining by countries and their hashes.1. United States: 35.4%2. Kazakhstan: 18.1%3. Russia: 11.23%4. Canada: 9.55%5. Ireland: 4.68%6. Malaysia: 4.58%7.

In Kazakhstan, a mining license is already required. There is a lot of unregistered mining in Russia, but next year there may be laws. It is better to choose a country where mining is not very developed and the government will not care about you",

However, there are some companies that I think offers cheaper than that you just need to find some legit colocation that offers cheap power.The US is not the best place if you are looking for cheap electricity rates most of them are in Asian countries like Iran which offers around 4 cents I guess.",

Can recommend a better mine.I like America and that's my dream to go there but regarding Mining equipments I think that Electricity and other such things are very expensive to other countries relatively. And I might say that I will Prefer Canada cause it's cheap and also better and there is more low temperature that is just good for the Mining Machines...But Despite that I have seen that Still united States is king with most Active miners in the world.and I am also still Impressed that Kazakhstan is in 2nd place and that is just a big milestone.",

How much is the electricity bill? Can recommend a better mine.Some new Miners moved to America because mining in their country was closed, maybe one of the reasons in this country is that electricity costs are relatively low and they decided to move to that country, and Bitcoin mining in the United States is Legal. besides, miners in the United States already know that they produce more of the highest Hashes;Top Bitcoin mining countries and the Hashes they generate  United States: 35.4% (USA topped the list)  Kazakhstan: 18.1%  Russia: 11.23%  Canada: 9.55%Actually there are also several mines that are not registered from the country.Maybe in terms of rules, in the future I think the State will make regulations stipulated in the laws of their respective countries for the issue of mining articles.Apart from the United States, several countries in Asia also facilitate electricity costs that are not so high, and some of them have low electricity costs, but the problem is Bitcoin mining regulations.I think choosing a mine where electricity costs are relatively low is the best strategy, because this will still be profitable even though the bearish market is in a fixed state, and very profitable if the market is bullrun. if the cost in your country is standard, I don't think this is a problem, it's just that you prepare as much as possible about how to manage it.",

How much is the electricity bill? Can recommend a better mine.Previously China was very pioneer in the mining sector but considering various issues, the Chinese government has banned all activities from Bitcoin mining to Bitcoin.  Among the reasons why the United States is currently leading the mining sector is the fact that the USA has large reserves of electrical power and the amount of electricity required for mining is not a problem for the United States.  Mining in America is still profitable for electricity power consumption, but the scarcity of electricity power in other countries will threaten mining in the future.",

Even USA is at the top doesn't mean you can just go there and earn a lot. And there are other counties that also have cheap electricity. But in the long run, you can't just get in the country and stay there forever to mine BTC. You need green card for to stay. And if we skip talking about that, then you need to focus on the mining rig. With a good rig, you can mine and compete with others easily.",

But if it's going to be expensive and your electricity bills will go to mining, I think it's useless.But as long as the climate of a country is cheap and cold, I think you can save on electricity in this scenario. However, it is still better to do some research so that you know which country to mine bitcoin effectively.",

Some pools blocked Russian IPs, but they didn't stop working with Russian miners. In Siberia, very large investments are spent on mining, because there is a lot of cheap electricity. I think that at the end of the year mining statistics will change a lot in favor of Russia.",
