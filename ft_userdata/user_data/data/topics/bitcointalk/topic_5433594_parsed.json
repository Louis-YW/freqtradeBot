      "body": "(Fun Only) As its stated on the OP!Well I hate to crash the party but, I've always known meta to be reserved for serious issues regarding the forum and certain observations, not an idea place to have fun except on April 1st (April fool's day) when Theymos gets to shake our legs in our boots with the unexpected in a serious way.So, this might not be the idea place to have this sort of Fun @OP. Perhaps reputation might do or even off-topic but, a guessing that won't do the job you intend for the thread. Either way, it doesn't change the fact that, what is appropriate is what you should do.Quote from: shahzadafzal on January 09, 2023, 09:56:19 AMFun fact:Quote from: shahzadafzal on January 09, 2023, 09:56:19 AMBitcoin was released on January 09 and I joined the bitcointalk forum on January 09..... call it a coincidence?But thank you.Another Fun fact for you!Today is January 09th and all these are along out on the same day. Perhaps we would have some other users that would create there accounts today and have yet another coincidence.Just so you know, you've made OP a promise in wishes. Hope you can keep tab on that and not fail your promise, Â Happy Account Creation Day Shahzadafzal!",
