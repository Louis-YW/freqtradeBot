  "content": "Clearly, the cryptocurrency market is experiencing a bear market. The term “bear market” is defined as a market that has lost more than 20% in a given year. Bitcoin is down -35% in 2022. The bear market has been a blessing in disguise in more ways than one. It is no coincidence that many firms are announcing their entrant into the crypto space. I think that they are taking advantage of the bear market. Listed below are two such companies.MoneyGramOn Nov. 1, 2022, MoneyGram announced the launch of a new service enabling consumers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrency via the MoneyGram mobile app. This new and innovative feature gives MoneyGram customers in nearly all U.S. states and the District of Columbia1 the ability to trade and store Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) by using the Company's leading mobile app.Western UnionOn October 25, reports revealed that Western Union, another cross-border remittance giant, filed three trademarks. The filing covered the management and exchange of digital assets and commodities derivatives, Issuing tokens of value, and brokerage and insurance services. Judging from the trademark filings, Western Union plans to offer crypto services. It is the firm’s latest attempt out of several previous ones to enter the crypto space.[/list]Kindly add the other companies that you think may have taken advantage of the bear market to get into crypto.https://bitcoinist.com/moneygram-will-allow-users-store-and-trade-bitcoin/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/moneygram-introduces-new-crypto-service-enabling-customers-to-buy-sell-and-hold-cryptocurrency-via-the-moneygram-app-301664682.htmlhttps://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-bear-market-opportunities-make-the-most-of-a-crypto-downturn/",

Companies that have good financial advisors will always tell them of cryptocurrency highlighting it as one of the core investment opportunities for the future. Companies and organisations wants to make profit so on the advice by financial advisor to take advantage of the bear market many companies have followed without making it known to the public, the companies that made their own public just decided to do so.",

Most who join in bull periods don't have the reserves to handle it or don't want to look like they're launching a pump and dump scheme (I think - although it does make it look more like that's what they're doing when they withdraw after large price move).",

It takes a while to implement things. And then get approval from the needed regulators. Still good in general for BTC, but the timing and market at the moment mean very little.-Dave",

What I want to say is that more than 1 year can pass until some new FOMO is created, and it is no secret that a lot of people invest in cryptocurrencies with the intention of short-term profit.It is known that these large companies evaluate their business several times a year, and if they conclude that something does not bring them income, they simply throw it out of their business. Many companies did this precisely with Bitcoin because they did not have good enough business results, especially during the bear market. If they already wanted to earn something (and they are certainly not Bitcoin fans), a little better timing would definitely make more sense.",

I mean, probably they gave lots of thought before taking advantage of the crypto market and they were just looking at the history of the crypto market and since it make sense to them, they conclude to join others who already doing this. As for the small investors, we need to carefully not to jump to any conclusion, because rushing to this hype will not bring us anything good.we still need proper research and patience to hold our horses before investing.",

Another one could be because of Recession looming about and how it could avoid fiat devaluation, so they just want to reduce the risk of by accepting payment in bitcoin. Thirdly it could be that they found out the cryptocurrency space doesn't not have the Tax inflicted on it just like Hoarding fiat. Most importantly I think they actually wants to draw in costumers to there brands because of the daily evolution of bitcoin and it mass adoption by people. Just like how social media has been used to lure people to some companies they might think people could just easily patronise them ones it has crypto payments options",
