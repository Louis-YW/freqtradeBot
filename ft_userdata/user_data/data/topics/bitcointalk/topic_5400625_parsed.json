Build slow, buy a new GPU for your PC and mine with it, then expand to a mining rig later.I agree now that the price of for example the Rtx 2060 Super 8 Gb is good enough to just test the waters and see for yourself.I would also suggest this journey/learning path,just upgrade your video card and see for yourself for a couple of months,if you like what you see,then most probably you can go ahead and build a full mining rig.",
