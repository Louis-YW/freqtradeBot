  "content": "I was going through a social media page and I came across this post immediately something very different surges into like a \"power\" or do I say something gingered and inspired me to drop it here to let does who have failed up on 9ja to learn how other are really commending and complementing on our country if not for our bad leaders.. And I quote the person saying \"..\"\"Nigerian's are the most educated immigrant group in the United States!' (MPI, 2022)You do not believe me?Let me challenge you!Ask three people in their circle where their lawyer, their surgeon, the owner of the tech start up, their child's teacher, their business mentor comes from (outside of their home country of course).I bet a 100 bucks that the answer is ... 'originally from Nigeria'! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬Over the years of doing business in Africa I traveled and done transactions in over 25 of them... where ever I go I find at least one Nigerian who is 'ahead of a the pack!If you go the the US, the UK, even to my father land Germany... you will find Nigerians striving.Why is that?Well, to me this doesn't come by surprise....because...Nigeria = plentifulNigeria = resilienceNigeria = never give upNigeria = tomorrow e go bettaThe spirit of Nigerians is incredible and I usually say that you can place a Nigerian into any environment he/she will strive! Watch and see...\" To read more click here, and this shows even though we don't believe in ourselves other people truly believes in us and they knows we can make a way were there seems to be no way or even take a Nigerian to the hardest place in any country, they can always survived ( we no dey carry last). At least for once celebrate yourself, like this another person dey celebrate us why we no go celebrate ourselves na abi you think say others no see wetin dey happened for we country?",

I'm a proud Nigerian with so much strength, wisdom, and talent. God took his time to bless us in so many unique ways that help us to survive in whatever situation we find ourselves in.One thing I love about my country people be say we de always believe say \"there is always a way out of every situation\" plus the mentality of \"if others have done it, we will do it\" de help us wela when we travel out.Nija na correct country but na just bad leaders spoil am.Nija na we country and we no de carry last.",

Nigeria is the most populated black nation in the world and there are many Nigerians that has done very well globally and those that hasn't really brought a good name to the country. The fact that people are judge or have a stereotype on where they come from or their religion has lead to so much negative effects, some part of the world fills Nigerians are scammers because of some people from Nigeria has giving that impression but that's not the case. Let's normalize not giving tags to what to expect from people based on their nation but let's actually judge individuals based on their own actions .",

Even though you take a Nigerian to hardest place they most survive and makes their names glitter not for bad but for good anyway so, be proud of your country and let bye gone be bye gone.",
