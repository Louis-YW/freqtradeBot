While the men have unlimited access to phones and information. This condition has limited the interest of women in the Bitcoin sector.",

I taught some girls about cryptocurrency and they are good traders and good investors, and am having a sister that’s into cryptocurrency investment and she is doing fine, but I don’t really know why women are not really interested in cryptocurrency maybe it’s because of the risk. We all know women with money, they don’t want anything that will tamper with there money, but men are great risk taker.",

This condition has limited the interest of women in the Bitcoin sector.Based on your statement, it seems that due to your cultural discrimination to women, causes them to not have access on free informations online where they can do their own research about crypto, which is true since learning Bitcoin could be done online. Even back in the days women discrimination is already a thing, they were restricted to go to school and their only job is to be a housewife. Which is not can't be considered in our current situation since there's already people who fought for the freedom and women empowerment. If your country is still in the era of women discrimination then its the worse. There's a lot of possibilities that women could do if they are not restricted in online like surfing in the web and learn how crypto works. Even not online, even other things, there's many women in the world that contributed a lot in the humanity. It would be better to raise the women empowerment in your country. Not only for them to have freedom just to learn Bitcoin, but for them to have their own decisions in life.",

      "body": "In my few short years as a cryptocurrency builder and trader all at the same time, I have had my fair share of females who dabble in the cryptocurrency world, and truthfully speaking, none of them are in passive roles like \"trading\". Most of them take up executive roles in startups which is something that is both inspiring and intimidating sometimes. I've taught a couple women too on how to trade cryptocurrencies in the past few years so there's that. The industry is pretty much riddled with males as much as females. It's just that the anonymity this industry boasts of is also acting as a form of double-edged sword that disallows women to get proper credit for their work sometimes, lest they risk being doxxed and having all their information released on the internet without their consent.",

There are survey results cited in the thread, there confirming that the dominance of women in trade is quite high compared to men.Quote from: pawel7777 on March 29, 2023, 09:27:20 PM\"Singaporean women ‘outperforming’ men in crypto trades, survey reveals\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/singaporean-women-outperforming-men-in-crypto-trades-survey-revealsThe dawn of mankind is officially here. A recent poll from Singapore revealed that women managed to outperform men in the manliest games of all - crypto trading:\"As per the survey data, 76% of women reported either making money or breaking even on their crypto investments, compared to just 72% of men\"Since it looks like the answers were self-reported, there's a chance that women may not be telling the truth, to make themselves look better. But maybe there's something in the female approach to trading that would explain it (i.e. higher risk aversion?).Link to the original survey: https://www.independentreserve.com/blog/news/independent-reserve-cryptocurrency-index-irci-singapore-2023There's a downloadable pdf, they're asking for name/email but don't verify, so you can put anything.It is also good to think that gender will not prevent you from getting involved in crypto trading, in fact there are many women who have been part of the team of a project till date. That is a fact although I am not too sure about the domination.",

      "body": "Of course women do. Though they have been slower to get in than men. In the early years most people who knew about Bitcoin were probably either in tech of finance. And those fields consist mostly of men. Also men tend to just by nature have a higher risk tolerance than women. For these reasons much more men are in Bitcoin/Crypto than women. Also some women have kind of got it in their head that crypto is a male thing simply because the early adoption was so heavily favored by men, so there are definitely some women out there who avoid it because they think it is some weird thing that only men get involved with, which is too bad for those women.There are plenty of women in crypto, and the ratio will even out over time as it goes more mainstream in the next couple decades. But for now it is still mostly men because adoption is still very early and few people even know what Bitcoin is so it still heavily favors the tech/finance/risk-okay people which are mostly men. But every year for now on this dominance of men should become less and less prevalent.",
