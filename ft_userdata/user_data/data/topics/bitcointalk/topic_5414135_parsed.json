  "content": "Could someone explain to me when a share is a block solution mining solo BTG (Equihash 144.5 algo)? Is there a way to know if you found a block by the value of the share you submit?I thought it works the same as on ETH, where you need to submit a share with a value equal or higher to the network difficulty to find a block; but I've submitted a 6.5M share when the network difficulty is around 500K and still didn't get the block.",
