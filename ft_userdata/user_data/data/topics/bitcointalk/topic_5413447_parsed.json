Why would I get a different app to do a transaction that I can already do straight from the Bank app itself without any additional benefit?",

And I guess, although this may highly vary from one country to another, a CBDC implementation does not eradicate payment solutions like the ones mentioned primarily because the government would most probably lack the ability to innovate and develop infrastructures that would effectively render these private companies useless. To my mind, and based on observation, the government would continue to accredit third party payment providers. As a matter of fact, I don't believe that a country implementing a CBDC would only allow a single government-operated wallet. It's likely that there'd be a number of them, privately-operated mostly.",

But having \"government approved\" wallet(s) for the CBDC is just a tiny step forward, and then the people will be able to pay with that wallet via smartphone, instead of paying with Google Pay/Apple Pay with the Visa/MasterCard cards enrolled.Quote from: Darker45 on September 14, 2022, 11:01:04 AMAnd I guess, although this may highly vary from one country to another, a CBDC implementation does not eradicate payment solutions like the ones mentionedIndeed, my use case works primarily inside the borders a certain fiat currency already works as legal tender.Quote from: Darker45 on September 14, 2022, 11:01:04 AMTo my mind, and based on observation, the government would continue to accredit third party payment providers.Then they may have no \"selling point\" for those CBDCs.

Banks wouldn't want people to have cdbcs, as they would lose clients.If cbdc can be equated with physical fiat, then bank savings still have an advantage in terms of providing passive benefits and other reward programs offered by private banks.Honestly I wouldn't deny the existence of a cbdc if it had become a priority use of those around me, but I would first see what a cbdc can offer especially management procedures and security compared to banks.",

No cryptography? That's wrongSomeone mentioned privacy. I don't know about other areas but in the Eurozone, if you read their very long white papers from the Parliament, privacy has to be 'a must' to consider for development. Of course, it won't be something 100% anonymous, but more than using a traditional bank account, and of course, less than using bank notes (they're not so crazy lol)Years ago, Hal Finney said something like:\"In the future, we will have 2 layers: the (crypto) currencies used by banks, and cryptocurrencies used by people\"See now in 2022 how this guy was so rightIf there is a German or French here, look for a recent documentary from Arte TV with the title in german \"Do we still need banks?\" and in French \"Avons nous encore besoin des banques?\"You will think about CBDC immediately.",

However, with more nations in the development and pilot stages, the adoption will likely accelerate quickly. Even though we are aware that this will still be subject to government regulation, offering a digital payment method is not a bad idea. If so, transactions made through it should be less difficult and more transparent than those made using fiat. In Nigeria where it has been launched, there is no distinction between it and fiat currency, since you are signing up and submitting your KYC, and your transactions can be tracked and monitored by the authorities.",

According to what Nigeria's CBDC (eNaira) was referred to, cyptocurrencies are banned in Nigeria, that eNaira is not a cryptocurrency but a digital currency that is making us of blockchain technology. They are even confusing themselves to let us know which is which. I am waiting for how the US CBDC would be designed. There are 18 designs now, we are going to finally know the perfect one they would choose.I see no reason for CBDC when fiat has been in digital form since many years ago that makes transactions easier and very much convenient.",
