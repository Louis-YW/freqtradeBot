Local news outlet The Standard reported that KenGen has space at its new industrial park in Olkaria, near its flagship geothermal power station, which could be rented to Bitcoin (BTC) miners.The Acting Director of geothermal development at KenGen Peketsa Mwangi said that his company was willing and eager to have the miners call Kenya home.Bitcoin is going more green, see a country electricity producer calling out for crypto miners to come to their country for crypto mining to mine with green energy, the electricity producer in Kenya, KenGen said 86% of their electricity generation are generated from renewable source. Bitcoin mining is becoming a business in the world that some organizations in a country see that they can make profit from. This will favour Kenya government in earning from bitcoin mining.",

I never knew that Kenya is a crypto friendly country. But it seems their tourism business was hit hard due to the covid restrictions and they have realized that they need additional sources of revenue. It's encouraging amidst the ongoing global concerns against crypto mining which is thoroughly baseless and probably funded by banking institutions. Way to go Kenya.",

When they talk about crypto Mining, you will hear about Asia (Mostly China). Europe and North America. Africa and South America rarely come up in the mining conversations, probably because it's barely a business venture there due to;1. High power prices2. Very high taxes on mining equipment imports and that revenue ends up in corrupt individuals pockets3. Instabilities in different regions4. No wide spread knowledge about Bitcoin mining yet",

But I looked at how Kenya stands on this issue and it seems that the location of the plant is still in a more temperate climate zone so the whole thing makes some sense.Yeah, speaking from experience too, it's the second coldest African country I've lived in (Ethiopia's frigging cold in winter). Compared to rest of Africa is much cooler in Kenya due to elevated land (for me, relatively anyway, from Southeast Asia, Kenya or at least Nairobi areas, it's really chilly. Right now actually 15 degrees Celcius, which is cooler than most air-conditioned places in SE Asia). Also it seems to be getting weirdly cold there -- 2 years ago massive hailstones destroying crops all around, snow occasionally since mid-2000s. So maybe it's less of an issue there (possibly even slightly more advantageous than in other parts of low-land Africa).",

The initial term of the contract is eight years. During the first four years, the effective cost of the electricity will be US$0.022 per kWh. there is no way for anything in Europe to compete with stuff like this.Quote from: Zilon on June 03, 2022, 01:54:36 PMRenewable energy is the best as it saves energy cost and consumption. This will mean more miners and less cost for transaction validation and confirmation. It doesn't work like that, the cost of mining has nothing to do with the fx fee.The only thing the cost of mining determines is the revenue and profit of miners, dictating so how big the hashrate is.The cost of each tx is influenced only by the activity on the network, there are 100tx in the mempool you can get a confirmation with 1 sat, and there are 100MB of more than 10sat/b prepare to wait, quite a bit.",

There is a need for experience in the environment, what I notice with this development is the fact that this will give miners in Kenya who are correctly making development of the mining farm or are already into crypto mining in some form. I know Kenya is a tech support country so there must be some indigenous miners who will want to cut costs and operate better they will take advantage of this opportunity.",

Already the Energy Company have got more green energy production and this is something positive about it. When it comes to supporting its own people, the company aims in bringing foreign investment into the company.
