Bitshares User Issued Assets (UIAs) were not Really Viable the way they were, and there was no Oraclization like there was for ETH and all the Others now. So I would want to know about these Things. Because once the Token were made here, we would want a Peggy on TRX and ETH and Everything. BSC is supposedly going to be less Criminal now too, so there might be some Things that can Start to Happen regarding like Building Apps and Everything, since they are supposed to Help keep all the Criminals away that are there just asking you to Send them $500 so you can get $2,000, or Your Bank info, or whatever they are Asking for. And just Generally allow the Market to be more of a Civilian Thing, and not Hosted by Criminal Organizations. They don't want Hamas to have a Coin for Example, that is Part of what the FBI was Talking about with BSC.",
