I don't know how to do it on Windows, so you have to figure it out yourself. Another solution would be to use the second option for authentication(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md#torpassword-authentication). You can generate the hashed password with: Code:tor --hash-password <password>Run the command where there is tor.exe located. Then put the output(e.g. HashedControlPassword 16:xxx) of it on the Tor configuration file(torrc). Lastly, update your bitcoin config to include torpassword=<password>.",

Do I have to make an edit in torrc to make hashpassword auth available?Yes, that error indicates you haven't set up the password auth method on the torrc. You should put the generated hashed password on there.Code: (torrc)HashedControlPassword 16:xxx",

This is the IP and port of a Bitnodes peer that is connected to me (and might be running in a Hetzner data center based on the 88.99 subnet, not that its relevant).If you connect using onlynet=tor, it might prevent your node from connecting to the IPv4 address.",

If I keep port 8333 on port forwarding I still get IPv4 inbound connections, but if I delete it from port forwarding, all inbound IPv4 dissapear, it remains only Onion Networks (Sometimes 1 single connection, at the best 2, but normally 0; besides the full/block relays) and I believe that's a problem.

But establishing only 1-2 inbound connections it's too low (I believe).127.0.0.1 onion addreses are merely making an inbound connection using the Tor Network using a random port on your PC. They are localhost because your Tor relay is running on 127.0.0.1:9050 [the default Tor control port].Remember that peer discovery depends on fetching the peer lists of other nodes that you are connected to, so if the TOR nodes you are connected to are only connected to IPV4 nodes, then you're not going to get TOR nodes from them, until they happen to connect to a TOR peer by accident. So you should leave IPv4 on until you notice that a sizeable amount of TOR nodes have been discovered (at least half a dozen).",
