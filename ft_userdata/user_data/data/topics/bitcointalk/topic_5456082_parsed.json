  "content": "Hey guys, We currently have a limited stock of 150 miners left in our farms which are based in Dubai, China, Russia.We are the only major company for crypto in Dubai which have licence. You buy a bitcoin miner from us within two years you will have double the investment, our miners hover around 56% profit per year after electricity costs and management. Paid out quarterly unless you hold more than 10 bitcoin miners with us than we can do it once a month.We have currently around 50 happy clients that are recurring and investing more.Any messages feel free to contact me.Thank you,BlockFarms",

Why do you sell magic ASICs like this? Use them yourself!What kind of idiots do you take us for? Where did you get this 56%? You don't know the price per kw/h that your potential customers are getting, you don't know the future of difficulty adjustment, and above all, you want us to believe that you have access to better-performing chips than those known on the market?No one is going to put money down here for your scam, it's not even at the level of a good joke. It's more worthy of Facebook than Bitcointalk, we're not that naive here.",

      "body": "OP, people will and should be skeptical due to your financial assumptions. Combine that with the lack of any real information about your company and yeah I would say something does seem off. One would assume that even a new(ish) company would put up a link to a website showcasing their locations and services at a minimum.Best of luck.",
