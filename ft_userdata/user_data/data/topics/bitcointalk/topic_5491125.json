      "body": "the mainboard(controller board) that connects the hashboards are different for bitcoin asic vs ltc asic. so its not just a firmware update, you need to create a whole new mainboard ..or patch things together using a third board, then redesign the chassis box to get it to all fit snug and not overheat each other.. (a whole R&D process)in short, far more simple to just buy 2 devices and keep them separate as the R&D costs to make them compatible in one unit with one controller board would waste time,effort and cost of any advantage you would hope to achievefor instance the litecoin device emulates(in design and aesthetics of a) a personal WI-fi router so might aswell just use LTC miner as your home wifi router and then have your btc asic connect through the router to reach the internet",
