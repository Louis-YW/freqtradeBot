  "content": "I will buy one RTX3080/RTX3090 for me and my son for playing games.If there is a miner who has stopped mining and has a card for good money, write me, I would buy one piece if works ok.I live in Czech Republic so within the European Union, not outside the European Union due to vat and tax.I would prefer the RTX3090 because of more VRAM, more ready for future games that need more memory. But it all depends on the price. If someone were to offer an RTX3080 for a bargain, I wouldn't mind buying an RTX3080 as well.",
