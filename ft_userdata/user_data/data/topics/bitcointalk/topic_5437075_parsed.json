  "content": "Those who are in the crypto space for over 5 years can actually understand the question more clearly than others.We have seen that from the last 2/3 years, each day new and new coins are introduced in the market and many of those coins claimed that they are depended on actual utility, etc their ICO price is even higher as well when they list the coin on an exchange then the Initial price almost start from $0.5 - $1 or above like EWT/VICA, etc and there are many others, but at the end, their prices dumped to a very low like reached to bottom and some of those coins even disappeared from the exchanges, CMC and even their websites are deleted.On the other hand, we saw there are coins that are considered MEME coins like Doge, and their price are low, everyone can buy them, and also they are still present on the TOP exchanges.So, the main issue here is that Senior Crypto users/Investors/Trades can predict the price of new coins, read the White Paper and then take decisions regarding investment, but the problem is for the Newbie/New users as they don’t have enough knowledge and can’t be able to predict/analysis the price and at the end, they just lose the investment.How to stop that kind of scam? And what is the proper way to save the Newbie from the honeypot?",

And what is the proper way to save the Newbie from the honeypot?Senior crypto enthusiast, investors, and traders doesn't have 100% guarantees they can predict the price of new coins.Actually everyone can read the whitepaper and there's nothing new from each project to other project, it's start from the general fake goals of the project, praising their coin over Bitcoin, promise to give a higher APY among other cryptos and the last they will create similar roadmap, token characteristic, funding, fake utility etc.If you and everyone want to stop this scam, just avoid any altcoins listed on CMC or Coingecko and only stick with Bitcoin. When there's no one buy the coin and everyone already lost hope in shitcoin, the developer wouldn't create new coin since it just wasting his time and he wouldn't get anything.",

However, it is not a biggest or only decisive component and it must interact with other components to make value and success for a coin / token.Without utility, it has zero value and zero price on market, zero trading volume too.With utility, let's see other factors like tokenomics and security that are very important. With a broken tokenomics like GameFi projects, tokens will be dumped by gamers very easily and it is not good for token value and price on market.With bad security, projects and their treasuries, smart contracts can be hacked, compromised and consequently, tokens can be over minted by hackers than dumped on market. It's not good for token price.",

But most of the ads offering new investment coins these days are giving more visibility to their partner list. This seems to have become a quick research standard for most new investors, but in reality it is difficult to find investors who can look deeper into the project. Even in long term goals, that should not be the only consideration of feasibility and certainly not a recommendation from a \"senior\" investor.",

Newbies should learn it cause in the past most ICO doesnt have a utility but gain so much hype and thats because of community, influence and marketing. We cant blame them to jump the bandwagon especially many CTs are good to lure newbies with their words and simple but attractive marketing approach.",

Year's back is was DeFi, NFTs, Meme, Gaming etc, always expect a new narrative, that's the key to making better gains in this market.

Howeber if it is for short term investment, xoins without utility are the ones having high rate of increase especially during bullish market. Each type of token has its own advantage depending on its concept but bottomline is which token will be having more demand on the eyes of the investors since demand will be the determinant of profit in this industry. Some coins from tokens with utility are not even growing through years, so still, no certainty of profit to both with and without utility.",

There's no way to predict their future price as they are still new and they are still working with their credentials and trust in the market. If in doubt, better not to participate and buy instead the top coins that already proves a lot in the market, it may not be a guaranteed profit but at least the risk are not that high.",
