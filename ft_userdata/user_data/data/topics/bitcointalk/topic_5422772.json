  "content": "I am trying to help a guy with a project. He mined bitcoins back in 2010, 2011 or maybe 2012. Not for a long time, so its not like there should be worth that much but still, you never know, and we want to at least give it a try and see if we could find this potential money.So we are trying to figure out where it was mined, first of all. So I was hoping maybe the more experienced members on this forum would could give us any idea about what websites or apps that were available at the time. Maybe he could then recognize it. So we are looking for any information, whatever it is, that could help us and give us a clue where to start.I guess it is very hard, but it would be great to at least know something more so we know if it is possible or not.",

I can promise you that this is not a scam. Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 23, 2022, 11:10:57 AMDepending on pool he used, he also need either Bitcoin address or username/password to withdraw mined Bitcoin. You also could check list of pool which doesn't require account at https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/10996.Thank you very much, will check that out!Quote from: mocacinno on November 23, 2022, 11:15:28 AMIn ~2010 it's also possible he was just solo mining...

I will make a new subject in the mining category and hopefully come back with more questions if this situation develops!",

Maybe, maybe not.In general though?  Yeah, I suspect a lot of these \"Someone I know was mining in 2007\" and \"Someone I know received some bitcoins back in 2005\" messages (years chosen for comical effect) are related to either the friend being scammed, the poster being scammed, or an attempt to scam unsuspecting members of the forum.Quote from: highfarmer on November 23, 2022, 01:52:04 AMI am trying to help a guy with a project. He mined bitcoins back in 2010, 2011 or maybe 2012. The more they can remember about that time, the better the chance of figuring it out.If they started in 2010, then they were almost certainly CPU mining with just about any desktop computer. There's a very good chance they were solo-mining using Bitcoin-Qt and any bitcoin they successfully mined are stored on the hard drive of the computer they were using at the time (and nowhere else). Mining would have been as easy as just downloading the Bitcoin-Qt software and runing it.If they started in very late 2010 or early 2011, then there's a pretty good chance that they were using a computer that had a very good graphics card.  In that case, they may have had to download some specialty mining software along with Bitcoin-Qt and needed to figure out how to configure it. Around this time the first pool (Slush's Pool) started, so it's possible they may have configured their equipment to use that pool.By mid-2011 FPGA mining was catching on and CPU mining was all but dead.  GPU mining was still viable, but it was fading fast. The chances that they were pool mining is increasing at this point, and there were an additional 2 or 3 pools that opened up I think.By early 2013, ASIC were created, and mining quickly moved from CPU, GPU, and FPGA to ASIC. The return on mining without ASIC quickly became meaningless. Quite a few more pools  started opening up, some of the more popular being F2Pool and Antpool.",

At one point I had 70 BTC but I sold them all long before BTC broke 1000.The pool I used was the Eligius pool aka LukeJr's pool.In 2012 until 2014ish I was getting small payments of BTC every day - like .01 - .10 BTC, but then eventually difficulty and electricity made it unprofitable. I still have the HashFast in storage but it's basically an expensive paperweight at this point.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Eligius The upshot of Eligius pool was that you didn't need to register for an account. You could just have an address and then the coins were mined directly into it.",

At one point I had 70 BTC but I sold them all long before BTC broke 1000.The pool I used was the Eligius pool aka LukeJr's pool.In 2012 until 2014ish I was getting small payments of BTC every day - like .01 - .10 BTC, but then eventually difficulty and electricity made it unprofitable. I still have the HashFast in storage but it's basically an expensive paperweight at this point.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Eligius The upshot of Eligius pool was that you didn't need to register for an account. You could just have an address and then the coins were mined directly into it.WOW, you got the history down, that's great info.",

I only needed to supply my own mining payout address of my own non-custodial wallet. I don't remember all details, maybe some minimal registration was needed to be able to view your own mining stats and request a payout when minimal payout limit was reached.Are you too lazy to search pool announcement threads here at bitcointalk?Good luck with your 17BTC... not your keys, not your coins...",
