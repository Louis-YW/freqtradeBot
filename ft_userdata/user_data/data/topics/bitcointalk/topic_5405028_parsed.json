  "content": "I was watching the News days ago and an incident that occurred at the World Championships in Budapest was flashed. Something I would refer to as an ugly accident involving Anita Alvarez of USA who sank slowly down to the depth of the pool in the process of the on going competition.In the process of her sinking, her coach Andrea Fuentes  who without a second thought immediately dove straight into the pool to rescue her.Picking some keynotes about the story I had to liken it to the cryptocurrency community with the importance of having a mentor or coach which to some persons they see no necessity in it with reasons personal to them.In this keynotes I observed that:1> Andrea Fuentes as a coach had a deep understanding of Anita as her coach. Knew before anyone else could that Anita don't stay under water longer than she already has, and immediately came in to her rescue while others innocently watch.2>  Anita's coach spontaneously took the decision of diving into the pool to help out without other thoughts running through the mind of either going in or not to.3> Lastly, Anita was saved by no one else but her coachIn cryptocurrency trading today we have a lot of newbies that are currently drowning just like Anita but with no one to come to their rescue; drowning maybe they never had the opportunity of having a mentor or coach while engaging into cryptocurrency investment or probably they never saw any need for one.My candid advise to newbies and some other person's is that, just in case you have  no mentor/coach and feel the need for one, then don't shy away from looking out for one, someone with wealth of experience here in the bitcointalk forum.Secondly, those with varse knowledge and wealth of experience should endeavor to see need to having a mentee too.N/B:The bottom line here is that, we rise also by raising others. Finally, I want to use this opportunity to appreciate everyone in the forum who in one way or the other played an impact in my progression to my new rank as a MEMBER, about two days ago.Am grateful for all the support.",

      "body": "A swimming and a crypto mentor is two wholly different things. A personal mentor/coach is not really important in cryptocurrency, and could not only be counter-productive, but risky for newbies, mind you that most newbies do not know a lot about security, privacy and anonymity, thus they might give up some of that to the person they consider a mentor, and that might prove costly in the long run.Having said that, it is prolly better to learn by yourself, and even if you'd want to get a mentor, it shouldn't be a personal one, it could be someone you admire from afar, and try to learn from. Mind you also that basically copying someone's strategies doesn't help you learn, but in hindsight limits your knowledge.",

      "body": "The importance of having a mentor/coach cuts across all works of life, but the truth remains that not everyone will see the need to, some persons can do better on their own. Identify the category you fall under, if you are the type that require a mentor or coach, do your research properly and make an appropriate decision for you. Remember that you do not need to have just one mentor or coach, and you do not need to have too many mentors, just one mentor or a few couple of mentors (a few) is ok. With a mentor, your learning process can be facilitated and you can choose to learn from a particular person's experience, the importance cannot be over emphasized. Your mentor can also be someone online or someone you know personally.",

      "body": "A mentor, a coach, a guide, a role model whatever one chooses to call them is good. They are all important in our different cryptocurrency journey. There's a quote that says, a coach has failed more times than the student has tried. A red flag would be if your cryptocurrency coach can't share their personal experiences with failure or mistakes in the crypto space and then give you practical tips on how to avoid them. Above all, be twice as careful and thrice as smart.",
