  "content": "The bookmaker froze my bets for almost a month, which won. And after sleeping a month, he sent a letter about the violation of the rules, in which it is written about the gaming syndicate and about arbitration situations and about automated software. In general, just like many fraudulent bookmakers say \"You are guilty, we will not prove it.\" And winning bets were assigned the status of \"Loss\". $358 stolen. There is nowhere to complain, because they do not have a license. I just want new customers to know that the office without evidence and only at its own discretion can take money and easily write down bets as lost ones. It's even worse than a refund. All bets that the client makes, the this casino has the right to take for itself, simply by calling you an arbitrageur.Bookmaker's answer:Hello,Our technical and risk management departments have noticed that you were repeatedly violating clause 2 of the GENERAL RULES. Accordingly, we have deducted a number of your bets to cover the company’s losses caused by your actions. The decision is final. We strongly recommend you not to violate the company's rules in the future.Best regards, Karin!https://i.postimg.cc/MTGx0xg4/1.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/2ysDfW3R/2.jpgYou can easily find out the result of these matches on the Internet and make sure that my bets are won.https://egamersworld.com/counterstrike/match/apeks-rebels-vs-mouz-nxt-finished-4ytZU6BzxmThttps://egamersworld.com/counterstrike/match/mibr-academy-vs-00-prospects-finished-4kn_U6rflX6I didn’t even know before that the bookmaker itself can change the status of bets, regardless of the result of the matches.Although the bookmaker does not argue that the bets won, he just decided not to pay and count the bets as a loss, for, as he argued, \"to cover the company’s losses caused by my actions.\" And I was just betting. My only mistake is that I did not study enough forums to collect information about this bookmaker before registering there.",

      "body": "I read the OP and have to say I have no recollection of a website called Sportbet.one but if it is a deliberate play on the Sportbet.io name in the hope of them getting extra customers by deception from search engines, then as a rule I would avoid those types of websites.Will you now be able to post again but this time explaining what it is you want to do or what it is you want to achieve because it remains unclear. If the sole purpose of the post was to \"I just want new customers to know that the office without evidence and only at its own discretion can take money and easily write down bets as lost ones. It's even worse than a refund.

Screenshots from the accounts area showing bets placed and payments sent along with transaction ids would be a good place to start. If you have a valid case please prove it with evidence and I am sure members from the forum will back you.Quote from: nnd001 on November 19, 2022, 01:06:29 PMThe bookmaker froze my bets for almost a month, which won.

You have violated our rules by using 3rd party software which detects arbitrage situations and makes auto bets in these situations. This forbidden activity caused losses to our company. We have calculated and deducted the amount of that loss from your account. Please, don't violate our rules in the future.The OP is discussing the allegation in that thread too when he really should have kept everything in one thread where the matter could be discussed. I think Sportbet.one have made their feelings on the subject known in their own thread.From what I read, it seems the OP still has access to his account but is being asked to not cheat again. Sportbet.one did not provide any evidence that the OP cheated but the above is what Sportbet.one said in their reply to the OP.",
