  "content": "I should have received a mining payment from two days ago and I know sometimes 2miners delays the payment but it has been two days,now today afternoon at 1 PM I will receive another payment but yet the first one is unprocessed so far,what can be the problem,maybe the massive Bitcoin price crash but that should not affect fundamentally the pool.",
