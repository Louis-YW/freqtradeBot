Additionally, there are some titles of posts that are just poorly written. Even though I am not 100% guilt-free, I still plan to post this because I believe we will benefit from it.#1: Be concise - Don't try to cram information into your title and don't try to communicate more than 1 key take-away in your title.#2: Minimize the number of words in your title - Good thing that the Forum allows for only 80 Character limit.#3:  Be specific - Do not beat around the Bush#4:  No punctuation marks - especially full stops#5: Use an active verb #6: No filler words  - Examples - Very, Basically, So, Just, Really, Highly, #7: No acronyms  - Do you have any other rules you follow when writing a post title?Note - It was Dr Anna's post that gave me the idea for this  post.",

      "body": "You don't really need to have a good title as long as the title is on topic nothing more nothing less. Nore important is that your post should be clear and easy to understand ecem though you write it like wall of text. Sometimes, some topics need more explaination rather than using short text or a summarized version. What most people doesn't like is that you use a clickbait title which made many people to see it and then very disappointed when they read OP which is full of text copied from another source rather than making a summarized of the topic. In short, the title I will use os direct to the point.",

According to the source you linked, there are two more \"rules\" that you didn't mention:Quote#9: The level of jargon in the title should match the target audience#10: The title should adhere to your target journal's guidelinesI think you're right that there are some important things to consider when writing a title. However, I think the most important rule for submitting topics here is to make sure that your title clearly and accurately reflects the content of your post. If you're writing for a general audience, it is acceptable to be more creative with your title. But if you're writing for a more specialized audience, like scientific journals, then it makes sense to use more formal language.",

You're right because I've seen alot of people writing post that does not correspond to the title given, but in most cases for this kind of situations, over too know is what some people try to do but deviated rather from the main idea unknowingly to them just in the name of i too know, you also don't have to complicate a topic before it will seem to carry a semantic meaning in your presence, just a simple presentation in simple terms is ok than grammatical wrong title for posts.Quote from: Davidvictorson on December 03, 2022, 04:00:55 PMDo you have any other rules you follow when writing a post title?Don't ever exargerate a topic Don't use symbols or smileysDon't write a sentence for topicCorrect grammatical errors Let your title carry the same intended contents.",

Although, if a person is training towards writing journals they can practice with the forum by consistently writing catchy topics. However, I'll have to disagree, both here and the source, on kicking out adjectives and adverbs entirely on a topic can dull readers impression of clicking an article.Descriptive words are vehicles to crafting catchy topics.

Even the most poorly constructed article in terms of the writers arrangements still goes viral in the forum so far as the information the person is trying to pass is reliable and informative enough",
