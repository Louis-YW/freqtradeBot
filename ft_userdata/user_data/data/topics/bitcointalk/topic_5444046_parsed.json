The bounty manager cannot pay you your rewards if you violate the terms and rules of the campaign or have done illegal methods. Before you blame the managers, you must blame yourself because they have the right to prevent you from any bounty campaigns you participate in or not distribute coins to you. Again, you have to abide by the rules of any bounty and not try to cheat, and you will receive your tokens in due time like other honest bounty hunters.",
