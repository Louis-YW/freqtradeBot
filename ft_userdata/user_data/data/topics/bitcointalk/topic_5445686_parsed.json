In China, people choose auspicious days before doing important things, such as getting married, opening a company, signing important contracts, going out for important occasions, etc. The Chinese Almanac is a mysterious and powerful tool that can predict natural disasters, astronomical phenomena and feng shui directions.

Among them, NFT is one of the most popular applications in the past 3 years, which provides the uniqueness and irreplaceability of digital assets. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology especially the emergence of ChatGPT, many picture-based NFTs may lose their original meaning because they are just simple pictures and have no practical use scenarios. Only NFTs with technical background will be meaningful.In the traditional sense, NFT usually refers to digital artwork or collectibles, such as digital pictures, audio, video, etc. These digital assets are sold and traded on the blockchain through smart contracts, and due to their unique properties, they can achieve the authentication of digital assets and the tamper-evident nature of transaction records. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, people can easily use AI technology to generate a large number of similar digital artworks. These generated digital assets may be beautiful and have some artistic value, but they do not have actual use scenarios and values.In contrast, NFT with technical background has more practical application value. For example, in the game industry, NFT can be used to represent virtual items in the game, such as game props and equipment, so as to realize the construction of a virtual economic system. At the same time, NFT can also be applied to scenarios such as identity authentication and traceability tracking to provide users with more secure and credible services.In addition, with the development of blockchain technology, NFT is also gradually expanding its application areas. For example, some digital assets with practical use, such as properties and cars, can also be traded and confirmed by means of NFT, providing new possibilities for the digitization of traditional assets. Recently, there is also a ChinesealManac NFT that can divine, and I believe that more practical NFTs will appear one after another, so that the benign development will be more helpful to the whole blockchain. In particular, ChatGPT's addition to the more thoughtful new NFT to become the mainstream of the market.In short, although the development of artificial intelligence technology has brought some impact on picture-based NFT, NFT with technical background still has a broader application prospect. With the development of blockchain technology, NFT will gradually come out of the category of digital artwork like simple avatar pictures and become an important part of the development of digital economy.",
