  "content": "Bitcoin increased very significantly in January which we all expected, but the much increase from $16500 to $24000 made some people to think that February is going to be less volatile but which might still be a little bit bullish, surprisingly that that was what happened in February as bitcoin increase further but not getting further than $25,250. People expected $25000 to be a strong resistant price because it was when bitcoin falled below it since last year in August.So what next in March?In March, is Bitcoin going above $25000, going back to or going below $20000?In the last 4 cycle bull bear period, bitcoin later still fall below an unexpected price again which was significantly low. Bitcoin may still increase further, but after the increment, can it later fall below $17000 again?Also we have 2023 price guess and it continues: Bitcoin price guess, 2023",

Bitcoin may still increase further, but after the increment, can it later fall below $17000 again?Today Bitcoin had touched the price of $24K even if only briefly and I think that in this month it is still very possible for Bitcoin to pass $25K again even though there is always a correction after an increase occurs. Because as long as bad news no longer affects many people and many Bitcoin holders, it will be easier for Bitcoin price recovery to occur, although not in a short time.Because upgrading slowly but having stronger resilience will always be better than upgrading in an instant but not having long endurance in Bitcoin. Well, in this month I have more faith in an increase in the price of Bitcoin than a decrease in the price to the bottom area although it is still possible to happen.",

      "body": "The monthly candle for February turns into a huge indecision candle when you view the price chart in monthly time frame. This kind of candle show a strong trend reversal  against the current rally since buyers is losing confidence to buy more above 25K. I believe the price will be below 20K or above 26K since this month will be decision time for the next price direction for Bitcoin. I highly believe that price will dump this March and the strong opening of the monthly candle is a clear sign that there will be a sell off soon.",

March is a month that is not expected to be quite supportive of price increases, but nevertheless we never know how the trend changes and it shouldn't always be the same.I don't really care about the odds up or down, but if they are not long term investor then they should consider setting cut losses to not lose out.",

Moreover this year it is predicted that Bitcoins will touch the ATH. Bitcoins follow the 4 year pattern graph and this year it has to go up. So like February, if March also start with green candles, then it will be a celebration for the Bitcoin holders. Bitcoins just need to break the resistance and come out of this 25k usd price segment.

But in any case, it's a barrier that we are going to break again and again and maybe we got lucky this March that once we breach it, we can have a sustain rally up to $28k.
