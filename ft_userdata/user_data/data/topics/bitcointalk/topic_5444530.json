Therefore, I would not categorically state that if bitcoin falls to 10 dollars altcoins will die.we are only talking theoretically here. because right now, that scenario is very far from happening. there's possibility that btc will indeed become obsolete in the future, and be replaced by a new one. we can't tell that yet. possibly that a new alt or new currency will be introduced to the humankind, who knows? but more then likely, a lot of alts already died at that point.",

The 10$ target for bitcoin is also a crazy idea. at that price 1 whale can buy every single coin and manipulate price as much as he wants (including pumping it back to 1 mln $).",

When the price of bitcoin goes on high during the bull run, alts do come with it, right? And if bitcoin goes $10 soon, the price of altcoins are gonna be cheaper than what it is right now. But here's the thing when bitcoin drops to $10, there will be a lot of people that will be quick to buy those cheapest bitcoins in the market ever. They've seen it not just once not just twice but many times that it has recovered from its dump and that's why it's not gonna be a matter of price if that happens especially for bitcoin and, I think that the same scene might be created for some few altcoins that's also known.",

So according to this relation if bitcoin become down the  surely altcoins will accommodate this changes in price but those tokens which have already lower price will become more in dip so as bitcoin reduces 10 dollars then already reduce tokens will completely loss their value and now it will be very difficult for those coins to return back to its original position.",

Markt marker would suffer the most losses. BTC price currently is $25k and Ethereum is $1,600 so do the math, if BTC drops to $10 then Ethereum Ethereum would likely trade at $0.6 or less, so at what price would most of these Altcoins trade, Zero.",

If a market has a day when Bitcoin drops to $10, more than 90% of altcoins will die.Even in better market, in normal bear market, there are thousand of altcoins die each year.How many cryptocurrencies have failed? is a good insight report from Coingecko but their report does not give anything new.
