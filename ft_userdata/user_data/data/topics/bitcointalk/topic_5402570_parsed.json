Because we have goals that go beyond your reasons not to sell them today. A holder with high self-confidence knows when to let go when he wants to. Not with theory or proverbs alone. We have a bigger goal to release and how much you have sold still can't beat Bitcoin holders.",

If you bought bitcoin in the 40k range, holding it until 25k below is only your choice since you didnt made profit. So whats the best approach? Minimize your loss at selling 40k-35k range then buy near at 25-21k. You wont have an assurance that it will increase asap but it gives you hope that you will make more profit once it bounce back. Again hodling is not for all kind of people in crypto.",

It's astonishing that they're fearful to accumulate when the market is down but excited when it's up. It's as if they have a large bag to cash out when they haven't bought any at floor prices or near it.

Well, we all do have not the same view of the market.

So we indeed endure that long bear market and we will do it again this year. There are reasons that the price is really going down hard, but we can flip it out and turn it into a positive by taking this opportunity to accumulate. Our entry point is obviously lower, and then we just HODL and wait till after next halving and see our profits grow.",

BTC has brought so much opportunity to everyone and at this time, a perfect opportunity to buy. Remember when bitcoin was on its ATH, people are telling me that if it was low or they should have bought it when it was low. Now that it is low, they're still thinking if they should buy or not. That's okay if they don't want to buy and are only waiting for another dip because they are not convinced that this ain't the bottom yet. Quote from: virtualdn on June 14, 2022, 01:03:35 PMLet them stay poor.Well, I wish them luck and soon they will come to realize that all of those people telling them to buy bitcoin now will be remembered by them are correct. And by that time, they're going to regret that they should have listened to any of us. There's no need to panic and keep holding as if this is like a life bet that we need to see until it goes back to the top again.",
