But you can still use bitcoin to pay on some websites. Also you can decide to settle some deals with someone that you know that knows about bitcoin with bitcoin. Bitcoin is frequently used for purchases and payinfor services in some countries. Some countries are very bitcoin friendly.Quote from: find_the_trust on March 18, 2024, 07:31:56 AMWas the initial design of bitcoin intended for use as a form of payment?That is what that was said but those that designed bitcoin design it to be an investment. Quote from: find_the_trust on March 18, 2024, 07:31:56 AMWhat aspects contribute to making bitcoin a viable payment option?Bitcoin is a viable payment option but the fee is getting high without going down as usual as it was before. Lightning network is one of the ways bitcoin payment can be better.Quote from: find_the_trust on March 18, 2024, 07:31:56 AM I know that currently, bitcoin is seen more as an investment rather than a means of payment.

I know that currently, bitcoin is seen more as an investment rather than a means of payment. Is that correct?As time passes on bitcoin keeps increasing in value, making investors to see it as more of an investment than a payment method. However, bitcoin is still used for an alternative payment method everyday by business owners wide world. This is because it is easy to transfer a huge amount of bitcoin easily than using a third party which might raise eye browns. Bitcoin as a payment option will keep on increasing because there are people who love privacy in their financial life. It is the rich business people that uses it more as a payment option as that is why you are seeing some businesses that accept bitcoin as an alternative payment method. Ferrari accepts payment in bitcoin. Everybody has a reason why they adopted bitcoin. I believe with time, it will be used more as an investment because of the high profit that it generates with time-line. This forum also uses bitcoin from payment, and also with some users here. Transaction fee is now becoming a barrier for small businesses using it as a payment option.",

If you read this original bitcoin white paper Satoshi mentioned it there What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.

I know that currently, bitcoin is seen more as an investment rather than a means of payment. Is that correct?You can't always get the most accurate answer for this sadly, but I can drop my own point of view, Bitcoin has three features that can help people depending on what they want.1. Bitcoin can double or triple your money if you invest when its cheap and sell when it's high in price, you can make Bitcoin your investment haven.2. If decentralization is what you care about, Bitcoin is here to serve you right. 3. You looking for a good store of value? Bitcoin seem right as a true digital gold. 4. It can be use as a means of payment, its just left for both sides to accept and receive as a means of payment. So what's left now is what you want from Bitcoin, if none of these isn't what you are looking for then start looking into something else, whichever way people sees Bitcoin is left for them, as for me, it's a good investment choice, store of value and also fits my decentralization needs.",

It seems simple, but upon deeper reflection, it is not simple at all. People believe that the price of Bitcoin will rise, which is why more people buy and hold it. However, Bitcoin does not have any practical applications in real life. Many wealthy individuals profit from this belief.",

Bitcoin is primarily seen as an investment because to its volatility and capital gains. Apathy against its use for daily transactions stems from this investment-centric viewpoint. The hefty fees and empathy for people who've dealt with them explain why Bitcoin hasnt become a popular payment option. Transaction prices are \"insane,\" especially for modest purchases, and a major obstacle. The issue is consumer perception and economic viability, not merely technology. Bitcoin has been tested as a payment system, but its high fees and investment status prevent its acceptance in regular business.

Was the initial design of bitcoin intended for use as a form of payment? What aspects contribute to making bitcoin a viable payment option? I know that currently, bitcoin is seen more as an investment rather than a means of payment. Is that correct?Before it becomes widely used for payments it has to be widely owned as an investment/store of value/savings. We are still very far from the first condition. Probably less than 1% of the world owns Bitcoin. Even if you take out the children in the population, adoption still is probably only right around 1.0%. 1% of the adult population, spread all over the world. That's not nearly enough density of ownership for merchant adoption, which is of course required for people to make payments.Specifically, what we need to have Bitcoin being used regularly for payments is:1. Cheap fast transactions (Lightning Network ✅ and other solutions like that)2. As said above, enough people owning bitcoin - still many years away from this3. To add to #2, enough people owning bitcoin for a long enough period of time, cuz people are only going to want to spend their bitcoin once they are easily in the green and not worried about spending at a loss. Because a lot of the whole point of Bitcoin is to use it as savings to gain money while you are holding, so at least in more economically stable countries, people will only bother spending bitcoin they've been saving for years and have seen plenty of value appreciation on, though les economically stable countries people may not care so much because they would just be trying to get out of their weak currency/corrupt banks. So let's say that delays the payment use case for one to two market cycles, so 4-8 years delay beyond when there is enough ownership density in populations to warrant merchant adoption4. Less volatility and appreciation. People aren't gonna want to spend bitcoin all that much if it goes up a ton in value over time. Though this may not matter because by the time there are enough people to satisfy #2 and #3 bitcoin will probably be fairly mature and will no longer be going up by dozens percent per year.5. Merchant adoption. Can't buy things until merchants add bitcoin payment options. And there is no reason to do this until #2 is hit. And of course this will happen gradually over many years, and then actual use of these bitcoin payment options by the public will gradually happen over many years once it is available.6. Tax laws that make room for bitcoin payments. Not very many people are ever going to use bitcoin for payments if you have to calculate how much capital gains tax you owe every time you buy something. So in nations where you pay taxes on bitcoin profits (most nations) there need to be laws that allow transactions under a certain amount to be tax free. In the US Congress such a low has already been proposed a couple times (tax free for txs with less than I think $200 profit), but we are still probably numerous years away from the law actually getting passed because politicians don't know enough or care enough about Bitcoin to bother passing such a law yet.So yes, bitcoin was designed as a p2p payments platform of course, in addition to being designed as a perfectly transparent scarce hard currency, and it is completely capable of being used globally for payments with second layer solutions, since the base chain was not designed for large payment usage obviously. But the six things above will have to be met before we see people regularly using bitcoin for payments. I'd guess we will see payment adoption take off in the 2040s and 2050s. 2020s and 2030s its still going to primarily just be used for investment/store-of-value/savings.",
