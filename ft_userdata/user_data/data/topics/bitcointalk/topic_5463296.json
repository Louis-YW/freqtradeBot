Well, about that, from my search, Nigeria has about 525 native spoken languages, and if there's use of those languages in the local board, there are going to be so many subboards for those languages. Secondly, there are some of us here who can't write in pidgin English, like myself. I think there are also a few people here who are not Nigerians, but because there's still the use of English in the local board, that's why they are active here, maybe because they can't write In their local language. For me, I don't think it's bad, but if you want to get the opinion of others, then you can start a new topic about that.",

And for now we need moderators and merit sources and with those everything in the local board go dey okay. If with what Charles-Tim commented above, then we don’t need to wait to have a moderator before we can get our important topics pinned to the board. If there’s a sticky post that can guide the newbies coming to the local board, it’ll help in controlling spamming and low quality posts. Even with merit sources been approved, we need to still have posts of great quality before they can give those posts merits. Just like the merit sources, moderators are important, so is the sticky post because our newbies will find our rules here more easier to guide them and ask questions here than the general board.Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 15, 2023, 07:18:48 AMYes, one of the reputed members like CryptopreneurBrainboss can do it.

There was a time a thread was created on this local board by  Hyphen(-) about some newbies getting permanent ban from the forum, which most of them at that time were all from this local board. We want more people in the local board to make our board more active and interactive, for them to know more and learn about bitcoin through here.",
