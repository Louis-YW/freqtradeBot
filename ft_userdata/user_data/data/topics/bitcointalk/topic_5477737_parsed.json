  "content": "I have a 1 year + old startup website that gets about 187k impressions on Google but I can't get best result because of its current theme …I need a $10k BTC loan to hire developers to dev new unique and SEO friendly theme including adding more features for my users. I will repay $13000 or interest can be discussed, I will repay the loan by January. The website domain can be held as a collateral as long as the DNS will keep pointing to its current hosting until the loan is paid.",

If at least some part is real visits, then you should have already monetized at least a small part and that would certainly facilitate your further development.I'm pretty sure your site isn't worth $15,000 and you'll have a hard time getting a loan with it as collateral.",

We also have to look at the side of failure of the deal, which sometimes happens. The lender needs to have a kind of collateral they can easily liquidate to recover their funds in case things do not go as planned.",
