  "content": "One of the great things about bitcoin is the huge quantity of information available to help you learn about it before investing. To be a successful investor in anything, you need to have conviction and to do that you need to have a great deal of information and education about what you are investing in. Without such knowledge and conviction you will do dumb things like panic sell at the first sign of trouble or correction. There are literally dozens of books and documentaries that have been made about bitcoin, almost too many to list, which is extremely helpful for someone who is considering investing in bitcoin for the first time. I believe this is one of the main reasons why so many who started investing in bitcoin eventually turn into long-term hodlers that are passionate and outspoken about bitcoin. In one of my favorite documentaries called God Bless Bitcoin, clergy members and rabbis are interviewed making a religious and moral case for bitcoin. Talk about having true conviction! Bitcoin is widely considered a store of value and commodity and competitor to gold, and even competitor to the dollar. I don't know anyone who thinks of ethereum or any of the other gazillion altcoins as a commodity or store of value. You can't have such passion and conviction among so many without education, and there is no shortage of educational resources when it comes to bitcoin.I don't know any books or documentaries that has been made about ethereum or any other altcoins. The only thing you can expect with the altcoin casino is slick marketing and hype designed to sucker you in, which is what ponzi schemes and other questionable \"investments\" are known to do.My favorite Bitcoin book:Other Bitcoin books:www.amazon.com/bitcoin-Books/s?k=bitcoin&rh=n%3A283155Some documentaries (I haven't seen all of them yet):The Rise and Rise of BitcoinGod Bless BitcoinThe Legendary Treasure of Satoshi NakamotoBitcoin: The End of Money as We Know It Bitcoin Through the Lens of BuddhismCryptopia: Bitcoin and the Future of the InternetIntroduction to BitcoinThe Great Reset and the Rise of BitcoinMagic Money: The Bitcoin RevolutionBitcoin Beyond the BubbleWhere Did Bitcoin Come From?The Bitcoin Exeperiment: A Crazy Idea Let LooseThe Emergence of Bitcoin: The Birth of a Revolutionary Idea",

He wrote The Internet of Money, a great introductory book for the layperson. Knowledge of the fundamentals is the key to understanding.",

Great introduction for a better understandingYeah, Andreas Antonopoulos is an amazing influencer and I've been following his Twitter and I was curious because he always talks about Bitcoin in a very positive way. I even saw a video of him talking about Bitcoin in 2013 in a room and it was a big room and there were only 5 people, probably most people ignored him and Bitcoin was worth about $80 at the time. And I was curious, and those 5 people are probably billionaires now.And I also read that amazing book after I got curious about Andreas Antonopoulos who is very pro Bitcoin, and I found it very simple but easy to understand and easy to remember and also easy to learn which is very helpful and a great book for beginners.",

I don't know anyone who thinks of ethereum or any of the other gazillion altcoins as a commodity or store of value. For some reason I like the title \"Satoshi Bless Bitcoin\" better (so that humanity doesn't completely ruin Satoshi's original idea about bitcoin and the purpose of this). It could have been a good slogan. But within the context of the film's content, it certainly fits (original version).Clergymen and rabbis, you say? Making religious and moral arguments in favor of Bitcoin? It would sound very powerful if it weren't funny. I think I should watch this film. Out of curiosity and to hear their holy arguments.But in general, I don't see any connection between technology (bitcoin) and religion (religious representatives), unless the connecting link is greed.Quote from: headingnorth on January 05, 2025, 03:58:21 AMYou can't have such passion and conviction among so many without education, and there is no shortage of educational resources when it comes to bitcoin.I don't know any books or documentaries that has been made about ethereum or any other altcoins.

Good books like this can really help in expanding one's knowledge and it will be good not only for beginners or new people to bitcoin, but to also those who missed this knowledge at the beginning. There are people who this book will be recommended to and because of the lack of reading culture, they will never read it. Lack of reading habit is also a reason why there are many half cooked people in knowledge who are investing in bitcoin.",

Would you rather be poor? It's a matter of how you go about doing it. The connection to religion is in having a sound and ethical form of money in bitcoin. For example, the deliberate devaluation of fiat currency by governments through endless money printing is just outright theft. That is inarguable. And the Bible says stealing is a sin, and (unsound) money is the root of all evil. Not just Christianity but practically every religion in the world says that theft is a sin.",
