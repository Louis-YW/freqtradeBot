Government?People?Centralized Institutions?Hack?Scam?As far as am concerned, nothing can stop the progress of bitcoin, not even the government, as far as bitcoin network still maintain the same protocols it works by on the blockchain.Quote from: Onyeeze on May 31, 2023, 06:36:12 AM2) bitcoin have some of disadvantages which we are not supposed have all our hope in bitcoin, sometimes the mistakes of people lossiing in bitcoin investment is as a result of improper explanation and orientation when coming to invest in bitcoin.All this you stated aren't a disadvantage of bitcoin because each individual is responsible for the bitcoin they hold, you cant blame the government or banks for being responsible if you lost your money or got attacked, if you lost your bitcoin or risk it under attack that's your own fault and vulnerability.Quote from: Onyeeze on May 31, 2023, 06:36:12 AM3) bitcoin is like a life bencher for lawyers, why in financial aspects bitcoin is a freedom it doesn't have who control it.4) having much benefit in bitcoin is when you know the good time to invest in bitcoin, like sometimes profit in Bitcoin investment is determination by the amount used for invest.5) I want new people to know that the advantages of bitcoin investment is higher than the disadvantages if you take your investment plans serious.But i taught you're to enlighten more on the disadvantages of bitcoin but now seing you talking about it advantages, which means even tou cannot figure out any disadvantage related to the use of bitcoin since the whole opportunity with bitcoin adoption is on a decentralized p2p network, which means by default you're in charge of your digital finance.",

Panic, FOMO, and FUD all have a major role thet play with the crypto market, it will take a very long time to finally understand how Bitcoin and the crypto market works, it took me more than a year and I had to live through a bear market to understand the importance of bear market and the Bitcoin halving.

Investors are getting rich because of Bitcoin in just few years compared to their outside businesses especially if they know the secret behind it. In trading, I know it's difficult but if you're really a disciplined person there's a higher chance to be successful in this journey even if you're newbie.Quote from: siedemtrzy on May 31, 2023, 06:46:13 AMIf you want new people to know about the advantages of Bitcoin then it's not the place, we all here know that.

You have to understand that those who are new to this market are actually very mentally strong in the face of their close friends' losses. It takes many people a lot of time to be able to face it, and it is the same bloody experience that every investor has gone through. This is really not pleasant at all because market psychology is inherently full of immobility, a game where side factors can greatly affect you. From the psychological perspective, emotions can calm before bad news or the temptation of FOMO. So don't think that it's really comfortable because the world of bitcoin is very large and complex.",

This is one reason why people who wanted to engage in Bitcoin for financial relief needs to study and learn the ropes of Bitcoin, the technological and the economic aspect.  Blockchain technology is one of the new emerging and trending technology.  If a person is able to understand it, he can then offer his service and many start-up company may avail for it.

Money launderers move a lot of money, and they will find it difficult to convert it on crypto exchanges, and even if they do, it will be after series of kyc submissions which will expose their identity, cash is the best option for the \"underworld\", and not BTC.",
