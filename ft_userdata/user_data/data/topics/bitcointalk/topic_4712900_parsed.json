  "content": "In the book \"Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money\", its author (Nathaniel Popper) quotes a couple of emails sent by Satoshi to other members of the early Bitcoin community. This was apparently right before his disappearance from the forum. Here is the excerpt:QuoteThe author of the Bitcoin software hadn’t posted to the forums since December, but he had continued to e-mail with a select number of developers, including Gavin, Martti, and Mike Hearn, a Google programmer in Switzerland, who got drawn into the project after the WikiLeaks blockade. In late April Hearn politely asked how involved Satoshi intended to be moving forward.“Are you planning on rejoining the community at some point (e.g. for code reviews), or is your plan to permanently step back from the limelight?” he asked.“I’ve moved on to other things,” Satoshi wrote back. “It’s in good hands with Gavin and everyone.”[...]Satoshi’s final e-mails went to Martti, whom Satoshi asked to take full ownership of the Bitcoin.org website. “I’ve moved on to other things and probably won’t be around in the future,” Satoshi wrote to Martti, in early May, before transferring the site to Martti and disappearing into the ether.[emphasis mine] Source: https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Gold-Bitcoin-Millionaires-Reinvent/dp/006236250X I couldn't help noticing that Satoshi announced that \"he had moved on to other things\" on two different occasions. What do you think these other things could be? From the context, it sounds these things are unrelated to Bitcoin. Maybe he was working on other projects where programming skills were needed. This can also be interpreted as Satoshi being more or less satisfied with the development of Bitcoin and confident in its intended future.I know that this is very speculative and impossible to know with certainty, but I would like to hear your opinion.",

In trying to put ourselves in his shoes, he needed to remain vague, perhaps not to say a real reason. Or simply because its original purpose was to let things be done by a community and not by a single person (Satoshi). Perhaps also it was a good way to create a myth about who's behind SatoshiI believe he didn't want to have to invent a crazy story to leave the project with a good excuse.",

So, personally, I don't see certain clues to guide us to the meaning of the words. We only can guess some possibilities : 1. He stopped using \"Satoshi\" as his identity. But who knows that he really stooped or not, he may use other names. 2. He planned to make Bitcoin to have no owner. It is matched with the Bitcoin criteria such as decentralized or anonymity. 3. Satoshi no longer leads the development of Bitcoin. He might think that Satoshi's role as the leader of the development of Bitcoin should end at that moment. It can be related to security, Bitcoin sustainability, or other vital things. It's purely my own theory.",

These 'other things' might be focusing on his family, or other endeavors such as only hobbies while enjoying his life away from work done on Bitcoin. Considering he must have enough money to live his life peacefully, he's maybe just travelling or in a peaceful vacation house somewhere.I think the main reason why he never revealed his identity is to keep off the radar of the US Government and other governing institutions, that is surely does not want decetralized way of things, especially currency in which they draw power. If his identity is known earlier when Bitcoin isn't globally spread, then the government might suppress its development or even threaten Satoshi's life.",

All we can do is assume, satoshi had the plan to leave bitcoin and disappear without a trace and we should respect his choice. As long as Bitcoin is alive and growing, people will always be fascinated with almost anything that has some connection with Satoshi Nakamoto. The search for the real guy will continue on and one despite the pleadings of the many to just let the man stay underground, or \"rest in peace\" if it is true he is already dead, for as long as he want in fulfillment of his wishes. This is just another sign that people are really interested with the origin of Bitcoin and the man who started it all.Maybe Satoshi Nakamoto decided at that time that he had enough of what he was doing and can no more contribute new with this platform that he started and so he was letting it go all thinking that there will eventually be people who can take the burden for themselves, making this whole thing really not for profit and not for self-serving interests (a litmus test that many later cryptocurrency leaders failed miserably). I am guessing that maybe Satoshi Nakamoto decided to instead be a good farmer and he is just somewhere enjoying the foods he is harvesting from time to time, enjoying the sunrise and the sunset everyday with his loving family smiling and laughing all the way. Now I am just wondering why he still refused to move his stash of Bitcoin...maybe he also adopted a creed forsaking wealth and materialism?",

We wish to have the official announcement of Satoshi soon among us.Danny has always been firm to his belief that Satoshi had already died prior to the 2013 ATH, and has not changed his stance since. I do also believe that the reason for him stepping down for good is to tackle personal matters involving himself and no one else. Idk why but I always get this feeling that the man behind Satoshi is no other than Hal Finney himself, though many others can say otherwise. Being there since the genesis block, up to the point where everything is working as smoothly as possible and claiming that \"Satoshi might be my next-door neighbor\" is like trying to tell us something that we just ignored.Anyhow, I do believe that whatever Satoshi did to bitcoin and the world would forever be remembered, with or without him needing to come back.",
