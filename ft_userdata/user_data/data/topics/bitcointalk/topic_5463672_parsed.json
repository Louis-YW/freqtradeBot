She is not worried that he is gaming but her problem is that he is a student that solely depends on her for everything he needs. Her fear is also that her son might start stealing from her if he has no access to the money he needs to gamble. My relative has even started suspecting that some money she feels was misplaced might have been stolen by her son. I spoke to my nephew and he told me that he has never stolen from his mother to gamble. And he gambles with only his savings from his weekly stipend he receives from the family. And he won't gamble if he has no savings to do that. From my observation, he is a responsible gambler that is just enjoying the game and making a little money occasionally. The gambling age in my country is 18+, but his mother is insisting that he must stop. What will be your advice for this young boy?",

What will be your advice for this young boy?Gambling is like a drug.The addiction grows most times unconsciously and that inevitably leads to all kind of irresponsible behaviors when the person who becomes addicted to gambling remains without money.If he only plays sport betting I would not be that worried for him as I am sure with a small balance the guy can go a long way but I would be worry sick if starts playing slot machines which are a super fast money drainer most of the time,that would be really dangerous and stealing money for him would be right behind the door.",

Father, mother, Uncle or aunty may not know that until certain things like him stealing their money.His mother needs to advice him. He is more than 18 years, let him choose the path he wants to choose, but tell her to give him good advice and to be on the good path. She should let her know how gambling is very dangerous and give him examples of irresponsible gambler's real life stories. I have heard many of such events. You can let him know how gambling is not a way to earn, it is not a way to earn but to have fun.",

What will be your advice for this young boy?to enter the world of gambling, in my opinion, 18 years old is a sufficient age. But besides that, it must also be accompanied by good self-control and sufficient knowledge about how gambling works and winning strategies.If you are still relying on gifts from your parents to survive, you should stop gambling. because you risk losing your parents' trust and generosity towards you.and one more thing, to enter the world of gambling requires ability and finances. It is wise to refrain from these activities until one is able to do so. If a person has engaged in such activities, it is extremely important to stop them before any harm is done to the child. For now, focus on mastering the basics of gambling and strategy, including the art of winning, so that when someone re-enters the world of gambling, they have enough self-control to increase their chances of winning.owever, it would be even better if the child forgot about gambling and focused on learning and pursuing their dreams.",

Speaking with him alone won't guarantee that he is a responsible gambler because he might just be seeing little money for now, because if he has the chance and money, you may not conclude that anymore. You can know a responsible gambler by experience. Some one who has no experience may not be responsible in such adventure. However my advise to the boy first is to listen to the mum and concentrate in his education, after education he could choose to continue or stop. Again, he should not allow friends to deceive him into what he will do against his parents because it appears the parents don't like gambling and are not teaching him that way. So for the mum, she has to understand he is a young person capable of being influenced by friends and what he see around. She has to keep cautioning and talking to him, watch his friends and guide him more. Young people have tendency of exhibiting different habit until they are stable and hopefully, he may listen to the mother one day.",

Maybe I will have to asked his friend and if possible check his account. But I fear that he might become a secret gambler and hide his experience from everybody. If he finds out that we are investigating his activities, he might end up not trusting anybody. When he trusts nobody, he will not open up when he is facing some problems. I think he needs to have someone that can advise him.

She only told me and never accused her son of stealing. Sometimes we use money and don't remember we have spent it. But when we suspect someone, we might think something else. I also don't think it is a genuine reason to have an issue with your mum. I have been accused severally by my mum of several things I never did. Mothers are naturally suspicious.",

My relative has even started suspecting that some money she feels was misplaced might have been stolen by her son. That’s the problem with gambling people often think gamblers will always end up stealing though there have been many cases of people who steal so they can gamble so it is good that mother have shown concern from this early stage before things get out of hand. Young people are easy to talk to so i think OP you should talk to him and teach him a lot about gambling especially how to always bet responsibly and how to manage his earnings into gambling since you have knowledge about it and also you are the best person that can convince him easily because his mother might use a different approach which may even worsen the situation.

What will be your advice for this young boy?We can’t be so sure about all he said because if i was in shoes also I wouldn’t admit i stole anything and I won’t admit that i gamble recklessly. Let’s just hope it’s not too late for him because he is at the stage of going through all this and i feel no matter how you try to make him quit gambling if he doesn’t want to do it willingly he will still come back it one day. Gambling is not a bad thing if you can control yourself and maintain a good gambling habit so I believe this is now up to you as the elderly one to make him grow into a responsible gambler. He is lucky to have you around to impact to him all what you have learned here because most of young gamblers on the street lack proper knowledge about gambling addiction that’s why they all end up as an addict and have no knowledge about how to manage their finances into gambling and so they end up losing so much while gambling.",

If it is not stopped immediately, over time he can become a gambling addict and you already know what the consequences will be if someone has become a gambling addict.

Her fear is also that her son might start stealing from her if he has no access to the money he needs to gamble. My relative has even started suspecting that some money she feels was misplaced might have been stolen by her son. In a problem like this I think it is very possible, we must remember that this is gambling where someone especially who has experienced addiction he will move under his subconscious and do it based on his lust. And as we are discussing this that he is still a minor and is still very dependent on his parents regarding various needs including in terms of finance, so if he wants to gamble but does not have money then in my opinion it is very likely that he will steal money from people around him such as his closest family. Children who are still underage are still very vulnerable to any temptation that comes to them, they have high curiosity and always want to try new things, if gambling comes to them and they are interested then this is very dangerous. That's right, the only solution that can be done in my opinion is restrictions that must be very strict from both parents, tell him slowly and limit all access that allows him to do gambling such as cellphones or whatever it is. Nowadays gambling is very easy to access and I hope all parents realize this for the good of their own children.

What will be your advice for this young boy?That might be true, I mean he might be right that he didn't steal from his mom for gambling capital. But on the other hand you also have to be more suspicious of him, if you have gambled or know about some cases of people who are stressed because of gambling then I think you will find out more about the real truth. It could be that someone is saying no just to cover things up, it's very possible. I am an active gambler and I really feel some conditions in gambling including when you really want to gamble but don't have money, I really believe that if the parents continue to let it go then one day maybe the child will do things that are out of bounds, borrowing money from his colleagues to gamble is very possible and to steal it is also possible if he has lost his way. I honestly agree with what his mother did, I'm sure she's a good mother and really cares about what's best for her son. For now maybe he is still a beginner in gambling but believe me if it is allowed then someday bad things can happen, and I think this is what is in his mother's mind so insist on prohibiting it.",

Proper advice is really needed so that he will not go on a situation where she feared to happen.If his son insist not to stop then she need to show some dominance so that his child would respect him. Cut off all means of connection where he can access gambling and she should put some not so heavy punishment like cutting off his allowance if he's seen to gamble so that he can remember something to scare off and decide to stop gambling.",

Since your nephew is a teenager he probably has gambling money for which he gambles constantly. But his father may see that gambling money and think that his son is gambling with his hard earned money but the matter is different. Since the gambler has become good at winning bets, he may have made a lot of money to make a better bet than that. If your nephew's father suspects his son of stealing money and gambling with it, I think it's very suspicious.  So he has to refrain from gambling so that his father does not suspect him and he does not become more addicted to gambling. As the boy is not yet 18 years of age a student so he should refrain from gambling at this age or else he will face a lot of harm in future. So he should never be allowed to gamble instead he should focus on studies and it would be better if he can gamble in future when he becomes a responsible gambler.",

If there is no evidence that her son is stealing her money, there is no reason to accuse him based solely on his side activities. If he enjoys the occasional gamble (provided it is within his financial means), then so be it. Even students who are working hard on their education need a break and some activities just for fun. By the way, how are his studies progressing? If there is no significant drop in his study results, there is no reason to worry.

In addition, if he needs to manage his finances when it comes to expenditures given that our initial reaction to a \"loss\" is to recover them quickly by gambling again. As long as he knows his limits, then he must faithfully adhere to his promise.Gambling is a very difficult act to control due to its very nature. As someone who is as young as 18 years old, he needs guidance and direction in order to avoid all the pitfalls that majority of the people experienced.",
