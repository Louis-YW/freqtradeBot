      "body": "one of the accounts was tagged \"Bot machine. Cheater.\"but an error in copying POA is common. you should look for other evidence to strengthen.but with your findings, you should contact the bounty manager regarding suspected accounts. although I did not see that in the bounty rules, there are restrictions on the use of alt accounts. because maybe the bounty manager account has also been tagged as a cheater account.confusing because there are still bounty hunters who follow bounty managers with tags like that.",
