CHINA SCAMMERS!Good luck!The question is how did you find this exchange, did you know someone recommend you here, how did you end on this site and what is the logic that you are going to use a new exchange without enough information or reviews checking the date when it was launched and it's only over a month Domain:crypto7change.comRegistrar:NameSilo, LLCRegistered On:2022-07-28Expires On:2023-07-28Updated On:2022-07-28 Are we lacking of good exchanges that you're using a new exchange that has not proven its reputation in the market, you need to post all the evidence like screenshots of your transactions to make your accusation legit.",

Sorry for your loss, you should stop using China based crypto services. They are all definitely fake.Yes stop using China-based crypto services but more importantly start learning how to pick the right exchange to trade, there's a big risk trading on a newly launched exchange unless you know it very well the exchange and it's operating from the same country where you are located but for a new one and its thousands of miles away, you cannot even verify if the address and information are real, not doing research will get you scam when it only takes a few minutes to do that.",

CHINA SCAMMERS!Good luck!This is a new exchange platform launched only 35 days ago, I would never advise anyone to exchange their currencies on new and unknown exchange platforms, it seems from the exaggerated positive customer reviews about this new exchange HERE that it is fake reviews written by the creator of the exchange platform to deceive people, Also, there are a lot of new exchange platforms that have recently appeared in the crypto market, so be careful and you have to deal with well-known and popular top exchange platforms to ensure the safety of your money.",

Another thing that i note is that people who are reading this thread tend to open the scam site to see its design or anything which they seem suspicious, which we should avoid. If a site is a scam, there can be malicious software/malware that can be downloaded on our system.Crypto exchange websites are usually scams and I trust none of them unless any friend of mine tells me that he is using a crypto exchange site and is satisfied with their service.",
