Where will Drake go now?Twitch To Ban Gambling Streaming By October 18th.But we all know that this is going to be temporary though, because they are going to lose big money if they totally ban gambling. As for this artistic nudity, it will become controversial like gambling, but as you have said, they have double standards so they will allow it to continue and same with gambling. It's all about the business of making money at the end of the end and not about morals, just saying.",

Just like been said that im not really that shocked for these kind of decisions would really be turned out be changed up overtimeor they would really be allowing something which is far more worst than with gambling. As for this kind of allowing that artistic nudity which we can really be able to tell that this is really just as good as light porn i should say?  Well, iths their company then its their right on what they would should gonna do into their company. It is really just that sad that they are really that prohibiting or banning gambling but now adding up some nudity? Totally mind boggling and questionable.",

It’s hard to tell why they will allow this but if the regulations approve this then something is going on for sure. Let’s see if Twitch will stay longer without allowing any gambling streaming because for sure they are already losing a lot of money since they implemented this one.",

I don't see any...  Gambling is much more harmful depending the person who is having access to it. For most people it won't have any negative effects to access gambling content, because they aren't going to become degenerate gamblers. The same can be said about nudity, although there will be always a minor percentage of people who will develop disfunctional behaviors when watching nudity (which may end becoming pornography).I'm not against one or another. I just don't see why one has to be fought back and the other has to be embraced. A simple age restriction for determined kinds of contents inside the platform would be enough in both cases.If Twitch wants to compete against adult websites for audience, while having an userbase of 13 years teens, let it be... That was one of the excuses presented to justify the ban on gambling content back then.",

To be honest I kinda understand the limitations on gambling, many outright scams were promoted. But also worth noting that twitch didn't want to get involved at all at helping gambling safer. They still allowed sports and poker, which could also be scams... They could have just demanded provable fairness on the other sites, but they didn't... So now the main viewership on twitch is just softcore  The more educated viewers will be on kick in the meantime.",

But once there's someone from government disturb their operation due to to nudity reason for sure same with gambling twitch will put an action with that and also ban that nudity streamers. For now those people who do that can enjoy that platform since no legal disturbance happening but once there's something certain roll of events happen for sure it can sure taken out on the scene same with what happen on gambling scene their.I  think twitch is doing fine since after all its business so maybe they allow it or let it happen since there's no official disallow them to erase that content.",

They are hoping to cater towards a much larger audience which in this case involves artists and other creators that delve in the art world, so they have more freedom to express their stuff without getting the ban hammer. I'm guessing they overlooked the fact that there are people who will look for loopholes to avoid getting banned while still being able to do these stupid things. I give the benefit of the doubt to Twitch on this one. But at the same time I condemn them for banning Gambling since at the end of the day, as Asmongold puts it, the platform was never meant for kids in the first place.",

Just take it with a grain of salt, I guess.Since that revamp on sexual content can be considered as a new change in the platform, for sure the community will voiced their concern and expect some changes over changes in no time. Let's just wait for the platform's reaction after a brief period of time. If you think the platforms annoys you, try to ignore them for now. Aside from that, Twitch is a growing platform and most likely will end up what Youtube is currently today where lots of content, at a different genre, are being subject for aggressive moderation as they are being regulated more.If the platform are against gambling-related services but allowing nudity, we should look deeply the specific term regarding that.(P.S: I'm not really sure about what kind of nudity are being referred here. I doubt they will put almost an XXX content there. )",

Artistic nudity is not that bad since it has something to do with art but I wonder how they can filter artistic nudity from pornography, and the filter of the actors or models used in such artistic nudity content.QuoteIf the platform are against gambling-related services but allowing nudity, we should look deeply the specific term regarding that.Nudity and gambling are two different industries, so they can approve one and completely shut one.  It is the call of the platform owner IMHO.[1]https://educateempowerkids.org/8-harmful-effects-of-pornography-on-individuals/",

Fortunately, the casinos have their Instagram pages without causing too much headache, but on Instagram women are almost naked in the photos, it has become something very normal and when you look at the USA you realize that in the USA it has become normal for women to walk in the streets with little clothing during the day and when women in the US go to parties and clubs, they put on little clothing that makes it look like their intention is that they are going to expose their body for saleThe owners of these platforms live in the USA, if I'm not wrong, so they are part of American society and obviously, being scantily clad is normal for women in the USA, so on these social networks there will be no prohibition on people exposing their bodies and that's it. because the US government does not prohibit this exposure of women's bodies, but in the case of gambling the US government, like many governments, has been much tougher and for this reason the owners of these social networks are intimidated and forced to sometimes restrict gambling.

They banned gambling because they believed it could not provide sufficient consumer protections that could lead to financial hardship and addiction. However, it's confusing because Twitch prohibits nudity, inappropriate attire, pornography, and sexually explicit or suggestive content, yet they allow certain streams that contain sexual themes if they provide an appropriate label. I understand the decision to allow artistic nudity to support a broader range of content and expression on the platform. However, it would be better if the boundaries were clearly defined to ensure that the content remains appropriate for its audience.",

It's better to just waste energy jerking off.  Seriously, I think it caused them trouble when streamers started live videos of gambling. It's not just about traditional belief but because of the rising amount of gambling addicts in the world.
