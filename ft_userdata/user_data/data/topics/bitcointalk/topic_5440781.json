  "content": "*** 3 DAY AUCTION ***SUPER RARE -- I've never seen one at auction here or anywhere else.  Truly stunning -- one of Crypto Imperator's best (arguably his best loaded piece, imho). I thought about auctioning it at Stacks, but would rather it go to a member of the forum. To find this coin, I had to search high and low and purchased it from a reputable member of the forum two years ago.This loaded 100,000 Super Doge is one of 25, with many having already been peeled. A nice write-up from our friend Elias: https://www.cryptonumist.com/coin/crypto-imperator-100000-doge-silver-edition-superdogeThe coin is in visually immaculate condition, and is graded MS68 PL (68 Plus) by ICG.STARTING BID: 0.35 BTC (which is the load value of 100,000 Doge at the time of auction kick off)MINIMUM BID INCREMENT: 0.01 BTCEND TIME: FEBRUARY 24th, 2023, 9:00 PM CentralCountdown: https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20230224T21&p0=24&font=cursive&csz=1**Payment due within 24 hours of auction end!!**SNIPE: Any bid made in last 10 minutes will extend the auction 10 minutes beyond the ending time.If within those 10 extended minutes, a new bid is made, 10 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC (I will post the address in the final message congratulating the winner, before locking the thread) SHIPPING: Based on location and preferenceESCROW: Minerjones, if desired (shipping to MJ at buyer's risk, but I've never had a problem)With Elon at the helm of Twitter, will we see $1.00 Doge after all?   Good luck!",
