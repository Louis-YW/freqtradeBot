Paypal does not work that way.Besides you can pay only using paypal checkout without linking your paypal to fiverr.Yes, you can just use your account instead of him on buying stuff there. But i see the only reason why op is doing this is because it will give his fiverr account a review from the seller (well, optional) and make his account more mature with at least one activity. Plus new account (if ever his account is new) have some discount on its first purchase.Quote from: virasog on July 23, 2022, 02:57:26 PMbut at the same time OP is giving access of his fiverr account to another unknown person which is also not a good idea. The person will evil mind can ruin the account too. That's the risks of what op is trying to do. Well, there's nothing to lose of sharing your fiverr credentials for this kind of stuff, there's nothing in there aside from having a balance. Well, who would in the right mind will share its fiverr account credentials if ever there is a balance on it.Well, if ever you have linked paypal for easy buy, you can report it immediately on paypal for dispute and remove the access manually on its settings.You cannot ruin someones fiverr too unless you (the bad actor) made an order using your money (if there's no balance obviously) giving 1 star review to seller then seller gives you 1 star review too. I see no other things to ruin soneones fiverr account aside a seller gives a 1 star review though.",
