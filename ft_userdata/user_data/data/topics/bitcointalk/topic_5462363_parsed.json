The chart shows a clear breakout is imminent for altcoinswe don't know when will that happen, such massive breakout at $100k. that's a long way go looking at the current price of BTC at almost 30k. TA experts or not, we can't be so sure when it comes to the price level of btc in the near future. but you can always follow your instincts on what to do with your funds on this market. do remember, at the end of the day, you are investing your own funds, so you are the one responsible for what may happen to itwhen it comes to alts, better choose them meticulously as not all alts will be in the increasing mode.",

The market is too volatile for now to take careless risks and my risk tolerance is pretty low.Do you one about bitcoin, you have to understand that anything you are doing with a bitcoin you need to have hope knowing that have a very good potential, if bitcoin experienced a bearish market now their is every tendency that the market of bitcoin can get accelerated anytime, so I don't believe on the price of bitcoin because I know quite well that the market is dependable the quantum of the investors, so therefore bitcoin potentiality is higher than the one of altcoins and you won't lose hope when you invest on bitcoin. Holding bitcoin will give the holder a privilege to make a profit whenever bullish occurs but Holding altcoins for long time, their is every tendency that altcoins can die off along the line, that is while many people choose to invest in bitcoin",

The incoming halving could change the narrative and I feel staking your assets now pending post halving which could usher in another bull circle will be the play here.",

The thing that surprises methat this is my first time in all the the years i've been here on this crypto market on which i have seen Bitcoin didnt move a single digit for a couple or hours specially on preev.com where i do always check out every now and then. I did make out some checks whether it is really that broken or site in maintenance but its not, which it did really give out that kind of stable price in a period of time.",
