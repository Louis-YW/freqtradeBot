  "content": "So it's been a while since I visited my antpool page, and I found a bold warning saying \"You have to KYC to use the mining pool\", I tried to do some research on when all of this took place but found nothing on google, but it seems that this took place around July according to their telegram group.Also according to their support on telegram they clearly stated \"Users need to pass the KYC before they can start mining.\"Here is an image of that for future reference Obviously, the above is a lie, because I just pointed a few miners to Antpool and I can see earnings accumulating, so they do allow me to mine there without KYC, the question now is, will they let me withdraw my BTC? I got some dust on the pool so it will take only a few hours to get to the minimum payout, there is a good chance I never get the payout but I want to test this so I can give you the answer with some evidence.Meanwhile, if you are using Antpool, do yourself a favor and stop NOW.",

I think I have some dust too, I will do the same test on my side.I don't understand why they're getting into this? Why would they?They don't need to be regulated on most markets as a mining pool, so why take the initiative of making it mandatory only for them?Are the dollars of our personal data the reason?",

But I doubt they will enforce it at levels of no KYC no money, probably they will just try and get rid of the small players that don't want to pass it pay them, and then simply tell them to stop mining, I don't think they are that interested in guys with under 1ph even if they would provide all the documents!Now, if they go next level, how does proof of funds work with a mining pool?  They will ask you where you got your ASICs, how much did you pay for it and show them the import papers?

Do we really have the risk of them all becoming KYC mandatory?It's conceivable that some medium-ranking pools like EMCD for example could benefit from an influx of miners deserting the KYC-pools. I imagine that there must be people somewhere taking advantage of convenient local regulations, t least I hope that'll still be possible in a few years' time...In any case, I agree with your idea of a p2pool with a smart contract guarantor, I think we're running out of privacy-friendly solutions.

If yes, can you share any example.There are none which is why it's just an \"idea\" or a proposal you may call it.QuoteBut on other hand, people or group who can setup many ASIC should able to setup P2Pool. Rechecking http://p2pool.in/, they just need one computer (to run both Bitcoin Core and P2Pool software) and point their ASIC to that computer's IP address.Those who setup many ASICs are either:1- Large enough to mine their own pool.2- They don't care about KYCing themselves since you can't have a large mining business without KYCing yourself anyway.The targeted users for such an idea are the average folks like us, people with a few THs/PHs worth of hashrate, which collectively have a good share of the total hashrate, we need to analyze what do these folks look for in today's mining world.1- Most prefer no KYC.2- Most want PPS pool (one of the reasons why P2pool failed).3- No tech-related requirements, extra PCs, complicated setup (one of the main reasons why P2pool failed).This makes the likes of Viabtc pool the most favorable, Viabtc is PPS based, and no individual setup is required.However, given that Viabtc is a centralized and known entity, at some point they might have to impose the KYC shit as well, so what I propose is a pool that covers these 3 points, initially, I proposed to theymos that forum funds (which essentially are his anyway), the other similar idea is to have a community pool with decentralization ownership.Now let's pretend that we want to create a mining pool with a 1% chance of going bankrupt and 4% fees (the current average PPS fees)(6.25  *ln 100) / (2*0.04) = 360 BTCSo here, we need a fund pool of at least 360 BTC, but obviously, the smaller the fund the more risk + more rewards for the \"investors\" and vice versa, but let's for the sake of simplicity pretend that 360 people each with 1 BTC, everyone will get 1/360  of the 4% fee that the pool generates, 1000 people each deposit 1 BTC then each gets 1/1000 and so on.Now comes the real challenge which is, who owns the piece of the software, or where does it run? who owns the server that runs it, this would require a similar implementation of the original Bitcoin nodes, where pool nodes will run on different servers owned by different people but the software is similar, and thus the work they send to the miners, the payout structure and everything else is the same, so it becomes like a large centralized pool with dozen nodes around the globe.some of that 4% fee could be allocated to those who run the pool node or, as one might expect, given that people run full nodes for no direct financial gain, the same people would be willing to do the same thing with these pool nodes, especially that these nodes will not be anywhere as large compared to the full nodes.Could something like this be easily implemented? certainly not, but will it become a necessity at some point in the future? probably.",
