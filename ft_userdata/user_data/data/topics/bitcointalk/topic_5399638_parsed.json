The more worried an investor would be if he has invested altcoins because normally altcoins drop way more than 70%. Its not unusual any more for someone who had experienced the long bear market back in 2018.  Those investors after 2018, learned their lesson to dump before the alt markets dive. Yes it going to be depressing when you saw your money that was once more than 300K, now drop to less than $50K. Feel sorry for myself too when I don't have any idea if I'm going see it goes 300k again, its detrimental. But after 2021, I learned my lesson.",

If you have altcoins in your portfolio, then not a surprise that your holdings worth has been decreased 70%. Better to hold bitcoin. This time is for the bears but the bull time will come but can still be long before it would come. The market can still be of the bears, many altcoins do not always reach all-time-high, avoid them and hold bitcoin.Quote from: 9thsky on May 21, 2022, 05:40:18 PMHave we ever experienced this kind of downtrend before?? What's the latest on how long this might last, or if it's even going to recover. You can check 2018, it was full of bears. If 2016/2017 were bullish, also 2020/2021 were also bullish. But in 2018, bear market started and lasted for long, also 2022, bear market has started and may last long. I am waiting for 2024/2025 to be bullish again.",

There was similar downtrends when Bitcoin was worth much less, but that was a few years ago. Nobody can say if it's going to recover into the future, but the trend does not look very good right now and it seems to be staircasing downwards. It does seem like there is some correlation between Bitcoin and the wider economic situation right now, people seem to be cashing out of it as the markets are looking jittery with a recession on the horizon due to wild inflation. Unfortunately it is a tough lesson to learn, if you're down 70% then you really must have purchased near the peak, otherwise it doesn't make sense? Hopefully you can take it as a future lesson to diversify and not put all your money into a single asset class.",

The cyclic movement of the market seems to be the norm at this point and the same rethoric was heard the last time (2018) when the marked went down. But will it recover as it did before (after a year or two) is anybodys guess as there are diferent factors at play such as world recession and what happened to Luna.",

There's an altcoin section where you'll find people in a much worse situation, especially those who held Luna. If you really held when you were -50%, there's no point in selling now at -70%. Were you even at profit because to be at -70 you'd have to buy at the peak of 2021? If what you're saying is true then you bought the top and then held all the way down, despite being at a 20, 30, 40% loss. That's really unfortunate, but If I were you I'd think about the probability of going down vs going up from here. We kept falling for the last 7 months, it can't go on forever.",

What's the latest on how long this might last, or if it's even going to recover. Sure, we have experienced the same situation because it is almost the same as in 2018. After bullrun 2017, crypto market drops as well like we experienced this time, but it recovered in 2021, right? So, we shouldn't be worried since it is proven that after bearish should come the bullish season.",

I'm sorry to hear about your health though and hopefully you can recover. Not sure when you enter you, maybe it was about the end of bull run?As for me, yeah, seen the last bull run in 2017 and then the subsequent bear market that followed, 2018-2020 and it was really hard. Nevertheless it has bounce back late 2020-2021. So that's kinda what the trend is, bears/bulls. So right now we are in a bear market so again, another difficult and painful period, but we should stay resilience and have the patience to be in the market still despite the price of bitcoin and the rest of the crypto are falling hard.",

What's the latest on how long this might last, or if it's even going to recover. ^Yes, and much worst than this.A downtrend is very normal in the crypto space but as long as you did not execute selling your amount of BTC will remain the same and nothing will change, for example, if you own 1 BTC it will remain 1 BTC if you did not sell it. Just keep holding your coin until the market will resist because for us, this is just a market correction that anytime the market will grow.",

You should have known the market before you start investing because what we have right now is just a repetition of the past bear market conditions. Whether you invest in bitcoin or in any good altcoins, the moment bear market turns in, its normal to see our portfolio losing that much. However, the market will not be like this for years.

One thing I have learnt in trading is that it is never too late to get in and never too late to pull back. Market is entirely unpredictable you might see another 70% downfall from this point or you might get even see an 100% uptrend from this point both the things are very much possible, we have experienced many worse downfalls than this and market has recovered from them every single time it will always recover in future as well. But yes it might go even down so you are losing an opportunity to sell high today and buy cheap later by mitigating the risk of price recovering from here only.",
