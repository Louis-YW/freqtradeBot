Have you ever found yourself trapped in this situation and how did you get rid of this ? The number one sign is enough to spark all the next numbers as a compulsive gamer.I remember being in that phase many many years ago where even when I was laying down to sleep my thoughts kept revolving about gambling and about what slot machine I will play tomorrow,during the whole day I kept playing slot machines and this is a clear sign that I was addicted.The only choice to recover from such illness though is if you really want to and no one else can help,maybe in the extreme case recovering in a gambling rehab center would be a good solution to this illness,for many people this is the only option,I was luck though as I recovered myself by a strong will to be a better person and do better things in life than keep gambling.",

There are just too many ways for people to bypass these self exclusions ..with all the casinos that are not asking for KYC details. I set myself a budget and it takes huge self discipline not to go over that budget... especially when you have gone into \"degen\" mode. Also \"block\" all gambling advertisements and promotions in your emails.. or create a mail filtering rule to delete it, so that it will not provoke you to gamble.",

You are there on a high that you want to achieve more and feel that adrenaline rush that you are yearning for, and as a result, you bet more and more money with regards to the usual amount that you should have, OR you didn't follow your betting system and risk management.The sure way to say that you have a gambling disorder is you lie about gambling. If you can't tell the truth or somehow, someway, you don't want to say it because they might think that you are an addict or something, that's already a sign that you are.",

We can only say that you are gambling compulsively if you cannot subdue the urge of doing so even if you are aware of what is happening. But is a different thing than addiction. So somehow I am against mentioned sign 3 because it somehow speaks for a need to do so, which is a determinant of addiction. Same thing goes with obsession whoch is also a different thing wherein it allows you to focus your attention into it such as with signs  1 & 4. But any of these would simply mean that you are going too much more than what should be. If it affects your daily functioning then seeking for professionl help would be the best thing to do.",

There are days I would have gained so much, but continue to gamble as it is enjoyable and I will lose more at the end of the day.

Though I think I have experienced it one time when I was supposedly going to sleep, again, my mind was somewhat telling me to gamble just one hour, so in the end, I did gamble that time and lost my money I wasnt able to sleep lol.",

The individual would always want to gamble more despite steadily losing money. With thoughts and hopes of recouping his losses in a mighty win. That would drive the individual quickly to financial ruin. To hide the losses accumulated, the individual would probably lie to himself and others around. Financial problems would follow as the individual would have spent whatever monies that might have been saved up.",

Have you ever found yourself trapped in this situation and how did you get rid of this ? Self-denial. Living in denial of a gambling addiction is an early sign. A gambler who knows that they have lost more money than they can ever think of to gambling and would keep on returning to the casino while telling themselves that it is because of a wrong strategy and not because they are addicted.These people will turn to other people's money when they are broke to gamble. They would lie for it, steal for it just to satisfy that urge. Yet, they will go on denying that it is not because they are addicted but because of their love for the whatever game they are playing or the potential to hit it big.",

Some random guy subtweeted him saying that he's addicted or something along the lines. Now this at first glance is just a harmless jab at how in denial some people who are afflicted with gambling addiction are. But honestly it's also a good statement against these people, a little wake up call if you will. Sucks that they are the last to know that they're in too deep to. But if you suspect yourself of being addicted to gambling already, watch out for these signs: Uncontrollable/Intrusive urge to gamble. You feel like you're at loss when you don't gamble for that particular dayDwindling savings and worsening financial situation. Most gamblers find themselves sweeping off their savings, and sometimes even taking out loans to fund their addiction. If you find yourself spending more than what you normally would, you should check yourself. You found other things to be addicted to as well. Smoking, Drinking, all of these forms of leisure, if you've picked these things up from the Casino or from the stress of losing tons of money from gambling, it's often a good indicator that something is already wrong.
