There are many scammers in the goods section so always be careful since Crypto is reversible.",

Please help!Obviously, the price of the promised invite looked below the market, which attracted your attention. As sad as it may sound, you will never get your money back. This lesson cost you 60 euro and I hope that you will draw the right conclusions from this lesson, otherwise you will constantly lose your money in the future.",
