You will waste a lot of time, your head will turn gray,trouble sleeping, trouble with stress, you will get sick (neurosis, stomach ulcers), family problems. All of those to barely (or not) outperform wide market in long run. Its much better to enjoy life and symilar returns with well balanced portfolio and medium/long term trades.",

So I would say that day trading isn't a waste of time",

This is up to you. I know some OG on trading stocks or forex and then they start trading cryptocurrency too and they are doing day trading. They are also profitable. They are not always winning but I know it's normal, there's no 100% guaranteed when you trade.As long as you have good risk management, it will not matter how you trader, even scalp trader you have, as long as you are not greedy, it's all good.",

Each day will have different market condition, also with a unexpected rumors like crypto ban or the most popular exchange got hacked etc, which will make the market will suffer short dump. You have no choice instead of cut loss, if you're doing cut loss too often you wouldn't earn more. But if you do 2-3 days or a week trading, I don't think it's will be profitable than just holding Bitcoin alone.",

So before investing choose time and coin care fully for avoiding loss.I think that's part of the risk of trading and that's why it's important to do some research and analysis,in trading we cannot completely avoid losses and it is difficult,we can only minimize the risk",

I've traded many times and luckily some in profit and some in losses.But with what I have understood and realized about trading, you don't have to do it daily and just do the usual trading of buying now and wait until it pops and makes you a profit. Anyway, they want to learn about day trading, charting, technical analysis and stuff. It's on them, they can apply all of those and choose to day trade but I've told them that when they experience the same thing as mine, they'll have to calm down.",

And only experienced it doesn't means good trader. And at the end I will say if a trader did wrong investment it's fully his responsibility and if you invest in the wrong coin at the wrong time, you will face loss not only in day trading but also in long term trading.Yes I think what you said is absolutely right. If any experienced people make this kind of mistakes very less they invest after seeing the price of the coin they are going to invest in. But there are some new traders who have no idea about trading.  Buy coins without understanding anything and lose their money. I think before trading you should have good experience and then trade.",

Despite of volatility then they could able to sustain and make themselves that profitable.Yes,its never been easy considering and looking just on the volatility of this market then you could really tell that dealing up with it on active manner does really require good skills.Even myself did try to have that daytrade but turns out to be that hard considering that main enemy on here is your emotion because of those fast fluctuation of price.If you cant bare out that particular thing then its better to stick to spot.",
