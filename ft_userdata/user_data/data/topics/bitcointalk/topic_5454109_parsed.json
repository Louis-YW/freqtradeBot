  "content": "Hi,This is the official thread of BitcoinCasino.to - a comprehensive review and comparison website for crypto casinos.Our ambition is to help players easily discover trusted Bitcoin and altcoin casinos by finding, testing and reviewing as many as possible of the operators that support cryptocurrency payments.So far we’ve identified more than 1400 crypto casinos and the list is growing on a daily basis. As it takes some time to properly review a casino, we might not ever be able to catch up – but we’ll try our best.In addition to our own experiences of signing up, depositing, playing, withdrawing and testing the support function we do keep an eye on the overall reputation among players and professional reviewers as well.Now, we would humbly like to ask this great community for some feedback so we can improve the website further and make it even more useful.@Players: What are the most important things that you want to learn from a casino review? What kind of content, features or tools would you personally find useful? What other kinds of improvements could we make to the site? We have just enabled visitor comments as well so if you agree or disagree about our assessment of any particular casino you can quickly and easily let your voice be heard on the site.@Webmasters: There are several other great crypto casino guides and review websites that we deeply respect and appreciate. If you’re a webmaster and have an idea on how we can possibly collaborate and help the community together, feel free to reach out.@Operators: If you haven’t already been reviewed you’re probably already on our TODO list. If you want to be prioritized let us know. Positive player feedback on this forum and/or strong reviews from other reputable websites could help expedite your case.In addition to private messages here, you can also reach us through Telegram: https://t.me/bitcoincasinotoLooking forward to any kind of feedback. If you know of any crypto casino that we’ve missed, feel free to highlight it in this thread.If you’re new to the site you can find it here: https://bitcoincasino.to/Thank you for your time.---Updates based on feedback2023-05-27: Added a \"+ BitcoinTalk Thread\" in the feature list next to casinos with official threads in this forum.",

If you skip it completely you'll have some people complaining about that. But if you go with full names and unedited profile pictures someone might risk real life abuse because they wrote something that someone didn't like. And if you do something in between someone will be displeased with that as well  We'll see if we can come up with something better.Thanks!",
