  "content": "Hello,I just got upgrade from 6900xt to 7900xtx and now I am trying to find miner and best overclock settings. It looks that still the best miner is Phoenix although it doesnt have zil caching and I have to use general kernel (as Phoenixminer itself is dead I think and no updates). But my trouble with phoenix is that it doesnt show me power use(actually other miners do not show me it either) ... even SRBminer that says that it supports 7900 gpus(I dont think any other miner have said the same)anyway right now with Phoenix and gminer and srb-miner I have managed to get 109MH/s with memory on 2740Mhz(in amd control panel(it show it is 2728Mhz)) and core is 1488Mhz, core voltage is set .700, power limit is -10it uses 280W - 285W of power (I see other monitoring places, not in miners) ... is this how it is the best or what overclock settings should I use ... and can add the ability to see wattage in miners ? is there some fix for it ? thank you I havent tried teamredminer because I always find it troublesome, with my 6900xt at least",

The software show wrong wattage - as all know.Phönixminer inflates the hashrate - so it is not the best miner - best miner for AMD is Teamredminer. It is optimized for AMD only and the developer doing a very well job. Sure you will see a little bit lower shown hashrate in the miner itself - but the pool hashrate is higher as any other miner and that is the only important think. I know you will don´t accept that, as many other noobs. Core clock can be lower i think, try to lower core voltage as low as you can. Around 260w software readed is possible. I think triple mining for those big cards is the best deal.",

It costs approximately $10.",
