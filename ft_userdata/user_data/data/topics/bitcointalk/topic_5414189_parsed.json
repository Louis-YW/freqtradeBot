  "content": "We are a pretty standard ERC-20 token, and we want feedback on how to improve or what to change of our project to make it better. We are going to paste our white paper next.White Paper: At Ringz we believe that the opinion of each person and organization matters. We also believe that the best decisions are made when a group of people, with different experiences and backgrounds, collaborate to arrive at the right choice.This is why Ringz works in partnership with PollsMine. You may be wondering... What is PollsMine? PollsMine is a platform developed by the same team that created Ringz, in which users can ask and answer any type of survey, question or concern. Verified members of the app get 1 $RNGZ reward when they help other users make decisions, that is, when they answer a survey.We want PollsMine to be the platform that helps everyone reach a decision. From teenagers who do not know which outfit to choose to attend a party or which photograph to upload to their social networks, to large companies seeking to measure the reception that the design of a new image or the introduction of a new product to the market could generate among their consumers. It is intended that people and organizations turn to PollsMine so that, supported by the users and their responses, a more realistic and accurate decision can be reached.As of today, the main objective of the project is the acquisition of new users and the growth/popularization of the platform. In subsequent phases, as the platform continues to grow, the Ringz-PollsMine relationship will be strengthened by integrating new services into PollsMine and creating new platforms tied to it. In later sections of the document, the next phases will be described in detail.Token SaleThe project is planned in 3 phases. The total amount of tokens on the market will be 6,666,666,666,666 $RNGZ at the end of the three phases. We intend a price of $0.01 USD per token, investors and exchanges will be offered a lower price $0.007 USD so they can make a profit when selling.To explain it in a better way, we will use graphs for each phase, in which the number of minted tokens and its distribution will be reflected.Phase 1.01,111,111,111,111 $RNGZhttps://ringztoken.com/_next/image?url=%2Fphase-1.png&w=828&q=75Phase 2.02,222,222,222,222 $RNGZhttps://ringztoken.com/_next/image?url=%2Fphase-2.png&w=828&q=75Phase 3.03,333,333,333,333 $RNGZhttps://ringztoken.com/_next/image?url=%2Fphase-3.png&w=828&q=75PollsMine will end up with 3,000,000,000,000 $RNGZ that will only be used to pay rewards to their verified users. As outlined in the ＂roadmap＂ section (next section), PollsMine may get more $RNGZ by charging users for running ads or special kind of polls in the platform. Those earnings may be used with other purposes.Exchanges (i.e. Binance, FTX, Coinbase, Bitso, Kraken, KuCoin) will end up with 2,000,000,000,000 $RNGZ to sell in their platforms and gain a profit.The team will end up with 666,666,666,666 $RNGZ that will be used to cover their personal expenses and to grow the team.250,000,000,000 $RNGZ will be donated to organizations dedicated or related to technology. Those organizations will be selected by the community using PollsMine. Another 250,000,000,000 $RNGZ will be used as a reserve for the future.Finally, 500,000,000,000 $RNGZ will be used to fund research on topics as haptic technology, full-immersive technology, biological 3D printing, space travel and mining, artificial intelligence, robots, human-machine interfaces, among others.RoadmapThe current part of the project is planned in 3 phases, to move from one phase to the next there are a series of goals that have to be met. The goals per phase can be modified by the founding members of the team, these decisions will be made together with the project followers, using PollsMine as a platform for decision making. Each of the phases will be explained below, along with their goals and how or when these could be considered accomplished.Phase 1.0PollsMine website launchRingz website launchRingz contract deploymentFirst Mint (1,111,111,111,111 $RNGZ)Transfer 111,111,111,111 $RNGZ to the teamSocial networks profiles creationPolygonScan contract verificationPolygonScan social information updatePhase 2.0PollsMine accepts $RNGZ as paymentiOS and Android PollsMine apps launchInitial coin offeringSecond Mint (2,222,222,222,222 $RNGZ)Transfer 222,222,222,222 $RNGZ to the teamPollsMine category for NFT holdersVideogame development startsML models development startsFirst Exchanges listingCoinMarketCap listingCoin Gecko listingPhase 3.0Third mint (3,333,333,333,333 $RNGZ)Transfer 333,333,333,333 $RNGZ to the teamTransfer 250,000,000,000 $RNGZ to the reserveDecision-making on donations startsDecision-making on research startsTransfer donationsThe TeamWe are a Mexican team, currently made up of two people (we are a couple, have been together for 4 years): a developer and a publicist. We realized that combining our skills, learning and experiences, with our fanaticism and love for technology and the future, logic dictated that we had to create a project that would allow us to work more closely with the tech world. We chose cryptocurrencies because of their current popularity and because we believe they are the ＂bridge＂ technology to other technologies such as the metaverse, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.The first member of the team is a self-taught full-stack developer, with a background in web development. He defines himself as an avid reader, lover of technology and with an immeasurable passion and intrigue for the future and technological advances. His main function is the development of the platforms and the planning of the next phases of the project.The second member of the team is a female publicist, entrepreneur, lover of design and technology. Her experience launching and growing local projects, together with her creativity and notion of brand design, facilitate the task of brand creation as well as the elaboration of advertising campaigns that will be used for user acquisition. She also collaborates with ideas in the structuring of the project.As we said at the beginning of this document, we believe that the opinion of every person and organization matters. That is why the decisions of our project will be made by the members of the community. We will take advantage of our own platform to discuss the future of the project and, therefore, there are some goals, objectives or plans exposed in this text that will probably vary as our community grows, solidifies and decides.We are open to any kind of advice, thank you in advance.",
