  "content": "This week saw the beginning of alleged Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht’s trial in a federal courthouse in Manhattan. Ulbricht’s counsel began the trial on an interesting note, arguing that Ulbricht indeed founded the site, but that he was not the Dread Pirate Roberts, the mysterious operator of the online free marketplace.In a cross-examination of DHS agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan on the third day of the trial, Ulbricht’s defense team coaxed a serious shocker from the agent who had infiltrated the Silk Road as an employee:“You believed him to be the mastermind behind Silk Road, keeping it secure and operating?” Ulbricht defense attorney Dratel asked Der-Yeghiayan.“I did,” Der-Yeghiayan testified.But he wasn’t talking about Ulbricht. He was talking about former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, who is involved in a legal battle of his own regarding the hundreds of thousands of bitcoins that went missing from his site in the beginning of 2014.“The Homeland Security agent’s theory was that Karpeles, as owner of Mt. Gox, held an enormous amount of Bitcoin. He used Silk Road to leverage that price and raise it, which it did by several hundred times over during the course of Silk Road’s lifespan. Bitcoin was worth around $2 at Silk Road’s launch and hit as high as $290 by 2013.”If it turns out to be true, this is the plot twist of the century!+ Mark Karpeles issued a statement denying that he is the Dread Pirate Roberts.+ A first-hand account from someone in the courtroom on day 3.ENCRYPTIONEarlier this week, British PM David Cameron questioned the need for end-to-end encrypted communications, arguing that no one should have the right to communicate electronically in a way that the government can’t access the contents. Cameron actually said,The question is, are we going to allow a means of communications which simply isn’t possible to read? My answer to that question is: no, we must not.Wow. Consider for a moment the absurdity of a first-world, Western head of state slamming the use of one of the most essential technologies relied upon today. Chances are good that you are reading this over an HTTPS connection, which uses that pesky encryption thing, and so do apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and iMessage. Virtually all of your private data, your credit card numbers, bank statements, and medical records are all kept relatively safe online through the use of strong encryption techniques.Cameron’s remarks were immediately condemned by people all around the world.Free speech activists, newspapers, internet security experts, and just plain oldregular folks the world over were flabbergasted by the fact that, again, the leader of a western democracy suggested making private digital communications impossible. After two days of meetings with Cameron, Barack Obama then alsovoiced his concerns about encryption.“If we find evidence of a terrorist plot… and despite having a phone number, despite having a social media address or email address, we can’t penetrate that, that’s a problem,” Obama said. He said he believes Silicon Valley companies also want to solve the problem. “They’re patriots.”Wait, what? The United States was founded on the principle that a government’s power should be restricted in order to avoid tyranny. The right to private communications is a fundamental one; it’s the reason why it’s a felony to open someone else’s mail, and why the government needs a warrant to do so. The patriotic thing to do probably doesn’t involve violating the United States constitution.Former NSA lawyer Stewart Baker had this to say:“We expect companies to be able to help with this. That doesn’t mean that you always have to write bad cryptography.” Cryptography with a backdoor is bad cryptography, full stop. What happens when the backdoor key inevitably falls into the wrong hands? Granting the government unrestricted access to private communications does not make anyone safer — it in fact does just the opposite. To concentrate so much power in the authority of a government is just inviting abuses of the system. McCarthy-era blacklists were scary enough without government having the ability to algorithmically sort and discover anyone who says something they don’t like. A populace that self-censors itself for a fear of their speech getting them in trouble can no longer be said to have free speech.Living in China, I know just how excruciating dealing with an unfree internet is. It’s one of the worst parts about living here. Only by using strong cryptography am I able to bypass the censorship at all, even to do the simplest of things like checking my email. If China had a way to backdoor VPNs, which rely on strong encryption, they’d still be able to stop me from looking at Gmail. It will be a very, very sad day for freedom when the US is taking cues from China on internet policy. I am deeply concerned about Cameron and Obama’s remarks this week.+ Cory Doctorow explains how stupid the idea of putting government backdoors in everything is.+ The Digital Arms Race: NSA Preps America for Future Battle – Der Spiegel published new Snowden docs.VOLATILITYI don’t typically focus on the price of bitcoin in this newsletter, because I believe that the price is one of the least important things about this whole bitcoin thing, and it’s very difficult to know all the forces at work during any big price movement. That said, this week’s ~30% downswing is notable, because there hasn’t been this much volatility for nearly a year, and also the price is at an 18 month low. Some miners are turning off their machines as lower coin prices means they are no longer profitable.Wired writer Jerry Brito also thinks that “The Price of Bitcoin Doesn’t Matter Right Now”:“In other words, it’s early days. The Googles and Facebooks of Bitcoin–the killer apps that will make the technology indispensable for ordinary users–may not come for another 5 years.Unlike the early Web, though, Bitcoin has a price ticker people look at daily, and so they wring their hands.

Nasdaq will also provide marketing support.”  WSJ+ Noble Markets CEO John Betts on CNBC. Former NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer has joined NY-based bitcoin derivatives platform TeraExchange in the role of advisor. TeraExchange previously received approval from the CFTC to move forward with their platform, but has not yet received specific approval for their bitcoin derivative products.Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (Ticker: GBTC) finally went live this week, making it the first bitcoin ETF to hit the market. At the time of this writing, no trading activity had occurred yet. GBTC quotes on WSJ.Bloomberg: Stock Exchanges are Beginning to Take Bitcoin SeriouslyADOPTIONFor the past several months, there have been rumours that PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker room, was preparing to accept bitcoin deposits. In February, the company even denied those rumours. PS still has not caught the bitcoin bug, but thanks to a partnership between payment processor Neteller and BitPay, users can now use bitcoin to make deposits into their accounts. Neteller also offers prepaid MasterCard debit cards which can be topped up with bitcoin.BitNet, the bitcoin payments processor that was founded by former Visa and bank executives announced this week a partnership with payments processor Cardinal Commerce. The partnership will give all Cardinal merchants the ability to enable bitcoin payments. Cardinal counts among their customers “international retail giants such as Lenovo, Toshiba, GameStop, Tiffany & Co., and Urban Outfitters. It also includes leading travel companies such as Delta Airlines, Orbitz, Travelocity, and Hotwire.”  Last week Rakuten integrated bitcoin payments with BitNet. Keep an eye on these guys!AROUND THE WORLDSenior Hong Kong legislator Leung Yiu-Chung says that there is no need for legislation to regulate bitcoin at this time. Several months ago, a group of scammers in Hong Kong used the premise of selling their clients bitcoins to steal millions of dollars, which led some in the HK government to call for more regulation.“Swedish bitcoin exchange BTCX, has been requested by the local Tax Authority to disclose transaction history of the company’s 20,000 customers. The exchange is taking the Swedish Tax Authority to court, arguing that by doing so, all its clients’ identities would be disclosed.” Startups from more than sixty countries applied to this year’s Barclays Accelerator program in London. Only ten were accepted. Of those ten, three of them are focused on bitcoin or blockchain technology. According to Coindesk, Barclays was heavily involved in the selection process, with finalist applicants having to do a Q&A session with as many as thirty employees of Barclays.READS“Welcome to DoctorX’s Barcelona lab, where the drugs you bought online are tested for safety and purity. No questions asked.” Fascinating article: Inside the Deep Web Drug Lab“Traditional payment infrastructure was built before the Internet existed, in a world where a lot of people and physical resources (land, buildings) was owned by central parties (e.g. a bank) to monitor and facilitate transfers of value.

Your website lacks too much features like on any project you must have to provide more details like that little box containing the information much be clickable.But less interaction on your Website will make it worse. You have to work on you UI and you have to define in your website why it is better then your rivals. In crypto industry, you have to be micro about niche and if you have selected this one then you have to be creative not just make it (like a prototype) and start advertising it. At least put something about you and put something to be clicked.",

Any attempt to implement an ICO token is just another \"take the money and run\" project.OP, It seems to me that you approach this discussion a little too aggressively. If you are provoked by a difference of opinion, then perhaps you should not open the topic.Yes, as you received previous suggestions, your site does not offer anything special, except a countdown for some kind of ICOs. If you want to become significant, you should definitely offer more. Some analysis, project structure... anything.Quote from: SBCO on July 17, 2023, 04:21:34 AMFree listings aren't being rated just like on most sites, doing an in-depth review of a alt-token takes lots of resources and even then it might not be correct.For example, can you say something, at least part of it, about the methods you use for review before approving the listing of an ICO on your portal?Quote from: SBCO on July 17, 2023, 04:21:34 AMSometimes I think that users just use threads to advertise their crypto casinos for free, becouse this content is zero effort.When I open your website, the first thing I see is an advertisement for bc.game casino",
