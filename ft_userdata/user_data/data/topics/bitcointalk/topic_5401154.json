So I'm putting it here.Interesting to see that as of the 2022 BTC price, there are still protocols out there burning a lot of it.Anyone know what other schemes besides STX burn BTC to 1111111111111111111114oLvT2 as of 2022?Quote from: MAsterV on September 12, 2015, 12:15:34 PMIt's just sad 43.26050876 BTC    is just lying there ... no one to use it...The funny thing is that Stacks / STX still uses this as some kind of (apparently frequently used) fallback in their proof-of-transfer logic. Makes me wonder what ROI can be expected from its staking logic which is supposed to go into the opposite direction as the \"proof-of-transfer\" (getting BTC back out)...",
