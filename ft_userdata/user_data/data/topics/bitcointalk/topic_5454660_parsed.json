  "content": "RAFFLE #11\"A decentralized digital currency is a pathway to many abilities, our government considered it to be unnatural.\"Quotes from a galaxy far, far away...We are back again with another great raffle to motivate the fellow members who have been contributing towards this board.As a token of appreciation to all the Indian forum members who are making this board a delightful place to stay even during the adverse Bitcoin conditions prevailing in India, we will continue running these raffles till the balance lasts. As of today, the price of 1BTC is around $27,000 ~ â‚¹22,30,000 per bitcoin Â and the winner would be receiving â‚¹2,200.About the Game :1. This is a pretty simple and quite interesting game, where there would be 16 spots from 0-9 and a-f. Each person should pick one character and post in the reply of this topic along with their bitcoin address. 2. Once all the 16 spots are filled, I will choose one single future block to be mined. For instance person X has chosen '8' as their spot and I have chosen block #782,997. Here the hash of the block #782,997 is 00000000000000000004cade9ff90e7ec9c31e4bf0475a1793387a5a06d9ea88 which determines that 8 is the winning character.3. The person who has chosen the correct character wins the prize amount of 0.001BTC (Please note that 0.001BTC is no more cheaper but in terms of our economy it costs around â‚¹2,300)As per rules, they are mostly the same as followed in the previous raffle topicsRules :1. The game is strictly restricted only to Indian forum members. If you are someone outside India or hailing from nearby countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan or Sri Lanka, you are not allowed to participate in this game.2. This raffle winner cannot participate in the upcoming games for 6 months. Let us give others a chance to win some bitcoins. You can consider this 6 months as a cooling period like if some X has won the game in April, they can participate only in the November raffle. Our local community is so small such that I have reduced the period to 6 months.3. There are 16 spots and only 1 slot per person is allowed and more importantly I cannot give you any random spots. Once I have updated the slot in OP, there is no changing of slot numbers. Please see to the filled spots in OP or have an eye on picked up spots by others before posting your slot number in reply.4. Newbies are allowed to participate, but you shouldn't have made your first post in this topic and you should be contributing to this board on a regular basis.5. This topic is only for playing the game and all the other discussions and doubts regarding the raffle or future game ideas should be posted only in the Indian Raffle Discussion topic.6. Bounty Hunters are not allowed to participate in the game. Even though if you are from India, the board doesn't need bounty hunters who are chiming here only for profits or earning money from this forum.7. Only active participants of Indian board in the previous months are allowed to participate in the upcoming raffles. This is not just a new rule to demotivate the inactive participants, but to encourage and improve the activity of this board.Previous Raffle Winners :Raffle 1 - sureshnsnetRaffle 2 - iram3130Raffle 3 - Rohan KotkarRaffle 4 - amishmanishBlock Halving Raffle 5 - LenderRaffle 6 - TigerMartIndependence Day Raffle 7 - madhavsinghrajputGuy Fawkes Day Raffle 8 - Clement KaliyarBitcoin Birthday Raffle 9 - pawanjainRevival Raffle 10 - avikzSpots :0 - pakhitheboss1 - cafter2 - erikalui3 - elevates4 - TheUltraElite5 - Stedsm6 - 7 - 8 - ajaxtempest9 - pawanjaina - libert19b - Bureauc - TigerMartd - e -f - IIrik11Wallet Balance : 0.001999BTCGood Luck and May the force be with everyone!",

Keep the entries rolling guysGreat! I felt that he will be a part of this raffle! He hasn't contributed with a topic but he has been active all over the forum. Still, he gets an opportunity and I think he can be a great asset if he comes up with a thread. I won't question your understanding Heisenberg_Hunter. I would still feel comfortable with @libert19 going ahead and creating a few threads on our board. Can you or not @libert19? If not then it all depends on your understanding of this thread Heisenberg_Hunter as you are the OP.",
