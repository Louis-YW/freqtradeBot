Only 3743 Masternodes exist and the reward is 5% per total block ; this is to prevent masternodes controlling the overall market liquidity and exponentiation masternode control. Sole purpose of a masternode is to allow privatesend and instasend to mix transactions. 2) Second Incentive : POWAR REWARD 100 VHH cost per transaction. Every volkshash transaction will be given back to the miner as incentive. The more activity that takes place the more the miner can receive .   3) Third Incentive : The Block Fifthening / 20% or 1/5Deflationary block reward system . Block rewards reduce 20% every 87600 blocks created on the blockchain. 4) Slow Start on POWAR and MASTERNODE PROOF OF WORK:VHH 5000 from block 0 to 100, Masternode reward starts giving 5% (of total block) from block height #150000 to prevent exponentiation masternode growth or masternode centralization. You can launch a masternode from Block height #1 the reward is 0.0000002% (of total block). This will allow Mastnodes being launched without overwhelming the network.5) No Asics / No GPU CPU miners only , YesPower is only CPU mineable at this stage . Low entry mining for all.6) VHH 1.000   = 1000 Volkoshis/Satoshis . Volkshash has only 3 denominations.

Important Note:585 000 000 is required to host a masternode and till block# 150 000 the reward will be +- VHH 1 . Then the reward will change to 5% per block , this will allow the network to grow without masternodes ruling the network  , as stated in Hashpaper . Will post a guide later when time of fine tuning is done  , Checking functions and stability first of Volkshash as some have nuclear powered CPUs .  You can follow any dash masternode guide if you are in a rush. Note masternodes purpose is not to overthrow the volkshash economy this is to protect both miner and user.",
