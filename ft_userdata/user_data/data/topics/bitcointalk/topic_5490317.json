  "content": "What makes bitcoin a better (or worse) substitute for gold? This is an important question since bitcoin is constantly being compared to gold.I will admit my bias is for bitcoin but for purposes of this thread let's be as objective and fair as possible to the gold and silver bugs.No matter what our bias, if any we should never allow ourselves to become close-minded to other ideas and viewpoints. Always take into consideration opposing viewpoints with an open mind because that is how bitcoin can become better and stronger.I will start.An advantage of gold:Gold is a tangible physical thing and instantly recognized by anyone in the world as something that has value. There is no need to explain it because even the most poor and uneducated among us instantly recognize that gold is something that has value. You might say gold has an intrinsic value and universally recognized with no need for explanation.On the other hand many people do not even understand  what bitcoin is or why it has value. It is something that has to be explained constantly to people.Even after explaining there will always be those who will never get it even if they are otherwise very intelligent people. For example:  Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet.An advantage of bitcoin:The physical aspect of gold can also be a disadvantage. One of the reasons why I never personally invested in gold is practical. Where would I store it? If you are accumulating or DCAing into gold over a long period of time then eventually you may end up owning a large amount which then presents you with the question of how and where to store it. And most importantly, how to secure it against theft.The other question is how do you know that the gold you have is even real? Is it solid gold or just gold plated or even faked? I never bought gold myself so I don't know how much of an issue that is in reality but of course anything can be faked, or even just diluted. A big advantage of bitcoin is its portability. Sending coins or bars of gold through the mail seems inherently slow and risky, though again I don't have any personal experience doing that since I have never owned any gold other than some small items of gold jewelry. Those are just some of my thoughts to start the thread. For those who own both gold and bitcoin what are your thoughts?",

      "body": "Why are gold and bitcoin both valuable? Easy answer: rarity. Gold is rare and not everyone can just extract it from the earth hence the explanation for its expensive price. Just like in bitcoin, it only has limited supply. Low supply and high demand results in high prices.Another con I can think of gold is that even though it might never lose its value, you won’t really be able to receive profits from it unless you actually sell it. It’s not gonna earn you passive income which is pretty much the same for bitcoin. In order to gain profit, you need to sell your asset. The difference is that buying/selling gold would be much harder to do compared to buying/selling bitcoin. Bitcoin is accessible and easily traded which adds to our convenience. You also don’t have to worry about physical storage unlike gold because it is stored digitally or in a hard wallet.",

But one thing that I can tell you about bitcoin, even if there's that uncertainty, it's still worth investing into compared to gold because you're more likely to make more profit than with gold and in terms of value, bitcoin's already beaten gold by a long mile.",

Author is very engaging and does an outstanding job of explaining it very clearly and simply.

Always take into consideration opposing viewpoints with an open mind because that is how bitcoin can become better and stronger.Like you I am heavily biased towards Bitcoin even though I own both of them. My gold investments are rather small and only part of a general commodity fund that includes a larger range of precious metals. Over the years this investment has done pretty well and I am just going to keep it and only profit from the periodic payouts. My main motivation to buy into commodities like gold and silver came from my grandparents who always believed that gold was the ultimate investment and they kept a lot of gold jewellery at home. My parents eventually sold all that jewellery as nobody in the family wanted to keep gold directly at home as a investment. Both gold and Bitcoins are near their ATHs and it might seem they did really well in the last year. However, gold has been on those high levels for several years now and the recent performance isn't that great. The 1-year performance of gold was only 9.5% which isn't much compared to Bitcoin. If I had to choose between the two, I would always go for Bitcoin, but if I have enough money then a small side investment in gold is not going to hurt.",
