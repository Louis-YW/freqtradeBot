  "content": "Hello crypto bros, today I want to share my thoughts on when it will be the best time to buy bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy bitcoin right now, DCA is still the best tactic. But it's still good to know WHEN it will be the best time to safely invest money in bitcoin and be sure that it will probably go up from now on. But I won't be bothering you with TA analysis (that is probably wrong) and strange predictions, today we will just look at the facts. I'll start by saying that yes, I think we are still in the bear market and it's obvious that the economy is still suffering. And it's not a secret that bitcoin still didn't decouple from the NASDAQ so we should understand that if the economy goes down => bonds go down => bitcoin goes down too. So we still might see some down movements and maybe we will even see a new button because statistically something always breaks down after fed pivot. So we can safely say that we will see a true bull run only when the economy will start recovering, but it can't happen until rates will start going down. That's why right now I think that we all should wait for the one single indicator: lowering of the rates. Bitcoin won't go up mediately, but it will mean that economy will start recovering => more money will go to the assets => and bitcoin and bonds will go up. The only question is when will it happen? Well, if we look at how fast inflation is going down, I can assume that it will probably go down to the expected 3-4% in the Q4 of 2023. So I'm not expecting a bull run until 2024.But again, I don't want you all to be bearish on bitcoin or selling it. For most people, DCA is enough to survive this crypto winter, but if you want to invest a lot of money in bitcoin, then I think it's better to wait until the signal we talked about.BTCBTCBTCBTC",

I've seen a lot of people mentioning this correlation, but they do not always happen. It's true that situations make them move in the same way at times, but check their charts, the curves are not always the same, so I will avoid using one to invest in the others.That said, I like the idea of DCAing, but now, I will have almost my investment in bitcoin, and the trick is for me to locate the bottom and buy it, then move it to USDT when a bearish trend is established (for holding).This is solely being done with the help of technical analysis, and it has been so productive for me since last year that I got fully involved in BTC.",

I never liked that fact, so although I understand that stablecoins have some advantages in trading, when it comes to holding, I would never gamble in that way.[UPDATED] PSA: Most Stablecoins Can Be Frozen, Even in Your Own Wallets",

I mean if you greed for more then definitely you will miss the golden opportunity to grab the Bitcoins at the current best possible price. Remember one thing that Bitcoins are limited in number, that is more Bitcoins cannot be created or invented. Hence it makes Bitcoins very much valuable. As the time will pass these coins will become more valuable as the demand will increase side by side. So according to me there is no perfect time to buy the Bitcoins. Whenever possible buy as many coins as you can and hold for long term. Definitely you will see huge profits.",

However, what if the economy is in a worse condition than it currently is? We certainly can't expect much growth currently since the market has been going downhill for the past few years, but what if the condition is worse in the near future? Could Bitcoin still thrive? The OP is also claiming that there's still a possibility of the market crashing again, but in my opinion, Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $20,000 again.",

This sounds like a safe purchasing method for BTC and of course, an amount that only you can afford to wait for a long period of time. There is no specific time when is the best time to buy BTC, for me., anything as long as you follow the DCA method and use an amount that you can afford.The BTC's next halving will almost come and as people expect BTC will create another ATH because of the hype.",

      "body": "You can keep a general conclusion that stocks/bonds/commodities going down means there is a background negative event and therefore bitcoin will also go down but there is not direct relation between them. Those who short will sell on the dump to buy back at lower prices, so if the same group of investors are going in on each of these assets it might seem that bitcoin is following them.I would say that there is no \"best\" time but one should buy bitcoin at the lower range of the cycle otherwise just wait it out. Like currently there is a uptrend going on, so the time to buy was before this when the bear market was going on.Strangely, I am seeing threads talking about buying bitcoin only after the uptrend has started and not during the bear market, when intelligent investors actually do the opposite.",
