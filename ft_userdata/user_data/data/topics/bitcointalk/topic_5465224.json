The addresses are guaranteed to match the PK's used but there is no record of which PK was put on which coin - was done randomly - so the only way to know if you win is to peel the coin and load the PK into a wallet. That said, you could then generate a new PK and address pair and load the coin yourself.Anyone wanting to do this, let me know and I can supply a new Alpen DIY hologram.",
