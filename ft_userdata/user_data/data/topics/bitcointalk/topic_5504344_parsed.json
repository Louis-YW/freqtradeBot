We must now assume that it has been stolen.I have set up a fund of 1,500,000 sats to recover it. The reward will be paid to the person who provides the crucial clue to its recovery.https://x.com/kanutotakumi/status/1817247067040854513?s=46&t=3kLdeXaYUTcS5qxFtcUOMQI am grateful for any help.Kanuto",

      "body": "Could you provide a little more background for what happened? Is this a physical piece that was stolen? And where, when, etc. If so, doubt any of us could help -- plenty of very capable blockchain sleuths around here, but am not sure they're up for detecting physically.P.S. Did almost sound like a game, until I saw your Twitter thread. Bounty now over 1.7 mbtc -- post an address of that fund?",

      "body": "It is a physical piece that was sent by post to the conference warehouse.There is proof that the parcel arrived at the warehouse and was dropped off in the lobby.It probably disappeared inside the warehouse. I have a good contact with the organizer and they have made a real effort to find it. they have searched everything 4 times in the last week, but it is gone. it's a 52 x52 x 5 cm piece and weighs 4 kilos, so it's hard for me to believe that it's just \"gone missing\".I have adjusted the conditions on Geyser today, so all donations for the bounty will go to HRF and Mempool in any case. You can also find pictures there, more here:https://geyser.fund/project/4thhalvingblockSince the sats for the bounty are collected via Geyser, there is no Bitcoin address, as this works via Lightning.",

      "body": "Sorry that happened to you, op. Though I can't provide any leads to help you. May I suggest you try to boost your Twitter post's exposure by twitter ads and/or launching a giveaway with repost + tag a friend requirements. Though, it'd be best if you can target the locals from the same city as well, I think some social media allows this? maybe look into it.Some good old posters near the venue could help too -- if it's allowed. Also, if there are online communities for the city, might as well post there.Good luck.",
