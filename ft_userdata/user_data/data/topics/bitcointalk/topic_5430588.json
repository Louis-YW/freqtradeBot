When I do this and run executable I get an error. \"Error while loading shared libraries libxcb-xinerama....\"I also cannot find bitcoin in usr/local/bin or usr/bin to copy over old binaries with new.I have bitcoin installed on my extra drive. 22 runs fine. I'm missing something in the upgrade process, any suggestions/solutions appreciated.",

Perhaps Qt is not installed by default? This is especially likely if GNOME or some gnome-based environment such as XFCE or MATE was the first (or only) desktop that was installed.",

Didn't realize I didn't restart. 308 blocks left proper version 24.0.1.   It ran that way before, should both be 1 for for?  It seems its related to this error \"Unable to open bitcoin-qt when incoming connections disabled in settings\"Are these listen 0 and listenonion 1 are in your Bitcoin core config? I think both of them are enabled by default but would you mind trying to remove them from your bitcoin core config or just setting up both of them into 1 to enable them?But if your current settings are running fine just leave it like other users they having the same issue but the others with the same settings they don't get this error.Or if you just want to use it as normal try the suggestion from GitHub to run bitcoin-qt -resetguisettings to reset the settingsAdding this if you are planning to run your core with TOR then check this discussion here \"Bitcoin node over TOR\"",
