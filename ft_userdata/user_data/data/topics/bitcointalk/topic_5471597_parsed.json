  "content": "Hey guys, continuing the discussion a bit earlier i want to ask the owners of Safepal S1 about their experiences. I know its closed source compared with Onekey for example that is open source. Also the downloads on Google Play is very high around 1mil if i am not mistaken. Do you know if anybody got hacked? I mean not from dumb smart contracts being signed , but for moving BTC in and out the wallet and having a decent knowledge on things.Because what i see on other forums or articles is that people are being hacked when they buy/sell coins that are scams.",

It is not known if it has vulnerabilities like backdoor or spyware or something of such.The best hardware wallet that you can go for are open source hardware wallet.",

That mobile app you're referring to can work without the hardware wallet.Now, even putting the fact that it's closed source aside, the wallet is just horrible. I did buy one some time ago back when it was even cheaper than it currently is, and I think the UX is just bad. It's probably the last wallet I would recommend anyone to buy.",

I have not seen a review yet that the wallet is completely open source, but for now, we truly supposed to mention it as exception and the reason. The wallet is having bluetooth and not QR code for making transactions, can not be connected with other software wallet like Electrum.

Who knows if there are close source wallet that are lazy and made use of Libbitcoin for their seed generation. Close source wallets are dangerous to that extent. Open source wallets can have vulnerabilities, likewise close source wallet, like what that happen during the close source Atomic wallet hack that happen this year that lead to over $100 of stolen coins. Any of the wallet can be vulnerable, but close source is far worse because the public do not know the code that is used to build it just like I have mentioned before which I know is not new to you. Because of how open source wallets are, and there are many bitcoin open source wallets that make use of secure means of generating seed phrase (there are too many of them), I will prefer to go for open source wallets.The only hardware wallet that meets my preferences is Passport, while yet to be released Coldcard and upcoming Keystone are promising. Although, if Safepal X1 is reviewed and if truly open source, likely some people can prefer it because of its cheap price. It would have been good if it supports QR code.",

But open source has always been in our consideration. In the future, we might also choose to open source part of the codes based on the actual situation, just like Apple and Microsoft did.Quote from: Charles-Tim on October 26, 2023, 07:22:57 AMThe only hardware wallet that meets my preferences is Passport, while yet to be released Coldcard and upcoming Keystone are promising.

With the review I read about Safepal X1, it can only be used with the Safepal software wallet, it can not be connected with wallets like Electrum or Sparrow.
