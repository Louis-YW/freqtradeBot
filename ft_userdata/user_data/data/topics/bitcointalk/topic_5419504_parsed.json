So is there any wallet that have these feature?",

Coinomi does support bitcoin and the altcoins you mentioned.However  I wasn't able to find the option to scan for 1000 adresses.Have you considered using metamask and electrum?You can use different software for each coin, which is usually better.Hardware wallets such as ledger nano or trezor are also good options.",

So is there any wallet that have these feature? This is completely unrealistic use case to generate so many addresses for both Bitcoin with shitcoins and to expect some random wallet will be able to import thousands of addresses.Each wallet usually have limited number of addresses, so you would need to manually change and test that with each wallet, but if you used BIP39 format to generate seed words than it should work in theory.If you did this offline than your wallet should be safe, but don't import this anywhere if you did this while being online with your browser.Best way to have good open source wallet that supports all three of this coins (btc, eth, trx) is to use open source hardware wallets like Trezor with their Trezor Suite app, or maybe Keystone hardware wallet.",

At best cases, you will have to use more than one wallet, and this will make it difficult for you if this is to complete the transfers within the service you provide on your site.The safest solution is to purchase payment services from one of the well-known payment gateways that can facilitate the service for you and your customers as well. There are many of them and I can direct you to one of these two options: BitPay or NowPayments.",
