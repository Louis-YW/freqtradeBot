  "content": "I have been mining this cryptocurrency as I don't spend a dime for it,I mine it with my work PC-s and make like 30 coins daily,I have near 3000 coins now and accumulating but lately precisely yesterday night the Raptoreum Core Wallet gives me a yellow message that says:\"Warning:Unknown blocks being mined,be careful\" and a couple of other things.The wallets work correctly as I mine from my work PC-s and send to my Linux machine at home where they reside.Is the raptoreum network/blockchain having problems or it is just a warning message to me?",

Do not use this console without fully understanding the ramifications of a command.This is a generic warning about using Console without knowledge of how it works. As far as I know it comes from Bitcoin, and is present in all forks unless removed.It definitely does not say \"attacks from scammers are going on\".To answer your question, nothing is \"going on\".But we do have a live stream tonight for some block 420420 celebration and discussion (futures activates at that height) should you want to join the party https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb1NsPkxVzc",
