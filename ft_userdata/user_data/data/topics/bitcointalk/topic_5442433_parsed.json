Its official site claimed to have more than 2400 validator nodes but the blockchain was always getting restarted and that means solana blockchain was true centralized blockchain.

So many times solana blockchain got network outageQuote from: IShishkin on March 04, 2023, 03:58:46 PMWhat is wrong here? Is it true that blockchain networks are failure resistant? Nothing wrong here. The only wrong thing is you are taking solana as an example caused by basically solana was just a centralized blockchain that fully under control by its developers. The only blockchain is very often to be restarted by its developersQuote from: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-25/solana-blockchain-hit-by-hours-long-network-slowdown-sol?leadSource=uverify%20wallDevelopers who operate and maintain the Solana blockchain restarted the crypto network after a technical problem triggered an hours-long slowdown over the weekend.",

The moment you realize that Solana is not as good as you think it is will be the moment you will start making a profit, it's a second hand coin at best and should not be considered a great product. I am not saying do not invest in it, there are many people who will, and it could go up in price when it shouldn't and you can profit from that.

What is your opinion?Being resistant to failures is not the same as being exempt from them, those two are completely different terms, besides as it is known solana is a centralized coin and this means that if something fails then the whole network fails, we have experimented this many times before and it is one of the reasons many investors are very skeptic about the long term prospects of solana, as  we never know when one of those failures could become critical and destroy whatever confidence is left on the coin.",

Thank you for your response.I appeal to popular \"educational content\" which is full of vague descriptions. As we know, decentralised blockchain is more reliable alternative to centralised databases. Solana is called \"blockchain\" simply because its data is organised into blocks linked by hashes. Sometimes it's called \"decentralized\" due to whatever reason. However, we observe that Solana is quite unreliable. Could Solana be anywhere better or more reliable than centralised database from any perspective?",
