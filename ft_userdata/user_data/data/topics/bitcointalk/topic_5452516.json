Don't you think that if Satoshi is to show himself today because of something like this, there will be more issues for us to be worried about than what we are facing now?",

I believe this is just a trying time and it will soon be over. Those that don’t believe and want to invest in bitcoin are always looking for the least possible problem to black-ash bitcoin but this won’t change the majority of the bitcoin enthusiasts mindset about it. Satoshi vision is a real and achievable one, just watch the space and you’ll soon see the result in the near future.QuoteThere is no way that Satoshi is not aware of the current situation if still alive, do you think what is happening right now is enough to draw Satoshi out to still make some changes or improvemens annonymously? Satoshi is not to be tempted by this to reveal himself to the world, I still believe his anonymity is what is making bitcoin to thrive till day. This is not the first time the transaction fee of bitcoin was recorded to be this high. In 2017, the price of bitcoin went as high as up to $60 even though this years own supersedes any other year before now which caused the alarm.",

So even if Satoshi comes out now, I still don't believe there is anything that can be easily done; it will definitely take some time to be rectified. By the way, nothing lasts forever without having some challenges that need to be tackled, so if Bitcoin is facing this one now, I think patience needs to be exercised a bit. Some developers are also moving the motion to fight against the high transaction fee.",

The problem is not enough for Satoshi to reappear because in this case even he can't do anything. The current situation is really bad with transactions and the developers are trying to find out something to fix the issue. I don't think that even Satoshi is capable enough to increase the size of blocks. Even if he appears out of no where he won't be able to do anything other than coping with the current developers.I believe that our beloved developers will soon find out a solution to resolve the issue of high transaction fees by implementing some new rules to disable ordinals protocol. I know this is easily said than done, but my firm belief is that soon we will see lower fees. And, if you ask me that if it's necessary for Satoshi to come back in this situation I would answer no because even he if comes back the things won't be in control. Let him remain anonymous till his last days after that the choice of appearing or not will also be his own decision.",

Well, it's hard to say for sure where Satoshi is or if he's still alive. Some people believed that he had passed away, while others thought that he was still alive and kept a low profile. But don't worry, I'm sure if Satoshi is alive when he wakes up and sees what's going on, he'll have some pretty good ideas on how to fix the situation as well as make changes to the network he's created.",

Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin was for it to be as decentralised as possible, possibly this is the reason he went offline, in order to promote what he was trying to achieve. As otherwise everyone would look up to him as a hero of Bitcoin of otherwise a leader to follow. So regardless of the high transaction fees, this remains Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin, as a decentralised means of value transfer.Quote from: Stepstowealth on May 12, 2023, 05:08:59 PMThere is no way that Satoshi is not aware of the current situation if still alive, do you think what is happening right now is enough to draw Satoshi out to still make some changes or improvemens annonymously? Nothing will draw Satoshi out of the shadows if he remains alive (which I doubt personally). If this were to be the case, he would of come out in 2017 over the block size \"civil war\". Now we see another so-called \"civil war\", but compared to 2017, it remains insignificant as hasn't caused any divide within the network.  Ultimately it seems Satoshi doesn't want the attention. Even a dev talking with the CIA was too much for him.",
