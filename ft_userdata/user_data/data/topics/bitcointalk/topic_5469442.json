The evolution of time will really happen, we have studied the evidence in school, initially humans made transactions using exchange of goods, then switched to using shells and then using Gold & FIAT. So, in the future don't be surprised if a bunch of little kids will be talking about Bitcoin and crypto in general.Quote from: edmundduke on October 06, 2023, 05:33:44 PMI do not think Bitcoin will be as big as the Internet adoption wise nor impact wise.

It will always be an alternative currency that people will choose to use. Fiat money in the forms of CBDC, Stalecoin, and cash will always be in existence and some people will always use them. The uniqueness of Bitcoin is its decentralized nature and only people who value privacy will embrace it wholeheartedly. Many people don't care about their privacy so they will always be comfortable with KYC. Introducing people to Bitcoin with this analogy sounds like a threat. You are threatening them to embrace Bitcoin because of the future doom that might befall them if they fail to do so.",

You cannot compare the evolution of the internet to bitcoin, it’s a whole different scale. There isn’t a lot of use cases for bitcoin except being a payment method. People can choose to still use fiat or other digital currencies, I believe bitcoin will be more popular in the future amongst people who do not want the government to have full control over their money. I think a better and more common analogy would be  Bitcoin is the future of money, the same way emails is the future of the post office",

Your analogy can be adopted by other forum users who are finding it difficult coming up with an analogy of their own to help in convincing people around as it is basic and relatable. This analogy will only be suitable for people who have low understanding, not people who have a high understanding of things and will not need an explanation so basic.",

The Internet was rapidly developing, speed was going up, costs were going down, the technology was rapidly gaining new features. You can't say the same about Bitcoin, today's Bitcoin is barely different from the version released by Satoshi. The Internet \"won\" the competition for being the best way to transmit information because it greatly outperformed radio, television and newspapers.
