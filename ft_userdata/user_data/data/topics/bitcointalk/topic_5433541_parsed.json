  "content": "self-moderated to keep this thread clean from trolls, attention-seekers and signature spammers JOLLYGOOD PRESENTS FREE LOTTERY #1 in association with donor Ratimov in association with proud sponsors Utopia THE WINNER RECEIVES c.$50 0.0025 in BITCOIN FURY vs USYKUPDATED 22ND JANUARY 2023The two teams are very close to signing an agreement to fight in March or April 2023 and this will be a huge historic and international event when it finally takes place. The winner of the Fury vs Usyk fight will be holding all the heavyweight belts and will be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world.This is a free lottery which offers 1 in 58 chance of winning. The winner was supposed to receive $50 in Bitcoin plus $25 CRP and $25 UUSD at the time the fight ended but that has been changed to 0.0025 BTC (which is more than $50 at the current rate) but I have received a PM from a moderator advising me to not giveaway altcoins as I will be banned.I am waiting for Utopia to advise me if they can giveaway $50 in BTC rather than CRP and UUSD then will update the thread, until then the prize will remain at c.$50 / 0.0025BTC (which will increase to if Utopia add it in BTC)There are some other ways the fight could end which could increase the number beyond 58 but this is how I will operate the free lottery.If you are interested in applying for a free number simply post a reply here with your BTC address. You will be given a number between 1-58 at random. If you want you can also ask for a number between 1-58 which I will try to give you on a first come first serve basis. In any case, the whole list will be published before the fight takes place and it will be updated periodically as members apply.Generally it will be the first 58 members applying for a number that will be selected but I reserve the right to refuse applications. For example, if you are on my ignore list or if you are a troll or attention-seeker or simply an obnoxious presence in the forum or in my opinion untrustworthy or if you are someone promoting scams, I reserve the right to refuse applications. In the spirit of fun and light entertainment, there is a small chance you could be allocated a number but in retrospect (but before the fight takes place) you could have your number revoked and allocated to another member but that is only if you happened to be someone who I allowed to participate by error without checking post history or because you have subsequently made comments that are unacceptable to the myself or the majority of members.This is a free lottery is open to all ranks. I am even willing to allow some newbies to apply. If you have received negative trust (but not from me) you can apply and your application will be looked at and a decision made after that.The 58 options are self-explanatory but in the highly unlikely event there is a dispute between members about who won the free lottery or if clarification is needed about the outcome, then I will make a statement via a post to explain my final decision.Please note:i) The prize fund payout has been changed to reflect BTC price only. Instead of paying the winner $50 at the time of the fight taking place, there will be a fixed 0.0025 BTC payout instead and that equates to $52.20 at the time of writing. This will be sent directly from me to the winner.ii) The prize was increased thanks to Utopia adding $50 to the prize fund and thank you to them for sponsoring this thread but as they offered in CRP and UUSD it had to be withdrawn from this thread as Games and Rounds cannot give away altcoins. This section will be updated as soon as possible.iii) This is supposed to be a free lottery for fun and light entertainment, if you have ulterior motives you are not welcome in this thread and your posts will be deleted. Only one entry per member. Duplicate applications will result in removal/exclusion from the free lottery.LIST LAST UPDATED: 21st MARCH 2023=============#01 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 1 suzanne5223#02 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 2 wwzsocki#03 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 3 Haunebu#04 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 4 Igebotz#05 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 5 LoyceV#06 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 6 mv1986#07 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 7 GazetaBitcoin#08 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 8 examplens#09 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 9 LFC_Bitcoin#10 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 10 franckuestein #11 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 11 Real-Duke #12 - Fury to win by knockout in Round 12 pakhitheboss #13 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 1#14 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 2#15 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 3  #16 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 4 bitbollo#17 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 5 bitzizzix#18 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 6 FatFork#19 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 7 condoras#20 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 8 Leviathan.007 #21 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 9 BenCodie#22 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 10 CoinEraser#23 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 11 hopenotlate#24 - Fury to win by TKO in Round 12 tokeweed#25 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 1#26 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 2#27 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 3#28 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 4 bct_ail#29 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 5#30 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 6#31 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 7 Mbitr#32 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 8#33 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 9#34 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 10#35 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 11 The Sceptical Chymist #36 - Usyk to win by knockout in Round 12 YOSHIE#37 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 1#38 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 2#39 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 3 jokers10#40 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 4#41 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 5#42 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 6#43 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 7 Pearls Before Swine#44 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 8#45 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 9 libert19#46 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 10 julerz12#47 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 11#48 - Usyk to win by TKO in Round 12#49 - Fury wins points decision W3 D0 L0 joeperry#50 - Fury wins points decision W2 D1 L0 xandry#51 - Fury wins points decision W2 D0 L1 Woodie#52 - Fury wins points decision W1 D2 L0 Strongkored#53 - Usyk wins points decision W3 D0 L0 Xal0lex#54 - Usyk wins points decision W2 D1 L0 inthelongrun#55 - Usyk wins points decision W2 D0 L1 HeRetiK#56 - Usyk wins points decision W1 D2 L0 LTU_btc#57 - Points decision draw Fury1 Usyk1 Draw1 willi9974#58 - Points decision draw Fury0 Usyk0 Draw3 bullrun2020bro=============FREE SLOTS ALLOCATED: 39FREE SLOTS AVAILABLE: 19If you would like to sponsor this thread or make a donation to increase the prize payout, please send a PM.Any tips you would like to send for creating this free lottery will be appreciated: bc1qsfdtyzx0rs3ta68xw4wrygh2w32rulf379d057UPDATED 22ND JANUARY 2023THANK YOU RATIMOVRatimov has offered to donate $25 towards the prize fund.
