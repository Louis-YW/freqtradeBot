  "content": "Let's begin with a story (more like a parable) which I think is familiar to some of us...A Man on his sick bed called two of his sons, and asked both of them, \"you both have heard that experience is the best teacher right?\" They both answered - \"yes dad\" He then asked the first son - \"you my first son, how or what is the best way to learn from experience?\" The first son, after thinking for a while answered \"learning from my mistakes, that is, never making the same mistake twice\". The father answered - \"that's very good my son, you've answered well\". Then turned to the second son, and asked him the same question.. The second son answered immediately - \"it is good to learn from my mistakes, but I think it is better to learn from other people's mistakes, so that I won't have to make mistakes myself before I learn\". The father looked at him and was short of words to empress himself, he told both of them to go, but later called the second son privately and said to him, \"I am astonished by the level of your wisdom, you can't take your elder brother's place as my first son, but I put him under your care, do all you can to keep him from taking wrong decisions\". Now, To the main discussion... Please note that I've previously touched on this topic HERE, but I decide to escalate it as a topic to better reach more gamblers who possibly could learn from the experience.. A supposed friend, he working and has been gambling for a while, recently got lucky, won consistently for 3 good days consecutively.. 1st day, he won $670+2nd day, he won $702+3rd day, he won $692+ This are the ones I know and saw the slip myself... For most of us in my area here, it was like he did a charm, I personally envied him to be sincere, but not with any evil intention , I only wished I was as lucky as him.. But the sad thing about the whole thing was that, he's attitude changes, those are big amount when converted to my country's local currency, but not big enough to warrant his Change of attitude.. He started spending anyhow, sleeping in different hotels with different women - before this, he already quit his job, he bought himself an iPhone and also bought an iPhone for one hoe that was following him up and down as a girlfriend - he left our neighborhood and moved to a better place and a bigger apartment, he become arrogant and left some of his friends in times of want behind, he did all he did probably with a mindset that the winnings will keep coming, some even spread some rumor that the guy meet a witch doctor who prepared a luck charm for him, which is what gave him the confidence of quiting his job - to me, this remains a rumor, since there is no way to verify if this is true of false. Long story short, 2 months after the whole winning spree, this guy lost everything back to casinos where he gambled on, he made gambling his day job, probably increased his bets so as to win more,  but as of today, this guy is joblessly roaming the streets, depend solely on friends to feed, as of yesterday when I overheard him discussing with some one I am also close to, he was asking to help him look for a Job, that what he planned didn't work out - what ever he planned that didn't work out, I don't know, but this is a lesson for us all to learn from.Gambling is not a business, and neither should you ever take it as a day job, in reference to this thread - it is likely impossible to make a consistent winning from gambling, there are day you win, even much more than $100, and there are days you will lose it all, to make a consistent $100 or more every day in gambling is a mirage, wishful thinking that might never happen.Feel free to chip in your contribution.",

Its rather absurd that someone in his right senses will quite his job just because he acquire a lucky winning spree and the whole stupidity of it all is that he made lavish with the money without even setting up a nice investment that can keep the money. Because he  can't expecte to win every day.",

Not everyone in the world today knows how to control money so many just let the money control them and its very bad because money amplifies someone character and its bring out the natural character of the person.",

The moment he quit his job and turned his friends away for easy women and gambling, I knew he had sealed his destiny.  Hopefully he does not resort to crime/drugs for more money, though; that would make things to escalate ever faster.You can hire all the magicians, gurus and shamans you want.

Anyway, if it's really true, this guy had the chance to change his life with so much earnings from gambling, which allowed him to live wasting and lavishing without limits at hotels with pretty women plus having access to wealthy accessories and furniture. It was just a matter of how to use the earnings.If he had been wise like the two boys from the first story things would have ended better for him and today he could tell everyone how gambling had a positive impact on his life.",

It would let you take the good decisions and be patient and it comes with a lot of benefits..Speaking about the other part of the story, of your \"supposed friend\". I'd say money can change people right? that's what happened, he's just too dumb to think that gambling could open their arms well for him. It's like a weapon with 2 sides and literally very risky and no one in the whole world can have 100% accurate predictions even if you visit thousands of witches to bring you luck. Only god knows the future not human being. I'd assume life is really tough for him right now since he quitted his job and have no income resource after the few weeks that he spent in \"fancy hotels\" with girls and so on. That makes me remember an anime I have seen before called Kaiji which is kind of similar to what this guy did.Anyway, I feel so bad for people who are addicted to gambling and I wish they'll quit this addiction one day, but at least gamble for fun, it's not a job tho, If gambling consider a job, it could be the riskiest job ever for losing your money.",

That is the point. Otherwise there would be no house.To me, and many others it's just a form of entertainment. That one simple fact should never be forgotten. I can go to the city and have a nice meal that costs a lot of money and then go to a show that also costs a lot of money. Say it comes to $500 for the night for 2 people including the train there and back. (New York) Some people will not think it's a bad way to spend money. Same way people will pay for tickets to a sporing event, or many other things.At the same time, others will look at those exact same expenditures and think the person paying 'that much for that' is nuts. But, for the people who find whatever that activity is entertaining it's no big deal.Gambling should be treated the same way. You don't go to a baseball game expecting to come out with more money then you went in with, nor do you go to a show and expect to come out with more then you went in with. Treat casinos the same way and you will be fine.-Dave",

I think we all know and understand that you can't make a cash profit stream from gambling, but how can you think rationally with gambling? That's not possible. When we start gambling we tell ourselves that we are going to win and if we lose once it is pure bad luck. Until you lose a few times in a row. In principle, there is no normal way to win money all the time, that does not exist. Or you should engage yourself in arib slow gambling, but sooner or later your account will be closed.

So In this 21st century, people are still believing this?In my presence, someone has won $10,000; that was the highest win that has happened to a gambler which I witnessed. The OP's winning is even less than what I hear about some people's winning; some people don't win at a straight, but if they manage to win, it usually becomes massive 🎉👏. So, it's not charm.I know how these kinds of stories usually end. karma is what happens to people who act irresponsibly. Although in his case he was very lucky to make those straight wins, unfortunately he did not make good financial management of the funds. Well, they say, \"When someone has spent time, energy, and passed through stress to make money, they will spend it wisely.\" So, in the OP's case, he did not struggle to make that money; rather, by just making his prediction and staking, he won. He just decided to spend it lavishly because he probably has not enjoyed money before.(what can I say 🙄).Honestly, his mistake is not what anyone must do; that's absolutely unwise behavior. No matter how easy you make your money, it doesn't call for lavish spending. If one cannot sustain money, then money cannot sustain the person. I read a book that says and I quote below. QuoteMoney is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition.The above quote is what I conclude with.",
