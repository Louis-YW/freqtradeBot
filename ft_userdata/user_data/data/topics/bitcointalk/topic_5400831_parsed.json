Is it true?  So Is It useless to follow bounties further more?It's true over 95% are complete scams, the remaining ones can barely get you tokens whose value is worth your timeI suggest you look for alternatives if you have a skill such as graphics designing, article writing... You can earn some bitcoins by participating in contests.

Is it true?There are good and scam ones but even with non-scam bounties, the value you get from your 'works' is very low. But let's consider about your 'work' with bounties. Quality is very low and mostly spam so low valuable payment is fair enough in my opinion.QuoteSo Is It useless to follow bounties further more?[/color]If you join bounties and airdrops again, you will repeat what you did in 2017 and you will waste your time again. Better you should learn and improve yourself and find better ways to earn in crypto market, from your higher valuable works. Real works.",

Only early adopter who get profit from P2E, or whencan accumulate NFTs when it dumped. P2E, Staking or farming need more money, if OP asking for free money, he need to selective to choose any bounty or airdrop. Or, if he have skill can try to open service based of his skill as far as related with crypto project.",

Thanks in advanceThe problem with you is that you didn't have patience and you chose those bounties or airdrop that did not make any sense. I joined atomic wallet bounty which I am certain was after 2017. I kept holding those tokens and they are multiplying as I write this reply. I also participated in a few airdrop in 2019 and they generated free high returns as I waited for the right time to sell them. Nothing is wrong with bounties or airdrop. You need to judge them and hold them till the right time arrive. The problem with hunters nowdays is that they have become bounty farmers. They join everything and they want to sell everything as soon as possible. If you need extra income then only join bounties and airdrop.",
