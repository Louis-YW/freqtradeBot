How do you expect to get $500 loan with collateral of BALLS which have zero value? And what if you can't repay the loan on time? Will the lender be able to sell them? I would say you rather try to sell them locally. Some people may get interested.Quote from: shasan on September 24, 2022, 07:50:19 AMWhat is right? Do you need USDT or BTC?

I assume you're asking for the loan because it took you 1 minute to write that and just in case there's someone remotely dumb enough to lend you the money, but I'm certainly not going to be the dumb one.",
