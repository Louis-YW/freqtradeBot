For legal drugs, I am not a doctor to give you any prescription, but with just the use of important keywords for your case in Google, I would like you to visit and read these articles:Anxiety MedicationStress: Symptoms and types of medicationsI thought of exploring the medications mentioned in these articles more, but since I am not an expert, I decided not to do that.

      "body": "Loosing money can be depressing especially when it is a big amount but this situation should not push you into illegal or self prescribed drug use/abuse. Please by all means talk to someone who understands and know that people have lost that kind of amount as well to gambling and were still able to bounce back. Moving forward, I think you stay away from gambling, or henceforth gamble with only amounts that you can afford to loose to avoid being in this kind of situation again.",

But I understand where you are coming from its really depressing to lose big cash in gambling but taking hard and illegal drugs aren't the solution instead you keep your mind busy with other stuff like funny videos and maybe try comedy skit or you can take a sleeping pill and have a nice and relaxing sleep over the lost.",

And if you do it often, it means you are a person who has a lot of money because buying illegal drugs is also not cheap.there's nothing wrong with using it to gamble again instead of using it for stupid things you have a double addiction, and use it to gamble in a better way and fix what caused your defeat and fix it. And better yet, you don't do it all.",

For example, a drink or two. If you smoke marijuana, smoke a joint to relax, if you have never smoked marijuana, don't do it.Hard drugs, the further away the better. Losing a lot of money and trying to cheer yourself up with oxycodone is like shooting yourself in the foot.",

It can be better for you to relax and wait for trying another day if you are winning in the past but if you are a steady loser, sorry you have more to do to get out from the state of depression. I suggest you can take sedative drink to help you relax and sleep, you will be better with days coming.",

It would stimulate your desire to gamble again to try to recover your losses and to bet unreasonably. If you really need drugs you should opt for (legal) relaxing and anxiolytic drugs like benzodiazepines IMO. When you write \"norhpine\" it's a misspell of morphine or it's another drug?",

Having a glass of wine or a run around the block a dozen times can help. I would never ever advise someone to ever turn to drugs.",
