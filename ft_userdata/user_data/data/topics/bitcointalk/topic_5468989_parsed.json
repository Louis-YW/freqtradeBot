  "content": "QuoteA 22-year-old French citizen from Epinal, France, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in U.S. District Court in Seattle, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman. Sebastien Raoult, aka Sezyo Kaizen, was arrested last year in Morocco and was extradited to the U.S. in January 2023. Raoult and two co-conspirators were indicted by a grand jury sitting in the Western District of Washington in June 2021. According to the plea agreement, Raoult and his co-conspirators hacked into protected computers of corporate entities for the theft of confidential information and customer records, including personally identifiable information and financial information. They hacked numerous companies, including companies in Washington State, elsewhere in the United States, and around the world. After Raoult and his co-conspirators hacked companies, a user going by the name ShinyHunters posted hacked data from many of those companies for sale on dark web forums, including RaidForums, EmpireMarket, and Exploit. Between April 2020 and July 2021, ShinyHunters posted sales of hacked data from more than 60 companies. Sometimes ShinyHunters threatened to leak or sell stolen sensitive files if the victim did not pay a ransom.The conspiracy to commit wire fraud is punishable by a maximum of 27 years in prison. Aggravated identity theft is punishable by a mandatory minimum two-year prison term to follow any other prison sentence imposed in the case.https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/french-cybercriminal-pleads-guilty-fraud-and-aggravated-identity-theft-hacking-privateSo in a nutshell, the groups Modus Operandi is,- they hacked on the computers of the corporation, stealing confidential information including customer records.- posted this hacked data from for sale in the dark forums, making money out of it- another way is to threatened to leak the data from the customers and demanding ransom- and worst, they used this companies computing power to crypto mineHopefully, the full hands of the law will go and punished this cyber criminals. But there could be more plea bargain though, like him pointing the other names of the group to the FBI so that they could be apprehended as well. And the bad thing is that they are going to milk the data that they got, selling it to other groups to exploit it and then used the business entities even more by installing crypto miner without the company's knowledge on what is going on until it's too late.",

And we we are one of those companies that has been breached, hard to say what is the next move as the data has been breached and leaked and as the OP said, they already make money out of it again and again. And after the breach, they can stealthy install some crypto miners malwares that will run 24x7 at the expense of the this poor companies.",

They do not violate the laws of their own country, but they do violate the laws of other countries. In Russia, they may receive a maximum of 10 years in prison, but they will spend 30% less time there for good behavior. But they are locked in Russia for the rest of their lives and will not be able to leave for other countries, because there they may be caught by Interpol.",

No, if your read the indictment, he has co-conspirators, so he has help outside to accomplished this huge data theft and subsequent milking of money from business entities and individuals accounts. So this is huge group operating in Europe and targeting businesses around the world including the United States. But you know that if a US companies is selected by any criminals, be in online or offline, the long hands of the law of the United States will reach this underground and see that justice is being made.Quote from: dansus021 on October 06, 2023, 01:07:26 AMare he going to serve in US jail?For sure, again, if he read it, he was extradited him to the United States. And most likely he is already behind bars since January 2023 and will count until his sentencing by the United States court. As for the wallets, this is a criminal group, and maybe they have dispose of the money already and split it to their group. The United States government will have to look at every possibility if they can get some money from this criminals. But since their heist is like 2-3 years ago, I doubt that this criminals have hold the money. They could have been living a lavish lifestyle after their attacks.",

So, while the investigation is ongoing, the criminal always has the opportunity to make a deal with the government and hand over his accomplices. Therefore, many criminals, after several months in prison, begin to turn in their accomplices so as not to receive a long sentence.",

And in this case, Sebastien Raoult will give all the names of his conspirators to be able to get a light sentence.",

But in some cases, these criminals just to get that lenient sentence will go the extra mile of implicating innocent people. It could also be used by some politicians and law enforcement agencies to target opposition or enemies. There have been cases where further evidence or investigation proved that some persons implicated by these criminals were innocent. So there is always a need to back these confessions with concrete evidence.  Quote from: joniboini on October 06, 2023, 01:22:27 AMQuote from: dansus021 on October 06, 2023, 01:07:26 AMare he going to serve in US jail?I think so.
