      "body": "Bitcoin's volatility is continuously lowering. It is much less volatile today than a few years ago. And a few years ago it was much less volatile than it was a few years before that. A few years from today it will be less volatile than it is now.Volatility naturally goes down as its value grows because it gets harder to move the price. And also because there are fewer dollars that will come in to change the price. If we pretend there will eventually be 10 trillion dollars that will be in Bitcoin, a 1 trillion dollars there is less outstanding money than at 1 billion dollars so less money will come in to change the price. So when most of the people in the world who want Bitcoin already have bitcoin volatility will be far lower not just because there will be so much more money in it so it'll be harder to move, but because there won't be huge pumps and dumps of people coming in and going out of the market.It will of course never be stable, as nothing with a free market is stable, but its volatility will continuously go lower and lower over time as has already happened throughout Bitcoin's price history. Even today its much easier to trade altcoins rather than Bitcoin because Bitcoin's volatility is far lower than it used to be while altcoins are tiny market caps that are essentially 100% speculation and so they maintain very high volatility.People who say Bitcoin is risky because it is volatile are either only interested in short term trading/investing or they don't understand the difference between volatility and risk and they are likely just repeating what they heard other people say who also don't understand the difference.",

      "body": "Since when is Bitcoin's volatility a turn-off? It might be for some, but I honestly don't understand those few who are put off by it, since that's what enables you to multiply your money. And that applies to pretty much everything, be it stocks, gold, or other commodities; all of them are volatile, maybe not as much as Bitcoin, but still may go through great price fluctuations during a market crisis or an unfortunate event.Personally, I find its volatility intriguing; certainly, it's not always positive, but nonetheless, it's what made Bitcoin what it is today. This isn't the first thread that mentions Bitcoin's volatility as a possible threat, which is frustrating.",

In the early years, the supply of Bitcoin was large and the demand was fluctuating so that the number of people trading in Bitcoin was counted with fingers, and therefore it is easy to find that the price rose by 50% during the day.If we reach a market capacity, for example, 10 trillion, and the supply is limited, then the demand will be shy, and therefore there will be no change in the price.The whole secret is the distribution of live retailers.",

What makes people believe in investing in Bitcoin because the price fluctuates, there are many opportunities to double profits in a certain period and even though the risk cannot be ignored, people already understand the pattern of investing in bitcoin and volatility is an inseparable part.Quote from: alastantiger on March 31, 2023, 05:23:49 PMMy query is: How will Bitcoin's volatility diminish over time, or what is the single biggest element that could result in a reduction in Bitcoin's volatility?The rise and fall of bitcoin prices is one of the events that cannot be separated in the market, this will apply as long as bitcoins can still be traded, because that is what causes bitcoin to be more valuable today.",

Its volatility makes it stand out from  every other coins which eventually die off. Bitcoin is very unique from all other altcoins and I know this as I was given a window to start investing last year when the price dropped drastically after hitting its all time high.",

And these factors are:Securities supply and demandGeopolitical variables Factors of socioeconomic statusAn options contract’s expiration dateAnd the cause of price volatilitySeasonality and WeatherSentimentsyou can read the explanation of each on this article[1]Now if we are able to control this factors and causes, we can minimize the volatility of the price of Bitcoin but the question is, can we control these factors and causes?  Obviously no.  So there is no way to remove the volatility of Bitcoin.  The fixed supply may affect volatility but it is not enough to remove volatility of Bitcoin making it act like a stablecoins. In conclusion, Bitcoin will always be volatile.[1] https://www.tickertape.in/blog/volatility/",

Once the mass adoption of Bitcoin is complete, there will be more buy and sell orders in the market and price movements will have less volatility. I think volatility is an important detail that shows us that mass adaptation is not yet complete. Once the mass adoption is complete, buyers and sellers will build up enough density and we won't see high volatility again. That's why I think we should enjoy these days. We have to make sure that we buy enough Bitcoins during periods of extreme depreciation. :)",
