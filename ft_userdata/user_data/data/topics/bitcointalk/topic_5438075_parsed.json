      "body": "Trading is the process of generating money from money, and it is an activity with potential for profit and loss, and therefore unless you have a business that pays you your bills and with a surplus that you can invest, then you will not bear to continue trading because you will not have additional money if you lose in trading.So the first tip would be to get a job that pays your bills and has enough surplus to invest and cover your losses.Second, control your emotions, stay away from greed, be patient and know that trading is a long term process.Third, withdraw your capital and leave your profits to multiply. For example, if you invested in the X currency and made profits, withdraw your capital and leave your profits in that currency for a while.Finally learn, more learning means more money.",

When it comes to trading, it requires maximum attention and focus on the market without any possible distraction, So for me before I open my laptop to start trading for the day, I ensure that anything that will cause some forms of distraction is settled.",

Crypto training is really a wild one and if we are not knowledgeable then we might need to face life's worst days.A simple tip from my side is, always have and follow strict stop-loss and target levels and place orders for these and leave your positions and start doing other things rather than simply watching market. If you keep watching then you may alter your stop-loss levels which may lead you to disasters for not sticking with your original trading plans.",

Likewise, if I am unemployed and cannot find a job, then $3 is more than enough.Other than whether trading is profitable or not, profit and loss accounts are related to other businesses, and from here trading robots appeared, which you can manage without being online or in front of a computer screen.These methods have made trading a profitable business for everyone who can understand the direction of the market and is ready for adventure and vice versa for everyone.",

Sometime you will spend whole days especially weekend and you will give very less time to family members and other social activities. There are two ways to protect yourselves from wasting of time in trading. First you should buy some coins for long time and then don't worry about marketing situation but this type is called Holding. Second fixed a time for fir trading (Two or three Hours) and then try to open and close trade in this specific time. For this kind of trading Candle reading is must and you should trade in high volatile coins.Money is not primary purpose because We earn money for life comfort, if there is no comfot then what is the use of this money?",

Not only time but also money. I thought that I don't have future in trading but I'm wrong, we have to accept that we have to experienced losses in order to succeed in trading. Sometimes, if we are focusing to our losses, we can't trade in a effective way.

We have the same goal and that is to be profitable, actually it doesn't need to be fun as long as you make money as you can consider trading as your money machine and have fun outside your trading life. Just focus on your dreams, and eventually you will realize that it's okay to sacrifice now so in the future you'll just spend the rest of your life having a vacation anywhere you wants.",

I will intentionally ask him to review my analysis not because i didn't know how to analyse at that point but i wanted to be sure what i learnt i understood them well. For a newbie it is better to stick around who ever thought them to trade and for those who are self taught they should find a peer to attack themselves to or join a community. Solo trading can be discouraging especially when the expected resulted is no showing forth.",

If a person has ability to earn and has knowledge about trading then it will not be a boring thing for him. A trader should watch YouTube videos and should engage in telegram groups so he will not feel that he is lonely.I learned trading from my family member that's why I doesn't feel lonely and never consider trading as boring thing.

I don't think with trading waste our time because could be side job with trading without make our main job disturbed. I wake up every day and working at company and time take rest I use moment for checking with current market condition and which potential coin to buy, there are not spent many time for trading and possibility after buy order filling we can sell our coins assets and open later after break from working.

No one does this for fun. People do this to earn money or sometime to earn extra money. So yes if you don’t have any good skill, and if trading is the only source of income, then yes you are bound to pass time like this. 90% of the people are not happy in the way they are earning money, they just do it in order to make money.If you are beginner then let me tell you that don’t mix trading as gambling. As in trading the profits earned are very slow and less. No one becomes rich through trading overtime. Many newbies make mistake here and without any prior knowledge they just invest in the coins and make losses. If you are beginner then it’s advised that forget about making profits, at first try to avoid getting losses.",

And many newbies may at some point think that they are probably wasting too much of their time.Trading requires your time and will have it's fair share of your time as you devote yourself more to trading. Tip for Newbie traders is that they should understand first that trading that they are about to begin requires time and real dedication. So if they know yourself to be someone who is already very occupied with some other activities or cannot dedicate time to trading, do not bother starting so your do not learn your lesson bitterly maybe after already loosing.A good trader that I know said that you will feel better loosing other people's money than your own money when you trade. But before you can become very good and confident to want to trade with other people's money, you must have dedicated time to learning and have shown results enough for other people and even institutions to trust you with money to trade for them, knowing that even if you record some losses along the way, they are still assured of some good profits.There is skipping a requirement if you must be a good trader, It requires your time, time you must be willing to give.",
