  "content": "In \"Withdrawal of BTC\", an Exchange informs that it \"supports all BTC address types\" and details: - BECH32 (started with bc1)and - SegWit (starts with numbeer 3)without mention to- Legit adresses (started by 1). So, I do not know if that site really can send BTC to a adresses started by 1. Question:Sites that can send  BTC to a addresses started by 3can also always send BTC to adresses started by 1?or there is, eventually, misinformation in such a site (Exchange))Thanks.I do not mean to say names.",

      "body": "Yes, I would imagine that the site would also support sending funds to legacy addresses. Most exchanges I know would pick the network for you once you paste the address though, so you probably won't have to do anything anyway.Besides, Not sure which exchange you're using but even assuming  (even though it's unrealistic) that the exchange doesn't support a legacy addresses, you'll just get an error. It's not like they would take your funds and never send them to your address.",

For more understanding, the address you are using started with 3 (segwit) is based on P2SH algorithm which is newer version of creating wallet address while the address starts with 1 (Legacy) is based on P2PKH algorithm that is older version. So, according to the backward compatibility of the BTC blockchain when you send funds to P2PKH based address which starts with 1, it automatically selects it while you chose segwit network.Just to clarify, Binance don't mention legacy address to withdraw funds but we can still withdraw funds on legacy address but just to be more sure in order to avoid losing funds, reach out to the support of the exchange you are referring to or try out with a small amount that you don't care to lose.",

      "body": "If it says that it supports all types of BTC addresses, then it should. Best way to know is to test it yourself read the FAQ for the similar question or ask the support system of that exchange since you are not willing to share the names of any.Would not say that it is any \"mis\"-information unless you have tried.Good luck and I hope you get your money quick and easily in your wallet.",

We have only one bitcoin network.If binance or any other exchanges say so, they are using wrong terms. We have segwit address, not segwit network.

As mentioned by OmegaStarScream above your post, in the unlikely event an exchange doesn't support withdrawal to legacy addresses, it should give you an error.",

The address format that you will find hard that they support is the new taproot address (bc1p). So they actually support it. But one thing is the transaction fee charged by them is higher than that of segwit addresses. Quote from: id5000 on November 06, 2023, 03:24:22 PM- BECH32 (started with bc1)and - SegWit (starts with numbeer 3)BECH32 (bc1q) is also a segwit address type it is called native segwit and the other one that starts with 3 is called nested segwit by some",

      "body": "Addresses that start with a 1 used to be considered the default address type so it wasn't necessary to mention if they are supported. Once Segwit became adopted those older addresses were considered legacy but I'm not aware of any exchange that doesn't support sending to them. There are still some businesses and old wallets which use legacy addresses. It would be foolish to inconvenience so many people relying on legacy address support.",
