  "content": "Hello all,I have send 45 euro to my trust wallet yesterday. I have made over 31000 euro in transactions on this wallet only. Trust support is like talking to a wall only even worse. I am trying to send an amount to another wallet. It doesn't work. I always get the same error no matter how high i set the fees. The amount i am trying to send is not smaller than the fees. I can't even send 20 euro while paying 600 sats for fees. Getting sick of this. Trying to swap btc for any other coin and that is also not possible. Nothing is available. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app on Android and still the same. Anyone else with the same issues? Can't import my wallet to electrum because it doesn't recognize the 12 seed words. The adress:",

I've been having that problem a lot lately, and the only thing I managed to do was to lower the amount when I was sending. It's probably related to the fees due to the number of transactions you might have received in the past (I'm guessing you haven't received the 31K in two or three transactions).",

If you decide to do the right thing and start using Electrum, do not use it with a seed phrase imported from TW, like i said it is closed source and we don't know how the keys were generated, you should create a new Electrum wallet with a new seed phrase.

You cannot cancel a BTC transaction once it has been signed and broadcasted, but you can \"cancel\" it through double spending if rbf is enabled, and that is what you did, you just created a new transaction with the same input to the address you want to send the funds to, usually should be done with a higher fee.Quote from: Rektforlifeanddeath on May 11, 2023, 09:43:11 AMThis is still a transaction made from electrum using the twt seed in order to empty the wallet.

Canceling a transaction means replacing an unconfirmed transaction with a new one paying more fee to your own address. Note that you can replace an unconfirmed transaction with a new one paying more fee, only if it has been flagged as RBF.",

He is doing a CPFP, but according to mempool space, his effective fee rate is 25.4 sat/vByte and not 93.3 at/vByte. Transactions in the 90 sat area are getting into the next block right now, and as you can see, OP's is still unconfirmed. The 25 sat zone is still about 14 vMB away.

It is also better to use a newly generated wallet in the future instead of the seeds that you got from the Electrum wallet.Actually i have several trust wallets (and i can send larger amounts without any problems (ridiculous fees though even for higher amounts). Getting new electrum wallets with different seeds to empty those. Nog going to import them tho but just emptying them by a transaction from trust to new electrum wallets.Â I never keep funds long on wallets anyway. For that i use a ledger. I guess trust wallet is way more efficient using bch. But honestly this whole experience with trust wallet is just sad especially when it comes to the support. I'm guessing this whole spike in mempool is because of the new shitcoins on btc? So people willing to pay extremely high fees for small transactions? Ohh and trust wallet still has issues with the swaps even on the other wallets. So they have a rating of 4.7 in the playstore and electrum a 3.7? Lol. I have used electrum a long time ago (on desktop) and it always did what it was supposed to do however the interface was like something from 1998 and i remember some problems but none of my transactions were ever stuck or whatever (yes sometimes it did take a while but not this long). I don't even know if it's possible for a btc transaction to get stuck even when you send it with like 2 sats fees it should in theory eventually arrive correct? Good people here trying to help. I thank you all. Haven't used electrum since my desktop experience back in the day but the mobile app seems really good. I can learn a lot from this forum.

It depends on the mempool, if mempool is not congested at all, it will be confirmed. But mempool is congested and fee below 40 to 50 sat/vbyte may not get confirmed by this time. But the mempool congestion has reduced than before. But expect increase in fee at anytime.",

You can't cancel a transaction once it has been confirmed, you can cancel it while it's still unconfirmed (after signing and broadcasting it).When you click on \"Cancel\", Electrum will create a new transaction which sends all the inputs of the previous one to one of your Addresses. It's the same as \"bump fees\" but in this case you replace recipient address with one of yours.",
