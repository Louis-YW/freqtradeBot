Etc.Might also want to talk with them about scams in general and how to avoid them, as Bitcoin is often used as just a tool for such things. For instance, as I type this, there's this guy messaging me on social media that I \"won\" a \"giveaway\" for a pair of sneakers but that I have to pay a shipping fee to receive them (LOL!). Of course, I will not transfer him any money, but I just want to warn you that scams are everywhere.",

      "body": "Nice work!What are good platforms for crypto that can be used by residents in your country?Would they be interested in things like sweatcoin which is an app that can be installed on smartphones to track the number of steps a person takes. Their exercise is rewarded by them receiving sweat coins. Perhaps apps like coinhuntworld which is similar to pokemon go. With you might guess the main difference being people walk and search to receive crypto rather than pokemon.It was claimed that some venezuelans sustain themselves financially through playing games like, I think it was runescape, online. Information is great. But I think real world application could be one of the main things crypto has to offer the world. Seeing is believing.",

I always say; it's very important that anyone who's tutored on crypto currencies and it means of operation should be told that it turns out badly sometimes.... (I've watched my stocks reduced intermittently and sometimes, it feels painful and frustrating though but, any new toddler in crypto would simply begin to panic and prolly, withdraw 'em funds)I believe that if anyone is told about the sweet times, they should also be told about the bitter and awful times too as that will create an awareness in their minds about how it works. I'm currently doing the same thing but, she's haven't posted proves to that anyway : I'd always try to make them understand that it's an influx many atimes but, - a huge loss many more times too.Sandra 💇",

You are a person who really cares about others by sharing your knowledge about cryptocurrency.The discussions and knowledge that you provide will certainly benefit those closest to you.I know what you are doing must be hard, but I hope you can succeed in escorting them to open up their horizons in the world of cryptocurrency.Maybe one more thing, remind them by emphasizing them not to put everything they have into crypto assets,because we know they also have to have money that can be used directly to accommodate basic needs which are likely to continue to rise.",
