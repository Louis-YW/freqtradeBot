All these incorrect uses of Bitcoin, all govern and bank extortions, all the abuses of crypto exchanges.And this limit will be reached when enough people will suffer from their greed, from their naïveté, from their stupidity. When enough of them will have criminal records and when enough of them will have to serve jail time. Only a drastic suffering will be able to open people's eyes.And, when this will happen, bitcoiners will finally stop using exchanges. They will stop holding in bank accounts their fiat incomes obtained from crypto activities. Some will even avoid using fiat money. If all these will happen, then individuals will finally start using Bitcoin the way Satoshi created it: for their own benefit, for rendering governs and banks as irrelevant, for eliminating any middle man, for anonymizing their financial deals, for being their own bankers, for owning their private keys instead of allowing exchanges having them.\"(C)How does administrative forfeiture from a non-custodial wallet work?",

They said even in the mere suspicions.

Maybe they already do that, I don't know. But it's crazy how on one hand they want to be cracking down on rich people but on the other hand we're letting people flood into the country and overwhelm our welfare system. Oh well!

I guess the history is repeating itself, only this time its digital.I guess so, but the context is really different iirc. There's no urgency in confiscating people's crypto compared to the gold crisis. While USA's debt keeps increasing, I don't think they are desperate to find ways to pay it.

My country's regulation for crypto tax is quite lax. While it is possible to change them, I doubt they'd be as aggressive as the US considering how niche the market is. Even if it becomes more mainstream, other sources of taxes are more abundant and easily accessible for the government as of now.",

CMIIW.This is a waste of time because cryptocurrencies will be tightly controlled in the US and Europe. Since in the USA each state still has local legislation, you can look for refuge in one of the states with a loyal attitude towards cryptocurrencies. And then there is Canada, which has more lenient legislation. But I advise you to look at which offshore companies Sam Bankman Fried registered his companies in and trade there with minimal taxes.",
