      "body": "This board is about trading, not about staking. You can move this thread to altcoin board, or maybe service discussion if you know you are staking or earning from exchange staking. You should know that not all earnings on exchanges are staking. Earning can be gotten from the leverage given to traders too and some other things. But the main thing is that you should earn by staking on noncustodial wallet or using a decentralized exchange if you like the coin and see the potential that the coin will rise after a significant fall or bear market. Know that altcoins are gambling, be careful and do not use more than what you can afford.Very important to know that staking on an exchange means you have no complete control and it means anything can happen to your coins if you give it out as you give it to the exchanges to do it for you. Better to use a noncustodial wallet or connect to a decentralized exchange to stake.",

      "body": "Staking is surely a way to earn some coins in profit when you finally sell off it but you have to know that the margin of profit you can get while staking your coin is very minimal if you have to trade it. Although trading is difficult and scaryÂ   A good decisive trade can give you more than 100% - 200% turn over to your initial value of coin in just a month (30days of staking) and that calculated over 120 days (3 months) but if you stake in a month you can only have less than 12%-16% and more less percentage in staking profit for 60 days or 120 days because in staking the higher the durational time of keeping your coins in hodl on the exchange, the lower your profit or earning staking bonus vice versa. This is what you need to consider in staking. Another thing is the staking earning percentage is not at random for every coin. Example, the percentage you will have for staking differs in different exchanges and also depending on the coins usability and demand. In binance for example, I have noticed the available time for staking differs in different coins, Shiba has longer time for staking up to 120 days with higher percentage in earning but ctsi is more shortened with lower earning percentage.",

I'm not going to stop you but I like to help you out from thinking that this is a good solution to earn more without doing anything because the reality is that, it is just only a penny. Trading is way better but I don't ask you to do that if you are not knowledgeable about this otherwise, you are just throwing your money into the other hands. For any of these strategies and ways of earning, you must have to choose reputable exchanges, most especially if you are staking.",

Sticking to native solution is always better, or at most a non-custodial one. Several cexes also offer staking services today, however don't trust them with large amount of funds. Suppose, you have 5 BTC then don't get lured by staking interest from CEX as you are taking significantly more risk putting your funds than whatever rewards you may earn there.

Is it lending your balance to platform and wait for certain return on set timeline?Or just let it been hold on your wallet? If you talk about first well that's real staking and aside waiting for returns you can earn if market pump. But the risk to lose money is there especially if the platform you use to stake your crypto is a scam site for sure with that you lose everything you hold.But for holding it on your wallet well the risk is low since the only thing you need to watch is the volatility of the market. Your patience is needed in this option because if you didn't have that you might lose your money on bad market movement.",

      "body": "So, you're asking about staking and how it can be a good way to earn income, even when the price falls. In my opinion, staking is a great way to earn passive income while still holding onto your assets.Important thing is you just need to make sure you're staking with a reputable platform that has a good track record. I think the new feature on exchanges where you can earn interest on your assets is a great development. It's a low-risk way to earn some extra income, especially since some platforms have little to no lock-up periods. And with no liquidation risk, you can sleep soundly knowing your assets are secure.Instead of trading, staking may be a more newbie-friendly method of earning income. Of course, if you know what you're doing, trading can also be a good way to earn money. But staking is definitely a great option for those who want to take a more hands-off approach.",

Like for example ETH staking could be done in a place where you won't be hacked, or you could just go to Binance which I highly doubt will get hacked and then you can stake there as well. Only places that you could get hacked or the places can get hacked is defi places, and in those places it might happen but I still think that it depends on the level of it.Like I doubt staking at pancakeswap would equal to losing all your money, it may happen, or maybe it won't happen, or uniswap with the same logic as well. So do your best to protect your money as well as you can, but also check some other places that may end up being something proper, it will allow you to make a good return without a doubt.",

Staking allows users to participate in the network's consensus mechanism and earn rewards for validating transactions. Even in times of market volatility or price decline, stakers can continue earning rewards by adding more coins to their staking pool.Additionally, the new EARN feature on exchanges provides an even easier way for users to earn income through staking without the need to set up a separate staking wallet or deal with network requirements. This makes staking more accessible to newcomers and helps diversify investment portfolios.Staking also offers advantages over other methods of passive income, such as mining, which requires expensive equipment and consumes significant energy costs. Unlike mining, staking requires minimal equipment and energy consumption, making it a more environmentally friendly option.",

This reads like a one of these paid promo articles for Coinbase or some other shitty exchange. Show me the numbers then if you think staking is really worth it. IMO the risk outweighs the potential profit. I wouldn't recommend staking to anyone, especially staking through an exchange. This means you have to hold money on exchange for long periods of time, risking it all to get 0.5% each month. To stake ETH you need 32 coins locked in staking. If you do that via an exchange that's 60k USD locked there, being risked every day. Imagine if you had all those money on one of the bankrupt exchanges before the collapse like on FTX. Suddenly earning a few bucks a month wouldn't look so appealing.",
