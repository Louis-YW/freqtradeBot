It's not a free service though. Their fee is 20% of whatever amount they recover.If you want to try to recover the password yourself, read about BTCRecover.You can find out more about how to use it here: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/",

I've no idea to use Hashtopolis, you might want to ask help on https://hashtopolis.org/ instead.

That or just wipe the server and start again. Back to the original issue, IF you are 100% sure it's not some AV grabbing the file and removing it since it never makes it out of the temp folder I would look at the server closing the connection before it's finished and the desktop just removing what it thinks is an incomplete file.Also could your front end router for the PC be doing any kind of filtering? More and more home routers are coming with some for of AV so it could be killing the download too.-Dave",

Additionally, he can always open Virus & Threat Protection in the settings and click on Protection History. There he will see all the logs that Windows Defender made, including quarantined files.
