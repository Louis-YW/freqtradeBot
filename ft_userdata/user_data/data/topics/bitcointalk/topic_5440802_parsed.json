Therefore, to continue to have additional accumulation we need some additional benefits such as short-term trading and investment in projects trend based. Whether it's AI-based cryptocurrencies even filtering them is a good choice. Because not a few will become a nest of scammers to take advantage of the hype.",

Definitely the pros of factors affecting the demand. There are many factors which could positively influence a demand but unfortunately, factors as well to pull it down. Simple events, as long as it could affect investor's interest towards this industry, would surely trigger market changes either long run or short price movements. Right now, news regarding adoption and such are the ones we can rely for sudden market price increase aside from the anticipated halving next year. Investing right now, given that there are events that could yield to a positive market behavior, could be an advantage. But since the market itself is full of uncertainties, managing the risks of doing so would be always better.",

We all expected that PoS change by ETH would be the start of the new bull run, and it didn't impacted the price at all, it didn't change anything, what happened in January that started a big run that was much better than ETH going into staking mode? Nothing, and yet it went up anyway.This is a proof that you can make something major and not make it go up, or you can make nothing and it could still go up, it all depends on what the market wants and if it wants it higher, then it will be higher.",

Since Ethereum teams are working seriously to ensure what their investors experience last year will not repeat itself again, because they need more investors that will help them to spread the good news that is about to happen in the market. I don't think, Ethereum price will decrease more than the current price before it will hit higher in the market to allow investors to smile again.",

The items that he listed were mostly about ETH so those could greatly improved ETH but BTC isn't jealous about it because it also have its own update and that is none other than the halving. When ETH move from POW to POS I think many people dislike this change so many of them actually sold their ETH and transferred to another coin.It could be Bitcoin because Bitcoin is still POW and will remain to be this way. We already saw the impact of ETH update on ETH last time but there are still other reasons for coin to recover in the future. Between the BNB and Matic, I think I will go for BNB since things aren't really doing well for Matic.",
