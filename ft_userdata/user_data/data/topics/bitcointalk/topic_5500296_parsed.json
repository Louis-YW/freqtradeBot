What happened to the victim do happen to people that cannot keep their crypto investment a secret, rather they move around bragging and telling anyone that they are talking about cryptocurrency, how much they ha win crypto.It should be someone that he has told or heard him saying it that must have attacked him and forced him to transfer his ether to their wallet. This is why we need to keep our cryptocurrency investment secret because you don't know will use that as an advantage to attack you. The first way of securing your crypto since you are your own bank is never to tell anyone that you have crypto, before the wallet security itself.It is the same thing that will happen to anyone that keeps a food amount of fiat in his house and is bragging about it, robbers will visit you and take it from you with guns, machetes.",

Gold, cash, stock, cash in banks or anything that have a value.Exactly, $5 wrench attack is nothing new.The problem here is the transparency and possibility of correlating certain address with online identity, you need your OpSec to be very good and you could still fall for this attack because when you trade crypto, people at exchange can leak the data or it can be hacked - same with banks receiving money from crypto exchanges and people working in bank, same with paying taxes and people working in tax office.The additional danger or rather incentive for the thieves here is the easy of washing this money if it's already in crypto.",

That’s the key to the survival. Look what happened to Roger Ver, McAffee and many others. Even if you don’t get robbed by the street scum, the state will look for anything to put you behind the bars and they will find that something unless you know the law obsessively. They’ll go after you first because they know your name. They know you are rich.The thieves follow the exact same pattern. They know your name, they know you are driving a lambo, boom then you are a nice target. That’s the life you will be living from that moment. A nice walking corpse with a target attached to your back.Sooner or later, you will mess it up. Unless… you planned how not to mess it up since the beginning.",

Or even lets say that on those people whom you do know and shared up that you do possess tons of coins or crypto will really be someday having that kind of bad intent on you.This is one of the main reasons on why i do keep it secret and i do ignore that i do deal up with crypto because of this kind of potential risks which it wouldreally be putting you up on great danger. Its not really that hard on doing such thing unless if you are that tactful and boastful. lol.",

It is, being your own bank and having a LOUD mouth that definitely has its downsides. As a holder of any crypto, your life is way easier when you are anonymous online. If you want to talk about bitcoin or crypto then use a moniker that no one can identify you by. Don't share any person information online, like pictures, house street and stuff like that. The dude is lucky to have gotten away without any injury, some others were. They were either kidnapped, maimed, and worse killed. I already have a thread on this and would add this story to the list.  It is the Physical Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Attacks that Have Been Reported Worldwide from around 2014 to 2024. Take a look at the thread and you will be amazed as to how these attacks have increased each year, at least these are the ones that are public and reported.",

It is, being your own bank and having a LOUD mouth that definitely has its downsides. This victim might not have told many people that he owns cryptocurrencies. Maybe he told just a few close friends or family members. There are some situations in which you will have to tell some close relatives that you own crypto like when they ask for investment advice. People you trust can arrange this robbery because they are aware of your hodling. There are several news of spouses, siblings, close friends, etc organizing criminal attacks on individuals. Nevertheless, it is important to keep your worth secret. There was a report of an attack on a crypto user because he flaunted his wallet balance on social media. Some of these people do these crazy things to gain followers or to convince people to heed their advice. However, they fail to grasp the security risk involved in such publicity.",

The choice of specific ones is optional and individual.Quote from: MeGold666 on June 18, 2024, 02:45:55 PMIt is always easier to prevent than to fix a problem. If this guy was deliberately approached to take away cryptocurrencies, it means he himself made a mistake and attracted the attention of the attackers. Therefore, the best way to avoid a “$5 wrench attack” is not to advertise your crypto assets.And of course, diversification. Why was it necessary to store 1000 ETH in one wallet?",
