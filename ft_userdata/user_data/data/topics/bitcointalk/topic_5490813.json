  "content": "Hi everyone,I recently started using a steelwallet for securing my Bitcoin seed phrase, appreciating its durability and protection against physical damage. However, a concern crossed my mind that I'd like to discuss with the community. Is there a chance that my precious seed phrase might get a bit too much unwanted attention?I'm not overly paranoid or anything, but the thought of my seed phrase playing peekaboo with security personnel during a manual check doesn't sit right with me. Do those X-ray machines get nosy enough to pry into my steelwallet's secrets, or am I just overthinking this?Has anyone here had to travel with their steelwallet? How did you play it cool? I'm all ears for tips, especially if there are any ninja moves for keeping the seed phrase under wraps in such situations.Are there specific types of steelwallets designed to mitigate this risk, perhaps by obscuring the seed phrase in a way that's not immediately visible?Cheers for any thoughts or shared wisdom on this!",

X-rays don't affect them I think, if you're worried that they might see through the inscriptions, you're safe because the only way that they'll see that seed phrase is if they use an amount of radiation on their X-ray that's enough to lethally dose you with radiation including the people around the machine. If you're really worried, you can probably ditch it for a much convenient to you like a piece of paper, that way you can wear that piece of paper somewhere within your person and not worry about X-rays since you're going through a metal detector.",

But If you're worried about your seed phrase being compromised during airport checks, then you should use a cryptosteel capsule or other similar products that can allow you disassemble the words during transit and re-assemble it on arrival.A video of Cryptosteel unboxing, assembling and disassembling.",

It is better not to take it with you and keep it at home or another safe place.However, if you are afraid that the x-rays will be able to read the modified seed phrase on the metal, you can place the steel wallet inside a metal cover so that the x-rays will not be able to penetrate it and read the engraved inscriptions.

But they are not designed to decipher inscriptions engraved on metal plates. Therefore, there is no danger that someone will steal your coins that way.However, while X-ray scanners might not be the biggest concern, carrying your seed phrase in your luggage remains a risky strategy.  Airport security can rifle through checked bags, potentially exposing your sensitive wallet information to prying eyes or surveillance cameras.  And with airlines' unreliable luggage tracking systems, lost bags or misdelivered suitcases could hand your precious seed phrase over to a complete stranger.  There are simply too many potential vulnerabilities to consider and  when securing your crypto assets, limiting access points by keeping your seed phrase far from airports and transit hubs proves the safest bet.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on March 29, 2024, 07:58:09 PMStill, I don't think it should be a problem even if it is carried about, because I know seed phrases could just be plain words that may not mean anything to someone who knows nothing about it, only if of course one makes it obvious.

All they'll see is a metal object, round or flat, depending on what type of a seed storage device you have. The problem is that they might think a steel container is some kind of a weapon. Something like this in your bag looks a bit like a small explosive device (IED), but they won't take it from you (most likely) just ask you to show it and unscrew the cover. They won't see each individual seed, but if you're scared about exposing yourself as a bitcoiner, better travel with a paper wallet.",

I do agree with just storing it somewhere though but in the absolute case that it's not an option, would my solution be applicable. And now that I think about it, isn't aluminum foil a good way to cover your belongings so they won't show in the x-ray? I think I've heard it somewhere that it can block it out somehow.",
