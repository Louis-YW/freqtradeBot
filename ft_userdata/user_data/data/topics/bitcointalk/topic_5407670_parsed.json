  "content": "If you feel like you are turning into \"zombies\"(demonic possession), simply stop feeding from the world(their words suck life out of you), and start feeding from Holy information/knowledge which gives you life. This information can be found in the Word of GOD (Holy Bible) or you could spend some time reading or feeding from my posts especially the religious ones. Read the posts in series, from Old to New (advisable 2020 to date) through my \"Show the last topics started by this person\" here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;threads;u=946901;sa=showPosts. You will notice how gradually you transform into a human as long as you read and believe them...They are inspired by our CREATOR. Few symptoms of zombie transformation:*Memory loss *Narrow-mindedness*Confusion*Anger *Uncontrollable urge to suck life out of people with hurtful/evil words or deeds*Hatred Etc Sign you are recovering:*Sound mind *You start remembering past life and people/things you've forgetten as if you are recovering from madness. *Understanding *You start becoming loving and wise Etc",

I do believe that a zombie outbreak is possible. I mean look what happened with COVID. Who knows what is being made in labs across the world. It’s possible something could get out & that really would be an actual pandemic to worry about.",

Consider the fact that human body is just a house/vessel for his spirit(the real human) to live in and operate on earth, which evil spirit also use as home to live & operate in when the real owner of the house/vessel is asleep or dead. Evil spirits are controlled by satan who uses them to operate/move the human bodies like zombies. It's important to note that Zombie & Vampire are similar. Both need blood to survive... And according to the Word of GOD \"There is Life in the Blood\"The infected humans would either drink actual blood to feel alive or suck life out of people through their words/deeds.  There is a reason why a lot of people feel better when other humans are hurt by their hurtful Words.",

Way back in the beginning of the Bible, Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit. Then they realized they were naked, and sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves. They hid from the Lord as He walked in the Garden in the cool of the day.Personally, I think that Adam and Eve change physically as well as spiritually. After all, a husband and wife are almost required to be naked in front of each other, just so they can help the other through friendly, bodily examination. So, what's with A & E? They changed physically.As their offspring, we're all zombies through them.",
