I see a lot of people talking about RTP and they don't know what it really means, they have the wrong concept.",

However, losing and losing money is of course what they get, while the wins belong to the dealer or the casino owner himself.So understanding and strategy in gambling is very important to have. Even though having an understanding or strategy does not guarantee a win, at least it can minimize the possibility of losing in gambling.",

Some people won big time to both land-based and online gambling casinos which I think made an image that winning is with ease  Some are even relying on their fate; selling their houses just to be able to play which is simply addiction. In terms of people wondering why they keep on losing, we do have choices;, to continue playing, to stop, or to play on different games in order to seek for thqt \"sweetspot\". Also, luck indeed plays a huge role in this industry but chances of losing could still be lessen to some gambling games such as those which requires analogy wherein a player could do some research or background checking such as with sportsbetting. What I am trying to point out is, whether it is gambling concepts which are not understood or just gamblers' habits, winning won't be certain so players should adjust for themselves with limitations to avoid making unfortunate outcomes, worse. More of a preventive approach.",

I consider gambling to be something that should be done only to have fun and spend some good time with friends and family at a tourist location but not as a compulsion to get away over your worldly problems. Because most gamblers are impulsive to go for quick money which are EV- games, they will keep trickling down your money by gradual amounts unless you find yourself in the negative and then you will become desperate to win back your losses - another mistake. EV+ games are somewhat better in terms of trying to work out a prediction but again the luck factor comes in every now and then.",

I am not sure if the category of people who are struggling with the mathematics behind gambling is really 25%, I would expect it to be lower than that. But you are definitely true that some people have problems understanding the statistics behind it. Among my friends I know this phenomena well, a good friend of mine has only one strategy when it comes to Roulette. He observes the last 10 rolls and only bets when there is at least 5-6 times red or black in a row. Even though I am telling him every time that there are no trends in gambling, and that each new round is completely independent he doesn't believe me. For him it's clear that after 6 times in a row black it has to come red now. It's hard to change the ways of people and we shouldn't judge them too hard for it. If you think back in high school there where always students who hated maths and had problems understanding it.",

Martingale, for example, is arithmetically proven to be an absurd strategy. Do we use it, though? I'd say yes. Many of those who are aware of why this system is ridiculous still use it every now and then. And it's not even because we are emotionally carried away. It is simply because we submit to the fun and absurdity of gambling. Many of us here know that gambling is money, albeit not for us but for the casino. But are we stopping? No, we're enjoying.",

Gambling is still and will always be an intended form of entertainment, and if people can enjoy it with/without including the necessity to study all the math-ish stuff, then it's perfectly fine. Besides, understanding it is just that, understanding it. It doesn't convert the original chances of 50/50 to 80/20 all of a sudden. Some may just, you know, enjoy it as a game and not as anything more complicated. This is regardless of the fact that they complain about losses or whatnot. I mean, a person can have a 13-lose streak even with 50/50 odds and they'd definitely complain regardless of how it was still a completely possible scenario.",
