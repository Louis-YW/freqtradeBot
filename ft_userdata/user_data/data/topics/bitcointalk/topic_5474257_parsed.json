      "body": "You’re getting the dust error because the amount in total is smaller when compared to the transaction fee. With the $6 worth of bitcoin you’re about to send which I think is the total combine amount from all UTXOs on that wallet and with a fee rate estimated to around 250 sats/vB (13.01) by mempool.space you can’t spend from that wallet. One of the reason is because Trustwallet doesn’t customize fees so if you try to broadcast that transaction you will be charged to spend $13 on fees which is way higher than the total amount in that wallet. So there is nothing that can be done about except you deposit a significant amount to that wallet so you can spend from there or the transaction fee reduces to like $2",

      "body": "You want to transfer only $6 BTC but you have to pay more than the amount you want to transfer as transfer fee. The transfer fee is now extra so you don't need to transfer this small amount of BTC right now. If you want to receive six dollars in your account then you need to have 20 dollars of BTC in your account. When you have $20 worth of BTC in your wallet, you can transfer BTC and receive $6. I don't think there is any need to pay $12 transaction fee to transfer $6. It would be a good advice for you to first wait for the normal transaction fees and transfer your BTCs when the transaction fees are normal.",

But there is a way around it, @Charles-Tim made this post in our local board and it has helped me complete some transactions cheaper and faster. He recommended using ViaBTC to make the transaction confirmaton faster. You must know that Trust wallet is can misbehave sometimes and will never allow you to withdraw that money. What you will do is to follow these steps:1. download Electrum wallet, then import your wallet using the seed phrase.2.  Initiate the transaction by selecting mempool then set the fee to at least 10sats/byte then send it. 3. Copy the TX and paste it in https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/The transaction will be accelerated and confirmed faster. I have tested this and spend approximately $2. You can spend less but ensure you put the fee between 10 to 20sats/byte. Goodluck.",

Another one again is the type of wallet used, some wallets have an in built rebroadcast. As such they regularly rebroadcast that transaction which will make it stay there for almost when it get confirmed. As for the fees if it is dropped, I think the fees will also be return with it because only the node that include your transaction in his mined block can actually collect that transaction fee and since it wasn’t mined no node can collect that transaction fee",

It's true that nodes may receive transactions at different times, but the time that an unconfirmed transaction is kept in the mempool varies from node to node, because nodes can have different setting. It's possible that two nodes receive a transaction at the same time, one of them keeps it for 2 weeks and the other one keeps it for 1 month.",

He has $6 dollar in Trust wallet and is unable to send it out because of UTXO error. My suggestion was for him to use Electrum wallet and set the fee to 10sats/byte, this will enable him to send the transaction which will not be possible in Trust Wallet. After sending, he can use ViaBTC to facilitate the confirmation. I don't know if you read anything different from this from my comment.",
