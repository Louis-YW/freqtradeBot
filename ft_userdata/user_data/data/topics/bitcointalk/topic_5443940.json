Also even if the adoption has been so much, the adoption will still continue. You created this in the trading discussion, but you should know that trading can make things to go ugly for you. If you eventually go into crypto trading, you have to always keep in my that you should start with the amount of money that you can afford to lose. It would even be better if you use less than the amount you can afford to lose until you make profit from it for months. But my dvise is that you should just not trade but learn more about investment.To start, learn about bitcoin, learn about bitcoin halving and how it is having effect on crypto prices. To not make things complicated for you, you can start with reading bitcoin for beginners, like this ones:https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/ampFor news, you can check Cointelegraph or Coindesk for it. There are many other news sites. You can browser about it.For price app, you can go for Coingecko which is better, or go for Coinmarketcap, but I will not recommend the later because Binance owned it. I will not recommend what is more centralized that Binance can manipulate for the progress of their exchange, Binance.You should try and check the price of coins after bitcoin halves, first and second year after of bullish trend, which will follow third year of bearish trend, and fourth year of bullish and bearish trend. Invest in bitcoin. But altcoins are more volatile and if they have fallen so much, you can gamble with good ones among them, going for the ones with high marketcap. But know that altcoins are not decentralized like bitcoin and their can be more manipulations.",

The answer really depends on what your expectations are for investing in cryptocurrency. If you are expecting to make a quick fortune overnight, then it may be too late to start. However, if you are looking for a long-term investment opportunity, then there may still be potential for growth in the Bitcoin market. But, like any other investment, it comes with risks and should be approached with caution.Quote from: GlobalMilk99 on March 07, 2023, 11:06:03 PMAnd if not, what would be the essentials to learn on working on it?It is always a good idea to do your research, understand the technology and underlying fundamentals.

Bitcoin is the only thing that can challenge the fiat currencies and it should increase in value the more people who use it the more it will be worth. I think you should try dollar cost averaging out. Search online [1] for a explanation and it should give you a tutorial on how to do it. If you do dca instead of investing a big amount you should be safer when Bitcoin goes down which it does often. It is easy to think that Bitcoin will fail when the price goes down but if you have faith and wait until it starts recovering again you should see good profits. 1: https://www.fidelity.com/insights/investing-ideas/dollar-cost-averaging-plan",

I advice that you cultivate the habit of reading and finding out things for yourself so you do not get misguided into making a wrong investment that you will regret. As you invest, you should also think and consider the security of your investment which should be taken seriously because loss of access to wallet and theft of investment by hackers is very possible.",

There are two types of Crypto Currency. Bitcoin and Shitcoins. If you want to invest in shitcoins, do your research before you invest. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, It's not late yet. Don't invest all in at once. Bitcoin is not for short-term investors. It's volatile. You will get some smart profit in long term, but you have to hold tight. As I said, don't invest all in at once. Follow DCA (Dollar cost average) method. If the Bitcoin price goes up, buy less, if it goes down, buy more. Keep doing it as long as you want. Never sell at a loss.",
