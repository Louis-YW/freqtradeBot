      "body": "You do realize that the Russians have what we call 'petrol' wherein a lot of industries are highly reliant to. And those eggs, milk, and other basic necessities you mentioned are produced thanks to the help of huge machines that are run by, you guess it, petrol. I understand that day by day, talks about Putin and his war on Ukraine is becoming increasingly irritating. But the mere fact that this country sits on a huge pile of oil is a matter that a lot of us can't really ignore for long. Quote from: Hydrogen on August 01, 2022, 04:55:28 PMEuropeans could swap out gas heaters for electric ones. Energy consumption on the electrical grid would rise. And the infrastructure base could be upgraded to support the greater load. Europe's issue could be that it lacks commodities and raw materials. It has no big production or manufacturing sectors. All of which contribute to make it dependent on outside regions to provide these imports.Well, Europe sans Russia is not an entirely resource-rich area. There may be some countries that have oil deposits somewhere but it dwarfs when compared to Russia. There are huge coal mines in Germany but those are no longer efficient, or no longer viable as a source of energy given how detrimental its effects are in the environment.You are right about Europe being highly-dependent on other countries for imports. Had it not been the case, I think Europe has the power to export a lot of stuff just like China. Then again, you have an economy that is built upon imports and that is doomed to fail.",

Do you know why? Because Russia, in addition to possessing an energy weapon, also possesses a green weapon (wheat and grain), after imposing its control over Ukraine.The world has become very interconnected thanks to energy. As global demand increases, economies become more interconnected.",

Russia may also have something that they need because they cannot grow it there so they need something in exchange for their goods which is gas. Right now, the most trade will be done in currencies (money). What do they do is get the money and just buy it themselves. Now, once the supply was cut off there will be a big problem. Like mechanisms that will not work because of lack of supply. Sure, there are other options but it's not like they can adjust to it that fast. Deals will be made and since the rarity increase, other countries who supplies gas can now increase the price because of its high value. Food prices will be affected because of transportation and equipment that are running with gas.",
