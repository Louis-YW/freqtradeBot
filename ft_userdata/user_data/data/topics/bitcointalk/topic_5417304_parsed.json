I think you don't know how the market works.Demand and supply dictate the price, not the merge or token swap bullshit. People bought ETH right before the merge because the wanted to get that airdrop of ETHW. Obviously after the snapshot or merge they started selling, thus the price tanking, but It hasn't tanked that much. I wonder what you would have to say if ETH price went below $500",

It should have fixed its problems but set aside that its problems are not its price and both are different things. As it tanks right now, you can see that we're in a bear market and that confirms the slow motion of Ethereum on its price increase. That validates the idea that during the bear market.Whether there's a very good news for the top projects, that won't do because it's the bear that's dominating at this time.",

Some problem already fixed, but it’s not the reason why the price continues to drop, have you seen the wholeMarket? ETH is still dependent with Bitcoin which currently dealing with the bear market and altcoins are not safe from this as well. The update was good, it can help ETH to become more efficient in the future so if you are holding ETH right now, better to accumulate more and hold until bull market, new ATH will surely be hit on the next bull run.",

It's just that many people are cashing out their investments and using them to live because of the increase in prices of goods and necessities. More problems are going around, and those problems solved in the network haven't been in full effect regarding the application.

I think it's normal that the price of Ethereum is still in a low position because market conditions are also in the same position. You should not be confused by this problem because if market conditions can reverse this year or next year, there is a possibility that the price of Ethereum will reverse direction too. Moreover, Ethereum is currently still leading in the second position in CMC and Coingecko so Ethereum still has the potential to increase further in the future.This Ethereum merger is also not the end of Ethereum's journey and that's why the team is still doing a great job ensuring everything goes as planned. So it's better to wait patiently and make sure you buy Ethereum at a low price.",

This is the bear season and even a piece of news like the Ethereum network marge couldn't have made a serious impact after it happened because the crypto community already knew this was coming and if there was going to be a price action upward I believe it would have been before the actual date but because investors were also thinking if it was going to be a positive thing or not, there was hesitation in investment, however, I think the effect might be a boost for ETH if investors see how the network performs going forward.",

With such big and important events, we should not be too Fomo but be more cautious because there will definitely be sharks involved. I don't believe it's because we're in a bear market where ethereum can't rise, but because the sharks are trying to manipulate the crowd. Like XRP although there is no final result on the lawsuit with SEC but XRP price has increased more than 60% and people started buying because Fomo thinks XRP will increase even more, the scenario is very similar to the previous ETH, surely XRP will be dumped like ETH after the final outcome of the lawsuit.",

It was easy to see why ETH became like that once they lost their biggest rally point for years of traders and holders spectacular around The Merge. You haven't seen how much ETH drove the price of the GPU market to the point even a subpar, outdated video card sold like 2x to 3x of its MSPR years ago. Only when you see that, you'll realize how much overhype ETH has gone. Once the PoW ended, no more spectacular around GPU or hash power, completely depending on people's beliefs and demand ETH. In a time of the world's economy slowly falling into a recession? Yup, ETH has no chance.",

The fact is that it was the problems associated with the commission and the increase in bandwidth that the Ethereum merger did not solve. The Ethereum merger is currently only the first step on the path of new updates that will solve existing problems in the network. This is one of the reasons that the value of ETH is declining and plus we are now in a bear market, when the price of not only ETH, but also other coins is declining.",

The main factor that causes Ethereum to continue to decline in price in my opinion is because we are currently in a bear market condition, so it is very natural for the coin price to continue to fall even though the merger has been completed and so far if we see that the merger event has not had a positive impact on the movement ETH coin price. Apart from the bear market there may also be several other factors that led to the decline after the merger and may also be caused by investors selling in bulk.",

No, the merge was not supposed to fix Ethereum's problems and that misunderstanding is exactly why the price is tanking. The merge just means that Ethereum went from POW to POS. It did not increase TPS or increase decentralization or security. It did not enable sharding. Heck, they didn't even enable people to withdraw their staked Ethereum. Right now, it looks like the best way to scale Ethereum is by wrapping it and pegging it like WBTC on Ethereum on another chain like Flare Network or by doing what the Internet Computer is doing, allowing ICP contracts to interact directly with Ethereum without bridges.",
