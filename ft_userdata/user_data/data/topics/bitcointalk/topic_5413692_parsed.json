Okay so I have seen posts that because of the merge, ETH will become even more deflationary as it transitions from PoW to PoS. This is going to be a very interesting crypto to watch for the upcoming few weeks to months after the successful merge.It's just sad that my almost 2 ETH is gone thanks to those hackers way back April 2022. However, my sister still holds a little bit of ETH so she would really benefit in the long term if continuing to hold.",

      "body": "today after the merger was announced by vitalik, the price of ETH is going down and there are other things that I hope to go down is the transaction fee of gwei gas which should be cheaper and can be like BNB which focuses on 5 gwei per transaction, ETH is still very high in fees so that may be disappointing me, I can only hope that ETH transaction fees can be much cheaper in the future from this merger, everyone is still careful now to buy it because it could be dumped after the previous ETH price touched $1700 but if investing for the long term take now is the price right",

There is. Cause I saw an announcement made by FTX that they are gonna support the trading of ethw/usd and currently been trading now. I saw it a while ago after the eth merge and the value is at 24$ per coin but dont know now. Ethereum 2.0 is probably adjusting cause there are none dapp yet and probably some bugs were gonna see on the network like the 1st nft mitned for 36eth gas what an insane fee which probably an error or dont know.",

      "body": "I think there many things that are happening in the background. Like miners might be holding on their ETH to check whether the prices are going up or down! They might be waiting for the soft point to sell off. May be this will be triggering point for the heavy dump of the ETH. That could be one of the reason for slow selling of ETH and in addition to this we have not considered investors to miners ratio and I presume investors are more in number than miners thus it gives more odds of “hodling” eth rather than selling it. This could be balancing out the whole scenario.",

The fork coin is a way for miners to keep getting more and more money through dumping their scam coin to the stupid people who are still buying it for now. Ethereum miners are scammers.

Just wait for a day a two and let the exchanges/whales do their drama to exploit the situation. Once this is over, i can see new all time highs for Ethereum.",

Transaction speed is now ok but fee is biggest issue for Ethereum for some years I don't see a massive selling happening right now but I think miner GPU's will be over flowing in the market in the next few weeks once miners realize that mining is not much profitable. Don't get me wrong, There are still minable tokens but those aren't profitable as much as ETH so maybe other miners are trying to keep their GPU for as long as they can. Though I've seen used mining GPU selling in the market right now at a low cost and I think it can go lower once miners released their GPU's.",

The update is great but the whole market is down, so we can’t expect ETH to rise that much because of this merge. Probably, it will take some time because we finally feel the effect of that merge. Bitcoin is still the leader here, if the price goes down the whole market will follow, and with this bear market even altcoins are not exempted. ETH will still grow though, but maybe not for now.",

Therefore i am pretty surprised that the price of ETH went down more than 100$ today. The old saying buy the rumor sell the news is also not correct here because the news that the merge would happen this september already made the price pump to almost 2000$ per ETH. a few weeks back. So i don't really understand why ETH is dumping now, when everything worked so smoothly. I think we should not underestimate the number of unhappy miners that may be selling off their ETH now after the merge. Who knows.",
