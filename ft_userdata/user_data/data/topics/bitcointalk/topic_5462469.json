      "body": "The transaction pays quite a low fee; 3.988Sat/vByte. Currently, transactions that pays a fee of below 4.2satoshi/vbytes are purged. Hence, your transaction has a fairly bad propagation and thus some of the nodes on the network might not be able to see your transaction. You can try rebroadcasting the transaction once the minimum relay fee drops.Blockchain.com is the only one that is seeing it as it didn't get propagated well in the network.",

I tried blockchair but they did not find any transactions with this tx. If the address is correct, there is nothing to worry about. Either you will receive it once the fee decrease or it will be returned to the wallet after 14 days maybe?",

It would be better to import your blockchain.com wallet seed phrase into Electrum and see or if (or wait) until you are able to pump the fee. If purging is around 4.41 sat/vbyte, that is the reason some mempool dropped the transaction already and you should be able to rebroadcast it.Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on August 08, 2023, 07:41:56 AMEither you will receive it once the fee decrease or it will be returned to the wallet after 14 days maybe? Also for the transactions that nodes are not accepting the fee, if you have made transaction using such low fee or lower than the fee, likely the transaction would have also dropped from mempool and the sender would be able to rebroadcast the transaction again. Some nodes may set this differently, that is why it would be good for the OP to import the seed phrase to Electrum, if not able to rebroadcast the transaction on blockchain.com which is not a recommendable wallet.",

This is why using wallet software with features that can be utilized when needed is essential. Luckily my transaction did not drop, and it went through after a day. I was using Bitcoin Core 23.0.0, which I barely use as a wallet. I was trying to run it 24/7 to help the network, but it's almost impossible for me due to the power outage here. RBF was enabled on my Bitcoin Core, but I had nothing in my wallet to increase the fee then. I do not understand the interface as well. Since it went through, I didn't top up that wallet anymore and moved to Electrum permanently.",

      "body": "Quote from: BitMaxz on August 08, 2023, 09:29:35 AMIf the transaction is still unconfirmed I suggest import the backup seed from the blockchain wallet to Electum and bump the fee but I think it was already rejected from other nodes mentioned above it only shows on the blockchain but not on the other explorer.This will not work because the transaction when it was created was created by blockchain.com and that means the RBF flag will not work.Quote from: nc50lc on August 08, 2023, 08:02:09 AMFor now, you can't broadcast it since the majority of the mempools will reject it due to its fee rate.You can only save it locally to your wallet via:Menu: \"Tools->Load Transaction->From text\"Paste the Raw Transaction above, click \"Load Transaction\".Then click \"Add to History\".I want to ask what is the point of rebroadcasting it, if he waits for several days and it is dropped, he can create a new transaction with a higher balance or extract the seed move it to any wallet that supports RBF like electrum? Or am I wrong?",

Or am I wrong? It is more convenient and safer, dealing with seed phrase is a sensitive matter which shouldn't be done just because of a single dropped transaction.And waiting for several days doesn't usually result in complete removal of a transaction due to (although non majority) a significant number of nodes aren't using the default mempool expiry and size.Besides, it's Blockchain.com, I bet he'll need to contact their support to remove the transaction from his history even if it got dropped from all mempools.I wont question his wallet choice since it's not the topic.BTW, I've rebroadcasted it yesterday when mempools are low so OP won't have to bother himself with it and it's now confirmed.",

Electrum is not a company that has support to help you. It's an open-source wallet built for anyone who wants their own responsibility. I tell you don't ever share to anyone who related to your seed and private keys.Quote from: sandy17 on March 07, 2025, 06:00:15 PM Blockchain shows my 500$ in that address but I can only access 200$ of it. where is the rest of my money please?here is my electrum wallet address:bc1qm9yk34vyhjtsqga4qslwvupnlydrd3mmhv4gcdIt is really something $490+, you can see it here https://mempool.space/address/bc1qm9yk34vyhjtsqga4qslwvupnlydrd3mmhv4gcdAs for your concern, it might be syncing issue, Does your electrum have color green circle? when did you last open the wallet it might be still syncing and will probably sync after few minutes.",
