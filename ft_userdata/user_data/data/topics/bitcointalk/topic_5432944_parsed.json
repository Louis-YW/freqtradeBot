So far the top 5 standings are still competitive with a not-so-big difference in points.",

I guess this league will become even more popular since al nassr will try t bring more professional players to the its club. I hope that al hilal will try to sign messi. This gonna create a very big hype to the SPL. We know that if al hilal was a rival for al nassr pretty much the same like barcelona against madrid in la liga. More stars will help SPL to be even more popular. Ronaldo's fan will not even miss any match from al nassr.",

There is no doubt that the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo will get a lot of hype and viewership for this league. He has fans all around the globe and that means that the matches of Al-Nassr will be watched by millions of people outside the Arabian peninsula. BTW, Ronaldo is not the only star player who will be part of the SPL. Top scorer (so far) of this season is Brazilian international Talisca, who also plays for the Al Nassr Football Club. There are also other foreign players at Al Nassr, including Vincent Aboubakar, Pity Martínez, Luiz Gustavo, Álvaro González and Jaloliddin Masharipov.",

So it's very interesting that the fact that CR7 can attract many football fans to this league. There are even rumors that there will be a top European player who will also be chased by several clubs from the SPL, making club competition in this league look even more exciting to watch.Anyway, Thanks OP for creating this thread.",
