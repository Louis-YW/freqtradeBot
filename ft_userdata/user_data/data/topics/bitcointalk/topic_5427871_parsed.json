Would make mining incentives last longer.~Has anyone ever posted this idea?I've only seen suggestions for the opposite: more and faster blocks.Quote from: bkelly13 on December 11, 2022, 04:39:52 AMCompletely agree.  Still, the amount of energy can be reduced significantly.It's good to realize why that energy is being consumed: because it's profitable. One way to reduce it, is a lower Bitcoin price. Another way is lower transaction fees, and very important: the block halving. Until now, the price went up more than block rewards went down, but at some point in the (near) future that won't work anymore. So I kinda expect Bitcoin energy consumption to have peaked. And of course higher energy prices lead to lower energy consumption, unless miners can move to a different area.yeah lite coin and doge covered that direction.LN is supposed to make the scaling issue go away.I do wonder if we altered block speed in 2024 making 1/2 ings be every 8 years more movement to LN and more fees to miners would happen.3.125 >>>>>> 20241.5625 >>>>> 20320.78125 >>>> 2040could be an improvement.",

Rewards might continue more smoothly for the miners, and security might rise as well, but the security cost per se remains the same. Miners don't create the value they're rewarded with. They tax the users. Either directly (transaction fees) or indirectly (block subsidy). If you mess with halvings, and increase their long-term subsidy, the users are going to pay for that, indirectly. I also don't see how that helps lightning.",

Due to the 4 year ½ ing pattern.by stretching to 28 day diff and keeping block size the same the main chain will get crowded fees will be higher. this is good for miners.at the same time LN will get more attention since it lowers fees and allows scaling a lot of transaction.I see it as a win win.BTW60/6 is a block every 10 minutesmy idea is60/3 a block every 20 minutesthere are other possible numbers that are easy60/5 is a block every 12 minutes60/4 is a block every 15 minutes.When you look at btc the 4 year ½ ing is causing rapid fire cycling in prices.More leisurely time frames allow for slower cycle and less volatility.Oh I used past 8 digits to calculate reward numbers because for btc to work either LN gets really big(they allow fraction of sats) or we go to 12 digits for paying on blockchain.I look at scaling in the future and while  I will be 99 in 2056 . It looks like a possible disaster that we do not need to rush to get to.  Some see LN fully taking over by 2056 I don’t see the meshing mechanisms in place at all.It appears that to mesh LN the main chain needs 10 Places and LN could use 14.You have an incentive to do LN by a factor of 10000 to 1.and the main chain can have 1/100 sat .but those are not on point with this thread.",

You could say the same about Proof of Stake: \"could the staker stop staking at all, and only create coins, where a new useful product or service is created?\". Even in Proof of Stake it is impossible to issue coins only when needed. And guess what: even if there is no mining, it is still possible to create too many coins, and then it is suddenly needed to burn them. Usually, when altcoins are burned, it means they produced too many coins before.QuoteIF so would it not decrease the energy waste of PoW by a factor of 24X.It won't change. Currently, there is one block per 10 minutes. If it would be one block per 1440 minutes (one day), it would not decrease the amount of energy, it will only make a single block 144 times harder to mine, so the difficulty will be 144 times bigger (actually, it will be somewhat different, because of Poisson distribution and things like that, see whitepaper for more details).QuoteThis would be more than enough to get the world governments off of btc case about energy waste for the next few years.It won't change, because it is not about the power, it is about the control.

If you wonder, what would happen, when the difficulty would be N times smaller, then just locate that point on the difficulty chart, and see articles from those times.

Second layer should work as long as main layer is workable and active. If the main layer isn't active, there's less demand for off-chain transactions (because 0 sat/vbyte is or can be acceptable). So, the natural state of the network is either a dead cryptocurrency (after the mainly-subsidy era) , or a very active main layer with users who've moved to second layer. That's the only thing that can realistically maintain security on the long term too.",

And they can raise, when mempool will be more congested, not less.Unless you want to raise a traffic by going into lower units than millisatoshis, like microsatoshis, nanosatoshis, and so on.QuoteIt is not only about frequency of a fixed number of people who open/close channels but it is also about the number of people who want to open or close a channel per day. For example we have a hundred users opening a channel every day who wouldn't want to close it in a long time, on-chain congestion makes it harder.And why they want to open or close the channel?1. Because they have to. As long as LN is a layer \"one and a half\", and not the true second layer. Because you cannot send coins to someone, who has no channel.2. Because it is profitable. And when it is more profitable, when you have cheap on-chain transactions, and you can pay anyone directly? Or when it is expensive, and you prefer to pay on-chain once than N times?Opening and closing channels, when it is cheap, makes sense only if you know in advance, that fees will raise, and that you will make a lot of transactions with connected parties. Otherwise, it is pointless, because you cannot predict in advance all cases, where someone will have no channel, so you cannot create that upfront. And guess what: if you predict it wrong, then it will be more expensive than using direct on-chain transaction, because then you have to pay for closing channels that you don't need (or you need to swap coins, and again, it can be also non-free).QuoteBottom line is second layer works best as long as the main chain is operating \"normally\".Those second layers would never be needed if there would always be a lot of free space in blocks. Also, second layers could work better when mempool is congested, because if there is a lot of data, then there is a scaling problem to solve, and that forces people to invent new scaling methods, like cut-through, transaction joining, signatures joining, outputs joining into multisigs, and other scaling techniques, that could really solve that congestion (and only then they are really needed).For example, if there is no address reuse, then we have better privacy, and nothing to compress, when it comes to repeated addresses. But when there is some address reuse, then it is bad for privacy, but at least it can be compressed, to make it easier to handle by full nodes (because you cannot force users to never reuse addresses, you can only make it easier to handle by compressing it). Also, we have a lot of history that cannot be deleted, but it should be at least compressed, when it is convenient (fortunately, compression is consensus-independent, so I hope that new versions will finally dominate, because their less space requirements will encourage people to upgrade).",

Lightning should serve the overwhelming demand of transactions. It's what the block space can't supply for. Quote from: garlonicon on December 12, 2022, 06:36:58 PMThose second layers would never be needed if there would always be a lot of free space in blocks.Exactly my point.

      "body": "QuoteCan you elaborate? How's address reuse helpful for scaling?Address reuse is harmful for privacy. Many things that are helpful for privacy have negative effect on scaling, for example using many addresses, using many coins, making many transactions, etc. And that's why everything should focus on compression, because that's the whole problem. LN can compress things to some extent, but only sometimes, because it could have negative effect on scaling if you open and close some channel, by making two transactions, instead of one. Because you need on-chain interaction every time, when you want to introduce someone to LN, or detach someone from LN, we need more tools for on-chain transaction batching, because then it will be also profitable for miners (by batching transactions, they can fit more of them in one block, and better handle mempool congestion, without increasing block size).Also, there is always a history. And users can be charged as usual (or even punished a little for address reuse), but it could be helpful for nodes if that kind of things will be compressed. And of course, any node can apply any kind of compression under the hood, but if it would be standardized, then it could have some positive effect on initial blockchain download, or even on things like sending blocks, if someone will spam the network with address reuse or other repeated patterns.",

If you look at random people at the forum that buy one miner, they will definitely say it will help them. If you look at who is actually contributing the hashrate, than you are looking at multi million dollar companies that have business plans that are made to fit what the bitcoin network gives them as reward. So they won't even start their whole mining business if they can't make a profit this way.About the 20 min block speed I would be super unhappy, because I already think the usual 30 min for 2 confirmation is to long and should be max 10 min (3 min per block)",
