But there are some posts outside this forum that are more helpful to us here but we can't just copy the post here (this would bring more spamming). So translating it brings lesser spamming, I know not all of the translated posts (in the board) are needed but some are. So if we can find a way to regulate the type of post translated then it will be better. Though I see that translating to pidgin the technical aspects of Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is more useful.But with all this I can say that we need moderators in as much as we need a child board in order to avoid spamming and other issues.",

For me, a translated thread is not useful for me, no merit that I will send. But I can not because of that not which others to find it useful and send merit or comment. If most Nigerians do not prefer pidgin translation, not meriting it and not posting there would be enough to discourage it than having all translated posts on a single thread, while it supposed not to be like that anymore when we have our own board now.",

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I’m only saying what I think, others might find these topics interesting and beneficial but I don’t fancy them. I have read a few and the pigin version does not do justice to the message the original author is trying to convey, there are certain words that are hard to translate to pigin and in an attempt to do so, one can use a lingua that is misinterpreted by readers.",
