In as much as Biden has assured Taiwanese nationals of his support, will there be much he can do if China decides to take things serious? I know, presently they are ranked number one in terms of military strength, But if they can help Taiwan who have not been attacked, why not help Ukraine win the war.",

They could then view this as a dry run of their own takeover of Taiwan. But obviously it didn't pan out that way, Russia made a disastrous blood-soaked bungling mess of their invasion, drawing global condemnation and achieving the status of international pariah.Who knows how China views this? It's probably not going to encourage them, though.",

They're brazen enough to keep modern concentration camps against millions of muslims so their aspirations and intentions for Taiwan certainly seem in line with reality. Meaning -- a military invasion is plausible. If China wanted to take a lesson from Russia, it would be that a lackluster international response should be expected.

It is extremely unlikely that China will decide on this before the end of the Russian special operation, so now Taiwan can sleep peacefully. It is extremely unlikely that the United States will interfere directly in what is happening, because then they will have to deal not only with China, but also with Russia. The recent joint air patrol of Russian and Chinese strategic bombers in the South Asian region sent a clear message to the US and NATO. In Taiwan, China will do everything itself, but Russia will cover it.",
