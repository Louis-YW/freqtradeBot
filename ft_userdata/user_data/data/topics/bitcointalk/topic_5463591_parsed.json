That depends on if your coin also says \"Buyer Funded\" on the hologram.  This page from \"The Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and Crypto-Currencies\", should give you the information you are seeking.  If you have more coins or plan to buy more, I would highly recommend picking up a copy of this book, as I find it to be an invaluable tool.Cheers",

I've double-checked my coin and I've noticed it doesn't have the words \"buyer funded\" on the back. So that makes them \"pre-funded\"? Mine still has the \"black bits\", so according to the book, only 490 of those exist.I'm curious to know how much this is going for on the market. Something like an estimated price would be nice. Do you think it's likely this coin will rise in value over the years? Anyhow, I'm going to need to save money if I want to add the 10 LTC and 25 LTC coins to my collection. Those are the only ones I don't have.",

Maybe that's unrealistic, but just my 2 sats.   I agree. I think physical bitcoin is one of the most important collectables on the planet. An artistic time capsule of when bitcoin started. I see collectible coins like silver eagles produced with a mintage of around 18 million every year. Our coins are typically under a thousand. Keep spreading the word and holding those coins",

Keep spreading the word and holding those coinsI think that one day these coins will make a big splash on the news or a social media platfrom and the market will change literally overnight, i think the collectable section on bitcointalk is beautiful but one day im afraid it might be ruined by thousands of new buyers. I also see these coins as the first edition of \" the new money\" and feel like the premiums 5 years from now will blow our minds, just mho",
