Some things I'd say to this:* I think that some (many!) of those posts are supposed to stay. Else the user would be nuked (and then his posts are indeed deleted) instead of banned.* By your logic, if somebody is banned by mistake and gets reinstated, a revert or some sort of merge would be needed. Unpleasant.* I'm far from certain that removing those posts would bring so much of a speed increase: I expect users table and posts table be separated.* Sooner or later we should migrate to new forum software, so drastic changes are expected to not happen here. But sadly this takes much longer than most have expected.",

The thing is that, a post should not be deleted regardless if the poster was banned or not, unless it is irrelevant and goes against the forum rules. Also, I believe the stress that the server/database is currently receiving is not enough for it to process the data slower upon logged in. It's all perfectly fine. Go check your internet speed.",

I don't know from your end, but from my own end, it's pretty fair and I guess it should be same at your own end because we are fetching from the same point.Talking about deleting or mutilating the data of banned users, I don't think it's wise. This forum is one of the oldest cryptocurrency forums, so it is also an archive to some people who will come here for research. How will you feel if Satoshi data was deleted before you discovered this forum?",

By the way, this topic is still quite interesting, I mean the idea behind it.I rarely use search option on this forum, just tried a little bit long text and when I clicked on search button, it was loading for ages. On short text, it works, just works, not well. I don't think it will improve in near future but the solution provided by OP is really terrible and disastrous. This forum is a 8th wonder of the world and no, I'm not joking, this forum once made a financial revolution and I think we should never delete the information that was posted by Satoshi and other developers, that would be a crime.This forum has Google Search option too that works well but to be honest I think that if you visit Google and type Bitcointalk and then the text that you want to search, you'll find what you are looking for more easily. At least most of my questions were easily answered that way. This forum has so much data, sometimes it's hard to filter it, especially when its search engine is not well-optimized. It needs optimization and improvement, not deletion of golden data.",
