  "content": "Hi all! I want to tell an unpleasant story. I traded on Binance for 3 years without any problems. I did nothing against the rules of the exchange and the deposit there is very small to violate anything. About 200 dollars. Before that I had withdrawn some money to tron (~ of 200 dollars) and LTC (1-1.5). Didn't withdraw everything in one day. And on April 4 I got a message - we temporarily disabled login function in your account. Please contact our support team. I wrote to support and they finally said wait 30 days, we'll see what happened. I had a margin call because I couldn't log in. I didn't know why they restricted logging in, there was still money in the exchange that I had earned through hard work at my day job. If I can't get my money out of there within 30 days, there will be maximum reposting everywhere, the money is too hard to just leave it there. If even with such small deposits problems what serious trading, staking, position trading can we talk about!  case ID 102928167",

      "body": "Unfortunately, that's how it goes with any centralized and custodial exchanges. They have stuff in place they claim to prevent fraud and whatnot but the reality is, they mostly trip innocent users. My guess is you will be asked to submit personal information when the support gets back to you so get ready for that.Also post your story on their subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/) where their support team could see it. They also escalate support IDs there.",

      "body": "If you leave your funds on centralized exchanges, you agree to their terms and conditions and have to play by their rules. For this reason it is a common advice not to store funds with centralized exchange wallets, always use a wallet to which you own the private key.Allow for the 30 day period, drop reminder messages during that time to ensure your issue is being addressed, hopefully you're told what the issue is and can get to solving it. As long as you did not do anything seriously wrong, you should have access to your funds eventually.This post is suitable in Exchanges subboard.",

      "body": "There might be an error here or the site really saw some irregularities with your account, you can’t do anything about this but to wait for their updates, though you can try to escalate this issue and have their support work on your account faster.This could be a big problem with CEX as they have control over your money, though the site will surely not ruin their reputation by doing this, there’s still a risk which you should always mind. Binance seems to be a good site but if there’s a way to get out of your money there better to do it.",

      "body": "Can you give us a good evidence of the reason your account was banned? Like screenshot of the message they sent you? They would state the reason why your account is banned or disabled.The only problem I have faced like this with Binance before was because I do use VPN and I mistakenly left it on while connecting with Binance. After many VPN use in which the address was set to United States an opening Binance app with it, they asked me for address. I was happy I could give an address of a place I have left many years ago in a way it can not even be traced to me because it was someone I knew that was living there and he is also  no more living there again. That was the issue and the issue was solved.Quote from: deddmitrich on April 12, 2023, 08:58:06 PMwrote to support and they finally said wait 30 days, we'll see what happened.Are you telling the truth? How did you wrote to support? It has been long that people can not contact Binance through email, or am I getting it wrong? What I know is that you can only meet their support team through social media like on Twitter. But it is better you make use of their live chat. Did you make use of their live chat? There would be bot that would be answering your question but if your case is not solved it would ask if he should transfer you to one of their customer care.",

      "body": "Binance gives you 30 days which you would have normally spent if you didn't have a margin call. But you can take live support to contact them in emergency way and discuss all your details there. If not then you must wait 30 days. In fact, if such a problem were in other exchanges, they would have solved it in no time. But I have seen no such solution in Binance Exchange. I also fell into simple trouble I had to wait for seven days.",

Some managed to recover theirs, some weren't that lucky. Most likely, they will ask you to submit more verification documents or even to provide source of funds.",
