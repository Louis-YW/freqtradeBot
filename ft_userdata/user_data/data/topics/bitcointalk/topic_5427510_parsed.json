Only use exchanges for trading, not for long-term holding. https://notyourkeys.orgI second this: always choose the platform (and users!) with best reputation, not necessarily the cheapest ones.If you have the time, a decentralized exchange can help you at least with the (lack of) withdrawal fees, but you have to learn/understand your ways there since you may give - by mistake - other users the opportunity to scam you.If you don't and you don't mind the requirement for KYC (however, don't take this lightly), then you'll use a centralized exchange, and MK4's short list is pretty good. There you'll probably need to fill KYC info and you'll have to keep an eye on the withdrawal fees (if the amount is big, it doesn't matter, but if it's small you may want to wait to pay less times the withdrawal fee).",

For this, I'd go with Coinbase for US peeps, and Binance for everywhere else.I'd like to vouch for bybit as well. Clean UI, faster interface and no overloads or shutdowns at all during times of extreme volatility. In the past, I've seen binance hanging/lagging and even not opening during sudden and larger BTC movements, but bybit worked flawlessly each time (atleast for me, since I use it personally too).Quote from: Cielo1994 on December 09, 2022, 10:34:12 AM<snip>Dont even know if that exchange you're talking about  is even popular and/or reputable, and you should not shill your referral links here, its against the forum rules mate.",

      "body": "Are you looking for an immediate exchange? Because you mentioned the best rates, I assume. Just be cautious when through using instant exchange. There are numerous scammers and fake websites. It is preferable if you can find your desired coin or token on a decentralized exchange. Otherwise, use a centralized exchange to consider buying coins and then transfer them to a non-custodial wallet. Don't always go for the cheapest option because it would lead you lossing funds. Keep in mind that storing your coins is never a safe in centralized exchange. I have been using Binance, you may take a look.",

So if you value your privacy then the best alternative is to use a P2P exchange like bisq which is already mentioned above and if you are trading on Bisq as a seller you can give the best rate and profit compared to trading on a centralized exchange.",

Maybe there is a website whereIn most cases, you will find reasonable rates if you deal with a person to person transactions or P2P compared when trading against the direct conversion of an exchange. Try to check the Binance P2P feature on Binance.com but even if you check it out, can you consider those rates as \"Best\" or it will satisfy you?You can also reach out to your local community to see if there's a direct buy and sell service there although you need to be vigilant as lots of scammers will surely watch you. But as a user who browses the internet for a long, I'm sure you should already know how to protect yourself.",

Only use exchanges for trading, not for long-term holding. https://notyourkeys.orgExactly! The reason why so many people got cheated by FTX was they had the lowest fees and they were doing that because they didn't care if they made money from you trading or not. They were making money by stealing your deposits. Nobody will work for free so if you see the promised profits are too high from an investment like staking or the fees are too low it should be a red light. Also, no matter how trusted a third party is there's always a small chance they'll scam you so make sure you're safe. Do a quick exchange in and out and don't trust them with your money for longer than you have to.",

It makes no sense to pay attention to the best rates, pay attention to liquidity, security and trust in exchanges. There are exchanges that offer the lowest possible rates and beginners go to them, but in the end it turns out that it was a trap and they lose their money.These are the exchanges that I am using, I first started with Binance, it is a good exchange, I prefer Binance mobile and desktop app which is the best to me, but because of KYC, I look for more exchanges. My second exchange was Huobi, it is a good exchange too. Followed by OKX which I am using very well with Binance now. Followed by Kucoin which has been the one that has not requested for anything related about KYC except if I want to use p2p, but I will not.Only what I do not like about OKX is when I click on coin pair, it will be loading everytime I click on it, although it do load successful and within a short time, but it is annoying. It is a very good exchange though.",
