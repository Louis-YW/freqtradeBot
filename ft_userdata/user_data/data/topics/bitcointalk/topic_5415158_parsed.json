      "body": "P2P transfers will still likely be quite private (the issuer of the CBDC might know you two are sending funds to each other but it might be harder to work out why - even if the trader did a lot of trades they might have personal uses for that account too).With exchanges, unless an exchange is awarded one account per person (which could and might happen) it may be possible for the CBDC to track inflows and outflows and work out exactly who you are (some simple things like treating exchanges like mixers and waiting a random amount of time that's a few days and sending an amount close to what's common for that exchange will greatly improve the chances of your transaction remaining private).",

CBDCs are going to be implemented gradually, and I doubt very much that they will eliminate the use of cash and other electronic transactions. You will still be able to acquire bitcoin P2P or on decentralised exchanges.",

Bitcoin transaction through P2P does not require any 3rd party. Directly you can do person to person transactions. And it is more confidential. And if you buy bitcoins through a bank, they always monitor your transactions. So I prefer to do transactions in P2P instead of banks.",

So yeah the CBDC and buying bitcoin are two parallels. Why did you not own a CBDC wallet? I bet they will allow buying BTC but of course not privately. Since users can deposit e-naira to the p2p platform, I guess that's how they also monitor for now the users buying BTC. It's surprising that Nigeria has CBDC but most countries today have none.  The bank bills are still being used but they may gradually illuminate certain bills in circulation.",

Using P2P aren't actually mean you have completely 100% privacy, it depends on your wallet and the server you access. If you didn't own your own node, there's a chance someone can still track your IP address.IMO when I hear about \"cryptocurrency\" word, I refer it to centralized shitcoins and that's almost same with CBDC.",

Let me come in here to answer the question, this your explanation goes in line with someone who is buying Bitcoin via P2P exchange, whereas for someone using his debit/credit cards to purchase Bitcoin for instance Binance or any other means of Buying Bitcoin using your cards, it could be possible for the government to track the transaction using your bank (CBDC'S) because the ATM card being used for such transaction is linked to the CBDC'S Bank Account and hence they will be able to know where you spent your money.",

Seems like a silly question being they can do the same through your bank but……CBDC have the same things as todays digital fiatif you take off the tin foil hat and do research.. you will realise many many thingsgovernment employees do not watch, monitor or surveill every transaction both in current digital fiat, and in the draft/trialing CBDCwhat occurs is governments create money. and then ration it out into commercial banks. asking commercial banks to monitor their customers and only report suspicious activity to government agencieswith the draft/trialing CBDC their main templates are a 3 level /versions of service.if your only moving minimal amounts .. call it monthly wage amounts you get the low level wallet. that does not ask for KYC but does limit how much funds can be transfered in-outabove this threshold is another service people have to upgrade to to get more relaxed limits. if they supply basic KYC. where by those commercial banks then do log names and transfers. but only report basic info to authorities of suspicious transactions and only supply full trade/transfer history if the government agency hands the commercial bank(s) a court order requesting full customer infothen if you are a whale/high roller/wealthy. then you need to go through full KYC the reason to pass info to government is similar to how all fiats have worked for years. the only big fidderence between cbdc and fiat is that in a CBDC the user has to save their keys to authorise payments which is more secure than a debit card pin number, where instead of having to hand a retailer all your debit card details for them to 'pull' money out of your 'account' you sign/authorise to 'push' an allotment of your holdings to the retailerthe surveillance and stuff is still the same as fiat now. (once you take the tin foil hat off and realise how fiat works)and yes even in china their way of banking is similar to that of UK/US. so dont learn how money works from fox news....",
