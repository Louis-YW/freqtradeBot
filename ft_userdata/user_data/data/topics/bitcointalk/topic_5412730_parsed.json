That's two months already you are that patient to post your issue now, we already have existing scam accusations on MBIT and they are all ignored by MBIT, their representative here is not active anymore with four existing scam accusations they are competing with 1xbit for the most number of accusations here in the scam section of Bitcointalk, you did the right thing posting your issues here, be sure to warn your friends who are active in casinos to avoid MBIT, if they don't want to be the next one posting here.",

If it's not tagged then it should be tagged and one of the victim can create a flag against them so that others can support. I checked one of the other thread and have not found any initiative from MBIT there.

Your accusation is not strong by the way, you need to attach proofs to support your accusation. Proofs like screenshot of conversation if any, deposit transaction ID and anything else that you think could support your case.Update: Profile found https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=262691But it seems they are not active on the forum from long time.",

However, it is not entirely clear how it ended up there in the end. I'm just really upset, you know? I trusted this casino, it had excellent ratings. I liked the site, as well as a set of games and providers. I just don't understand why she behaved like that. There are so many complaints about MBit, why do they have such great ratings on review sites? Can't they be trusted? And then where can I see information about the casino?",

It's not difficult to buy fake reviews. I've checked some of the review sites and many of them have good ratings on MBIT one of them even gave MBT a passing rating on their reviews of MBIT, I don't need to mention what review sites are those as I don't want to promote them here in Bitcointalk, people should pick the right review sites to read, believe in and sign up with their referrals, many of them are paid reviewer and it will do players good if they check Bitcointalk as their source of good reviews.",

I think this situation will be a good lesson for you and you will no longer play in unreliable casinos.",
