In just 2 weeks? it's 1/5 of your request!Why you are asking this to strangers on a online forum and don't you get directly from your friend/relatives (or just a bank/loan service in real life that will neve ask for such high interest?)Moreover, you have not any past transaction here hence no history of previous post ...no collateral!?!I don't think your is a reasonable offer",
