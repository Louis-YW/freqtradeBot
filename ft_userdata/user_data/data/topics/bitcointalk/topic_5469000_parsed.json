How do you control this thought over your ends do you keep to your regulations of always placing bets with some limits or you place bet according to your mind and regrets after losing that amount for not following your limits?You feel this way because you are betting not a comfort bet amount(too small or too big). You should determine to yourself what is the bet amount which you can accept when lose and win. Gambling will always feel you not enough when winning and losing so it’s important to resolve first your comfort zone to become satisfied on the result no matter what is the outcome.I’m not always gambling but I always have fixed bet amount on difficulty types of game. It’s very hard to control your emotion during the game so it’s important to settle all your max and min before you play so that you can still think straight. The only time I feel confusion on my bet amount is when I’m betting on live games which I’m not prepared.",

Sometimes I prefer to use high amount of money but I do overcome the temptation unless I am using free money like bonus to gamble. Gambling should not be in a way we should expect big winning. But sometimes I like big odds with far more lower amount of money, but that pleased me than to use big amount of money.",

Just be careful though and take control of our emotions because it might get you to being addicted.Exactly, greed is something that is very difficult to control and I'm sure everyone especially gamblers will admit this, it's in us and in everyone. So the danger is that when you have an excessive mindset in gambling and then also instill greed there then it is clear that like what you experienced above, instead of getting a big win by betting a large budget but instead the opposite, you lose everything without any return, that's right you also know that the final answer will not always be what you want, and with that it is clear that it is about whether you are lucky or not at that time. If you continue to do that, I mean keep betting with large amounts in my opinion not only mentally you will be disturbed but maybe in addition to financially that will be destroyed people who are around you will also definitely feel the impact such as close friends or your own family. So yes in gambling you better not overdo it, especially the problem of greed, you should never think that by bringing a large budget you will also get a big win, but think if you lose how? it is clear that you will not accept that result. So maybe you or they should be wiser and more reliable to see gambling that is just for fun.",

Greed had been a problem of many people on different aspect of life. Greed can affect us in gambling, trading, even in our various investments. There is need for us to tackle greed or else we might end up not able to reach where intend to reach or what we want to achieve. In gambling, greed can make us not to be flexible enough making the right decisions or make the kind of funds we supposed to make. We need to tackle greed by all means or else we might have some challenges which could be as a result a the freed spirit that had accumulated in our body.",

It's definitely about the part where you are \"craving\" for a big win and you can only make it if you are not going to regret it if you win but if you lose, that's the regret. That's when we are talking about gambling more than you want or above the limits. That's what occurs on your days for sure. Controlling this would be more connected to your discipline. I think you can start with betting smaller amounts or even fully going all in to not gamble. If it's becoming a problem, that should be your target.Make sure to pay attention to a different thing aside from gambling if you want to lessen your playing times there. Be productive.",

Everyone should decide what percentage of monthly earnings can allocate to gambling, but I do not recommend allocating more than 5-10% of your income.

While we all can agree that the pursue of some money is a relatively important part of what drives people to bet, if anyone turns money the main reason of their betting activities, they will likely shift from total losses to wins. The important difference between wins and losses is that after a big loss there can no be big win (since there is no leftover liquidity), after a big win there is always a chance for a big loss, though.",

The desire to win big is always there and if not checked can lead to playing beyond budget. How I handle this is to set rules and write them down; in the rule, the amount to play per bet , number of bets per day and target win and risk ratio are determined before ever placing the bets. This helps me manage my emotions better and so far, it has been helping me.

Personally I believe in playing small amount while targeting big winning but I do have games I also play big amounts depending on certain conditions. I do not feel bad irrespective of the outcome of my bets because I already determined how much I am expecting to win or loose before placing the best.

Let's say you gamble 2,000 Naira per week so that would account for around 8,000 Naira per month. You could set that amount as your maximum for the month and not worry how you usually bet per week. If you think the likelihood of winning is high on some games then you could put 4,000 Naira on that and use the other half on the rest of the month.",

That is why I have this habit that before I make a bet, I take the time to think twice before deciding to make a bet so that I can minimize having regrets. Surely, having regrets cannot be avoided but it can be lessened. Aside from that, I don't think that we can avoid greed when placing our bet because it is a human nature and sometimes, we were really carried away by our emotions. And putting a limit on your bets and sticking to it can really help you manage you betting habits. Trust me, this practice will save you.",
