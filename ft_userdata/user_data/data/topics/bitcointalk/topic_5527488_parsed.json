  "content": "The Lightning Network is becoming more popular, so I'm back with another initiative to run more LN nodes on Bitcointalk.This is going to be the largest Lightning initiative ever. All users will get the chance to earn merits for running a node.Start your own node, open channels, send & receive sats and learn how to use LN in your daily life!This is a marathon, not a competition. There are different stages of this marathon, and you receive rewards after you complete each stage.Read This Before Replying: You can enroll your alts, if you run another node. But you must make this clear beforehand, and don't expect your alts to receive any free sats (or merit, obviously). Two nodes are better than one. You need to run some sort of Lightning Network software to participate. You can either run it yourself, or lease it from a provider like Voltage. A bitcoin node will be provided to users who need help syncing their LN node. Free discussion of the Lightning Network may be held on this topic. However, please don't start arguments about LN here. Don't try to do silly things with your node that will cause your channel funds to be lost. I will not be liable for lost funds.FAQ:What do I get from this?In partnership with a couple of merit sources, we are handing out up to 50 merits to anybody who can get their own Lightning node set up and usable. These merits will be awarded progressively as you complete each milestone of running your node.We believe that Lightning Network will be very important in the near future, as fees begin to rise during the bull season.Alts, AI spammers, and accounts less than 60 days old will not receive merit.How do I run a node?Perhaps the most important question of all in this topic. There are many software you can use to run your node, along with tutorials, such as:- LND, C-lightning, or eclair (on Umbrel and Start9) Note: You will only receive stage 1 merit if you run one of these yourself.- Electrum trampolines- Breez app on Google Play or the App Store- Alby Hub- Phoenix Wallet- Muun app- LNDhub- Ride the Lightning- Raspiblitz- Rent one from Bitnoder, Voltage, MyNode, or Alby.Over time I am going to add docs for all of these on the Bitcoin Wiki for greater accessbility.Why is this in the Bitcoin Discussion board?This is to encourage more experienced members to run their own Lightning nodes, rather than newbies who barely understand bitcoin.Here is a good LN thread, but it's quite old and the OP hasn't logged in for a long time. Besides, it is in the Technical board of the forum, which is more confusing to normal bitcoiners. So here is a topic where people can learn and start their own LN nodes easily with even a basic understanding of Bitcoin.Can I join this marathon even if I am already running a node?If your node is complete and you can send and receive sats, then no, you cannot participate with that node. However, you are welcome to help by opening channels to participants.Additionally, you can join even if you're not registered. I accept reports from Nostr. Send them to this account, by mention (recommended for most reliable delivery) or DM. Obviously, you will be ineligible for merit prizes (even if you do register in the future), but you will still get some sats.My node is not syncing! How do I recover?It's probably because you're using Neutrino mode (see below). Turn that off, and ask me for dedicated RPC connection parameters to a real Bitcoin node.What Lightning node software can I use?Whatever works for you. You can run c-lightning, lnd, or eclair in a terminal, you can start a node through your Umbrel or Raspiblitz device, or you can even order one from Voltage or MyNode. By no means are you limited to just these options. Also see \"How do I run a node?\".Do I need a Bitcoin Core node to run a Lightning node?Yes, although you might get away with enabling \"Neutrino\" in your LN configuration. Note that Neutrino is an experimental protocol, so don't be surprised if your node has syncing issues because of it. You do not need the entire block history to sync it however - a pruned node will do.Where can I spend sats?Here is a directory of LN websites: https://getalby.com/discoverI reserve the right to modify or end this marathon at any time, with immediate effect, for whatever reason.Good luck, and happy node running!Disclaimer: Lightning Network Quest is not a challenge. That means you should not expect to receive any rewards for participating. Therefore, this should be used by bitcoin enthusiasts, and not bounty hunters or \"Games and Rounds\" farmers. Moving this topic might compromise the visibility of this initiative.",

Shame on me, I've never set up LN.Yeah, there's a mix of laziness and lack of time, plus the fact the price was going mostly up lately made me consider also saving a little, for a change.However, since I'm here, I am open to try, especially as you've written that it's a marathon. Then, no matter how slow I am, I'll try to finish it. Of course, I don't need merits and so on, the fact I'll finally have LN is good enough for me.PS. Super cool initiative, I am surprised that nobody came around yet.",

Do I need to download the full bitcoin network before I can be able to setup my own LN - This I already found the answer in the op, and it's a No, that a pruned node will do (I will find out what pruned node is later)2. This maybe a stupid question, but forgive me if it actually is, I am interest to know if there are any special pc specifications required to be successful with the LN setup (like from the beginning to the last step), any special kind of pc (with maybe any special feature or specifications like memory size, storage size and all) required for this?Thanks for the answer (in anticipation).",

Don't trust me and I can't say confidently that about 20h offline time will be just fine. If you don't have channels open, it doesn't matter, but no channels is mostly pointless.The trustless nature of Lightning means you shouldn't need to trust your channel partner. If your channel partner plays foul and posts a wrong channel state, means he tries to steal parts or all of your channel balance fraction then your Lightning node will penalize him. Apparently, your node can't do that in a timely manner when it's offline.Not all hope is lost though, because your channel partner usually can't screw you immediately or in very short time, as far as I understood it. To minimize risks I would avoid too long offline periods. What is too long? Can't say, really. Don't stay offline with your Lightning node (LND or c-Lightning) for longer than maybe one or two days. In my opinion that's just too risky (of course it depends on your channel capacity, but I don't like loosing even a few thousand sats for no reason).Don't perceive this as a discouragement. Lightning is interesting by design, it's also here and there complicated and a joy when it just works. Well, most coins have two sides, haven't they?",

Maybe I will connect it to my node tomorrow and see how it is.Alby Hub if I can get it to work might be a good way for you to run a Lightning Node as well. It has the same look and feel as a Bitcoin node. Even has a desktop app. But I found a bug in the login process that I'm trying to help the dev team fix.",
