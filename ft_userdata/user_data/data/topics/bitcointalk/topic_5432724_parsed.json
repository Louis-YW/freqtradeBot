Good luck!Both suggestions are highly effective.@YoMix, an ANN with graphic design will look profession, similar like this.The signature campaign with a good budget and longer staying plan will help you to build your brand awareness in the community. I can assist you designing an effective campaign for your business as I am already running a signature campaign for Sinbad bitcoin mixer. Besides, you can check my entire portfolio of bitcointalk promotion from my service page. Feel free to contact for marketing related discussion on my Telegram or via forum PM.Welcome to the forum. Good to see a new mixer with us.A small finding and suggestion: The clear version domain redirect to the TOR onion. It's fine when someone using TOR browser but when someone is not using TOR browser then it is going to show error on the page. Maybe it will be better to put some text in the root page and tell the visitors to open the URL with TOR. None-tech-savvy users will not find themselves confused.",

It says \"Exploring your identity to anyone may be dangerous.\". I think this should be Exposing.Also, it would be nice if you could also offer free test mixing on your site or even run a review campaign wherein participants would test your site and make honest reviews about it. If you're interested on running those or any promotional campaigns, do let me know, I might be able to help you guys out.",

But it remains incomplete if these members do not publish their reviews with the service.In previous comments, some members suggested that you launch an evaluation campaign where you choose experienced members to try the mixer and publish their reviews so that you can evaluate the mixer from the user's point of view. This will not cost you much (depending on the number of members you will choose), and this will increase the recognition of the Mixer and gain the trust of the community.I suggest you use Royse's campaign management services because he is an expert in it and has organized many campaigns before. He will help you to hire everything in a short time and choose the right members. You can contact him via pm : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=366632",

As well we have some investors, but for now we don't need their coins as, obviously, we just started our business and turnovers not so large.It's important to see that the company is willing willing to take and effect suggestions given by proprospective customers and those testing the site and mixing to make it better like your doing. I could see that some of the recommendations from experienced users on the forum have been effected like the copper membership and the launch of a campaign for a wider publicity with Julerz12 at the head of its management.Although, the Ann thread comes without any design yet which makes it look less professional and I hope to belive that's being worked on yet. With the increase in mixers on the forum as it is, standing out in every way is a no option but obligatory.The icon for sure is nice and symbolic, even the colour patterns as well as features offered. Cleaning of the logs is something I feel would bring some co.fort to customers and its nice to have that innovated and spelt out as well.From the activeness in response from the team, I can only expect quality service and am guessing that won't be lacking.
