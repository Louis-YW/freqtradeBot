  "content": "Hello, at the beginning of this long post with content and photos, I would like to say that I spent a lot of time looking information, scammed peoples, talked with they, received many things from they, photos, victims, it took me several months and I noticed the practice two years ago, from a telegram where this \"vigorous\" scammer was operating also on me. I hope it will be appreciated and my work will not be wasted and the Admins fallged, suspend his accounts, rest true member also, and we will write negative trust to destroy him! Also I will be here on forum looking the same persons as he.PS. I also spoke with resellers of accounts meanwhile work of this post, few I also knew it, many of them don't know with who he worked, but as we all know so buying account with KYC are very RISKY, same as GMAILS. About exchange currency we SHOULD USE ESCROW to be not scammed. We thinking that his real name is: Abdellah Kouh, one of the skrills to which he transferred the stolen money with linked the main one used gmail: abdelah39abdelah39@gmail.comAlter skrill: siffedine36@gmail.com (Saif-eddine Aatif) rachnn100@proton.me (Zakaria Bounajne)One of crypto address:USDT TRC20 address: TQeioP7tEXQ6wXyXxM1hwhSAh5RAdkoDDCBTC address: 1F174DpqxYCc7HyWzp26jobZkzfwr4gm7uMan with who he worked, they knew it personally, creator / reseller, yozidjbr@gmail.com.

(Of course are another connecting with accounts, not only that, another web BITIFY, HIS THE SIMILAR OR SAME POST FROM THIS ACCOUNTS, opinion etc).I put many screen and photos with guys, because post can be delete by this fu*ker. Of course you can check the latest posts of this scammer, I will give a warning under his current topics. I also gave a description under screens on imgur.com to make it easier to understanding.Many often change Telegrams, fast few also deleted or last seen a long ago. This which works now and are connected: Last scammed and active (think so not long ) : @accountstorestoree name as bet365 (number: +212720970783) and @zakariamouj, before @verifiedaccountsstore @accountstorestore (number +447865515904) and Mark Fyodor as @betfair23, then bet365etu and in last option shadow all. In 2022y and before was know as Dan @aronz223, @simor223, @agnelblc which we can saw as his post, look screen ofc, few also was delete faster. PROOF how to combine bitcointalk accounts and telegrams into this one person, sorry one SCAMMER to make it easier to read further threads.https://imgur.com/a/zW0c8hj - 12 Proof Screen, briefly presented connections of profiles on Bitcointalk and Telegram, more explanations in the scams presented below. As I wrote earlier, photos and screenshots of posts, but you can check post myself, if he still dont delete.Proof screens of course included this posts on which he showed this site, accountstore: From betfair23: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3532285 (Actual profile site which showed his telegram.)From usdt2023: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445283.msg61929783#msg61929783from: usdt2021x: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458313.msg62492054#msg62492054Many profiles? Why? Ofc the answer is clear when someone wrote that he was a scammer, he left the account for some time, and suddenly stopped writing, just like here on Bitcointalk, on Telegram (few deleted) and groups. It returns to the account when the case has ended.First, who is it and how does it work? He is a thief from Morocco who was quite intelligent and smart, he sells Bet365 in cheap, good price, Betfair accounts along with Skrill from Morocco and sometimes Spain. Everything previously on Gmail, which is recoverable for him.He is also very active in currency exchange, where he also scammed @MOUDO what will be in final show in down. Generally, he sells everything related to it, bank accounts, bookies etc, Morrocons including recently gmail accounts, which he also recovers very well, as I will show, of course.On start, when you want deal with him, he is very nice and helpful, he responds immediately. If he sell bet accounts, he also give you first to check, all looks perfect as in my case. Problem was later, but in other case they grab money and gone. START: STOLEN 400 USD by betfair23 (Currency exchange) (About 13 February 2023)Paid TX, address BTC of scammer: In Screens.Remember this topic? When @MOUDO wrote about scam Accusation agains him? He should already upload but we wrote to him and he sent this which he had. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439721.msg61756925#msg61756925The whole conversation, including the thief's address and checking that he had transferred the money to another exchange, then of course stopped talking. I added my screen also which thread when we talking about deal in BTC forum and screen from telegrams although it changed its name, at first to telegram: @betfair23, then to @bet365etu and finally, of course, hidden and last seen a long ago. After this of course leave for a few month btc profile: betfair23https://imgur.com/a/OrQjx0G - 11 proof screens Few current posts with his \"helper\" in currency exchange and same: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472492.msg63094921#msg63094921 , https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471550.msg63053949#msg63053949 , https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472330.msg63113955#msg63113955 Before from usdt2021x: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5377351.msg58797580#msg58797580 , https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5241465.msg60334459#msg60334459 STOLEN: 120 EUR (Spain Bet365 and recovery GMAIL also by betfair23 after back) - Few days ago when he back! (telegram: name: bet365 @accountsstorestoree +212720970783 and 2nd @zakariamouj)PAID: Money sent to his SKRILL: rachrr100@proton.me ZAKARIA BIJAOUANE (Proof on screens)Actual topic, back after 8 months with selling Bet365,Skrills from Morocco / Spain: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437571.msg63101644#msg63101644One guy wanted to buy a Spanish account, of course, calmly and pleasantly at the beginning, checking the account, paying, and then after 2-3 hours suddenly someone goes to the Gmail address, changes the password and also changes the recovery e-mail address, just like in the BET365 account. Of course, story so maybe a his friend not logout and then he stopped talking of ccourse. In other tele groups, days ago started selling \"another\" Morrocan guy, which put the same advertisement as this accountstorestoree, which name: @zakariamouj, and he will wrote to this person and... He sent the same betfair account and mail which previous propose before he bought spain bet. Also when we checking, this new account, Zakaria put Bitify link in one group, to sell Moroccan account, and the seller name is...: USDT2023, create in Feb 2023. Here I combined the screenshots to make it easier to find, please look, the same links lead to the same seller and even the link that had USDT2023 in his bio, of course, just like the number of phone the previous account telegram, mean, accountstorestore, this scam was from the last new accounstorestoree.Of course look to screen  https://imgur.com/a/smriluA - 18 PROOF sreensSTOLEN: 1: 800 EUR from Morocco Skrill + 70 EUR for account losed 2: 930 from Morocco Skrill by Usdt2021x, usdt2023, betfair23PAID Many times on: yazidojbr@gmail.com (Screens)*(450 EUR for Binance Account) - Im putting it in brackets here because Im waiting for a response from the, who was stealing in part of time February - October 2022, posted about 30 posts under USDT2021x about scamming for EUR 450, where he also posted the buyer's email abdelah39abdelah39@gmail.com and obviously non-existent tg: aronz223. I will try to update.Time when he probably start scamming and recovery mails with Skrill money. That was as Dan telegram (delete but talk are screened, which we can connect by telegram, and mails yozidjbr@gmail.com and abdelah39abdelah39@gmail.com, for example: At the December 2021 and start 2022 everything was fine, bought positive (change password and buyer mail added as recovery, but for scammer that was a not a problem, but for this we can see how he try recovery and after this also buyer can recover gmail but of course without money of skrill, when password was of course also recovery.) For the added e-mail previously, the gmail and skrill accounts were recovered by buyer also, but of course without the money, because after the theft, scammer didin't add more security options, he only cared about stole money, which was confirmed by another buyer who also lost her funds in the same situation.+Recovery Gmails accounts. Actual topic with Gmails selling: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470168.msg63023158#msg63023158https://imgur.com/a/9rLfUBW - 16 PROOF Screens He robbed much more, but sometimes people didn't have on time take photos or can no longer log in to provide accounts, but there was a telegram group that MARK, accountsstore created and invited peoples, where he sold accounts, and then stolen EUR 3k  from the skrill accounts which sold 2/3 days before, of course after users asked , never replied, left the telegram and deleted the group after some time. (Normal practise as always).https://imgur.com/a/tqFCcvo - 3 screens before delete GroupAs I mentioned at the beginning:  I hope it will be appreciated and my work will not be wasted and the Admins flagged, suspend his accounts, rest true member also, and we will write negative trust to destroy him! Also I will be here on forum looking the same scammer persons as he and few I have on my eye, because I have many more screenshots and suspicions about the next people.If you have any information, please write in the post to keep it up to date and bump, or send me pm, telegram (@dravenbtc) if you dont want do this yourself, but better here in this post.",
