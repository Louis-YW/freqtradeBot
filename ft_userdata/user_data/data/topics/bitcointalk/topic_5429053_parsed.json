  "content": "Alot of times I've deposited bitcoin into a crypto casino but then realized I could have deposited usdt or Shiba or even TRX instead, and I begin wishing there was a way to convert or exchange my bitcoin balance right inside the casino, to one of those coins I mentioned, without having to withdraw my bitcoin back to a crypto exchange, thereby saving me from reducing my bitcoin balance through paying the withdrawal fee.There is a crypto casino with such a feature?Would be really great to see some of the top crypto casinos on this forum consider adding a mini crypto exchange to their platforms, to enable gamblers switch between coins easily,This could also act as another source of revenue for the casino if they decide to charge a small fee for such services.Another important example is my current signature Ad payer, am paid bitcoin into my stake.com account, there are times I wish to gamble with part of my earning but wished there was a way to convert that bitcoin to usdt so that I know exactly the amount (in usd) am wagering away.I personally hate to gamble with bitcoin, because I could be gambling away 0.05 btc and it appears small, but when converted to usdt, that's a really big amount, this is why I prefer to gamble using usdt, or shiba or TRX, which give me clear indications of what am staking and could possibly lose.What are your thoughts guys?",

If you are going to deposit some funds better to use your preferred crypto already, and do the exchange outside the casinos I think this is more convenient to do so, but innovation like this are also welcome.",

Actually, it is not a common feature of any gambling platform or casinos out here. I've tried a lot of gambling platform that has an ANN thread on the forum, and I can only remember doing such a thing to only one gambling site. Unfortunately, I cannot remember what casino it was, but I was able to deposit BTC and convert it to USD and then to another cryptocurrency that they accept on the platform such as XRP since it has one of lowest transaction fees and the most convenient crypto for me to withdraw on. About the exchange feature that you're talking about, I don't think there's a casino that has it since it is not an exchange platform. You can only convert tokens to USD on some gambling platforms but not directly exchange them for another token.",

Well, it’s not wrong if a casino will also try working on a crypto exchange that I think will make the gamblers more satisfying when it comes to their in built service. Although it’s not their focus, but it’s also part of wise improvement that will eventually bring more customers on their site, because believe it or not, it will certainly  become a trend in the future so adopting it in advance would bring more advantage to the casino itself.",

So it will be very difficult for them as they might be treated differently by regulators or those who issue gambling licenses.So it's really up to us gamblers, how and learn to convert it in our head or uses the tools that casino provided us without the 'actual exchange' of the coins instead.Legally and cost could be the main reason why they are not willing to include this one, unfortunately.",

So far, I have not played in a casino yet where there is a crypto exchange. Although that seems more advantage too, but it could take more capital too for a casino to create an in built exchange. I have only experienced just like with dollar exchange but not with crypto. But if it will attract more customers to play, then I think that’s a good idea casinos should start to embrace.",

I believe everything that is new in our eyes create a sense of confusion, and might complicate things around as you’ve said. Yes, it will increase their expenses but if that will make the players stay on them, I guess it deserves to be tried. However, if the casino has other plans other than that, then it’s best for the casino to stay in focus on improving its casino’s services than to venture into something new that might be not of their willingness or availability of funds.",
