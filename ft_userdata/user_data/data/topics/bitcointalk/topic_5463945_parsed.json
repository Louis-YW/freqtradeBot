  "content": "i have opened a topic here in the past year asking if i could recover my missing wif characters https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407589.0Since i was trying to recover my 21 Wif missing character over the past few years with No Luck i was so disappointed , yes i know that 21 characters is too much , too much bits missing to be bruteforced  .i have a question but due my lack of knowledge i need some help .could i use my exact device entropy details that was used to generate the private key through bitcoin core in 2011 or 2012i have my exact old computer specs and the exact ram memory that was used and other important info .if this possible i want a python code or something using this entropy details i could try to hope to find a collision to my address or the change addresses in my wallet at that time .any help will be appreciated too much",

      "body": "No, even if you have the same specs as your old specs when you generated this WIF key it's still impossible to recover the missing 21 characters it would take decades to brute force these missing characters.I think you were thinking that you can generate the same WIF key by having the same entropy that is impossible never heard someone succeed in doing this even me I tried that thing past year's ago without success, I just want to recover my old private key due to backup corruption but no it doesn't work.Be careful on the post below that asks for public addresses and the WIF key with missing characters.",

      "body": "What do you mean you have the device entropy details?When generating a private key, your computer collects entropy from various sources. Mouse movements, network activity, thermal noise etc. You can't just redo the process and expect to get the same entropy, because the entropy is dependent on beyond RAM and probably other hardware info. In fact, I think that preventing the recovery of an entropy is what the Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generator is trying to accomplish in the first place, for if it wasn't, other programs could work out your private keys.",
