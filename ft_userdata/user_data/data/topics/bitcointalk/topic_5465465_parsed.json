Delisting trading pairs doesn't mean it would affect the price of these coins I believe it won't affect the market or these coins/tokens. Unless these coins/token is totally delisted from Binance.There are many reasons why they remove and delist these coins/token pairs there might be fraud happening on these assets like market manipulation or other illicit practices. They delisted them to protect users from losing on trading.",

Please give me your personal opinion! it depends on the fact whether these are the only trading pairs available on binance for these tokens  (and thus the token is completely removed from binance), or only 1 of many currency pairs is removed in order to increase liquidity on the others. While the second scenario should not have a negative effect on the price, the first practically condemns the project to a slow extinction.",

Many trading pairs related to BUSD will be canceled and trading of that currency will be stopped by February 2024[1]. This news has been spreading for several months[2], and therefore all that is happening now is an application of this news and it will not have an impact on the price.By deleting the pairs related to BUSD, it remains MTL/ETH ANKR/BNB, which are often removed due to poor liquidity or platform policy, etc., but those altcoins (MTL&ANKR) have not been delisted, although this may happen.if he talks here about its impact on Bitcoin price, it is almost zero.[1] BUSD users will be able to convert Busd to other stablecoins until February 2024 [2] Binance removing support for BUSD",

This isn't the first time Binance is delisting a trading pari or entire coin from their platform, Binance isn't only the exchange available on the market so those project will do fine if they have something they're doing that's worth investing in but if they were just benefiting from the trading volume on Binance exchange then they'll be in trouble. Also it's possible that this project has other trading pairs still on Binance exchange and the delisting is just for Binance exchange to meet their target of stopping support for BUSD on their exchange. As for those without BUSD pairs probably the reason behind their delisting is low trading volume. As for an immediate effect, some of this project can take a hit in their trading volume and this will affect the price of the project. Lets not also forget that we're in a bear market and if their price of the project takes a hit because of this delisting, they might decline further in price but if the projects has demand in the market, then they might rise back up but since they're altcoins and there's no guarantee in altcoins, it won't be wise to make investment in any of these projects just because they took a hit in price as they might never recover.",
