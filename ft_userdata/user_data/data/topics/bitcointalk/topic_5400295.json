  "content": "Hello all,I remember mining Bitcoin in 2018-2019 and making decent profit but nowadays its pretty hard to make good profit with a normal computer. I've been thinking about buying ASIC miners and trying to solo mine but I have no idea how to solo mine or if it's worth it to try. Are there any good guides on solo mining?also if you guys could suggest me a good ASIC miner, I'd appreciate it",

      "body": "It really depends on what you're after, and what kind of budget you have.The first thing to establish is if you want to have maximum performance and you don't care about noise, heat, energy consumption, etc. If that's the case, then just grab a few Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro+ Hyd which will give you 198Th each at 5445W and 50db. There are other good ones as well if you can't find that one, here's a good list: https://www.asicminervalue.comOn the other hand, if you want to mine at home with a quiet machine, then grab one or more Apollo BTCs and/or Compac Fs. Those are currently the best silent miners for home. Each Apollo can generate between 2-3TH/s+ depending on the amount of heat/noise/power you want. Each Compac F can run at about 300GH/s and are basically as quiet as you can manage to get a fan to run as they come without a fan although they need one.That's the hardware part done, now for the pool, there are a few out there, but the simplest one to run is ckpool solo as you just need to point the miner to the pool, no need to register or anything: https://solo.ckpool.org",

Each USB miner mines 300GH/s at 15W, whereas the Apollo gets about 2.1TH/s at 120W (extremely quiet and efficient mode). Based on those numbers, the 7 USB miners required to match the Apollo hashrate consume 105W.But the price difference is huge, 7 USB Miners would cost you $1,629.98 [1, 2], whereas one Apollo BTC with power supply is sold for $574.99 [3]Also, something important specially for a newbie, the Apollo is ready to go in one single unit, and you can easily attach more if you want to. You just connect it to your computer, power it and you're ready to mine. The Compac Fs are great, but you need to tinker a bit more with them, get proper USB hubs that give you at least 2.4A per port, get proper fans and make sure they're running, tweak parameters for each stick, etc. Also for 7 sticks you'll probably need 2 USB hubs, so that's two power connections instead of one for the Apollo, etc. It's just more difficult to scale with the sticks.[1]: https://bitcoinmerch.com/products/4-x-gekkoscience-compac-f-with-fan-upgrade-bitcoin-merch%C2%AE-10-port-usb-hub-combo-up-to-1-4-th-s[2]: https://bitcoinmerch.com/products/3-x-gekkoscience-compac-f-with-fan-upgrade-bitcoin-merch%C2%AE-7-port-usb-hub-combo-up-to-1-05th-s[3]: https://shop.futurebit.io/products/pre-order-apollo-btc-a-bitcoin-asic-miner-and-desktop-class-computer-running-a-full-node-and-much-more-batch-1-ships-in-late-april-to-may?variant=33404745351267",

Don't you think that would mess with kernel drivers a little and maybe cause a panic [Of course, never try this on Windows, as the OS will go up in flames before such a configuration is deployed at full speed].",
