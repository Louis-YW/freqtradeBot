  "content": "Bitcoin is a decentralized network and also a digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer system to process and verify transactions. These transactions are recorded on a public ledger, also called the Blockchain.The standard for owning Bitcoin is by having a wallet (ideally a non-custodial wallet), which contains: a private key that gives full control of the coins, and also a public address (wallet address) that allows individuals to receive and verify transactions on the Blockchain.As designed in the Bitcoin protocol, there can be only 21 million BTC in circulation, even though other enthusiasts might think otherwise due to proven calculations and reasons not to estimate.The concept of Bitcoin scarcity is strongly tied to halving events where rewards of miners are reduced, thereby decreasing the amount of Bitcoin entering circulation. In more detail, the total supply (21 million) remains constant, while circulating supply keeps increasing as long as mining continues, but the amount entering circulation is reduced by halving, thereby leading to more demand.In addition to scarcity,  Lost Bitcoins happens to be a significant contributor. Dormant wallets, also known as hibernated wallets, are considered to house lost Bitcoins. Identifying the total number of lost bitcoins can be very challenging or even impossible due to the fact that there are several inactive wallets connected to the Blockchain, making it impossible to tell who is holding and who has lost.For example, Satoshi Nakamoto happens to mine the first block. The Genesis address created holds about 99.85 BTC and is currently a dormant wallet. There are also speculations that Satoshi might have thousands of dormant wallets as they were used to receive block rewards. By subtracting the amount of Lost Bitcoin from 21 million, it is likely that we are left with an amount lesser than the total supply when unlocked.There are hundreds, if not thousands, of dormant wallets that house Bitcoin of different amounts. When we calculate all together, we realize that we are short of the total supply, which I think would trigger scarcity as more people would want to hold the ones available. Discussion QuestionsDo you think all dormant wallet (long inactive wallets) are gone forever? As we are not certain of Satoshi's return, should we be bothered about his dormant wallets? do you think lost Bitcoin can cause Bitcoin scarcity in the future?From a total of 21million total supply, can you attempt a prediction guess of the total number of Bitcoin that would be in active wallets after all Bitcoin has been mined?In addition, here are ...Possible Causes of Lost BitcoinDeath of the holderTransferring to the wrong network or address (though some wallet software can detect this and notify the sender before the button is hit)Inability to remember memorized or find written seed phrasesWallet compromise such as phishing hacks, etc.Preventive MeasuresThe use of private hardware wallets (cold wallets) is strongly encouraged.Seed phrases should never be memorized, nor written on a mobile device or computer. They can be written on paper or in a book that shouldn't be visible to external members and should be strongly protected.Having a backup of your documented seed phrase is crucial in case of unplanned circumstances like a fire outbreak.Genesis block - https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa",

The act of passing down needs to be done on an ongoing basis until the child for his future.I never knew how other people did it, but in my opinion bequeathed Bitcoin the actions that I would take if I had large amounts of bitcoin.",

Even today, most of the figures you might read on the internet regarding these 'lost coins' are guesstimates wherein they get the number of bitcoins sitting on wallets for a certain period of time. Even if you come up with a sensible equation or analysis to get an exact number of coins that would no longer be in circulation ever, it will never be correct as there had been some cases wherein dormant coins were transferred to another wallet after 10 years or more.",

But yes, normally you need to have the private key to move coins in the blockchain. The blockchain itself doesn't know or use public addresses, those are only recipies for how to construct so-called unlock scripts for coins.Quote from: Felicity_Tide on May 11, 2024, 04:06:47 PMAs designed in the Bitcoin protocol, there can be only 21 million BTC in circulation, even though other enthusiasts might think otherwise due to proven calculations and reasons not to estimate.By design there can be only 20,999,999.9769BTC, of which some are provably lost or unspendable (as already said e.g. the Genesis block coinbase subsidy of 50BTC is unspendable, even if you had the private key; there are few examples of miners who didn't claim the total allowed block subsidy and transaction fees, those unclaimed coins are forever lost, too; any coins sent to OP_RETURN outputs are burned and lost; ...).Quote from: Felicity_Tide on May 11, 2024, 04:06:47 PMDormant wallets, also known as hibernated wallets, are considered to house lost Bitcoins. Identifying the total number of lost bitcoins can be very challenging or even impossible due to the fact that there are several inactive wallets connected to the Blockchain, making it impossible to tell who is holding and who has lost.Why those should be considered lost coins? Elaborate, please!There might be a likelyhood that early coins are lost coins because wallets were deleted when Bitcoin didn't yet had a accepted value. But we can't know if those are really lost.Quote from: Felicity_Tide on May 11, 2024, 04:06:47 PMFor example, Satoshi Nakamoto happens to mine the first block. The Genesis address created holds about 99.85 BTC and is currently a dormant wallet. There are also speculations that Satoshi might have thousands of dormant wallets as they were used to receive block rewards. By subtracting the amount of Lost Bitcoin from 21 million, it is likely that we are left with an amount lesser than the total supply when unlocked.With 100% certainty blocks 0 (Genesis) and block 9 can be attributed to Satoshi Nakamoto (Satoshi sent some coins from coinbase of block 9 to Hal Finney and this is well documented).See http://satoshiblocks.info/, there's some scientific evidence that Satoshi mined around 21954ish blocks (this yields ~1.1million BTC). Every of those coinbase outputs were mined to a public key, never to a public address!This bitcoinexplorer.org lists blocks with a miner attribution.Quote from: Felicity_Tide on May 11, 2024, 04:06:47 PMThere are hundreds, if not thousands, of dormant wallets that house Bitcoin of different amounts. When we calculate all together, we realize that we are short of the total supply, which I think would trigger scarcity as more people would want to hold the ones available.Why are you so concerned about dormant wallets exactly? We can't really calculate them all together, except maybe that you could put them into buckets of unspent age. But that doesn't give you any certainty if those are only dormant or provably lost. What's the fuss about them anyway?I added my answers in color.Quote from: Felicity_Tide on May 11, 2024, 04:06:47 PM Discussion QuestionsDo you think all dormant wallet (long inactive wallets) are gone forever?No, but some may be. We can't know. As we are not certain of Satoshi's return, should we be bothered about his dormant wallets?Not at all. do you think lost Bitcoin can cause Bitcoin scarcity in the future?Provably lost ones, yes. But Bitcoin is already of finite scarcity, who cares if more or less?From a total of 21million total supply, can you attempt a prediction guess of the total number of Bitcoin that would be in active wallets after all Bitcoin has been mined?No, likely impossible. The only certainty is: the pile of lost coins only grows, never shrinks.",

By subtracting the amount of Lost Bitcoin from 21 million, it is likely that we are left with an amount lesser than the total supply when unlocked.According to speculation, we are made to believe that Satoshi owns over 1 million Bitcoin, whereas according to the real time value of the total circulating supply of BTC at the time of writing this post is said to be 19,696,950 BTC,  which means if we are to subtract Satoshi's acclaimed 1 million BTC, what will be left for both lost+unlost BTC currently in circulation will be 18,696,950 BTC.   Credit:www.visualcapitalist.comHowever, according to data about the top holders of Bitcoin, I'm made to understand that;1.

I also find this as humorous as the way we talk about the tragedy of WW3+, solar storms, quantum computers,... and there are tons of reasons why others question it, but back to the reality is that we need to own bitcoin before a bad situation arises to feel how it affects us.",

In regards to scarcity, probably the only thing that we can do about it is if we just don't think about it and just accumulate and hodl as much bitcoin as we can afford to do, we would eventually not worry about scarcity because when that happens and the prices goes up in an exponential amount, you would get the most benefit out of it.
