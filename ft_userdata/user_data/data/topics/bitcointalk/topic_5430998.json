  "content": "I saw the headline and thought we will be having another El Salvador experience in Brazil only to discover they didn’t make bitcoin a legal tender. I think the goal of the Brazil government is to regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. And they are using the FTX scandal as an excuse to do so. I could be dead wrong or paranoid. What do you guys think about this development in Brazil? Is it good or bad for bitcoiners in Brazil?QuoteBrazilian lawmakers have approved a complete regulatory framework for the trading and use of cryptocurrencies in the country.Voted on Tuesday evening in Brasilia, the country’s capital, the new rules recognize bitcoin as a digital representation of value that can be used as a means of payment and as an investment asset in the South American nation.The bill applies broadly to a sector which it calls “virtual assets,” and now only needs the President’s signature before it becomes law. It does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a legal tender in the country.The bill tasks the executive branch with selecting government bodies to oversee the market. The expectation is that the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will be in charge when bitcoin is used as payment, while the country’s securities and exchange commission (CVM) will be the watchdog when it is used as an investment asset. Both the BCB and the CVM, along with the federal tax authority (RFB), helped lawmakers craft the overhaul legislation.Home to a vibrant cryptocurrency economy, Brazil has at times seen more citizens trade coins such as bitcoin than invest in the stock market. Now, the country seeks to set the stage for that to translate into more day-to-day usage in financial transactions.But not all in the text is positive for the development of the market in the country. A big miss from Tuesday’s vote was the rejection of a clause that sought to cut some state and federal taxes on purchases of bitcoin mining machines. While the text was quite restrictive –– the benefit would only apply to operations using renewable energy sources –– it was apparently not enough to be approved.Other provisions include the regulation of service providers such as exchanges, who will need to abide by specific rules to operate in Brazil. The bill seeks to regulate the establishment and operation of Bitcoin service providers in Brazil, defining such entities as those who provide cryptocurrency trading, transfer, custody, administration, or sale on behalf of a third party. Cryptocurrency service providers will only be able to operate in the country after explicit authorization by the federal government.One rule sought to demand that such companies explicitly separate their patrimony from capital owned by customers –– for example, bitcoin the firm custodies for users. The clause sought to prevent events such as the recently seen with FTX, where user funds were commingled with the company’s funds, and help the recovery of user assets in the event of bankruptcy. It was rejected on Tuesday’s vote.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.amp/legal/brazil-approves-use-of-bitcoin-as-paymenthttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazilian-president-signs-bill-regulating-use-of-bitcoin-as-payment",

I'm not saying it'll have an effect on the current price, as I imagine it won't. However, it's definitely nice to see this instead of the normal doom, and gloom that's become normal the last couple of months.

Most users aren't prepared to learn how to safe guard their own Bitcoin, so they tend to trust the simplest, and most convenient option which is usually the exchanges. I don't think this news particularly changes anything about that?",

      "body": "According to what I’ve been reading, the law will still need six months to come into force, with a large part of the focus being placed on regulating bitcoin related service providers that can operate in within the country. What we’ve still got to see is how these laws translate into specific regulations, and how these play out.On the other hand, I haven’t been able to read anything yet on how this will impact customer-to-business (not B2B) type TXs. Although it should be something that both the business and the customer may use for their payments on a voluntarily basis (not being legal tender), for those business that do/will accept BTC et al as a payment method, and those customers willing to use it for their payments, there are no details yet on the specific regulation requirements that will need to be met by both parties. These details are what can make using bitcoin a seamless means of payment, or a burocratic pain in the ass (i.e with/without KYC, from what TX values onwards, report/no report of TXs to the country’s IRS equivalent and so forth).See (GT): https://www-criptonoticias-com.translate.goog/regulacion/ley-bitcoin-brasil-entrara-vigencia-2023-sancionada-presidente/?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

If most countries can imitate Brazil in accepting bitcoin for transactions, bitcoin will supersede fiat currency. I appreciate the president of Brazil for signing this into law immediately without a waste of time. Bitcoin should be the crptocurrency they should be using or else, some person may end up losing their investment,if they invested on alt coins. How to keep their bitcoin safe in their own wallet should be the next awareness Brazil government should give to the citizens,so that they don't keep their bitcoin in an exchange,to avoid regrets and blames.",

Isn't legal tender the same as legal recognition as a means of payment? I understand the law is not as friendly as the legislation in El Salvador, but that's on other matters like mining taxes, right? So it's crypto-related business, but not Bitcoin's recognition and regulation specifically. To me, it seems like Brazil made a big positive step forward, and it's big news for Bitcoin adoption, especially considering that the population of Brazil is 216 million people, against 6.5 million in El Salvador.",

For instance, we know Brazil is home to the most heinous of crimes there is, and I'm not talking about simple kidnapping and murder, AFAIK illegal black market trades of trafficked humans and organs are made here (correct me if I am wrong), so legalizing crypto utilization within their borders may just make the chase for these criminals extra hard. I do hope they made contingency plans for such instances, otherwise it would be as if they are turning a blind eye on these pressing issues.",
