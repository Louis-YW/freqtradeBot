So, I doubt that there is any chance to be posted the topic which has been posted by the user called Selling account. So, I think best way to stay away from any scammer is creating scam accusation as well as provide negative trust. Also creating scam accusation and negative trust is fast procedure while deleting from admin/moderator might take long time (though there is almost no chance of being deleted scam post).",

Seller is a scammer.  For some reason, They can use your account to promote a project that looks like legit and since you have a good reputation here, The project reputation will increased too which is good on attracting potential investors until they exit scam and take away those money. But 0.5BTC is indeed over price but the valuation of trusted forum account is very high if you can check on playerup website.",
