Though we all know that there must be a strict regulation for the centralized exchanges and from the exchanges, the individual users will face the rest with strict KYC. The main Bitcoin network is still anonymous. If someone send you coins , they can only trace the address but the owner is unknown unless you have used the address here and people have seen it, then we will know that you are the owner of the coin if not then nobody will no the owner. And that is the highest privacy and decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Because nobody can control your coins from you unless you have out your seed phrase to someone and the person use it to login to your wallet. Then at that moment you not the owner of the coins but the person that own the key. Bitcoin is to liberate the bondage the capitalist shackle the citizens in the world. Bitcoin has come to stay and nobody can remove it again. When you can't beat it you join. My country banned Bitcoin but now they, the government have accepted it to be used in the country, SEC was on the bottleneck of Bitcoin but finally they have approved Bitcoin ETF. Gradually Bitcoin will be used as the world digital currency.",

We can discuss about anonymity,im talking about wallet anonymity, because if bitcoin is implemented as an international currency in the end your ''anonymous'' wallet will have nothing anonymous, it will be much more traceable, it will result in extortions to people who have more bitcoin etc...because if we use it every day, to pay services etc. we are talking about receipts addressed to the ur name,and link you to your wallet pubkey.I am making a point of what side effects could happen in case that pubkeys still quite transparent when it comes to bitcoin worlwide currency, you will be in danger trust me!!We need to find a way, to put much less opacity into our pubkeys.",

I am from one of those countries that had initially placed a ban on crypto-currency but I call it a pseudo Ban because this ban never really existed even during the ban period there were many activities carried out using Crypto-currency. Truth be told it would be hard for any government to full carry out a plan to place a ban on Crypto-currency. Well Bitcoin network may be anonymous but other aspects like the centralised exchanges aren't and still people make use of the centralised system meaning they still find Bitcoin useful even if requires giving out some of their information out.",

And if you are doing nothing wrong then why you being concern about your slip up? It seems that you have describe what this criminals or supposedly if you want to hide something thru BTC.I do agree though that it gave us freedom, but there could be governments around that don't want to give that to their people.On the contrary, it's only a government that it authoritative, those freedom loving governments are allowing it legally or at least in the gray area.",

By merely sending someone you publicKey, they know who you are? If you posted your publicKey right now, would I know who you are? For most people that have more than one wallet address. There’s one they are more cautious with and another they can use for almost anything. Also, getting your info can happen with exchanges but that depends though. Isn’t of explaining I’d just say that you can avoid it by using Decentralized exchanges instead. There are Decentralized exchanges that do not require the KYC which we all fear.",

Other wallets like trust and exchanger wallets don't have such features. More reason why people worry about their balances being known.You can also decide to have multiple wallet accounts to avert the idea of someone seeing your balance through your wallet address.",

Now some important exchanges have facilitated p2p transactions so now there is ample opportunity to buy and sell all currencies including Bitcoin without any third party intervention. Transactions that are completed without the intervention of third parties are much more secure and privacy is maintained in those transactions. Not only P2P transactions but there are many other such confidential sites where a user can do Bitcoin transactions keeping all the information transaction hash secret. There is no need to give your private key to anyone in the transaction, then your private key will become public, which will never give us security. From this kind of thinking we can always think of alternatives to keep our wallet safe as well as doing other things including Bitcoin transactions with our own privacy.",

The idea of what bitcoin was back then (freedom without any laces to the institutions) , is completely differnet nowadays, i mean for one side its acceptable that the world is getting into bitcoin ,but that lead into the attention of the institutions.Different governments have diverse views about Bitcoin and they express these ideologies by the policies they enact. Last year we saw a few nations making more Bitcoin-friendly policies and hopefully, this year will be better. Last year also attracted more institutional investors to the Bitcoin space which has attracted more investors and more funds. But sadly everything that has advantages also has disadvantages. These investors are in the Bitcoin space to promote centralization, which is against the natural design of Bitcoin. Recently Gary Gensler recognised that the approval of ETF is a win for centralisation because it is against Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralization. (Gensler sees bitcoin ETF irony in light of Satoshi's mission)QuoteOther thing that concern me its the lack of privacy, you can be targeted easily , just by giving someone your pubkey, they will know how much is your balance or what exchange your movements or even the exchange what you are using .To be concise, you cant choose if you want to be fully transparent about your movements/balance or stay anonymous and protect your privacy, beacuse we all know about bitcoin and the fungibility problems(this it will be discussed in other thread).You have a choice between decentralization and centralization and nobody is forcing you to make a decision. We still have the opportunity to enjoy privacy and freedom if we avoid centralised platforms. Bitcoin has not deviated from Satoshi's original plan because there are still diverse ways to keep our keys and enjoy pseudonymity/anonymity. We cannot stop these institutional investors from joining the Bitcoin system but we choose to be free by choosing only decentralised platforms. We can also spread the message of decentralisation if we have the opportunity.",
