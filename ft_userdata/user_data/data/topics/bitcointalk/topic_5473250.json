  "content": "Heya cryptoart lovers!I wanted to explain my decision to put four of my paintings on auction this November.Since I didn't want to spam the auction threads, I decided to make another one. (if mods will let me keep it These are the auction threads:Bitcoaster: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472614.0The Bitcoin Miner: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5473099.0Etheria: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472822.0Egging on the Future: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5472359.0It's been a while since I made these paintings, 5 years or so. They were made in another phase of Bitcoin - it was 2018 and we felt the depression after the big growth of autumn, 2017.I painted the hype and promise of Bitcoin we felt then and I fought depression with everything I had. Using real gold leafs for Bitcoin, I made it obvious this had real value.I painted the rollercoaster guy in three variants to show how fun and free this new crypto world feels. I painted Andreas Antonopoulos as majestic prophet of upcoming technology and Vitalik Buterin as a centerpiece of his world of Etheria.The Bitcoin Miner showed the world a new type of worker personality and how much effort went and still goes into Bitcoin existing.And I painted Cryptoglyphs, a monument to Bitcoin's technology visualizing how exactly it works:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5065782Here in Collectibles, I teamed up with some of you most passionate collectors of everything tasty in Bitcoin.We produced wonderful art together, like Wailing of Crypto winter or Bitcoin dawn and even though some of it went sour (just simply sad Coldkey end), it was a positive and exciting ride.I want to continue that ride and find new projects and ways of collaborating for cryptoart.Because my personal life doesn't allow me painting just for my passions anymore, I sadly need to make profit from everything I work on.That's why I had a hiatus from crypto art, I got caught up in life, costs and needed to work elsewhere for stable finances.Hence these auctions. Those that have followed me since I came here will know, that I always kept the prices of my paintings solid. For this occasion I lowered them to make them more affordable!If I manage to sell some of my artworks, I'll be able to finance more crypto art production again.I've had quite a few ideas over the years, but all were time-costly and would need my attention for a while.So here it is. If anyone helps make some noise about my auctions, I'll be super happy.If you bid on my artwork, it'll make my day.¬†And as always - your comments and advice will be much appreciated and helpful.Cheers!",

I rememberwhen all your works were released, except the Cryptoglyphs i might have been away fromthe forum at that stage.
