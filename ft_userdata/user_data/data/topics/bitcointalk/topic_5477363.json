I mean more safe than a random new solo pool. You shouldn't point your miners at our pool if you don't want to, but it's good that you know that we exist in case one day you decide to give us a chance.BTCHi,Yes, our code is based in Ck Pool by @-ck. We Like it.Quote from: mikeywith on December 22, 2023, 12:48:26 AMthis is likely just the same open-source code for CKpool which you can find on bitbucket.orgWe have made some changes to both the Pool configuration and also to the bitcoin.conf file for further optimization.We will also add StratumV2 soon and we will continue to be the pool with the least fees since we selflessly maintain it.The decentralization of HashPower and the possibility of providing the opportunity for any person in the world without means, without experience, without technical knowledge,..., to also be able to mine, is our priority and always will be.0,4% fee anonymous solo BTCitcoin mining for everyone.Â BTC",
