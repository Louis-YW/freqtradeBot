If Elon Musk stop to troll about Doge, Doge price will not increase a lot, just like in 2017/2018.",

Would be good to hear some views on this - are you for or against Doge? I am not an investing expert, but my personal opinion is, that there are a lot of crypto projects out there, that have a higher chance to make a x5 or a x10 in the next bullrun than Dogecoin. First of all i think the timing to invest now into Dogecoin is pretty bad because it just made that 30% increase in terms of the price in the last few days after Musk has used the Dogecoin symbol as the Twitter logo.So as long as there are no new PR stunts that Elon Musk is doing for Dogecoin i don't really see it doing another price pump from here on out. Once a real bull market starts Dogecoin will obviously also begin to rise again but not as fast as most other altcoins in my opinion.",

Would be good to hear some views on this - are you for or against Doge? Since Elon Musk hype up doge and use this to increase the awareness of Doge coin then this is one of good coin to invest temporarily. Because for sure Elon want to do something on it like pumping it up just what happen before his action to include doge coin logo on twitter is a good indication that he is serious for creating some good hypes on this coin so its good to ride with it. But we make sure that we never over extend our expectation so that we will never get outsmarted by them and earn some profits when good time to sell came.",

I am sure with you not only dogecoin but also many other things in the market that can help you to achieve such profits. However in the case of dogecoin people are fomo a lot and I am personally quite neutral although I am also holding it, but I do not expect profits to come quickly. It's true that the hype from the influencers helps with the price increase a lot, but newbies like you should also be wary of the hype surrounding it.And if you are ready to accept the profits and risks with dogecoin, then stand your ground, do not depend too much on anyone, especially your investment.",

Well Elon indeed make a lot of scenes around it but would you just buy because Elon said so? This is a form of shilling and promotions. I would rather pick a good reliable L1 than dogecoin.

You'll not know which coin is going to be pumping by 5x to 10x. Dogecoin was done with that and I think that it won't move that much anymore. Don't believe those people that are saying that it will be $1 as if there's an assurance. Yeah, it's possible but leave it there that it's just a possibility and you don't have to be too confident that it will be there as soon as the bull run comes back.Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on April 05, 2023, 08:41:59 AMWould be good to hear some views on this - are you for or against Doge?

Would be good to hear some views on this - are you for or against Doge? It can reach that price, or it cannot.The time when it reaches $0.70 was when Elon Musk is hyping it. Reaching the price to $0.70 doesn't mean that it will reach a dollar though I'm not removing the possibility that it can.I'm into a point where I'm thinking DOGE as a good coin to invest, but not for long term. I don't know the reason why, but I'm thinking that it isn't a good long term coin to hold. It has no use case at all aside from the fact that it's a meme coin (and possible that Elon might integrate it into Twitter knowing that he is charging people 8$ for that blue tick on their name, there's a chance that he might accept DOGE into it as well).I'm not against DOGE, but I'm also not a supporter of DOGE as well. I don't see DOGE as a good long term coin to hold as well. Maybe the fact that it's supply is unlimited, and has no use case at all that's beneficial to investors are the reasons why I don't want to hold DOGE (for now).",

I have no problem with anyone investing in altcoins or memes, as long as you accept the risk and you've done your research, you can invest without anyone's advice. The money is yours, you should decide for yourself because that is the profit you will get. A lot of people don't like doge because it's much riskier, but if you can take the risk, I'm sure that if successful, you will get more profit than those who are against you. Decide for yourself, don't invest according to other people's opinions.",

There were some serious shilling that happened in a reddit group. Someone suggested Doge after an exchange or broker made a mess of their account if I am not mistaken. I think that was even before Elon made some Dog tweets. I can't remember the exact sequence of events but I can say there was a major catalyst that resulted into Doge's insane pump. Do you think there's one happening soon? I personally don't know.",

Then you are believing if doge coin has the possibility of touching it again. In my opinion, if this time is far different compared when doge coin was reaching its ATH. Elon needs to do a hardwork to create hype for doge coin unlike when any of his tweets were making people so crazy to think that if doge coin would be mooning. You shall be aware of this too. As an investor, you must be careful when investing your money unless you can afford to lose it once the price will be dumped so hard., Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on April 05, 2023, 08:41:59 AMMany say it will go past $1 next bull run and it could well do but think I would get out around $0.70 which would be a 7x if I was to invest at todays price of $0.10. Take its ATH as the sense price to be reached before expecting the price of doge coin to go even higher than it. You should not follow those people who have been losing their sense to think about which possible price to be touched by doge coin. As long as bitcoin will able to go even higher than previous ATH and it's possible to see doge coin to reach its ATH.

Dogecoin is one of the only coins that have been giving investors profits for the last 8 years, each bull markets sees huge gain in the popularity of the project and now Elon Musk is now a big fan of the memecoin.Dogecoin can get to $1 in the next bull market, so investing at the current price is still okay although I'll prefer you hold on for the price to drop. Doge coin pumped recently and need some corrections which is think can go as low as $0.065.Buying at that price would be very okay since you won't have to wait until it reaches $1 for you too make good profits. Just by reaching $0.65 which is still not the peak of last bull market, you'll be in profits already.",
