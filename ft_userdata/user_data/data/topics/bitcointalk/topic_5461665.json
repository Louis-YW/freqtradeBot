Example, I want to send specific amount of BTC to an address every week/month in regular basis without the need to open my electrum wallet.Yes, it is possible that you can automate it, but you need to write a script that checks every day, minute, hour, or week, when the balance is more than a certain amount, then something likeCode:electrum payto <address> <amount>But I do not advise you to do that, as the script will need to be connected to the Internet, and therefore the wallet will be hot.https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/tree/d3f65e24e143121e6209547d49463171af01b1a0/electrum/scripts",

I would not recommend loading a wallet on a publicly accesible server while being funded with more than pocket change.That's right but also \"automatic payment\" may mean fixed and predefined payments for example a fixed amount of bitcoin sent to a fixed address(es). In that case the transactions could be created by utilizing the transaction locktime and setting it to the date and time of the payment while each tx is in a chain meaning they each spend the output of the previous one.This way each tx can not be broadcasted or mined before its time and the online system does not need to hold the key anymore.",
