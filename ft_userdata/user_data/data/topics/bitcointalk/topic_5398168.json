Did I enabled any settings that I'm not aware?",

At first, I thought it was Bpip extension on Chrome but it's not possible to use on mobile devices that's why I opened the thread to confirm it. I preferred using it this way as I don't usually attend to PMS, it will help me quickly attend to them anytime I skipped mail notifications.Quote from: dkbit98 on May 11, 2022, 01:10:21 PMIt probably hurt you more because you wrote on that topic  You felt my pain, it is very annoying.  Thanks everyone for responses, the thread is now closed.",
