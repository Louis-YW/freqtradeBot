His main concerns was  Bitcoin's volatility.  How many times have we heard of this same story? Everyone back then said bitcoin would be worthless come a specific period of time but look at bitcoin now. It’s reached 100k when many people doubted it. Yes, it is volatile but this is not enough reason to say that bitcoin will crash in the future and end up with 0.QuoteThis man refuse to understand that the decentralized nature and Supreme security have made it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic instabilityBitcoins future is greatThese people do not use critical thinking skills.

They provably don't know what Bitcoin is so don't pay much attention on what they are saying. Since its common for people thinking about they know everything to talk  shit on something they don't like, so if you always keep buying those words they say then you might also get affected on nonsense opinion they are spreading.We all know Bitcoin is good asset and for so many times it shut the mouth of those people talks negative about it since for many years Bitcoin continue to gain massive success and support to people. Those people like him still thinking negative about bitcoin will provably left behind on good progress happening with Bitcoin.",

This man refuse to understand that the decentralized nature and Supreme security have made it an attractive hedge against inflation and economic instabilityBitcoins future is greatWatching people making imaginary comments on bitcoin always baffle me. Bitcoin is not what most people assume it to be. It's the most secure and decentralized form of money ever created. It is not like traditional currencies that government and banks can print endlessly, it has a fixed supply that makes it a true store of value. We have to admit that the future of finance is digital and Bitcoin is already leading the way. But who are we stop people from airing their views and opinions? Some of them are secret investors but want to trend by attacking bitcoin or using foul languages to attract attention while they go offline to invest in what they criticise publicly. Smh!",

Sometimes Peter Sheriff and Warren Buffett also speak anti-Bitcoin, but their words do not change much in the Bitcoin market.",

So it would be a waste of time to spend time listening to people who are still rambling that bitcoin is a scam, worthless or dying, let alone spending time arguing with them. Or they have other intentions and are just trying to manipulate us to achieve their goals. But whatever their reasons and intentions are, I think it is better to stay away from such people to avoid wasting time and instead focus on our bitcoin investment.",

They don't care about data and statistics, they are just against bitcoin and that is final. When you hear people say things like \"bitcoin was made out of nothing\" you'll know they didn't think about it critically because even fiat was created out of nothing. The difference is one has the backing of the government. So if the government says it's no longer a currency then it has no more value. I don't agree that they should be ignored. I believe their views should be countered so they don't go about deceiving people and spreading misinformation about bitcoin.",
