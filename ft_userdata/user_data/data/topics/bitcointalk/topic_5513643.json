Bitcoin mining was banned in China but presently China still has the second highest bitcoin miners. China is a country that can be used to know that nothing can ban bitcoin because of its decentralized design.I believe China doesn’t recognize Bitcoin as property or currency. While it's not illegal to hold, trading it is against the law, so there's no clear regulation on Bitcoin and crypto in China.Recently, there was news that Shanghai recognized Bitcoin as a \"unique digital currency.\" That could be the spark behind the rumors that Bitcoin might be legalized soon. It’s a small step, but it has people talking. Bitcoin gains legal recognition in Shanghai despite China's crypto ban",

But if ever things may change and China decided to legalized bitcoin, well that would be another achievement for bitcoin. Not only China will benefit from it but also the bitcoin community which means more bitcoin adoption, the bigger the community will become in the future.",

Knowing the source of the information in X will show how true the news is. I did a brief research and found nothing regarding the move to relegalise Bitcoin. However, nothing is impossible, China might want to reconsider its stance on Bitcoin. The approval of Hong Kong spot Bitcoin ETFs and the involvement of some major Chinese asset managers in business might be a sign that China is softening its strict approach to Bitcoin. An announcement by the communist government of China that Bitcoin is now accepted in the country will make this bull season a memorable one.",

China views Bitcoin as property, but unlike in the US, where it’s taxable and subject to capital gains when sold, China doesn’t tax it because trading or selling Bitcoin is illegal.However, in the event of a dispute, Chinese courts handle Bitcoin cases under their property laws, similar to real estate. If Bitcoin is stolen, it’s typically valued at the market price when the theft occurred, and if it can’t be recovered, the victim is compensated in fiat based on that value.Quote from: tranthidung on October 18, 2024, 01:51:08 PMYou can own bitcoin and government can not do anything if you did not make criminal activities, used dark money to buy bitcoin.

So, just tell them it was a gift!",

Regulations & banning orders can make it more difficult to buy & use Bitcoin but if you want something enough, you will find a way to get your hands on it.",

They are just rumors, most likely started to try and influence the price by creating positive sentiments among the community.It's difficult to effect bans on something as decentralized as Bitcoin where no one needs documents or permission to use. This is why you'll still have mining and trading going on in China today despite bans placed on it.",

I am really being bothered having this kind of news time after. However we want that whole world accept btc and legal it for using it as a worldwide currency. Btc has that potentiality to use it as currency nevertheless many government trying to banned it and restrict. This is really unfair.

China's economy is going through a very hard time where the government had to announce relief packages worth many billions of dollars twice already. Show the government is trying to increase the cash flow in the hands of their citizens. At this point, if Bitcoin is made legal as a currency, that's going to support the economy of China. It will increase the money circulation within the system and increase the purchasing power of its citizens. So it may become a reality, you never know!",

I think that it has something to do with the collapsing economy that isn't just shown in the media. After the huge hit that they've got from the real estate industry and as well as their banking industry have been delaying withdrawals and some are completely stopping depositors to withdraw their money, this is a huge step for them to make. It's unlikely that they're going to accept BTC as a currency. They've got BRICS and they want to make their own currency, RMB to be a stronger one by having that alliance and to surpass USD. So, it's better for them to stay legalizing BTC as an asset but won't accept it as a currency. That two is different but I think it all still sums up for accepting BTC no matter how they view it.",
