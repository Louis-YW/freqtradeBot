I don't really wanna bug anyone for review to merits my post but is just a simple truth I need to know that you are increasing that is to say \"Yes you are gradually changing for good\" or \"Put more efforts while making post in this section of the board\" but however, if you feels they are worth the effort being put on those posts then you can spare some merits to it and give back your ratings in this thread then I would know where to make my adjustment.

I am sure one of the reasons why you put more effort to improve your post quality is because you were criticized and corrected when you made some mistakes. This shows that you need this criticism or attacks as you call it to evaluate your performance and improve your post quality.

Sincerely speaking if this is done I think there are some people who would make corrections that's, if only such persons had zeal and passionate enough to be useful to the forum.There are no forum rules that mandate anybody to do post reviews for any rank of the forum. Merits are distributed based on the personal discretion of these merit sources. But some merit sources have given members the privileged of applying for post reviews and there are other threads where members' posts are reviewed. You can find them and apply. Not getting merit might not necessarily mean that you are not a quality poster and receiving many merit is not also a pointer that you are doing well. So don't rely on merit as your main grade for your performance. I know merit is a motivator, but don't lose your zeal and passion when it not coming the way you expect. Regarding my rating SmartGold01, you are not doing badly and I am sure in no time you will achieve your next rank. I supported you with one merit. Keep improving.",

You have the right to whatever you want, which means you will achieve everything.If not for any reason, your rating alone already given me energy to do more work and put efforts as I could remember my thread where you commented and partially I wasn't happy but I pick courage from there to keep pushing. Apparently seeing you as woman also gives me confidents to be able to scale through here as I believe you can't never undo or hurts your fellow Gender, irrespective of the color or distance but as I know and feels within and upon myself we are one family over here. So we should show and demonstrate love and give to whom that needs our help in other to encourage more of our Gender's to strive harder be it here or on our physical worlds and various places of our endeavourment. Â Truth be told, very much happy with your kind ratings knowing that you are a well recognized profile here, and just as Stalker22 do say I would also love to see his or her own part of story after getting it reviewed as promised. Hoping to get Good news from him and any other person that may spare their time to take a look at my profile and give their honest ratings. Thank you for those who spare out time to review my profile.. hoping for more as the floor is open for anyone, btw lovesmayfamilis already given me the best vibe so I feels like Joe Biden",

Thank you sir as I believe you are also a well known person over here, and for me to have a good ratings from you people simply shows I leaned to overcome some criticism and hates words. Also all the efforts and changes aren't invain so I believe to have more energy than before after hearing from you all.As per the Fillippone merits review I did applied once when I think it should be around April or so but no results or action towards it, however I didn't get discouraged as I believe there were lots of people on queue maybe it could take a year to get my turn, that why I created this for a self review from any of you that are free or can spare their little time to rate me and also if found any of my post quality enough then they can also merits them.I learnt the sceptical chemist review profile but to me it make no sense sending an unsolicited pm to such a high profile person maybe he could get offset maybe not but I believe some people don't like someone bugging them for something they knows they could easily have spare time to do it freely without attaching values to it.Like I said, I am too emotional and any wrong reply at the cost of sending pm may or might easily affect my day so, to keep my day sweet and good I don't want sent pm to someone or applying for a review directly on their thread as they had their own ways of analysis and to whatever post you may found worthy may not be that valuable to other source. Having myself attention would be more convenient and cool for me without any discrimination or having to look at my current rank as I think or have red from few people who had replied here to say, I shouldn't be that failed up or backside as they think I will surely go higher above this level I am currently. But that not withstanding I wouldn't be overwhelming with their ratings because they said \"Pride cometh before fall\" so, mentally I have to get prepared whether I chosed to develop the habit of reading and learning it all leads to credibility and positivity to my knowledge bank. Whatever that is classified as bank is place where resources are being stored., Hence I can say if I improved definitely there will be resources at my later end but that doesn't show the end of a woman because whomever that is alive today are pron to continuously learning and that is one thing we are striving today to get more involved, knowledge and take good care of our families irrespective of whatever angle and area maybe field of study we might find ourselves we keep pushing to avart being penurious in our line of history and generations.Although I know that we are in a nation where their leaders do not utimostly care about her citizens but we the inhabitants keeps survive as we believe the world is place called \"Survival for the fittest\" in other words I can say only the king of the jungle lives and will over to the entire kingdom. Well I rest my case as I believe that my boss JayJuanGee is yet to speak to my life performance over here, although I never fully depends on him but got inspiration from him and some other users I love reading their posts.",

I know there are instructions for them to follow maybe so I say is my kind of nature to give people attention and know about their wellbeing, maybe with this my mindset you have it at the back of you that I have involved myself with so much worries but, however I am not in a haste for anything rather to get my wisdom bank filled with knowledge, and having to come encountered with bitcoin is the greatest knowledge I've gained so far because it's now a way of life and trends which every young female out there needs to know.",

Some criticism might be too harsh to take as such but let that not discourage but rather build your confidence more. We are raised from different places and culture, you canâ€™t tell how some people can relate message to people and they feel itâ€™s normal which is not. You can as well access yourself from the number of posts youâ€™ve made and how many mods have deleted to be low quality or spam, if thereâ€™s a big ratio between that, Iâ€™ll like to say congratulations and be happy for yourself as youâ€™re doing great job and contribution to the forum. I also admire your dedication and contribution to the local board, youâ€™re doing great, so keep it up SmartGold01.",

Be yourself regardless of how you introduce yourself in the forum through your knowledge and the quality of your posts, it is much better than you being the user that other people want you to be.",
