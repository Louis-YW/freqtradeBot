Most likely he's lying. Have you tried showing him that the address he's given you is owned by an exchange? Perhaps he will say that he's also using Kucoin but I know the exchange assigns a unique address for each of their users so he  can't really use that as an excuse. If he's claiming that he really owns that much coins then that's already a sign of a scammer. Don't enter into a transction with that person.",

Correct. I am very certain that it is a scam attempt directed at you.Quote from: sima_sara on April 03, 2023, 02:52:39 PMcan I ask him to transfer worth of few dollars to my wallet to prove ownership?  The way to prove ownership of an address is to use a signed message. In that way, it won't requires to transfer fund to establish ownership, but by simply creating a message which signed by the address itself.I don't know what kind of transaction you are going to conduct, but since you give incomplete information, just be wary of a scam attempt",

There's a chance if he send his coin to your address, Kucoin use the address listed on the link as the sender address and you will believe if he's own the address, while the truth isn't. This mean send few dollars to your wallet still not able to prove ownership.",

That's why you are asking about to him, for this for the verify of his word.Sign Message the only way to prove that, he own the address by making sign message under the address with his name—however, my advice since you want to transaction P2P better to use a middle man.One of the important rules, in the internet transaction no matter how much the money. Use MM, for your safe security.",
