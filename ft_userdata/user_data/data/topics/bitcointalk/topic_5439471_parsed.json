      "body": "Thank you very much for sharing your track record here, it may be a good source of inspiration for other bettors to make picks on some sports, leagues or teams they are not aware of and to try the sportsbooks you are using. But I don't understand what means 2:1 and 4:1 in your picks. It's just the final score of the match?You are already in profit with 2 bets above 2.00 that's a nice start.",

Why don't you start as a tipster here? I guess you would be able to get some good amount; worth a try, isn't it?",

I think it would not be bad in the first thread post to have something like a summary table or a kind of green and red counter, where data on the total amounts of winning and losing bets would be updated, and since we are not talking about amounts here, the resulting profit or loss can be omitted, so that the overall picture of your track record would be visible.

Do you research your picks or pick by your gut? Just curious what makes you make your choices and if you do research? Not asking for any negative reason, just a little curious if I want to follow.My predictions are based on my model which is looking for value odds. It's much easier and better results can be achieved with soft bookies like B365, Will Hill, etc but I decided to go the hard way and beat sharp bookies like Pinnacle or Betfair.I am mostly interested in your NBA/NCAA picks if I decide to follow. Obviously you make no guarantees, but I seen a couple sharp picks in your past results and may take a gamble on you. Good luck with todays bets.",

If the OP showed a predictive ability that consistently gave profitable results and someone wanted to pay for it, it would be a free deal between individuals.

Picks are based on my own model and I am trying to do my best to find the best picks with value in odds.Feel free to join my Telegram channel if you don't want to miss picks.I am just curious here, how many years you've been in sports betting?As you have several sports that you are following with, does it mean, you are familiar with all the athletes involved in those sports?Because you will only be at least comfortable with your picks if you are well-informed with these athletes.You have your own reasons why you are picking certain team or athlete for a given match, because as a sportsbettor, you should haveenough reasons why you are picking a certain team to win. Don't know if you will continue sending free signals via your telegram channelor would later on, charge these followers for a certain fee, when you think you have more than enough of sharing your picks.For sure, you have your reasons why you are doing this for free as of the moment. But let us see how long can you share your thoughts when it comes to sportsbetting.",

Dang that's long and with that duration, no doubt that you already learned a lot of things but I think there are some who can't be convinced with that unless if you show some proof or some kind of certification at least? You said who will care if how you choose your bets?The people who will use those bets of course. They are only making sure that those bets are well crafted and not just came from a random thought. You may not care about it because maybe you are not playing the actual game but you are only posting here if you think will win and maybe if some of those guesses were correct, you will ask for some donations or tips.",
