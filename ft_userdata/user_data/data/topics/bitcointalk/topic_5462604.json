You can see it across the many conflicts that we've had throughout the history of Bitcoin. However, the extent of their influence only goes so far. Each individual in Bitcoin has their own say over what they want Bitcoin to be; if they don't want a certain aspect of Bitcoin but the rest of the network wants it, they can use a fork of it that follows the older rules or an alternative path.It is very much akin to a system of actors where game theory applies heavily in the decision making of Bitcoin. No single entity can control Bitcoin, and everyone has a say in what they want Bitcoin to be. However, it is centralized by the fact that you still have pools and hordes of miners that are aligned with their own goals. That is inevitable.",

Remember the conspiracy that the US government is involved in funding rebellions in Central and South America? Turned out to be true and they're funded through drug trafficking, they even discredited the investigative reporter that uncovered the conspiracy and even staged his suicide. It's a bit of both though, either you're pretentious about your argument because you don't know how to properly argue your points and you end up berating the person who talks about those conspiracy thinking you're high and mighty or you're just blissfully ignorant.",

Which one is actually quite hard to say right now.Yes, Bitcoin is decentralized to an extent. There is still a power hierarchy within the ecosystem which gives more influence to those who either own more coins or have control over hashing power. It's not flawlessly decentralized though it is in the sense that the ledger can not be modified, and probably won't be able to be modified with the current power structure.Though, to criticize bitcoin and to still use the fiat money system is quite contradictory. Fiat will always be worse than Bitcoin, even if there are ulterior motives behind Bitcoin that we are not aware of.",

Â If you help secure the chain by mining or running a non-mining node to validate and relay transactions, you have a limited amount of influence over consensus. Â The code you are running will help determine what the rules of the network are. Â Developers only have influence over consensus if people decide to run any new code which allows rules to change. Â If any developers were to write code with rule changes which didn't meet the approval of those securing the blockchain, users can simply choose not to run that code. Â If no one runs code, it doesn't do anything. Â When anyone claims that developers control consensus, they clearly don't understand this fact. Â Or, they do understand it and claim users are merely \"sheep\" and \"fanboys\" who run the code without thinking, because they have no real arguments. Â Please ignore such obvious trolling. Â Some people just can't accept when their ideas were weak and no one shared their view of what Bitcoin ought to be.Some believe consensus means that everyone has to agree. Â This is false. Â If a majority of network participants decide to move on, they can and will leave those who resist behind. Â If a small minority were able to block or filibuster proposed changes, it would give individuals too much power and pose a threat to decentralisation. Â If anyone tries to tell you that changes to the protocol can only occur if they personally agree with it, understand that their mindset is dangerous and poses a serious risk to network governance. Â Dictators have no power here and we must always be vigilant to ensure this remains the case.
