You can see it across the many conflicts that we've had throughout the history of Bitcoin. However, the extent of their influence only goes so far. Each individual in Bitcoin has their own say over what they want Bitcoin to be; if they don't want a certain aspect of Bitcoin but the rest of the network wants it, they can use a fork of it that follows the older rules or an alternative path.It is very much akin to a system of actors where game theory applies heavily in the decision making of Bitcoin. No single entity can control Bitcoin, and everyone has a say in what they want Bitcoin to be. However, it is centralized by the fact that you still have pools and hordes of miners that are aligned with their own goals. That is inevitable.",

Remember the conspiracy that the US government is involved in funding rebellions in Central and South America? Turned out to be true and they're funded through drug trafficking, they even discredited the investigative reporter that uncovered the conspiracy and even staged his suicide. It's a bit of both though, either you're pretentious about your argument because you don't know how to properly argue your points and you end up berating the person who talks about those conspiracy thinking you're high and mighty or you're just blissfully ignorant.",

Which one is actually quite hard to say right now.Yes, Bitcoin is decentralized to an extent. There is still a power hierarchy within the ecosystem which gives more influence to those who either own more coins or have control over hashing power. It's not flawlessly decentralized though it is in the sense that the ledger can not be modified, and probably won't be able to be modified with the current power structure.Though, to criticize bitcoin and to still use the fiat money system is quite contradictory. Fiat will always be worse than Bitcoin, even if there are ulterior motives behind Bitcoin that we are not aware of.",
