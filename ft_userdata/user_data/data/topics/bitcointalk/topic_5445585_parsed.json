The aes.json file won't contain it no matter how well you decrypt it without a password. You'll only corrupt the file itself.",

      "body": "The first thing I would do before trying anything else would be to make a couple of back ups of your wallet.aes.json file.So you can log in to your blockchain.com account by resetting the password via email? Does your account show your coins?If not, then as above, your only option will be to break the password for your wallet file. I would also suggest using btcrecover to do this. If, as you say, there are 10-20 possible passwords, then this will be very easy to do. If those passwords don't work, then you'll need to create a tokens file to try variations on those passwords to try to brute force the real password. We can talk you through how to do that if it comes to that.",
