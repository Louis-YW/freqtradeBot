The supply of Wrapped Bitcoin on the Fantom network is too limited. The current supply is 1000 BTC, and only one address holds 500 BTC. We have a list of the holder's addresses, and it's public. I would like to know which one is your address. I do not see any address that holds 64 Bitcoins. Please share your address unless you are just a scammer trying to scam forum members. Â  This is a bad try",

Made the announcement on Bitcointalk but wants the deal to be done over telegram. This is rather unserious and fishy to me. This is typical of scammers. Since they do not have any chance of a real deal, they didn't even feel if someone wanted to exchange, what method they could offer? They didn't think it because they were not going to give the clients anything. Telegram is scammers paradise. I have seen this quote somewhere. They can delete the account, change the name, and handle it anytime they want, which is why they use telegram.

I will be damned if he does that.He won't be able to do that. There are no addresses that hold 64 Bitcoins. There are only 37 holders, and three of them hold 982 Bitcoin, which is 98.2% of the supply. The rest of the addresses hold less than 18 Bitcoins. So, how the hell can he have 64 Bitcoins? You can check the holder's addresses and the amount they hold; https://ftmscan.com/token/0x1e1fdb53451c5262a5ba449271789c7f551a9142#balances",
