Trading can confuse you that you want to be depressed but if one is finding it difficult you can take a break and relearn yourself by correcting the mistakes that you have made and your coming back will be better",

So if you're just a beginner you should have to expect the you will experience a couple of loses in trading and sometimes what you didn't expect to happen will happen. There are days that you will be in a very stressful situation and you should keep fighting and focus on your goal in trading. Always remember not to force trade especially if your emotion is in control. No matter what happens, always follow your trading plan and risk management.",

You can lose money and keep losing money if you are careless.The best thing to do is to learn to trade very well before trading and you can start off with a demo account so that you will not lose money.Again, trading is not for everyone.

If someone keeps making same silly mistake and he knows it everytime he is on trade and eventually losses his money and it repeats again and again everytime he comes back, what he needs is emotional courage to get on strong and to correct that single mistake. If we read the story of some traders, it is always like that, they never got it right even in two years of trading. Some of the big traders where disregarded by their family because they believed in themselves and got the final touch that revolutionized their trading story. It is about the persons conviction and not what we advise them to quit after two years of losses.",

And those who give up after a few defeats are the real losers and have wasted experience. But those who continue to experience defeat on an ongoing basis then they are people that cannot learn from experience.Well, when I was still trading, I experienced a lot of defeats. But I made the defeat a valuable lesson that I made as material for me to examine more deeply. I researched the causes of my defeat and I found various kinds of flaws in my previous strategy. and I started fixing it. And every time I experience defeat then I repeat the previous steps. That is studying the cause of the fatigue. So I continue to perfect my trading strategy. So that I can survive as a day trader until now. And can provide for my family. But to be honest in trading nothing is perfect with continuous profit. Because I personally sometimes experience defeat. It's just that the number of profits must be greater than the number of losses. So we have to maintain the profit percentage to be much higher than the loss percentage.I believe everyone can do it if they keep learning and don't give up. It's just that we must not be careless and hasty in learning everything. We must study it slowly and carefully.",

It is one thing to start trading and another thing to start trading right. A big part of why some new traders loose within their first months of trading is because they were not patient enough to start trading right, they hurried into trading without enough knowledge and no borrowed experience.",

Quiting is not the better way for us to leave the market because we are becoming a loser. A loser today can become a winner tomorrow that is why we need to work and learn the way others are using to keep making profits. We need to make profits for us to be a winner. Those that are winning now are the ones we are celebrating and no one cares about those time when you are hustling and working hard to be a better trader.

Trading is not what you start and you will be expecting profit immediately. Most beginners always lose money when they start learning how to trade. It happened to me when I also started trading. I learned how to trade in a hard way because I had no one close to me to guide me. I was learning how to trade from videos I watched on YouTube and pdf books, which wasn’t really easy for me. I wanted to give up, but I was lucky I didn’t give up then. I know trading is not really easy, but if you are dedicated to learning how to trade, then you will definitely learn it.",

The ones who make some good money as a newbie at the start will think that they are great and after a while they will lose all of it, it is just not that possible unless you started at the greatest moment of bull run.There were some people who bought Doge at the bull run because of Elon Musk, and made a ton of money, and thought they were great traders, if they kept going, they all lost their money. I think that should be an important thing to realize, and I would guess that it will not be a simple one one the long run neither, it is just not happening at the moment.",

In fact, most of the traders are even losing and this isn't just for those folks thinking that they can quickly cash money unless they've been here for so long and are already experienced. But honestly speaking, those beginners that are starting to trade, if you're thinking of doing this as a business, you'll have to go through a lot of losses before you'll actually start making money. It may be harsh and hard but that's really the process of trading don't be too gullible with those people sharing their wins if they are not even sharing their losses.",

As a noob then you are really that prone or susceptible when it comes to lots of mistakes and errors basing up on the knowledge you do have which is really that lacking or not sufficient but until the time comesthat you do able to acquire those things then for sure you would really be starting out to see the relevance and sustainability towards this unpredictable space.One we do decide on being a trader then self acceptance and perseverance and patience would really be playing a big role. You should have that control of emotions on which it wont really be leading youinto that kind of option on which you would be quitting just because you cant bare out on the risks. You wont really be seeing yourself getting progressed if you do have this kind of quality.",
