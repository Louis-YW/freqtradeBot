  "content": "Developers have gone far in research on how we can conviniently store our \"Private Keys or Seed Phrase Encoded with Colours\" in recent times, this new way can be introduced through colour paintings in our homes or anything that we often see or make use of around us, this was made in addition to several ways whereby our keys can be properly stored without missing them or loosing them to third parties who may use them to attack us and steal our bitcoin, colours are generated to represent each encode seed phrase using the techniques as explained by the image below.https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1678103284140109825?t=c0DurNoXeK0n1Wcz77EZjA&s=19I've heard about many means through which we can safekeep our our private keys/seed phrase such as using engraved washers, metallic sheath encryption, laminated paper and other personal means we can device for storing them privately, Â I will like to hear our personal view on painting colours as described by \"Lancoleman Mnemonic Tools\" from the above diagram, if it can also serve as an additional efforts or means to have our keys secured with maximum security or there are likely vulnerabilities to the use of this newly introduced colour paintings for encoding private keys.",
