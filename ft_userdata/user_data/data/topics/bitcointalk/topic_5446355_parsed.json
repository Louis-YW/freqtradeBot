  "content": "Just announced a few hours ago that Johnriel Casimero will be fighting against an unknown opponent (at least to many) and his name is Fillipus Nghitumbwa. Per below boxing record, his resume is not impressive so i think this will be a walk in the park for Quadro Alas.This fight may not be so exciting to some users here but for us coming from the PH, Quadro Alas fighting in his country is a big thing as we seldom see him fight in the PH when he become a world champion.Nghitumbwa for his part has not fought on foreign land and he got not much experience with only 13 fights but still hoping that he could give Casimero a competitive fight.What do you guys think of this fight?",

Although his opponent's record isn't scary, Casimero still needs to work hard in training and should not underestimate him. As we all know, upsets can happen anytime in boxing.Hopefully, his next fight will be a championship fight. Let's watch this!By the way, where will this fight be held?",

While Inoue is recovering from an injury, Casimero is challenging himself by staying active in the ring. This is a good sign that he will be successful in the new division. To reach his goals, he needs to be consistent in winning.I'll search for some highlights of Nghitumbwa on YouTube since he is an unknown fighter to me.",

His last fight was a huge joke and it was really a misfortune for him to not finish that fight in TKO because he was clearly winning the fight but the Japanese know how to act as if he was hurt. I think this time he needs more focus to finish this opponent so that it will become his ticket to take a more serious fighter in this weight division.",

I watched several fights of the two just on youtube, this is really a mismatch fight. Nghitumbwa has the habit to drop his hands, he really will end up lying on the ground. While both are aggressive fighter, Casimero is more experienced and can just absorb whatever Nghitumbwa throws.",

His first fight in this division is not so good and then they are looking for some challenge and this is what they got for him?In any case, yeah, a fight is still a fight. Hopefully, he will be impressive here and make a statement win and show that he still got it so that he will get the respect the deserves and fight for a world title or at least a solid opponent next.",

It may seem a walk in the park but if he won't prepare for this fight, and just take it for granted,his opponent may see this as a challenge and sincerely prepare for this upcoming fight.Even if his opponent has no name yet, it will be his motivation to beat Casimero even if Casimero is in his home turf.The bookies may list this a week before the fight as there's no belt on the line, and seems a small time boxing event.This may be a determining fight for Casimero where he is now in terms of how prepared he is to face with much bigger names in his weight division.",

Though I don’t see this as an easy match between this two boxer since his opponent also have a good record of KO despite of being unpopular, maybe be is also taking advantage of this so he can be know worldwide. Exciting match for Casimero, will surely place a bet to him in support to this fight.",

But I do agree that he shouldn't take this fight lightly and be overconfident. And we wanted to see that brandish style of his again, willing to go toe to toe if needed just to get that huge knockout win.And just for the record, Casimero is now being handled by Treasure Boxing Promotion a Japanese based boxing company.https://twitter.com/TB_PROMOTION/status/1639854524285468674",

Casimero has got his reputation and has titles and that's why this is a good experience for his opponent and whether the results go accordingly to Nghitumbwa or not. Still, he's managed to get into a fight against Casimero. He has lesser experiences and Casimero's fight gonna give him the hardest probably on his entire career but this will put him on an upperhand on his career path. What do you think guys? Do you agree with what I think as this could really open more opportunities to Nghitumbwa after this match and he's gonna benefit more regardless of the decision?",
