War is inevitable but as much as possible I wouldt rely on that aspect. It can boost the currency of bitcoin but that isnt good way to boost it. Though it will literally help increases as investment on shares or stocks might flop due to war and tend to crypto instead as hedge fund. But a no no no.",

If others are predicting that it will be 5 million dollars per bitcoin, and of course before that happens, it will take several decades, and we don't know if we're still alive, then now you say it will be 1 billion dollars per bitcoin.As you said, are you sure that all the banks will buy Bitcoin immediately? You must have a credible source link to hold on to so that other people believe what you are fighting for, even though I know that is just your assumption.",

Remember that most of the world's banks are located in the US and Europe, while 20-25% of them operate in Asia and other regions.Your prediction is so impractical because if a war starts between Europe and the US, not only banks will be affected. Most of the BTC nodes and Mining rigs are also placed in these two countries, so they will be affected by this war too. This means we might see fewer miners on the blockchain network but transactions might exceed the normal usage. Because banks will be closed and to make transactions they have to use something. However, due to fewer processing systems in the BTC blockchain, the network will become congested.And we have to wait so long for our transactions to be confirmed. But in this scenario, the price of BTC will increase but it is so unlikely for BTC to reach 1$ billion because 1$ billion is not an easy target even if there starts a war and everything goes like you said, BTC will not touch that target.",

Remember that most of the world's banks are located in the US and Europe, while 20-25% of them operate in Asia and other regions.If 1 BTC is worth $1 Billion then the number of billionaires on earth will increase just like the number of millionaires are increasing now. And the upper people sitting in finance don't want it because they don't want lower class people to go up using this technology even if many already reached the step of $1 million dollar using this technology but the gap between $1 million to $1 billion is not small.There is no way that BTC could reach that point because to touch that point millions, billions, trillions of money should be added in BTC's market cap. As of today market cap is around $815 billion and in my opinion, the market cap should be around $20 trillion for BTC to touch the $1 billion target per coin. And gaining a $20 trillion market cap is not an easy thing. In the war other than banks many other sectors of life will also be destroyed and not to mention that most of the nodes are in these regions and if the electricity is gone due to war and no internet will be provided or if mining machines will be destroyed in the war, then the network will become more congested and speed will be slower than before.",

The adoption is increasing everyday, individuals, corporate organizations and countries are accepting it because it's a valued asset. I think perhaps what  the OP meant was if there is financial instability in Europe and America, bitcoin will hit $1billion, it shouldn't be because of war, because no reasonable person will want bitcoin to dominate because of war. Bitcoin and fiat can coexist, no need for one to extinct so the other will dominate.",

You could also be wrong. Before Bitcoin will hit $1 billion it's not going to happen so suddenly. Bitcoin doesn't need a war between US and Europe for it to sell for $1 billion, if at any time it the future it's actually the time that Bitcoin will get the price you mentioned, it will without war. War is not good, it can have bad effect in the life or people both children and adult and it can also disrupt the economy at that moment. Even if such an unforseen occurrence takes place bitcoin might not even get to the price you are mentioning.",
