  "content": "Hello there , i am trying to create my solo miner FOR FUN and the nano chance to win (i know it wont happen)i am using my pc cpu i know the whale world say it's a waste of time and effort but what if i can manage to obtain a 0.001% chance just by using that cpu ?i am using solo.ckpool.orgso, for now i have successfully connected to stratum and obtained the data prevhash = 3039670f966d8851b7bf7a8c6a790a2a9461ca5d0004ec230000000000000000coinb1    = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxmrkl = version = 20000000my questions are1- the prev hash received is reversed should i reverse it back to original to create header or it will be appended as it is?2- are coinb1,mrklbranches,version , bits and time reversed as well or they are in correct order ?3- i know i have to reverse merkleroot after creating it , should i reverse the full header or just the merkleroot ?4- extranonce2 from my study and search i should random it , is that correct or its a fixed number ? and if randomized can i use the job id as extranonce2?5- every minute the stratum sends me a new job with same prevhash should i add the branches to the prev ones or can i ignore that and continue working6- the padding string included in the hash calculations or we add it after hash found ?        padding string which is \"0000008000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000080020000\"7- should i reverse the hash found to check the target or compare it as it is ? (\"should i log it starting with 19 zeros or ending with them?) 8- is there any test block data i can use to test my codes?my pseudo as for now1 connect to pool and authorize2 from received (mining.subscribe) extract ExtraNonce1 and ExtratNonce2_size3 randomize ExtratNonce2 and save it as required size4 from received (mining.notify) if not cleanJob ignore else extract the job data as Job5 from Job extract job difficulty and calculate target6 extract the rest Job info and start the mining process7 coinbase_bin = coinb1+extranonce1+extranonce2+coinb28 coin_b_hash = double hash coinbase_bin9 foreach x branch in merklebranches mrklRoot=coin_b_hash+x and double hash that10 reverse mrklRoot11 job_data=networkVersion + PreviousHash + mrklRoot + NetworkTime + NetworkBits; (All as recieved without reversing)12 create nonce 13 toHash=job_data+nonce+padding14 hash = double hash toHash15 if hash>target goto 1216 submit work (username,job_id,extranonce2,NetworkTime,nonce)thanks in advance",

      "body": "Thank you all (no one replied !!!!!!!!!!!!   )i got it anyway by keeping to try several thingsi think this will be the first really and fully working C# stratum solo bitcoin miner (at least for my searching for a month)answers for my questions in case anyone would like to know1- yes i have to reverse prevhash by 4 then when calculating header reverse it by byte2- not sure yet but most likely they are not coz version, bits and time are not  3- no only the mrklRoot4- yes extranonce2 is increment field so you can randomize it , and no you can not use jobId because its incremental variable5- you can ignore the job updates or you can start over a new job but branches do not added they will be a complete new and updated old branches6- no 7- yes hash found must be reversed to compare it with target8- there are too many just go to any blockchain explorer and extract data from any blockNow my new task is to create merkle branches from waiting transactions , so my next questions are1- what is the coinbase address or string as sender to my address2- will the amount be the reward only (6.25) or should i calculate fees and add them to the amount?",
