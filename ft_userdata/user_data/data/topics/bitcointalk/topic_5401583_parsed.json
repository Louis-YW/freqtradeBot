      "body": "A private sale in which anyone can participate is a public sale. Although I'm a little wary of a few things about this project:There is no support for launchpad, the tokens are sold directly on the site, where there is no guarantee that exit scam won't happen and the domain won't get shut down at some point, as it often happens with unknown projects;There is no specifics in the roadmap, it's too short and crumpled, no documentation, much less a whitepaper;Faces from the Management section... it feels like they were just copied from different projects, here, for example, some of the faces are taken from here https://aplfintech.com/team/",
