His tireless efforts and uniques work played a vital role  to alleviate poverty in the world. There are so many financial capacity people in the world that made it through Bitcoin investment especially those that have earlier invested in Bitcoin between 2009 and 2010 when the price was drastically very low.Introducing Bitcoin is one of the best thing that has happened to the world and I must say that the role of Bitcoin to enhance the economic performance of the world cannot be overemphasize and we cannot appreciate Satoshi enough for his wonderful innovation.Thank you Satoshi and happy 16th anniversary to Bitcoin.",

Happy Birthday BitcoinYes, it has been posted earlier today but in a wrong place of the forum. There isn't much point to having it posted in Meta, is it?And if you search for \"Happy Birthday Bitcoin\" in topic titles, guess what, you find a lot of such topics with titles not specifying any year of occurrance or anniversary count. So, somewhat double posting? I assume nobody cares.Though we might have to wait until 18:15:05 UTC, I'll chime in now: yay, happy birthday, Bitcoin!Some data lore with respect to Genesis block's watch-only descriptor:Code:combo(04678afdb0fe5548271967f1a67130b7105cd6a828e03909a67962e0ea1f61deb649f6bc3f4cef38c4f35504e51ec112de5c384df7ba0b8d578a4c702b6bf11d5f)#gvgcz9wtAs of 2025-01-03T15:48:27Z (UTC) above Genesis block descriptor \"got\" 48234 UTXOs including the coinbase transaction, totalling to 100.30407003BTC plus 3415sats pending (unconfirmed) of which 50.30407003BTC could be spendable if one had the private key.The largest \"donation\" to the Genesis block was a whopping 26.91679286BTC at blockheight 824513, worth at that time approx. $1,174,030. My node received the transaction at 2024-01-05T18:51:49Z (UTC) and the block confirmation at 2024-01-05T19:00:34Z (UTC).Since some time there's almost no day without some people throwing some coins \"at the Genesis block\", bloating the UTXO set as it's highly highly unlikely that the spendable coins will ever be moved again.

      "body": "Sixteen years ago, a mysterious man pioneered electronic money that could be transferred from one person to another without requiring third parties, but more importantly, money that would not require trust in a central planner to work. Before that, only gold could be considered the only alternative to fiat currency, and would be very imperfect. For thousands of years, money was flawed and against individual property rights. January 3rd must be celebrated as the day that money was fixed.",
