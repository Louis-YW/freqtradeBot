I suggest you to use binance/kucoin p2p service for performing such activities. Its fast and secure for both parties.Quote from: alterra57 on April 19, 2023, 09:27:55 PMYou send the money first.Escrow accepted.SEPA is reversible.

I've been taking SEPA payments for a couple of years now and there are conditions that must be met for senders to ask for a reversal. Anyways, to kind of make it more secure I immediately buy crypto with it and so far it's been working. Also never had anyone ask for their money back but you never know.",
