  "content": "Here are 5 ways:Negotiating entry level salaries is no joke. This is because you are coming from a place of noexperience.For you as an entry level, you are confused as to the range of figure to state.Should I go high? What if am shooting my self in the leg and the company can not afford it?Should I go low? What if they are paying other people higher and I am made mockery of?I have been in these two situations.One, I called a figure so low that the HP had to ask me to restate the expected salary figureagain. Two, I called a figure so high that the silence after stated my figure was so deep and knew immediately I am not getting the job.I am not sharing this from a place of expertise as there's no fixed salary to ask at every point in time.But I would give you a few tips to negotiating that may guide you in taking the right decisions.1. Don't go into salary negotiation without being armed with information:This specifically was shared by our members on Wednesday. Arm yourself with information, no matter how little about the salary range of the company. Then, you can argue from a place of knowledge. You can avoid making the mistakes made when armed with information.2. know what you bring to the table:It is crucial for you to know exactly what you bring to the table and negotiate from a place of value. This is why equipping yourself with skills is crucial. You find you are able to negotiate for higher figures when you are certain of the value you bring.3. Be Confident in Negotiation:If this is the only thing you take from today. Let it be. It is important to approach salary negotiations with confidence. This means being assertive while maintaining a professional and respectful demeanor.4. Consider Non-Salary Benefits too:There are some jobs you should take up, not because of the salary but because of the perks thatcome with it.Our speaker on Wednesday said she took a $75 entry level job because she was able to get Tech certifications easily. If the job has other perks than salaries such as intense Learning on the job, you may be willing to consider other non-salary terms.5. Be willing to negotiate:Contrary to what is said about being insistent on a particular figure, I would advice you to bewilling to negotiate. You may understand the employer's perspective and be willing to makeconcessions.Finally, don't tremble when stating the figure.
