  "content": "Hi guys, coming through with a rather odd question this morning.So, i was looking up on Wikipedia the meaning of Money Laundering , and below is a quote of how the site defined the term \"Money Laundering\"QuoteMoney laundering is the process of illegally concealing the origin of money, obtained from illicit activities such as drug trafficking, corruption, embezzlement or gambling, by converting it into a legitimate source. It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime.So, after i saw that Gambling was mentioned or listed among the listed illicit activities through which money can or could be laundered, I can't help but wonder if gambling is actually an illicit activity.Wikipedia did not mention gambling being an illicit activity in their definition of  gambling here, why then did they mention gambling as one of illicit activity through which money laundering can be carried out?Please check this out and share your thoughts.",

Talking about gambling as a money laundering activity, I think it is possible that what Wikipedia means is a means by which people can launder money there. but as you know and other people also know, it is not easy to launder money in casinos, your account and money can be frozen if you are caught.I don't consider this as something that can be said to be a prohibited activity, instead I consider gambling only as a means and activity for fun games, a kind of entertainment and nothing more than that, but everyone may have their own views so I'm just saying from my point of view. .",

We've seen this so most of crypto based casinos today, KYC and at least their is a betting requirements before you can withdraw your money.And if you go to landbased casino, I will always think of those whales or heavy bettors that I witnessed and think where did these guys are getting their money? I mean they will bet big without blinking an eyelash. And me thinks that he could be some drug lords because he doesn't care about the money win or lose and most likely he like to mix his money and later withdraw it.

This is why there are community that will really be getting that bad impressions or looks towards gambling which its that normal that it would really be alwaysthat bad.",

But in countries where gambling is not banned, it can not be considered as illegal activity. I think this is the best response to this question. What I suppsed they are explaining is the fact that people can use gambling sites to move money through the back-door.  Some companies allow withdrawal from means differrent from that of deposit and this is where the opportunity to deposit money, play one or two games either win or loss, then withdraw through another means and the money will be untraceable. I know some companies have come up with rules to mitigate this such as ensurering that certain percentage of the deposited funds must be used in playing gamble before the balance withdrawn. In that case, users can not just deposit snd withdraw.

Gambling, in many jurisdictions, is not an illicit activity as long as it is regulated by the government or other authorized bodies. However, unregulated or unauthorized gambling can be considered illicit. Here in our country, for example, gambling isn’t entirely illegal. There are forms of gambling that are authorized by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR). However, any form of gambling not authorized by PAGCOR is considered illegal. Laws such as Republic Act (R.A) 9287 denounce illegal number games and serve as the country’s law against illicit online gambling.https://justicesnows.com/illegal-gambling-in-philippines/",

Though I guess the general idea of society about gambling is rather negative, I believe society has changed radically enough to identify it as not. At least, without involving some cultural aspects and whatnot, but rather from a general point of view. I'd argue that the reason it was included was that gambling can be seen as illegal in some countries after all, so they just chose a general idea that would fit those who would be affected if it was portrayed positively/negatively and in this case, I guess portraying it negatively won out.

Obviously, they can't list everything illegal out there. As for gambling being an illegal activity, it depends on local laws and regulations. In many jurisdictions, there are legal gambling activities, such as state lotteries, licensed casinos, and online betting platforms. These get watched closely by regulators.  But other areas completely ban all gambling or unregulated betting making it against the law. So it varies place to place whether gambling gets you dirty money or not.",

It's because of this kind of activity that some people would like to wash their money through them and just get out with the same money as they deposited. I think that's the term for it \"washed money\". They need to clean it up especially if those bills are marked or should've been listed somewhere else. There's a movie about this \"Den of Thieves\" where the money they will try to steal are those that will be shredded and so it is clean money. It's not about gambling but it's a good explanation of why people are trying to wash their money and the evil ones trying to get the cash that is already in circulation in exchange for their unclean ones. Gambling is illegal if not registered in one country because there's no way they can regulate it and if cash is flowing there without the government tracking it then they might arrest innocent people who will be holding those illegal money without knowledge about it.",

Some places consider this illegal, let alone using it.

This is why the government is very serious with casinos regulations, because they knew that right from day one many illegal activities are been carried out by those running casinos, and that's why they mandatory KYC requirements too.It's why some countries will never accept gambling activities among it's people, they believe it's a very harmful habit, they failed to approve gambling when they know that they can make some money from the it and use the fund on the country, but it seems they care more for their citizens, like Cyprus and Cambodia.",
