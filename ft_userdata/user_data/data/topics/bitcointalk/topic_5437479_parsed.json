I am pretty sure that the same person is behind these accounts, but I would like to get confirmation from other members as well.User coinpools offer Stripe account monetization service. classically, newbie accounts suddenly appear who are very satisfied with his service. when I was writing him a reply, I noticed that all three \"different\" users have the same way of writing. Despite the fact that they did not say much, one thing is obvious, leaving a space before the comma.Accounts:coinpoolsaleealex423makmanamanthere are still no proven elements of fraud here, but I am thinking about the negative tagging of these accounts.",

      "body": "It's a common scheme in the marketplace sections, where users use new accounts in order to give those reading the thread a false perception on whether the service/product is legitimate. So, yeah this isn't unheard of. Although, stronger evidence would be preferred to negative tag them. However, I imagine you'll find a lot of users willing to neutral tag them based on this. Ultimately, it's up to you what you do with the trust system. Although, you're somewhat right; the space before the comma isn't a common thing to do, although that doesn't necessarily prove anything.",

They deserve neutral at least, but I don't think that negative would be overkill either. Was actually going to suggest the same after going through some details of those accounts, I think they all deserve a neutral tag at least, to warn users dealing with any of those accounts to exercise some carefulness.I think the neutral tag is enough for now, since there haven't been any report of any type on any of those accounts relating to scam, and neither is there any evidence of attempted scam on any of the accounts, a neutral trust as a warning to the owner of the accounts and also to users dealing with with the owner of the accounts would be more befitting at this time.",
