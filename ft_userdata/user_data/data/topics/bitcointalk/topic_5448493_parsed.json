So I would say that ETH will loose relevance. Being technically advanced doesn't always help in adoption. So ETH may be technically a little behind than some other coins, but in terms of users, it is far ahead. So I don't see ETH becoming irrelevant.",

Indeed. I'd argue that Polygon and Filecoin can maintain their relevance by catering to distinct functionalities and niches. Polygon still has a decent DeFi TVL and actively pursues growth in the NFT market, recently convincing Solana's DeGods to move to their chain. Filecoin team is the same team that builds IPFS I believe, which is widely used today. Cardano, however, I'm amazed to see Cardano still in the top 10 by market cap size. Do people actively use it, and if so, for what purposes?",

Do people actively use it, and if so, for what purposes?User base may not be as high as Ethereum but it's still growing. Most are probably just staking at the moment and waiting for the potential they see on Cardano.I don't see this chain losing relevance despite Ethereum's recent updates. It's true that we don't hear much about them since developers prefer the slow and steady approach. Only releasing new features when they are certain it's ready for mass usage. The chain seem stable unlike others that has outages every now and then. Perhaps that's also one reason why it remains in the top 10.",

But so far, all have failed miserably. The most recent is Solana, and we could have it failed miserably, I don't even believe Sol will recover from the FTX crash, let alone replace ETH in the future.
