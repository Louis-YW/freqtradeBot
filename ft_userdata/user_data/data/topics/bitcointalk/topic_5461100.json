  "content": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-signs-digital-ruble-bill-224312972.html?\"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed into law a bill that will grant legal tender to a “digital ruble” amid severe Western sanctions and rising inflation brought on by the war in Ukraine.Under the bill, Putin has granted legal authority to the Bank of Russia—the country's central bank—to serve as the platform operator for the central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill also provides legal definitions for users and specifies how banks will operate under the new framework.Although the bill now has Putin’s green light, Russian officials have said they do not expect the digital ruble to be widely adopted for years. In an interview with Forbes, Olga Skorobogatova, the deputy chair of the central bank, said most citizens will only begin receiving access to online wallets by 2025 at the earliest.\"___From August 1, the law will come into force, but CBDC won't work everywhere and it is not yet clear how this will work in practice.I ask you to refrain from politics, only economics and laws will be involved.I wrote about the implementation of CBDC in Nigeria, and now I want to describe this process in Russia in detailhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5440827",

As long as the government controls it, it can impose a much broader swath of restrictions, albeit digitally. For example, they don't have to issue sanctions. They can quietly prohibit cryptocurrency exchange by any party that is deemed whatever. Dissidents, thieves, political figures, you name it. They control the entirety of the pocketbook. Credit and debit cards are a highly loose form of this digital control. With CBDC, they can do it instantaneously. You can only spend on what they say you can spend with whoever they say. Don't want anyone buying guns? Ban the exchange addresses of all gun dealers. No legislation or negotiation is needed. This is an autocrat or dictator's dream.",

Even in my country, Pakistan launches new laws to expedite CBDC launch by 2025, where the crypto is not legal but CBDC will be part of CBDC. I guess they would plan to keep Bitcoin and crypto illegal but promote and legalize the self-developed CBDC so the power still remains with the government and big financial institutions.How come Bitcoin / Crypto promotes money laundering and this CBDC is anti-money laundering, Ridiculous !!![",

If the goals of the CBDC are total control of the population, then it will be necessary to reduce the number of banks and reduce the amount of cash.",

Most friendly nations to Russia have developed their CBDCs. China and India have been Russia's major partners and have refused to join NATO states to sanction Kremlin. With the exclusion of Russia from SWIFT the international payment system, international trade payment between these nations has not been easy. Central Bank Digital Currency seems to be one of the means of helping Russia invade sanctions. But I am viewing CBDC as the beginning of the end of fiat currency. Before, at least it took efforts of minting to print a currency, now it might take just a click to produce billions of a country's currency. Without adequate security, hackers can cause harm to the system and issue billions in no time.",

It only allows transactions to stores that sell food. And that's not even CBDC, it's still fiat.Now imagine ECB launching CBDC and making a smart contract that forbids your wallet from sending money to well-known CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken etc.Some banks already enforce that (Ethniki for example) with the already existing fiat currency.Of course people will be ingenious to find other -roundabout- solutions: I can buy a highly-sought product (let's say a PS5 or an iPhone*) with CBDC and then sell it in the black market for BTC. But that means the CBDC -> BTC exchange rate won't be very favorable... in fact, I don't even expect 1:1 parity (despite ECB enforcing it) between the physical (zero limitations) and the digital euro (CBDC).* assuming you will still be allowed to buy these products, because even that is not 100% certain:https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/14/23760879/sony-ps5-cloud-streaming-games-testhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994814/apple-iphone-hardware-subscription-bundle-reportMaybe they will tell you that owning these devices emits way too much CO2, therefore this kind of purchases would quickly deduct your carbon credits.",

Just sell it peer-to-peer, and you can even select a premium price. In fact, I have never sold bitcoin without a premium price once. I'm regularly charging an extra 5% whenever I'm not in hurry, and a 2% when I'm in hurry. People buy those.",
