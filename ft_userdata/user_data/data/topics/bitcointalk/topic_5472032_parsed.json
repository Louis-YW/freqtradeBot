  "content": "This came to my mind and I was pondering on the topic in and I outline some of the things that should be done to do or to make or create a quality post or comment and I came to the conclusion that it is easy for someone to make a quality post and comment if only the following steps are followed by the low quality posters.Your subject area or field of study: in real life you must be good in a particular subject, such as English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Government, Political science, Computer and other Skills which you good with. So as you came to the forum at first your  brain is blank and you don't even know where to start from and this make many to back off. While some post out of point threads and comments. Now if you Carefully look at the forum all the subjects  or the courses I mentioned above, their terms are used frequently in the forum from one board to another. So what you have to do is to look for the particular board your subject terms or course terms are frequently in used and make comments there always, and when you have topics to create based on the discussion you involved in then you can do that to see you strength. Then when you have mastered that board, you can come out to other boards to make comments but on the topics which you can make comments and not any topic you see. And also in gambling board which is also a general board in the forum. In that board, there are different topics to discuss. Football, casinos and other sports activities which you can discuss freely with issue but this particular gambling which I think would have been an easy place for people to make comments is the most difficult board for people to participate. I also discovered that most of the newbies are banned from that board. If Chelsea and Arsenal playing a game and you are a fan, all what you need to do is to support your team and predict that they will win or they will loss and there is no need to go and copy article from somewhere and paste it. All what I am saying is that just specialize in the area you know that you are good and base (stay) on that board. Then when you mastered the board then you can raise your head to other boards. If you know the local board is good for you at the initial time then base (stay) there to improve yourself. Many people are making low quality posts because they want to rank up at all means when they have not even understand how the forum work and finally got ban. For those who has local board, stay on your local boards to learn more then sometimes you can come out to Beginners & Help to ask questions or post. Quality Post is guaranteed if you post in the area you are good in real life.",

The problem lies in the urge to grow one’s account easily and this has lead many newbies to creating threads that are of low quality or better still full of contradictions because they do not understand what they want to teach themselves. You can grow in the forum even if you don’t have the basic knowledge from those subjects you listed above, all you need is to be able to read and understand, and then be patient and you will grow gradually in the forum.

Clearly, Newbies - Read before posting contains  basics and manual for any beginner to understand how the forum works, not everyone understand English and the rest, that is why Local boards are available, going through the basic rules is what any a beginner should first read, that thread is interpreted across all the locals boards we have in the forums.QuoteThen when you have mastered that board, you can come out to other boards to make comments but on the topics which you can make comments and not any topic you see.

Quality Post is guaranteed if you post in the area you are good in real life.I haven't see any Newbies that are banned from a board, they can be ban for plagiarism which can be permanent or temporal. Only when you become a troll that you post things that are out of context of the board, then you can become limited to that particular board. I know of some thread where suggestions were raise on the Meta board to limit some members in some board for posting bad things about bitcoin, some where approves while some were ignored, sometimes the forum enjoy trolls.I understand your point but what a newbie needs is guide, and after reading through the rules and regulation, the next thing is to learn before they can teach others. It's funny how a newbie that doesn't understand want to teach others, that's not the best way to go if you want to enjoy the forum. First, you must learn and when you understand better, you can then interact.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 28, 2023, 06:18:33 PM@OP please which board can I use chemistry knowledge on this forum  Maybe he is talking about Entropy of a system. Endothermic and exothermic reactions of mining machines, that is joke by the way",

For me, quality post is making sense of anything your are writing on, contributing both the negative and positive effect of what you are talking about and speaking from your intelligence or should I call it mind.

We don’t use English, chemistry, or other subjects you mention here. In my opinion, we post a topic of discussion on a board, and what we want people to talk about will suit that board, given that every board on this forum has specific topics that are supposed to be posted there. However, I don’t know where all these subjects you mention are used or what terms are used on the forum, like, for example, the Bitcoin discussion board. Every discussion about bitcoin takes place there, while beginners and helpers are on a board where we post things for beginners to learn. Everybody has their own specific board, which they perfect well in the forum.Local boards use their local language to discuss, so which board did we use the subject terms you mentioned?QuoteAnd also in gambling board which is also a general board in the forum. In that board, there are different topics to discuss. Football, casinos and other sports activities which you can discuss freely with issue but this particular gambling which I think would have been an easy place for people to make comments is the most difficult board for people to participate. I also discovered that most of the newbies are banned from that board.Gambling is not the most difficult board for people to make posts; everybody has a board where he or she specialises in the forum. So not all of us have much knowledge about football and other gambling activities, which they find it difficult to reply to. Instead of just writing what they know and moving on, they kept on making mistakes, which is why they got banned.",

So what I will say to the newbies and newcomers in the forum is to read, engage in research, and also ask questions because you can’t help anyone who is not ready to learn or the lazy ones, so let's read and do a good post to succeed in the forum.",

I want to specify various problems and not stay exclusively on one topic. I'm really surprised by people who say \"should\" about someone on the Internet. Likewise, I would apply the word \"should\" only to human qualities: respect, honesty, and decency. People have different views on the usefulness of a post.
