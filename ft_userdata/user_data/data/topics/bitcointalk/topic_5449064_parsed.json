  "content": "New poster here, just wanted to share the winnings from my session today on a new casino as I'd like to leave a good review. I deposited $100 to start with and proceeded to hit a few 20x multipliers on $5 bets getting me up to around $370. I then waited for red streaks of 4 or more and then martingaled it all the way up to $2800 then went down to $2519 when I cashed out.Deposit and withdrawal was instant, the game is very fun it's like dice. Overall 9/10 would recommend - only thing is they don't offer any deposit bonus it would be nice to have some sort of offer in the future!https://ibb.co/560fppyhttps://ibb.co/bB9wq7P",

All this just makes people here to be more skeptic of a service, specially if a newbie account comes around here talking wonders of an unknown platform and even mentioning non-KYC.It is a series of red flags for anyone with a little bit of common sense.  Only because they pay for advertisement, does not mean they are legit.",

The whole thing looks shady to me.If a casino as big as coinplay could cheat its customers I wonder what an unknown casino like the one you mentioned would do. I'm very sure that the Op is part of the casino's team and hoping he would be able to attract those that would end up being scammed into the casino by just creating a praise casino.If you feel that the casino is great as you claimed then let them come to the forum so that members can test-run it and see if there are any green flags so that they can alert others of them. I would advise that everyone stay away from the casino Op mentioned, the fact that he just came out of the blue and started raining praises is a red flag on its own.",

It's not uncommon for scammers to create fake sites, lure people in with promises of big payouts, and disappear with the money. I take it you are unable to attach some verifiable proof, like a blockchain transaction, instead of just screenshots that can be easily faked?",

If you have any please link them here I'd like to see.Also I did my due diligence regarding the game's script before playing, it says this about it in their tos: \"We concatenate the client seed, server seed, and nonce together and hash them using the SHA-256 algorithm to create a unique hash. We then take the first 8 characters of the hash (which represents 32 bits of data) and convert it to an integer. We use modulo arithmetic to get a value between 0 and 2400, and then divide by 100 to get a decimal value between 0 and 24. We can then use this value to determine the outcome of the game.\"I don't really know what that means, but if someone can educate me on if that sounds accurate I would be greatful to know before I deposit again.",
