I wonder is anyone here actually trading or have tried to trading, or is it just to fill the sign-campaign requirement? I don't want to mention any names for many reasons I think everyone have good intentions but most of the posts and tips makes zero sense and when I read it I know that the person that posted that is not a good trader and probably never had trading at all himself/herself.

I think trading is very addictive and many people can not quit trading because they already addict with trading.Trading is a tough journey like the chart you share and in this volatile market, with news, fud, trading is harder as emotion, psychology can be affected a lot. Investing is not easy too but if comparing to trading, it is more easier to get profit.The challenge with investment is choosing a good asset. If you choose Bitcoin, you done a hardest part and the rest is holding it to get profit. It will be so smooth if you look at the chart in Log scale.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/ (choose All, choose Log)",

I believe that it's not something that someone without the full knowledge of how fundamental and technical analysis of trading works. This is why I'm grateful for this forum, because hearing members trading experiences makes me to be better equipped before I start, hopefully soon. Although I'm very optimistic that when I eventually start, with the knowledge that I'm gathering, I believe that my profits will be greater than loses.

There are tenses that are used by traders, and to be a trader talking to other traders, there is no way you will be able to express yourself without using those tenses. Quote from: BabyBandit on December 08, 2023, 08:25:17 AMLegendary rank can be a newbie trader and a newbie rank can be a legendary trader.Legendary in rank does not mean that the person has an idea on every subject. But it should mean that there should be the maturity to contribute on topics where you have an idea and ignore others and simply read where you do not have knowledge.",

People can refer to earning money from trading to be hard, which is not wrong but right.so far the most viable way of trading that didn't cause loss as frequent but instead give quite many profits are trading around bullrun like today, as the saying goes, everyone is expert when the market is bullish so making a trade is rather easy and getting profit is also easy, quite opposite trading when the market is bearish or where the market have no trend going on more likely gonna be incurring loss since its all about trickery when it comes to trading at that time whale just trying to make fake pattern so people buy then further dumps the market anyway as if TA supposedly helps the retailer are instead being taken advantage of by the whales.thats what I found from my experience in trading, when market bullish like this, we can invest in the shittest coin and still make profit. just overall better experience to be honest.",

I read true your whole post and agree with what you saying.This is the coin that I made the most profit on so far: https://www.coingecko.com/sv/coins/bonk Dog Coin in Solana network. Yes I can only imagine those who made heavy investments, I am not there yet but I know I will reach that level in a soon future. I must believe in my self and try, if we never try we never know and the risk we regret our cautious is huge. No Risk No Reward!",

Thanks for taking time to reply in the thread. I see and I understand how trading works for you. You should always stick with something you know works for you and be careful when exploring new things, if you feel trading is waste of time for you yes then you should not be trading.  I am also fresh in trading, P2P trading I have done since 2020 or something like that and it's totally different since you more or less cant lose money, you will always do a profit if you are able to sell your coins fast.Last 6 months I been exploring crypto trading and I can say that I only been trading with coins/tokens in the Solana network for 1 Safe as much on fee's as possible. 2 Been able to do instant and fast swaps. Now this have been worked very good for me, but I  am aware that everything can turn direction in seconds, so I am very careful but I also have in mind that if I don't risk I cant get a reward, so I am trying to balance it as good as I can. I am still in a phase where I am learning new things every day and this forum one good way to learn things about Trading for example. But as we said in this thread, if you a complete newbie you should be careful on what tips you choose to follow here.  The coins I been trading with lately is Bonk, SolTradingBot, Cope Token, Guacamole & DOBI (released yesterday) and many more.  Quote from: libert19 on December 09, 2023, 06:59:12 AMI am not active trader as people who open and close positions daily, but I spot buy coins I think are good and hold indefinitely.

You remember what Einstein said?\"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\" & \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.\" So what you doing is very very wise. 💪",
