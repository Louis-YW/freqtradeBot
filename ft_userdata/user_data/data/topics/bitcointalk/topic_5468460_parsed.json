      "body": "Very funny though and if I may ask can any of your client vouch for you? I will like you to post a link to your work different from what you have made available here for us to see. At least that would convince prospective clients to engage your services.You should categorically state your payment procedure and price as per job offer so that any one coming would have idea before engaging your services. I will also suggest you get an escrow from this platform who is reputable because members here would not be comfortable making payments directly to you when they are not sure of you. Do well to make your conversations here for transparency and accountability.",
