Perhaps because they wanted to put more effort and manpower into creating chips for other points of customers. Gaming for instance, which has been their biggest suit since time immemorial. The fact of the matter is that they are slowly losing to AMD and they need to do something about it before the latter breaks their necks and claims the competition for good. Since gaming is their biggest market it just makes sense to put more focus on it. But if this weren't the reason I'd be confused too. In any case they'd still carry out support for Blocksale so it's not like the end of the world or something. Miners with blocksale chips in the past will still be getting support from them although the certainties are a little vague in my opinion.",

Did someone at intel do the math and figure our that they can make more money just making chips for other people then designing the chips and miners and selling and supporting them.Might just come down to something like that. There are a lot of things that go into doing the entire miner or even just designing and making the chips. If someone hands you the ASIC design and says give me 10 million of these chips and you can make a couple of dollars a chip it might just be a better business deal for Intel-Dave",

As far as I know, while they're not doing great they still have decent capital, not as bad as AMD when they were close to bankruptcy. Their investment to open a new fab is probably taking the majority of their spending so experimental products being stopped is understandable though.Quote from: karabiber on April 23, 2023, 05:32:36 AMIntel's decision may be due to increased operating costs and the loss of popularity of Bitcoin mining.  I'm not sure how mining popularity is decreasing with the increase in global hash rate though. At the very least, it is not surprising if big farms are still buying and building new farms to mine Bitcoin. As for individuals or small miners, they are probably not the target for this product in the first place. CMIIW.",

This means that they lost to their competitors, although the company has great resources to continue to fight in the market and make decisions not only for companies.",

Intel's decision may be due to increased operating costs and the loss of popularity of Bitcoin mining.  It's easy to blame Bitcoin price for such failure but that's far from the truth, TSMC and Samsung still make a dozen chips for their mining gears manufacturers, and Bitmain and Whatsminer made trucks full of money in recent years despite the drop in BTC price, they both still sell their ASIC miners at prices way above cost price.Intel walked into the room with their big boy pants showing off some crazy efficient numbers, they made everyone thinks that they will dominate the field, but they failed massively to their rivals who have a lot more experience in designing ASIC chips which so happen to be very different from the GPU chips.I am not happy to read the news tho, I want nothing but more competition in the mining sector, but things happen.",
