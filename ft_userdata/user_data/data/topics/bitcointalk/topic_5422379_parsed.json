If your software has no malware, then you won't get banned. I have seen so many folks post new software and not get banned.Just do the right thing if you don't want to get reported and get banned",

Not sure how that was wrong, hence my main question how to determine if i get banned from posting github link with miner or now.It is literally miner that probably 60% of GR miners use, it was more as it was literally the fastest and only good option back then, is open source and out there for some time for now so not sure how that might be bad.He talked about main GR coin discord about it some time ago. What i personally did not like about it is that apparently there are no reason he got about the ban, just ban, no explanation, no questions asked or answered when he asked about it.",

I been following the project raptoreum that uses ghostrider from the test net days before ghostrider was even used.I never said delgon wrote a miner from the ground up. he worked on the original ghostrider\"take2\" miner and also provided arm support. arm support was not implemented in till then, something you do not support at all. then later on the wyrven miner came out which dramatically increased performance. he also even worked on a modified version for the intel KNL platform, something you do not support.I've even seen wolf himself call it delgon's miner. not sure why you have to swear about it.",

It is not anymore on Raptoreum website Download section as the code itself is not optimized for normal CPUs like improved vesrion below.Quote from: JayDDee on November 22, 2022, 03:51:39 AMAll I see is bullshit claims without any evidence. Where is this elusive miner? It's not recommended my Raptoreum as was claimed.Where's the KNL code?And the Delgon and Ausminer cpuminer-gr that is mostly used is here: https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2 not sure what is \"ellusive\" about it as it is literally in the Download section on Raptoreum website.KNL binaries were mostly dropped since version after 1.1 as the interest was not so great with it iirc.Quote from: JayDDee on November 22, 2022, 03:51:39 AMWhere did Wolf vouch for him?Delgon was doing a misc checks for Wolf as RTM team though he might put GR logic together and push a miner for GPUs but he dropped it and andrucrypt (Wildrig) made it instead. If you know him, you can ask him about Delgon, they were colborating and Wolf was quite active in RTM discord for a long time, did not see him lately tho.Here Wolf's reaction about cpuminer-gr fork being on Bitcointalk just fine where they changed colors and address to the Delgon and Ausminer dev fee wallets but main cpuminer-gr and dev was banned. And some other of him talking about the minerhttps://i.ibb.co/7QyHfY2/Screenshot-from-2022-11-22-05-28-15.pnghttps://i.ibb.co/j37z545/Screenshot-from-2022-11-22-05-27-22.pnghttps://i.ibb.co/NjTzQCN/Screenshot-from-2022-11-22-05-17-46.png",
