  "content": "In my state of thought, I sought to understand the kind of mindset that made some persons lucky to the extent that after several attempts without success, they finally strike gold.Whereas, on the other hand, we have persons who seem to follow a sure career path that is predictable, steady, but never seem to share in this kind of luck.  Here's a story to help us distinguish between a lottery mindset and a disciplined mindset:I have a friend who recently lost his job. He was fired. Although he had complained about leaving the job for several unsatisfactory reasons. His wish came through, and he was not stuck in the clouds nor perturbed as to how to survive or source another job, even with little cash left. It was until he had given up hope of sourcing or waiting for a job, he returned home and was sure to invest his full time in same small business he managed to hold onto while he worked at that job. He got called back and with better pay package. He never felt he couldn't survive without the job, as he reiterated, but for other reasons, passion and pressing bills sake, he took the offer, while holding onto his small business/side hustle.I do not think my friend had the lottery kind of mindset but the disciplined one, else he would have refused the offer and focused solely on his small business. That is, one lucky break over a fluke while trading, versus, trading with discipline of focus and understanding.Ever heard of persons who needed a lucky break and got it?Do you want to approach trading with a lottery mindset? If you do, you’ll always be on edge and you will have difficulty trading with discipline. Let's discuss.https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-lottery-mindset/#:~:text=They%20develop%20a%20%E2%80%9Clottery%20mindset,steadily%20t",

      "body": "For me, I see nothing wrong with your friend accepting his job offer back after a brief period of break, because he has bills to settle, and those bills can only be paid with a paycheck and not either a lottery mindset or a disciplined mindset. So at least your friend now have a side hustle where he gets an extra income, which is equally good. But never you quit your job just to trade Bitcoin,  because though it may be lucrative, it's profit is never always guarantee due to it's volatile nature",

      "body": "Thats will and determination. Its not like he is a quitter but looking for greenier pasture out there. Trading is risky so, might as well called it as lottery mindset. The only difference is if you are discipline enough you could do much more chances to gain or win that lottery on trading. Ive been there and sometime this kind of attitude will gain us expectation, which is really not a normal one right? Trading is something you do with heart.",

      "body": "Life is a stage and it's not easy to climb down these staged after climbing to it's top. That's why it's difficult for cooperate workers to quit their jobs and Chase a dream. They are now capable of certain bills and those bills will keep coming whether they're at the top or downsized. I think your friend thought about this, and chose to go back. Although his business would have made him more money if he stuck to it, But in the process of waiting for the business to Excel, he must have become a debtor. So decisions vary, and Life has more than one category none which is easier to handle than the other.",

      "body": "I am convinced that almost every person is given a chance that can radically change his life for the better. The problem is that this chance is not always evaluated and accepted correctly. There is a good motivation saying that if you want to be rich, you must think like a rich person now; all our beliefs show the strength of our intention. If you want to be rich, but in your heart, you understand that you cannot be rich, you will remain poor all your life. The strength of one's intention and conviction must always be on the same level of agreement. If there are inconsistencies, luck will not turn in your favor. But after checking the many stories of people who got rich, it always appears that these people were once very lucky. Therefore, you should never deny that you deserve the best, even though at the moment you may not have anything to eat.",
