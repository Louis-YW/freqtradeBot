The new development is big positive news in the cryptocurrency space and quite a good number of coins are already showing a positive attitude which results in a few percentage of increase in their price.",

The brand name is tainted, trust has gone.Hopefully if they go reopen the first thing that happens is, any funds that are still there & redistributed (in part) to those who lost money. Obviously the full funds aren’t there thanks to an awful scam but even if part funds are returned to the rightful owners that’s the best scenario out of the whole FTX shit show.",

Most likely they will never do. Even after FTX reopen. Its possible that FTX CEO will \"find\" as much as it is possible to pay US users to not be chased by US authorities not carrying about others. That wat chapter 11 is - bancrupcy. There is also Chapter 13 - a reorganization. After this, as long as I know, you can have a fresh start without paying all your liabilities. You only have to have reorganization plan and  the bankruptcy court's need to accept it even without the acceptance of creditors. SBF have frieds to help with that.",

If I take examples of various banks around the world, usually they get government support to ensure that the bank can restart its operation. However, we haven't yet seen any such things happening in crypto world. rather we have seen a long litigation process and extreme delay in refunding the money of the investors in various cases. So I am not sure if FTX will really start their operation again. But it seems highly unlikely. It can be only possible if some billionaire steps in and propose to take up their losses and liabilities in exchange of 100% ownership and no legal action, FTX might re-open someday.",

That ship has sailed and even if they want to re open the exchange, hardly you will see any investors trusting their funds with the exchange. First they need to refund the money stolen from the users and if they are able to settle everything which is highly unlikely they can open.",

In terms of lost investor funds, there is also no certainty when they will be returned in full.It's actually easier to be able to develop and advance a new platform that doesn't have many users than it is to revive and regain glory for a platform that has collapsed due to having a serious case and a bad reputation about the platform.So it's possible that FTX will be revived again, but it's impossible to be like before when it was still victorious.",

I think this is a good development in a way that the funds from the users were returned, though not so much for FTX which has their name already tarnished by what SBF did. It will take more than a rebrand and change of leadership in order to get FTX up and running again and compete with the best exchanges out there. And then there's the US and Bahamian authorities that are seeking to take FTX down due to a lot of legal complaints against the said exchange..",

For me personally it is pretty hard to imagine that FTX can just restart their business and then go on like before the bankruptcy like nothing has happened. I think that first of all the trial against SBF needs to happen until there is a final verdict. Only then it is clear if the company FTX also is partly guilty or if it was SBFs fault alone. Then there also is still the fact that there was a hack happening at FTX during all that Chaos and the funds of users were stolen. So this also needs to be settled first.",

The brand is tarnished beyond repair. Nobody in the right mind would ever trust that exchange. It doesn't matter if they get a new CEO. That exchange is finished. They should just declare bankruptcy and try to find ways to make their customers whole.Let's say they found a new CEO for this scam exchange. Is he going to pay for the stolen coins from his own pocket? If not why even bother?FTX needs to die asap. Bankman should rot in prison. There is no other way out.",

I would have shorted it in binance but for some reason i first didn't find it there and shorted it with a dollar that i got left in FTX for fun and got some pocket cash.
