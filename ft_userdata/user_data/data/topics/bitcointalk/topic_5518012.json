We got some Bitcoin in one way or another and our worth increased significantly. Others would say \"easy money\". Well, it wasn't that easy. Hodling isn't that easy. To resist the urge to sell when Bitcoin skyrockets from $1,000 to $20,000 in just a span of months isn't easy. Neither is it easy to keep hodling when after reaching $20,000, it freefalls all the way to $3,000. To just watch the price move from $6,000 to $69,000 and then from $69,000 to $15,000 and from $15,000 to $72,000 and do nothing isn't easy.",

This is pat on my own back too  since I started when price was around $400 and watched it go down all the way to $150 and even stay at $200 for about a year.bro! This is crazy. Starting off at $400 and staying around till $89k is a journey that's worth a thousand tap on the back. That literally means you've stayed to watch Bitcoin grow above 223 times it value at the time you started investing with all the bulls and beers and the disbelief and temptation to sell that must have come with staying this long.Though I can't say the same thing that I've witnessed a remarkable beer like the majority of the early birds that came in even before Bitcoin got to $1k but coming in at the time Bitcoin was around $40k and seeing it get to $89k in less than a year and still climbing is something I've come to see as one of the best Discovery of my life and for the little chunk I've already built and for the  journey ahead of us, it's worth at least the tiniest tap on the back and hopefully in the coming years, we will talk about these era as the then days when Bitcoin was low.",

Although I'm not an expert in crypto space, I believe that I gave some advice to some users here in the forum in one way or another. I gave advice, shared information to these newbies because I'm also once a newbie and got some help from experts here. I donated some of my crypto to those who are in need, but not directly crypto. I converted my crypto to our local currency and donated it to them. That's okay, right?  I've bought many things already using Bitcoin. Too many to say right now.

That doesn't mean that I'm out already, but we all have strategies.  As for selling my Bitcoins, I've been earning Bitcoin since 2018 and been selling them as well until now. Just imagine if I choose to hold all of the Bitcoins that I got during that time until now. I would've been a millionaire in an instant.  Bitcoin changed my life in a way that I didn't imagine. I don't know with the people around me though, but it changed meQuote from: X7 on November 12, 2024, 11:59:24 PMSee you in 4 yearsSee you.",

They can sell instantly and leave Bitcoin to enjoy their profit or they can still hold for some time and sell when the price make another new ATH.Yes, Bitcoin change our lives as we are Bitcoin investor who held our Bitcoin from a long time ago. We can celebrate our waiting time by selling Bitcoin (if that is our plan) at the price now and enjoy the profit. Patience will not lie to those who already held Bitcoin and they now see what is the benefit of Bitcoin to them. This also proof to other people who doesn't believe in Bitcoin because they see what happen to Bitcoin now.",
