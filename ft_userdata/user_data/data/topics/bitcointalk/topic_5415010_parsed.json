  "content": "Every now and then we get new monetary policies and as money supply keeps growing too rapidly inflation sets in which inturn reduces the purchasing power of our various fiat currencies. This inflation don't just happen spontaneously it starts with a comfortable price hike everyone can cope up with and continually increase until it becomes noticeable. It comes in stages the first face might only affect the poor and small scale entrepreneurs, the second phase might be a matter of concern for medium  scale entrepreneurs ,the third stage is when the large scale investors gets affected too and the final stage is when the producers start feeling the impact on the cost of raw material and reduction in production quality and patronage. Before this time there have been slight change in material cost but it might not be too obvious to stair national concern. The world at this point needs a decentralised currency that can be monitored through a public ledger  that way excessive money printing will be curtailed and going by how challenging keeping up with the rapid inflation has become there is every tendency of having worst GDPs in coming years because if manufacturers and Producers fails to meet up the hight cost of production then they will in due cause turn to low standard products just to keep the demands and stay in production",

Is that it?We have to do nothing? Just wait while they were f*cking with us? Im sure someone should be blame by this but we can't point fingers since they were too discreet to show themselves. It only proves that riches will become richer while poor people will be more poorer and this gives the idea of survival of the fittest if this is all about in the economy but how can you expect them to act when things like this going to happen?",

But there was no other way. A new currency, however it works, won't change the fundamentals of demand & supply. A decentralized currency may even be worse in such scenarios. Since there won't be any way to control the money supply(or a central authority to do so), the problem will be much bigger than what we have right now.And inflation isn't always bad. It's a part of growth.  It is a natural occurrence that happens when an economy is growing.",

These are arguments that would apply very well for before 2022 but not with the rising energy prices we have, which will not be solved by simply printing less. If we want less inflation on the energy side, what we need to do is to produce more energy, i.e. increase supply, or reduce demand. That's all there is to it.",

But what we really need is to create and nurture a culture where society takes issues like inflation seriously, before it snowballs into a major issue. As people we generally look to solutions that require the least amount of effort and risk on our part. We advocate for systemic solutions: libertarianism or socialism. Hoping that libertarians or socialists will do all the work, and assume all the risk. Or people advocate for representatives, politicians or government to do all the work and fix everything. So the people will not have to invest time or energy into fighting their own battles.Systemic approaches are a counter intuitive approach, as the area where the greatest gains can be made is typically one of self improvement.",

Inflation is also often caused by the low purchasing power of the people due to the high price of goods. Moreover, the government continues to supply basic commodities from abroad, resulting in low prices for local staples. This is often due to the government's inability to control the barons over national spending.When it comes to inflation, I think it will continue to be linked with the government as the policy maker. Apart from that, corruption in a country can also lead to inflation. Because it does not match national income and national expenditure or in other words Gross Domestic Product.",

It does not have to be that way, when the gold standard was in place we saw one of the moments in history in which the economic growth was very high, and this was because business owners had a stable form of money in which they could rely on, then governments cheated the gold standard because of WWI and then they began the slow implementation of the fiat system, so while we need to do our best efforts to protect ourselves due to the system currently in place we must not forget that things were not always like this.",

You can’t survive on this if you continue to complain instead of working into something, some countries might continue to experience higher inflation by the end of the year, that can result to a more complicated situation and I just hope that many already prepared for this.",

Governments wouldn't want to switch to switch to a currency that they can't control. And if an independent one like Bitcoin would start getting traction, they would shut down its use. And what about volatility? When it is big, it's worse than inflation, because it ruins all short-term planning and makes it very hard to run a business. And any currency that isn't backed by a government or a similar powerful entity is bound to be volatile, because there's nothing to stabilize it.",

Furthermore, no country that wants to maintain its monetary sovereignty will ever give up its national currency in favor of something it cannot control.The way the world works and how the financial system is integrated into it is something that has existed for a very long time, and it has proven to be effective for the ruling minority at the top of the pyramid, who thus have control over everyone else.

It can slowly kill people if they will allow this kind of system ruled out or if they will agree to be charged high.In some countries, people are protesting to bring back the old rates or to increase the pay rate of the service that they do so that they can keep up with the inflations. It's only sad that it could lead to fights and people can get injured and worst killed. Those who got divorced, I think they have another problem and they only use the inflation as an excuse.",
