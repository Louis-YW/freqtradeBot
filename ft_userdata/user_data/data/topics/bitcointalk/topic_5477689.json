To hodl any investment you must have a good cash flow that can serve you without touching the said capital for investment. The experience you had was as results of less knowledge of such but now I know and others will know from you too which is good.",

I am happy to see someone learn from experience and succeed in life with it because like you rightly mentioned, experience is the best teacher. And learning from it is the best solution to our problems in life. I remember trying to hold Bitcoin several times but it will fail because I don't always have that financial backing to stay feet with it. Hence, my inability to continue to hold and I have to temper with the funds meant for investment for my personal needs.As much as I like to hold my Bitcoin, my intentions go into futility because of my lack of ability to earn outside the funds I use to invest. I will also advise that low income earners invest in the DCA approach with the little they can afford if they must to do so for them to sustain their investment.",

People are sometimes very hasty and do not strive to learn simple truths. To invest in something, you need to understand that you can do without it for a very long time. We know many good stories where Bitcoin helped people become financially independent, but there are even more stories where people were ruined by their illiteracy and greed. Therefore, if you decide to invest, carry this thought for a few days and imagine the worst possible outcome. If you realize that you can survive after it, then go and invest.",

Its not just an idea that you need a steady income to keep your crypto holdings safe; its a harsh reality based on the lessons of unstable economies. You made a good point when you said that the unstable nature of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can force buyers into selling too soon, which can cause them to lose money.Isnt it a problem to think that all buyers arent strong enough to handle market changes? Having a job is important, but smart money management and mental control are also very important. The real problem is finding a balance between the need to sell assets and the long-term investment goals.This is shown by your experience going from being vulnerable to stable as a Guinness merchandiser. Its not enough to just have a job; you need to learn how to handle money and your emotions. This is the truth that no one in the world of crypto investing wants to say.",

An investor aiming to have a long-term investment in Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency requires to have a stable job. High possibility for an investor to sell their holdings early if ever the time comes when they need money for any emergencies. Having a source of income will also be the one to help an investor to at least increase the holdings they have.

I came from nothing to something myself and I can tell you that nothing having a source of income was why my end result isn't that great today, if I had a source of income I would have made a lot of accomplishment. Source of income makes investment to be easier, and the lower your responsibility the harder you can go on your investment, today I still risk 80% of my income on bitcoin because the 20% left is more than enough to get by everyday, this is a good advice and thanks for sharing.",

So others here, and I think majority of us have a regular 9-5 office job. And in turn, we uses our salary to invest on BTC, be a long term holder and then don't sell, only offload when necessary (taking profits in the bull run).There could also be some though, who started their bitcoin journey with nothing, and then earn some for their signature of bounty campaigns and then turn it around thru trading. So there's a lot of ways really and it depends on each individual on how they are going to take their crypto journey here.",

The decision to sell due to urgent circumstances does not need to be regretted because ownership can be carried out again when the problem has been resolved.",

The value of bitcoins can be volatile and there is no guarantee that their value will increase over time. If you have no other source of money and are relying solely on the value of your Bitcoin, you may find yourself in a vulnerable financial position. However, it is important to be realistic about our financial situation and hold investments in a sustainable way for us.

One of the best attributes to have when investing into bitcoin is patience, with patience you can hodl for a very long time and we all know that does who hodl for a very long time are those are most likely to run into profits. So to maintain or exercise this patience you need an extra funds outside this investment so that you don’t always run to the investment for solution of every problem.
