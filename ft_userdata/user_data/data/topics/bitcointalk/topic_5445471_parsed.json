You cannot unlock it.\"how to unlock it ?If you lock a topic of your own creation and want to unlock it later, this will definitely work.Â  But if a topic is locked by an admin or moderator or you want to unlock a topic created by someone else then you can't do it anyway because you are a normal user so you don't have any special powers like an admin or moderator. So if you want to do it then it will definitely be a futile attempt.One thing I don't understand is why you are trying to unlock admin locked topics. did you create that topic?Â  Or do you have some other purpose? and which topic are you trying to unlock?",

You can't unlock it because you don't have that vector power to do so,you can only unlock a topic that you locked yourself. Forget about your locked topics and try to create topics that someone can learn from. I saw that you have been here since 2016 and have made only 39 post,common this shows that you are not here to learn and grow. If you don't know what to post then let go of posting and read more of other people's thread or the pinned thread on every board to start with, maybe you this will help you.Forum members sees one line post as spamming and the poster as a shit poster.",

Perhaps one of this kind of topic was locked but going through his topic creation history I failed to find any thread that is locked. My assumption he has another account and a topic from that account is locked and looking for solution to unlock it. Edit: How could I miss it LOLhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5408679.0I was checking his earlier threads first to find any ANN related to Zarfund ðŸ˜‚",
