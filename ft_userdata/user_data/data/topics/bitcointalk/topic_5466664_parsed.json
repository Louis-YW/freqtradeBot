      "body": "If I have access to an AI bot that could efficiently do day trade in BTC, then like other big investors, I might try to perform hundreds of trades in BTC. I recently watched a video in which the person, who is an Institutional trader, is making thousands of small trades, by using some automated bot and he said the profit ratio is good. But, as I am not that familiar with that strategy, so before implementing it, I do need some knowledge plus a lot of assets too. Which I don't have now, well, I also don't have the AI in my hand so.  Quote from: BitMaxz on September 13, 2023, 03:51:08 PMAI Day trading with crypto like Bitcoin is very risky without knowledge you won't be able to make a profit.Since crypto is too volatile it would be hard to make an AI trading bot more efficient in day trading. Because you will need to train your AI model from previous historical data, strategies, and risk management. There is no guarantee that your AI will make a profit after you've trained it unless you know much about risk management and good strategies.You are 100% right, and another thing is, that the creation and maintenance of that AI bot must be done frequently. But as OP has created a situation in which we have the AI bot already in complete form, to day trade in BTC. This means that AI must have all the necessary functions required by day traders. As, we all know day trading, has different strategies that could earn money. And day trading in BTC might be profitable as it is less volatile than ALTs.",

Why there's no chance of loss in your trading logic? Also, Day Trading requires trade to be completed before the day is over. So what if your criteria to close the trade isn't met on the same day? Will you close it with the on-going loss and Profit? If AI trading was beneficial, teams building GPT-4 would have worked on that directly.",

Just because it is an AI, it doesn't mean that it will rake you profits with assurance. No, it doesn't go like that as these AIs are also not perfect and can make mistakes.They're basing the data of the market based on what can be found through the interest and they can't do read future events so, there's no analysis that they can do pertaining to future market movements but only the past ones.Quote from: mk4 on September 13, 2023, 04:48:16 PMIf I actually found a way to use AI to trade bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency or asset in general effectively, simple — why the heck would I tell anyone?

AI can't perform well and make mistakes. Due to high volatility, it is difficult for AI to make predictions which leads to loss. Also, the bots are more expensive and very complex to use. And the most fearable thing is that the hacker can easily manipulate the AI bots which is lost for you in a huge amount. Although AI has some more potential benefits I can't recommend that you use AI,  Do your own research, Gain knowledge, and then do trading, it will be good enough from AI bots.",

A trading AI, if there is one, is supposed to be fully designed to somehow deal with different market trends and behavior.Technically, there are lots of \"what if\" sequences in its program where it has a designated strategy at each. The question is, with how volatile crypto is, can it really cover all those trends and make up a strategy for each? It's still good for me to use instead a trading bot and create an algorithm on our own.I know others will say that AI technology is really evolving and it can almost do what people can't do. Maybe it's best to try out that program for real, if possible, and do the conclusion based on its performance.",

This will make them lazy and lack the knowledge of trading in general because using AI to trade cannot allow someone to learn the knowledge that is required in trading, and AI doesn’t guarantee you profit, so I don’t think you should have an interest in that. I think you should focus and learn your trading skills and the technical analysis that is required.

Bitcoin is an investment asset and that has not changed to this day.Using the help of bots in trading will not provide satisfactory results in terms of the desired profit targets because crypto prices are very volatile and it is difficult to predict the daily closing price.I can't say for sure that the bot can provide profits to traders who use its help for that reason.Hopefully I'm not wrong.",
