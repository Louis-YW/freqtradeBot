      "body": "I've discussed Ulbricht's case with some people just recently. Overall, I don't think people like him should be in prison, let alone have a life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. His crime was non-violent, but I also do understand why he got such a harsh punishment. He challenged the system a lot by defying the court, making a marketplace what doesn't need any governmental oversight and selling, among other things, opiates. Opiates are a very sensitive topic in the US because they still have overdose deaths on the rise. Still, a guy like that would be more useful working for the country, not against it or rotting in prison.But as for Trump, I simply don't trust him. I think he's just being a populist, telling people what they want to hear to win more votes in the upcoming elections. And then, once he's in power, he can continue doing what he always did, and that's not being pro-Bitcoin and not being libertarian. Also, commuting the sentence could be a possibility of parole without him actually getting parole, for example. He didn't say he'd pardon him or otherwise free him.",

He wants all future Bitcoin to be mined in the US. Trump made this promise to please Libertarian voters who have been campaigning for the legalization of drugs and the release of Ross Ulbricht. Politicians cannot be trusted but this promise is good enough to make him get votes from Bitcoiners and supporters of Ross.

This is the nature of politicians. My only concern is Trump's willingness to fulfill his promise of commuting the sentence of Ross Ulbricht when he gets to the White House.",

Yes, there's no other reason for doing this. I think Trump is trying to get the votes of all the Bitcoin maximalist and the supporters of Ross. And this is another way to bring down his opponent Biden because of the bad image of him in the cryptocurrency community. But here is the problem, Trump is not so clean too, he was also against cryptocurrencies and just saying he has a change of heart. Well yeah, you will change your heart if you are running for president and trying to get more supporters. They made this politics like Hollywood, all fake, all drama, all scripted, and it's all to manipulate the votes.

And his current conviction is just the tip of the iceberg. In his first term he tried to trade Ukraine away to slaughter in exchange for... moderately helping his reelection bid by forcing them to start an investigation into Biden. Trump was willing to trade away the security of the United States, in other words, for a few votes. He was willing to burn our Capitol building down in order to retain the presidency--even though this weakened us as a country. He didn't care how bad this was for our country. He just wanted to stay in office.All of the prominent figures Trump pardoned in his first term were either his campaign associates or large donors. Trump is for Trump, not the USA. This is unlike any previous American president, by the way.",

Yes, and since he cannot join the group of those two running for President, he needs to act that is also about cryptocurrencies. Here he goes.

Why now?  These guys, they are all funny. It looks like the candidates for President are all targeting about cryptocurrencies because they know the people are hooked there so they are using this strategy to get their votes. I don't even know if it's working. People are wiser now especially those who are into crypto. Because you need to be wise or else you will be scammed or rug pulled. I guess it's all about cryptocurrencies now and it's just normal that a new president should know something about it too.",
