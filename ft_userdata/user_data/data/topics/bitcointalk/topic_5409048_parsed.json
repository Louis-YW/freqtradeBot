Just to get the idea, go on look for the past trends like ICO, NFT, P2E, IEO and all of those.Once the trend for this ENS, there will be another build up but AFAIK, this is related to the web 3.0 and that will be also the trend possible trend so it all goes down in connection.",

Simply some people wants to easily remember there address and show off there assets since not all people wants privacy on crypto this days because everyone is still obligated to pay there taxes and track all there transactions for filing tax report unlike before that you can really feel the anonymous vibe without regulators badgering on all of your crypto transactions.This name service project really kill the purpose of decentralisation but new investors on crypto don't prioritized privacy anymore and just focus on gains.",

My thought on this would be that they could be trying to book a space by doing that registration and expecting someone to take fancy to it and buy it off them. It's a business strategy for them. I've read where companies and business concerns buy existing domain names that rhyme with their business. I think that should be the game plan of those doing .name thing now.",

Benefits are their product got expose and if its useful then people will buy their tokens and used it to their desire. If its profitable or good then it will sell and developers would earn out of it. Sometimes royalty or if they have shares of tokens from creating the projects. Well it depends, case to case basis.",

Second, your domain does not just represent a single address; it represents your website, your addresses, and others. Third, you can also put your brand or company in your domain. That would be a kind of promotion. Finally, of course, you can sell your domain with a profit.",
