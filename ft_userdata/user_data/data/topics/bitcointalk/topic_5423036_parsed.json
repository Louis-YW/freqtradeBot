Try to grab more knowledge on it and search some good articles via surfing it on google since you can reach out some important statistics also other things what you need.Also try to read what people discuss to know the insights and sentiments of the people on current condition of the industry. Anyways good luck so hopefully you will have courage to try since crypto really change lives if you spend more time to learn more about it.",

A time in 2020, bitcoin was $7000, but in 2021, it reached $69000 before falling back to $16000 now. If you have bought it at $7000 in 2020 and sold some at $50000 in 2021, that is not a small amount of profit. You can just do that now too when bitcoin price has already falled and find a good investment means by investing in it.",

Yes if you invest while price is low and about driving up well you may be lucky to have some profit depending on how long the bull last. I don't subscribe that people should keep the idea of btc making them wealthy , just have it as an option to your investment or you invest after close to halving and immediately after the halving because it is shorter to expect profit then than locking up your capital for long and expecting profit that you could get if you invested in a fast turn over business even with little profit the fast turn over can lead to good margin profit on long time.",

With it your money is save from excessive devaluation like local fiat's, also an hedge against inflation.

It's heavily recommended to have steady cashflow/s first before buying something like bitcoin as bitcoin can't necessarily pay your bills unless you wait 5+ years.That's true, unfortunately. If you have a steady flow of cash from a job or a business, you can always put 10% of it into bitcoin each month and not worry about the price. What's the worst thing that can happen? Bitcoin goes down 20%? You just lose 10% of your 10% which is like nothing. When you're someone with no income investing their savings, a 20% reduction in that can make you lose sleep. Quote from: Stepstowealth on November 24, 2022, 10:26:23 PMThe same news about bitcoin value being low that is discouraging many people from it is the same news that has attracted me here. That's also what made me interested in 2015 when we were scraping the bottom. Invest what you're comfortable with. Bitcoin will be higher than it is today, but we won't give you the exact time. It can be next year or in 3 years. Make sure you can survive without the money you put in bitcoin for at least 3 years, without having to borrow money or sell your home to buy food",

And while it is wrong, the history of Bitcoin's price has proven that it was true. However, what happened in the past won't happen again. That Bitcoin could grow a thousand fold is a thing of the past. It was true before. Sadly, it cannot happen once more. If there were people who quickly grew rich because of Bitcoin, it wasn't really because of Bitcoin. It was simply because of timing. Today, it is wishful thinking to even expect Bitcoin to grow a hundred fold. So to consider Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick investment is plain nonsense.",
