      "body": "Freewallet is one of the worst custodial wallet you can use, they have many scam accusations in the past and till now. But why using custodial wallet when there are open source noncustodial wallets? With noncustodial wallet, you will have full control over your coins, instead of depending on third party, depend on yourself. For bitcoin, you can use Electrum.To download: https://electrum.orgPGP signature verification",

      "body": "$27k is such a huge amount to trust a custodial wallet with a lot of bad feedback if you're going to put a lot of money into one wallet, noncustodial is the only wallet you can trust Electrum and Exodus are just two of the noncustodial wallet, people should ignore noncustodial wallet if it's just for storage, based on your story it's unlikely that you are going to get your money because of the so many bad feedbacks here, but still, upload your proofs here for reference. I hope we're wrong and your can still get your money",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 10, 2022, 09:19:22 AM--snip-- I'm sorry for your loss and i only can you suggest to contact them publicly (e.g. using Twitter or Reddit).--snip--That's about the only advice that can be given... In the past, they seemed to somewhat care if they got negative public feedback (probably because to much negative feedback might decrease the number of people that open an account with them, and less users mean less people to scam).They have an account on bitcointalk. I don't know if it's still active, but in the past i've seen people getting their own money back after making big public scam accusations on bitcointalk, twitter, reddit, facebook, trustradius, google appstore,... If you want to have *any* chance, i'd advice you to go big... Tell the truth, but tell it on as many places as you can.I've adviced people to lawyer up in the past, but for some reason i've never heared anybody succesfully sueing them, i don't know where their headquarters are located but it's possible it's in a country where it's difficult to sue somebody over crypto.By the way, if you ever succeed in getting your money back, get out and run... Move all your funds to a non-custodial wallet as soon as possible... Sure, they'll tell you that your account is now active again, so you won't have problems with them anymore, just ignore this and move all your money. You have now learned that custodial wallets (like freewallet, which is more of a very shady exchange than a wallet anyway) can lock your own money whenever they want to... Don't fall for this again.",

If it's the latter, especially if the payment term is FOB --or worse, EXW--, maybe if it's possible, you'll want to start considering to arrange to send the goods back? Given how long will this refund process from Freewallet --if they'll ever-- could take, I can't imagine how huge will the bill incurred from THC, demurrage, and storage and other late fee. The possibility of detention charge as well. Or, at the very least, wrote an MOU or arrange something with your original seller that you'll pay them after certain amount of time, an L/C perhaps? Not sure if you still can do L/C after the product is already on your port, though, but do everything you can to take that container out of the port. The fees themselves would drain you immensely if you waited for the fund from freewallet to be liquidated.",
