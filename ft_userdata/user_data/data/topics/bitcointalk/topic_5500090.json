Instead, they send cryptocurrency directly to your wallet address.OmegaStarScream is right. Exchanges are generally cheaper and easier to use, especially if you're already comfortable with them. But, this \"kiosk\" thing does have some advantages. Anonymity is one, for example. You don't need to go through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures for smaller purchases, at least where I live. And, some companies offer promotional periods with fee discounts, so buying or selling can sometimes be even cheaper than on online exchanges. For instance, Bitomat.com (formerly Shitcoins.club) currently has a 0% commission promotion for sales in Bulgaria, Croatia, and Slovenia. link to Bitomat blog",

It reminds me of a famous old Bitcoin mixer that was giving you the private keys of an address with coins. I like it, there might be a moment when you don't have access to your Bitcoin wallet or don't want to use device where you have your coins, so you buy a wallet that is filled with coins, it's like prepaid visa cards.I personally support the idea but 7% is too much to charge for this service. I don't know who uses ATMs with extremely high fees and terrible exchange rates. My friend has one Bitcoin ATM in his restaurant but no one uses it because rates are inappropriate.",

Yeah, its definitely true that using one of those Bitcoin vending machines could let someone spying on you steal your private key if it gets printed on the wallet receipt.  I mean, those new to crypto dont really get how risky that can be yet.  Makes sense why there dont seem to be as many of those machines around anymore, even though they did help more folks learn about Bitcoin back in the day.   I remember when my buddy first showed me how to use one at the mall.  We were pumped to get our first fraction of a bitcoin.  but then I realized later that anyone could have peeked over my shoulder and gotten my key.  I would definitely be a lot more careful today.",

Maybe there are some of them, but I think their reviews or insights about the experience are still not enough. I think the only way we could know if something is effective and efficient is if we actually use it or are introduced to it more, even on social media, so many people will have an idea that this thing actually exists.  I hope this ATM could also be put in the country where I am, but of course someone should fund it, but for now I think it is still impossible. We can just know the experience of those who have actually used it, and I envy them. Anyway it is a great experience for those who could use it.",

It makes sense if those companies add such warning on their automatic machine. A warning like \"You should buy bitcoin at a minimal value which can be used for a next transaction like $20, $50.

This is more like reducing the privacy and self custody associated with that account  Since your private keys were printed by a third party. Its risky because in the event of the company's data being compromised, then your wallet already is and there may be cases funds theft if the company employs a wayward staff and clients  funds are very much vulnerable.What if I loose it?, my funds are gone since the person currently having it can have access to the private keys (let's assume it can print the private keys to the new holder).I can never keep a lot of money in such a wallet because I see it as a centralized scheme. Also I kind of prefer using bitcoin ATM since I can just make purchases easily by loading it with fiat and paying with it in bitcoin at a go.",

This works even with bitcoin if you don’t have any digital fiat to exchange with bitcoin and you just want to exchange it directly.Another scenario is if you are running and you suddenly need some bitcoin (which I agree seems unrealistic but hear me out here), you can easily exchange your fiat to bitcoin right here.It might seem more of an inconvenience right now but this looks like a good step towards mass adoption of bitcoin.
