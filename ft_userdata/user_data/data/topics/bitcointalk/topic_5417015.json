      "body": "I saw your topic and it was synonymous to some topic I responded to yesterday in the trading board of the forum for which I think, this thread is also best suited. Well, I felt you created the topic for which I am referring but was wrong on that although, I discover you yo be veryuch interested in trading and that's that's good thing.I would however advice that, you learn these analytical methods and practice them. Joining these groups where they share signals and explain the analytical steps to have arrived at that point of deriving an entry then shre it to the rest of the supposed group is something but, you could also learn that from past analysis that surfaced in the market and not necessarily trading a signal because the analyst was able to say, \"because of that, this would happen\" and give out a signal. Its still not 100% and could go wrong.Device your own pattern and see I work. Also, try to have a plan B when it's not working. It could be leaving the market entirely or maybe, not trading the pair for sometime or something that keeps you away from so much risk.",

      "body": "for day trading. dont be trying to follow some influencers signals. they are just pump and dump influencers hoping for people to sheep floow them so that the sheep move the price for the influencers profit. not the sheeps benefit(by the time you read the signal. influencers have already acted upon it, meaning your not at the front of the herd, you are the last sheep , the end if the line... meaning your not going to get all the benefits))instead stop thinking someone or some site can tell you the perfect time to buy/sell to make 300% quick.. it never worksif you are going to wait for a year to make 300% be smart and risk adversemake just 1% a day which will add up to more then 300% over a yeareach day the price moves/wiggles by more then $190 (1% of $19k)so its not difficult to achievethrowing in large amounts hoping for large changes, can also cause you to be waiting a long time to achieve such where most of the time waiting your left at a negative positiontake your fiat reserves, and split it into 10 allotmentsthat way when you buy in at 1 dip to put it as a sell for 1% higher. your not then locked in if the price further drops as you have 9 more opportunities to take the next dip below the first. thus you take more opportunities. and when they fill, the combined profits add up. without the risks and without missing opportunities. there is no \"live\" signal that can predict the daily pricethere are some fundamental economics based on the 6moth+ logic of trading. but not the daily predictive stuffso just be smart. take small bites of profit with little risk as those small bites add up over timebuy low sell highbuy the dip not the hyperides the normal tide waves dont wait for the tsunami",

      "body": "I am a beginner in bitcoin, I think in trading WE should not depend on others. looking for news is necessary, but we must be able to organize our thoughts so as not to get caught up in trading. Just try to think that everyone who trades is a BUSINESSER so don't get caught up in the words of people who are looking for their own profit. For example, there is news like this: bitcoin today will rise to a very high price and he mentions this and that reason, even though he who spreads the news will sell bitcoins in large quantities. well of course many people are tempted by his words and finally many people are tempted by his words, and finally buy bitcoin by speculating that bitcoin will go up in price very high. and after being purchased, the bitcoin price immediately fell. and in the end the one who buys loses. and I speak like this based on my personal experience. so basically be yourself, don't be greedy in trading and don't panic when the price drops.",

Beware that some are just fake treaders.Tradingview also has an ideas stream feature where traders post their TAs and predictions. Just make sure you don't follow what they say religiously, but learn from how they carry out TA so that you can do it for yourself later.",

Most of you can find out there are paid live TA guides in the webinar but I think there is no difference in learning them from other sources. I have a good source where you can learn about TA and also FA.Check this link https://github.com/SpiralDevelopment/Awesome-Crypto-Trading It includes courses and free tools that you can read and then use the free tool like the trading simulator to try the strategies you learn from the course.",
