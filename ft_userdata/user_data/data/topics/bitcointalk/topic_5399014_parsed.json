For me I think itâ€™s a personal decision, you can decide to wear an avatar and join a signature campaign the rules are not against earning money legitimately. The only problem I see is making bounties, signature campaigns your sole aim of being here.",

Because there are a lot of similar motivational posts in the section for beginners, but unfortunately, few people really follow them. I find posts like this from newbies a little silly since such words should come from people who can talk about their experience.But I read your posts and I see that you are trying, so I will give you the first merit as a motivation for further development. If you ever think that being on this forum is a waste of time, just go back to your topic. Try not to give up, and you will certainly join this society and will be able to give advice on diligence to future newcomers.",

This is a community and quality discussions with other forum members is what gives a sense of belonging. Even contributions which are not public like reports to moderators are very useful.If there are any threads at all where a user asks a question or makes an inquiry and gets a useful response, that right there represents the forum.If the sole purpose here is to get paid, then you would find it difficult contributing and you do not have to, if you feel you're not getting the benefit you desire from it.",

I wanted to second you but unfortunately I lacked merit to do that. We all need encouragement to bring out the best in one another. The globe is becoming a tougher place unlike what it was a few decades ago. People are really going through a lot this day. Depression and frustration may be biting and hitting hard on people who won't voice it for fear of getting mocked.",

Don't let money be the driving force for you being here OP, else you will easily get discouraged when things do not go as you want. The forum offers an opportunity to earn stipends, it is not an entitlement. It will interest you to know OP that there are some high ranking consistent members here who have no need for the stipends maybe due to their economy, are not members of any signature campaign but still gainfully contribute. It is a choice.",

Forum opportunities and referals to successful jobs that have helped in the past will help give everyone a sense of belonging.Specifically getting payment here is the matter of engagement, seriousness, activeness and consciousness, i will let you know that time factor and seriousness is the highest point of been elected in this community, i will assure all the newbies that the effort of most of us in signature campaign is what gives us the privilege to emerg to the paying campaign. Newbie are to learn from the seniors colleagues in order to get advance comprehension of bitcoin and advance understanding of how to get elevated",
