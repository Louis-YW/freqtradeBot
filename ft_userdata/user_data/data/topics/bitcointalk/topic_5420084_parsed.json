I am sure that there will be some people who can be cringing to the idea where only a very few are controlling the market and this is is where CZ is thrown right now...whether intentionally or otherwise. Certainly, there are many things leaders of the crypto industry can learn from this development and I am hoping they really do...so they don't have to come to CZ for some relief package.",

Don't borrow if you run a crypto business.You can make loan but it is similar to margin trading. Risk management should be done very well. Obviously the best is avoiding loan and too high leverage for your crypto business.For stable coin, your business should have fiat currency as collateral, not Bitcoin or altcoins. UST from Terra is a good example for how such non-fiat collateral will cause collapse.",

If they took loans, you wouldn't know anyway. No one they're still paying a loan of too is going to come out and crash the exchange on purpose.Quote from: Esther C on November 09, 2022, 11:01:35 AMCan someone please explain the no. 3 more in-depth please.He seems to be meaning \"don't run a crypto exchange like a bank\".If you're running an exchange in crypto you're better off having 100% of your users funds segregated and covered (especially larger dormant accounts that might come back). Whether this is what he actually does and isn't something just put on a tweet remains something we'll probably find out one day.Most large companies have between 60-100% debt to assets and get considered more efficient because of it (somehow - probably because the biggest people buying them are the people lending to them) this is likely an unsustainable model for a crypto exchange though in comparison. Don't know what binance is going to hold their profits in now though. I'm wondering how futures and margin started without taking on debt though as the interest paying sections came years after them.

It has more to do with the rise and fall in the value of the underlying crypto asset, which translates to more or less profits in USD quoted from the base currency.Yes, I meant it. At least people must choose an asset that can give them a most stable collateral value. Nothing is perfect if they choose one cryptocurrency as a collateral even it is Bitcoin. Even stable coins can lose their values like $UST.But if I choose between Bitcoin / altcoins and stable coins for my collateral, I will choose a stable coin but that one should be a good one.QuoteUsing people's money as collateral even with stablecoins can still fuck things up if the market goes against the opened positions. Stablecoins do make the positions bulletproof from liquidation. The problem is too much greed by the so-called exchanges.It is right. Having your position against the market movement, market trend will kill you. Whatever collateral type won't be able to save you if you get such positions.I implied about the risk of liquidation because of your collateral gets serious loss in its value that will put your position in liquidation risk even it is not too bad.",
