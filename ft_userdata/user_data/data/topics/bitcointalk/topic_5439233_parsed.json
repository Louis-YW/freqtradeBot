I have learn from my mistakes way back 2018, wherein I have a supposedly good projects and a holder of it and thinking that I can make a lot of money from it in the next bull run. However, just like in this case, it went dead in the bull run and nothing, not even a cent that I earn from this project (I totally forget the name of it), way before I found this community.Anyways, that is the risk is very high for altcoins, even if it is launch by Binance launchpad, and I will say that there should be some element of luck on it before it become big and successful.",

Most of the time happening for new projects, they use the word \"hack\" to be their exit plan so nobody could think that they are scammers but they are. Maybe I was wrong in my assumption but new projects can't be trusted and are too risky to invest in. If we want to invest make sure that we are also investing the right coins and stop thinking about the x100, x1000, and more as this will end up investing hyped coins.",

This is a very big lesson that will not be forgotten even to the next generation. I always advise people to try as much to make concrete research before thinking of investing in any altcoin. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency I can be rest assured that we will not experience anything like rug pull or crashing. Making altcoin projects in the market are for personal gain. If you are the CEO of the project, are you not going to try as much to make more Money even though you don't have the intension of running away with people funds. Some people are just extra ordinary wicked to create a coin and at the end run away with people's funds.",

Diversification towards different projects (if you are focusing on crypto) is a good approach especially when you are just new to investing in crypto. Being an altcoin investor is more risky compare to just invest purely into Bitcoin. It has a higher risk, but has a higher reward. As for me, whenever I'm investing into altcoins, I'd rather invest into the top altcoins in terms of market cap, but even that, I'm still doing research because we've seen top altcoins went bankrupt or a fraud project or a scam project. Diversifying towards different crypto coins is better, but diversifying towards different assets is for me the best approach.Quote from: Outhue on February 09, 2023, 05:21:07 PMAlso, I prefer projects from the Binance launch pad because binance don't just list any projects, 85% of all projects that used Binance launchpads are successful.I personally am not a fan of new projects though I know that there are some projects that are becoming successful.
