  "content": "Hi Everyone,A few years ago, I bought some bitcoin (very small amount, don't worry) and wrote down the 12 mnemonic words on small flashcards. I recently found these cards but seem to have forgotten what the order of the words were. Is there a method using python or any other tools to figure out the order of the words?The number of bitcoins in this was less than 0.04, and as such expensive computational resources would be out of the scope.My rough thoughts lead me to believe that there are 12! possible wallets which is 479,001,600 possible combinations.I read this post online where it claimed that BIP39 uses a checksum word. Does anyone know how / if this checksum can be used for valid mnemonic determination?https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79249/i-have-my-12-word-bip39-phrase-but-not-in-the-right-orderAny help would be appreciated.",

I recently found these cards but seem to have forgotten what the order of the words were. I just ignore what you find (small flashcards). I have a question, What wallet did you use?I've also had this case before where the words cannot be read clearly. But, I try to remember the wallet I used and try to find that wallet file on my ext drive. After I found it, I just imported it to the wallet and worked.",

If you don't it will still be possible, but you'll need to set up an address database first. It would also be useful if you know that the address you used was the first (or at least one of the first) addresses in that wallet.",

With 12 words, there are indeed 479,001,600 possible permutations, so this method could be time-consuming.The BIP39 checksum is used to detect errors in the mnemonic phrase, but it won't help you recover the correct word order....The checksum might help as an optimization. I think it is faster to validate the checksum than it is to check if the phrase generates a known address.So, for each permutation, first checking the checksum would eliminate 93.75% of them. For the remaining 6.25% you would still have to check against the known addresses.",

The checksum is a single SHA256, while to generate an address you need 2048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512, a variable number of further rounds of HMAC-SHA512 alongside elliptic curve multiplication to work down the derivation path, and then three SHA256s, one RIPEMD160, and a Base58 conversion to turn that final public key in to an address.Still, the account you are replying to is an AI spammer, which is why the script they shared is nonsense.",

I initially didn't have my public address and tried to figure out how to use the public address database to decode but was unsuccessful.Then I was able to trace back some of my old transactions to public address and was able to use it to crack the order of the wallet. It only took 115 minutes using my hardware, which is pretty solid. Successfully recovered 0.0309 btc.Thank you everyone for your help, Much Appreciated!",

If it was 24 words, I would've been less sure, since that's even more possible combinations and would take in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands or even millions possibly.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on September 08, 2023, 12:35:31 PMFortunately current btcrecover developer already provide such address database, although it was last updated on 2022.

      "body": "Not sure where you got half a billion from?If you have a benchmark for calculating 12!, then to calculate 24 you would need to take that benchmark and multiply it by 13*14*15*...*23*24. More easily written as 24!/12!.24!/12! is over 1 thousand trillion. With 115 minutes for 12 words, then it would be around 283 billion years for 24 words. (In reality it would be a bit quicker than this since with 12 words you can reject 93.75% of combinations as having an invalid checksum and with 24 words you can reject 99.61% of seed phrases, but that is not relevant.)",
