Value itself has to come from intrinsic specifications of Bitcoin like its decentralization, limited supply (21M bitcoins), and its utilities.To debunk your wrong thinking about value, you can see many examples of shitcoins, meme tokens, that can rise very high, in their prices and market caps, but when FOMO disappeared, these shitcoins and meme tokens lost their unrealistic overvalued prices and fell down like 99% or more.These examples show that prices can be high and can be very overvalued too, while true values are the same.If you want to find reasons to believe more in Bitcoin, let's readThe bullish case for BitcoinHow is the 21 million bitcoin cap defined and enforced",

I agree with you that Bitcoin has spread around the world to be more popular today, because it has helped nations to eliminated delay in transactions and it has also helped nations to reduced unemployment.Anyone has an opinion on what is more valuable to them, and he believes in bitcoin, which is why he says it is the best investment. You are correct that they have something more reliable than bitcoin, and you need a large amount to begin with. Real estate, land, and property are all investments, but you can't guarantee that when you invest in them, you'll make a lot of money because in some places that don't have values and go and buy some lands, if the places haven't improved and have a lot of people, they won't buy them with a lot of money. So, op prefers to invest in bitcoin because he believes he will gain a large sum of money in bitcoin if he invest on it.And I would prefer to start my investment with bitcoin and then return to Real Estate and other physical businesses, because I can utilize my bitcoin profit to acquire land while keeping my bitcoin going smoothly. However, if you establish a business and he does not favor you, you will undoubtedly lose your funds, so anything is risky, and everyone goes for what will benefit him most. Bitcoin investment is always the best option to invest in online because is only him that is more better and can minimise your risk, many people have engaged themselves on online crypto update because people have started believing that there is a lot of opportunity on them if they are patient enough to invest on them, it is very hard to ask someone about bitcoin that he won't know about because he is full everywhere now, and I can say that is all this Airdrop some people are doing that make Bitcoin will gradually become something that people will want to invest in before anything else. I believe in bitcoin since it is volatile no matter what anytime he decrease i know that one day he will increase and you will definitely get something at of it is all about patient and get enough knowledge on bitcoin.",

But remember, no one will guarantee that the price of Bitcoin will continue to grow. Even to reach $500k or more.

So I agree with you that we don't need to do aggressive marketing of Bitcoin potentials to family and friends, the adoption is increasing and when it gets to their turn to embrace it and I see their interest that is when I can impart my Bitcoin knowledge to them.

Bitcoin is the most popular coin on crypto market. Bitcoin has much potentiality and it is growing high and high. However it was dream once when bitcoin hit thousand of dollar after climbing it was breaking one after another level. We are dreaming to hit 100k$ now at the moment.Surely we will touch it soon. Though we have few downfall but the market will recover soon and surely it will touch its level. That's why it is more popular as currency.",
