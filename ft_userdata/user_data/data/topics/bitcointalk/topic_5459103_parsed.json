If you want to play roulette, then just invest at random, in everything you see first Investment rounds? Where is it located at? I only remember games and rounds and investor-based games here in the forum. Looking at who is investing in the project is not enough. We might see a big investor but we shouldn't be happy and do the same thing because it might only be a whale or a part of the projects team whose goal is to manipulate the value of the coin.Good thing, you gave other factors and we should also check them to have a better judgment of the project. Your response here seems the one the OP is looking for but I think its title is a little different. At first I thought he is looking for those privacy-based coins like Monero.",

Each of them makes an ANN about the project they are going to run. We often find in ANN if member photos displayed in ANN like to cheat.No matter how good their concept is, it is very likely that the many that appear in the crypto space will end up being scams.The unique piece of advice you can hear from people is be careful.Switch to Bitcoin if you don't want to feel the pain of being tricked.",

I've got mistake in the past that I've decided to go all in for a few projects and altcoins that I thought will rise in the future. But that didn't happened so a mistake that I'm learning and applying the lesson to myself now.",

If you are looking for crypto with higher security and it must be bitcoin which is truly decentralized currency. Your topic is a bit off topic caused by you were asking about how to identify a scam project. The main concern if you shall try to take a look at the background from the project. As long as the project backed by some big names and i can assume if they have been fully doxxed.

However it is true that if you mean crypto currencies by digital currency then yes crypto currencies contained higher securities from the fiat currency holding or putting on bank. But you have also reminded that not all cryptocurrencies are contained that higher security. In this case you have to find the best one for the best security, and for this, you have to follow some facts before choosing that currency like that should be well decentralised eco system ,, there is a good one that is Bitcoin.",
