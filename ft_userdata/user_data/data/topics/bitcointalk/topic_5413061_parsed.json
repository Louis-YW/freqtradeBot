Sure it can go up but that can be because of various different reasons. The whole movement for PoS is driven, not only by enviromental reasons but reasons for saving energy because of the uncertain situation in Europe. And i am starting to think that even the flippening has a real change again pretty soon and BTC could lose the marketcap dominance. I know this has been predicted from the start by some people and their predctions have failed so far, but i think that we are entering to whole another era now.",

We only think the bottom is already reached out and the coins are now recovering but it could be another trap again and the real bottom is only yet to come. Even if the coin hasn't reached its bottom, it is still possible for them to recover and sometimes the recovery is much better. For the question if when will the alts go parabolic, I think the time for it to come is near because many people are expecting it already.Quote from: X-ray on September 12, 2022, 05:35:21 AMBitcoin is going to be parabolic as well.

Ethereum is 20% of the marketcap while Bitcoin is about the double of it, it is a very good achievement for ethereum to stay this high at this time in the bear. Now the merge is done, which I think is the great biggest news of development in the space this year, lets see what goes ahead with the price and other altcoins.

The price of bitcoin tends to decrease so that it has a decreasing impact on altcoins, so the impact of the Ethereum merger has not been felt. But if there is a rally in the price of bitcoin, it will be a sign for the altcoin market to start moving, and at that time, the price of Ethereum may start to increase. Yes, we must be more patient at this time because the situation is still unstable, and the market can move anywhere.",

Some altcoins might pump but will still go back to their low price because they follow the status of Bitcoin.In the past months, altcoins have good rises because Bitcoin after its dump has been in an accumulation time. This accumulation of Bitcoin is a support for altcoins to rise because capital flow needs to change from Bitcoin to altcoins. Because they are not able to get profit in Bitcoin, they must choose altcoins alternatively. Market makers need time to complete their accumulation in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, they decide to pump altcoins. It's how the crypto market and capital flow in crypto market work.QuoteThe altcoin rally is still quite far but it's a good sign that some altcoins are showing a little pump. I don't think the upcoming Ethereum merge has a huge effect on them. In bear market, altcoins lose more than 90% of their price from all time high. Effects on altcoins are from Bitcoin, not Ethereum.",

But we must remember that it's all predictions that we don't know will happen or just cheer us up during this bear market. But I feel that if the price of bitcoin can increase drastically, the movement of altcoins will get crazier and there will be many altcoins that can also increase, especially for altcoins that have not had time to increase in the altcoin season yesterday.
