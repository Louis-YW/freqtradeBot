It is not fine tuned yet for mining but the for the initial tests that we have seen it is just a bit over 130 Mhsh in Ethash and Etchash algorithms.The problem with that card is that it consumes a lot of power and there have been a lot of reported cases that it usually burns the connectors with the passing of time,not just one case but several cases,so this card offers not a whole lot more than the 3090 which at least is stable and it does burns out the power connector.",

The company posted in its community forum, saying that it won’t be making next-generation Nvidia graphics cards but will continue to sell and support “the existing current generation products.” According to Gamers Nexus, the company doesn’t currently have plans to make AMD or Intel graphics cards.https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/16/23357031/evga-nvidia-graphics-cards-stops-makingThe second problem is in return on investment and relation to profit with possible problems.",

I have a lot of cheap open cases and don't want to spend money on closed cases or extra ventilation.Good point. First - all cards with gddr6x need attention, some early some later. This are extra costs, lose in warranty and so on. No good deal in my opinion, but i don´t know how good the cooling of the new rtx4000 series is, maybe it is better, but i would avoid gddr6x cards for mining, or use it only on core intensive algos.The point with the cases - i can feel it. In 2017 i build complete rigs for around 1500€ and nowadays, people pay 1000€ for a closed CASE only, many bought cards for the double price, bought pretested china riser for the triple price and than we talk about ROI?

If you're not a graphics fanatic, then a $60 graphics card would be a good buy. But I would buy 1070 or 1080 which have better performance in modern games but cost a little more.Yes agree that 1070 have better performance but price for rx470 makes best price/performance.I think it depends on the games. rx470 4gb with non-working fans are already on sale for 35-45 dollars. It's very cheap.For 35-45 i will buy 8 or 16 of them. Where is it? In Russia, these video cards cost 4,500 rubles, which is about $63. You can buy wholesale from miners or in China for $45, but the condition will be very bad after 5 years of mining. There are also mining edition video cards with 1 video output, they are even cheaper. Search in your country or China on aliexpress and similar marketplaces.",
