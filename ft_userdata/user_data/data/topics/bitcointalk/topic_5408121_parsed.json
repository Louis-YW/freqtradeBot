After a while, the effect fades away and the price drops to a lower level, but still higher than before. I doubt that we will see a new ATH for ETH with the merge as the price needs to more than double for that.",

But you can see that a lot of them are hyping it buy I'm not buying everything those so called experts.Just remember that we are still in the bear market, it just reaches it's all time low. So I would be calling a sudden flip just because of this news. But if we are talking about a short term upside then why not, but it's not going to be sustainable in this kind of situation.",

Thoughts?You know speculation has risk of incorrect speculation.The Merge is a very big event for Ethereum community but do you think their developers will launch it when the general market is still very bearish. They are not stupid to do that so the launch would happen in bear market, with best conditions for Ethereum speculative show.Do you think it is best time for them to do it?In my opinion, it is not that time hence I don't believe Ethereum will get its new all time high any time soon from now.",

Yes, Ethereum may have made the trend recently but it doesn't mean it could go way up without the help of a Bitcoin pump. Remember, that ATH didn't come from that merge news because it was just reported recently and not when they are being dragged by the Bitcoin pump at $60k each. There will be investors, old and new but I doubt it could be pulled as far up as what happened before.",

Ethereum after the upgrade will significantly increase throughput and scalability, which will allow you to abandon most of the L2 solutions, which will undoubtedly attract more users to this blockchain. The main thing is that this update should not be postponed to a later date.",

Thoughts?From my previous known experience, i have seen that when there is a pump in Bitcoins, all the altcoins follow BTC.So we can only expect all time high for ETH when BTC starts rising. But currently seeing the bull market, it’s obvious that it will take more time to see a pump in the coins.In the mean time we can buy these coins and add in our portfolio. In a month or two BTC will surely rise and with the rise of BTC, ETH and other coins will also rise and all the investors will get huge profit.",

Thoughts?My general take on Ethereum has always been that it probably is just as important for the whole cryptomarket and its evolution and development as Bitcoin itself. Of course Bitcoin basically created the whole crypto space because before Bitcoin there simply were not cryptocurrencies existent. Ethereum has brought a whole new dimension of opportunities and possibilities to the crypto market though with the introduction of the smart contracts. Without them we would not have Dexes, no tokens, no Defi and no NFT's.I doubt though that we will see a new ATH for Ethereum anytime soon, because the whole market is just still to shaky for that to happen in my opinion.",

Ethereum has been breaking through $1700 for a while and that provides a bit of optimism for many traders who were expecting more surprises to come from this digital coin. Of course, I believe it will go up because ETH is one of the currencies that brought bitcoin to its throne. Talking about speculation, there are many people who previously bet on the price of BTC will correct to the price of US $ 13,500.",

But you can still speculate to see ATH for ETH soon but you should have another plan if your speculation is not going to happen. I still think that ETH needs more time to rise or we can say recover step by step before or after the merge for ETH. If the investor is confident that the merge for ETH can bring a good thing for them, they will give their big support to ETH and that can help the price to start rising. Otherwise, we still need to wait and be more patient to see the price rise.",
