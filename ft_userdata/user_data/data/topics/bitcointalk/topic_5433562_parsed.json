Actually, there are still many other types of coins that are worth investing in except shitcoin LUNC, I even doubt their future career.",

The man himself is in hiding and cannot appear in public in fear of being deported and arrested by the authorities.

It doesn't even make sense to expect a huge pump to come again,that's enough for people to continue their stupidity to buy this shit scam dead coin. I hope that those stupid investors will be realized there are better coins in the market than this one.

Also, if a token has already a bad reputation, then why would you risk your funds investing into it? Everything especially market prices in this industry are solely dependent with the demand. Impression and image of the token highly affects the demand which I think makes it a risky investment. This is likewise with projects before which somehow made it to the top but eventually fall; the idea of them being able to be back on their feetm Such thing is possible but I only saw such instances with major coins of this technology annd the reason I guess is the community of users as well as the utility of those particular tokens.",
