People lose their cryptocurrencies regardless of how they store them, whether it's hacking a CEX, downloading a fake wallet, clipboard malware, or exposing their backup or maybe losing it after a while. When it comes to HW, there is always the possibility that at some point someone malicious did something wrong, which means that it could be someone in the factory or the one who delivers the package.As far as I know, none of the companies that have gained a reputation have ever been accused of such things, but when it comes to HW, people mostly lose their cryptocurrencies because they enter seeds into fake wallets or are victims of clipboard malware that changes the coin address without them knowing.2. You can't know that, the only thing you can do is trust that the company you bought the device from has no bad intentions. However, if the device is open source, then I think there is a possibility to verify the method by which the seed is created, i.e. that this method is safe and random.3. For me, Ledger lost its reputation a long time ago, which you can read about in many threads in this board, and as for the second choice, I can't say anything because I'm not familiar with how good or bad it is. The prevailing opinion right now is that best HW for Bitcoin is Passport, which of course has a price that you should be ready to pay.",

Has anyone ever reported that they lost their cryptos stored in hardware wallets? I think it is possible for the manufacturers to tamper with their products. But till now I haven't heard or read any news about which someone who bought a ledger, and safepal from the official platforms and faced hacking issues. Plus after reading the policy of Ledger hardware wallets, you can claim the warranty within the timespan of 2 years if your wallets do not follow conformity. Point is, you can claim a defected hardware wallet but I think you can not claim the funds that you lost in that defect wallet. Quote from: Walter66 on September 17, 2023, 01:11:49 PM2- How do I know that the words I received will not be assigned to another user after some time in a hot or cold wallet? The words cannot be same, as ledger uses true random number generator (TRNG). Point is you have to understand how seed phrases are generated to get the answer to your query. Small explanation is, there are 2048 words from which different words will be made and if you are using a 24 words (seed phrase) then the combination is 2048*24. Which is equals to 3,320,769,675,556,062,850,796,210,216,064,294,951,921,238,704,640,860,049,951,290,741,255,962,051,166,208Now, it depends on the random number generator you are using. As if you are using hardware wallets then those wallets come with their own random number generators to provide the element of uniqueness. And for claim purposes, you can use the ledger's policy Quote from: https://shop.ledger.com/pages/terms-and-conditionsYour recovery phrase is unique. It is only communicated to you once when your Ledger Product is first activated. It consists of a random sequence of 24 words.Quote from: Walter66 on September 17, 2023, 01:11:49 PM3- I want to buy ledger nano s plus or safepal s1.  which one is good? (I only want for bitcoin)I think safepal is better than ledger as ledger hardware wallet provides a feature of recovery option which means they must have inscribed some type of code in the hardware wallet that could let them in or any other entity. The point is it hurts the main meaning of using a hardware wallet. But there are many features that are not present in Safepal but are present in Ledger. For example the following features. https://www.crypto-hardware.com/compare-hardware-wallets/",

Has anyone ever reported that they lost their cryptos stored in hardware wallets?There are cases when people lost their crypto stored in a hardwarewallet, but the cause of these losses was always the owner of the wallet. I want to say that at this moment there are no known cases of hacking of HW devices. Except when this was done by engineers to identify vulnerabilities (like a bounty program), but all these vulnerabilities were eliminated.It is possible that the manufacturing company initially interfered with the product and left the opportunity for subsequent access to all crypto assets of all users of their devices. This can't be verified due to the closed source code, for example, from Ledger. In theory, this is possible, but in practice, so far, no such cases have been identified (this doesn't mean that this can't happen in the future).Quote from: Walter66 on September 17, 2023, 01:11:49 PM2- How do I know that the words I received will not be assigned to another user after some time in a hot or cold wallet?No way.You will know about it, but it will be too late to change anything.Quote from: Walter66 on September 17, 2023, 01:11:49 PM3- I want to buy ledger nano s plus or safepal s1.  which one is good?

(I only want for bitcoin)DON'T BUY A LEDGER.Ledger is adding key extraction APIs to their wallets, which means they're not truly safe anymore.  Ledger says their key extraction code won't work with the Nano S, but their code isn't open, so they can't prove it.  Don't trust closed-source code.  Seriously, take it from somebody who owns Ledger wallets: don't buy a Ledger.  They've become untrustworthy.I'm not familiar enough with SafePal stuff to say whether it's good or not, but Ledger has become a terrible company.",

Start reading more about Bitcoin and cold storage, and when you are ready, your security will be taken to a higher level.",

The question is where the risks will be minimal. Certainly not on a closed source device, or are we still overestimating the value of open source code? Here, too, there may be errors in the code, allowing to lose crypto assets.Quote from: LoyceMobile on September 18, 2023, 01:14:51 PMAnd with both, people have been scammed by simply entering their seed phrase into a phishing site.But in this case, the loss was not due to a “bad” device, but due to the gasket between the monitor and the chair.",

Even more, if your HW already has a seed, be wary.However, you can generate new seed whenever you want (just make sure you keep safe the seed you have money on and not another seed words) and the chance of collision with somebody else's seed is so small it can be safely considered 0.Quote from: Walter66 on September 17, 2023, 01:11:49 PM3- I want to buy ledger nano s plus or safepal s1.  which one is good? (I only want for bitcoin)I have a Nano S. No issues for years. But: since then Ledger has proven itself risky in handling users' addresses. Since then Ledger came with \"seed recovery\" feature I am not comfortable with.So.. choose wisely.Even more, if you are afraid the manufacturer would tamper with the device, you may also consider adding to the list SeedSigner. It's not a HW \"by the book\" (for example you will have to do some actions and generate the seed yourself), also I don't own one yet, but imho it worth a look.",
