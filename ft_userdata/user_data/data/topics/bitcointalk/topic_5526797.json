Sorry huge newb here. And let's say one is an exchange..  having insane recieving funds is people selling to the exchange correct? Lastly. The site you linked. I see dates. Are these files I can download say 2024 dec 21 it'll show every single transaction that happened on that day for every wallet and transaction?",

Tried this and unsure if I'm clicking on the right examples as each time I'll click on on of the addresses to and from etc and i just get wallet with 1 or 2 transactions. Click on Kraken or bittrex for example. Then click on \"show wallet addresses\". This will give you a list of all addresses linked to thst exchanges along with the number of incoming transactions. You can download the CSV file to sort them more easily and  get the ones with the highest transactions count.",

I tried it with the Bittrex wallet addresses and found this one: 1N52wHoVR79PMDishab2XmRHsbekCdGquK with 452,211 transactions.",

This is also where you can spot the biggest exchanges. However, if an exchange claims to have high trading volumes but this activity isn’t reflected in their wallet addresses, they might just be faking the volume.",

No. The transactions you see on Blockchain related to exchange addresses are mostly from users who deposit funds to the exchange's wallet, and that doesnt mean that those coins were immediately sold or exchanged. Unless, of course, they are instant exchanges.QuoteLastly. The site you linked. I see dates.

It'll give you the most used addresses.",
