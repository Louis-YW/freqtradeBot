Though its an old story i only want to understand how possible for a wallet to forget a user password. In my understanding i think he forgot his password yet he still insist he never did. That was how he lost his entire Bitcoins. This was his last statement - \" I knew owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad!\" . And i fully disagree with him him. In the end i noticed he was an economist, a Bitcoin critic and a gold maximalist. Are there people like this still existing?Full story here",

I have never heard of a wallet or site that forgets one common thing which is password. I was able to access the full story and i saw he shared some screenshots which i think was all framed up. The name of the Bitcoin wallet he used was impossible to identity in the screenshot. This only means he never even bought any Bitcoin in the first place. All a lie to draw the attention of other Bitcoin critics.

Till date gold has the highest value but not compare to Bitcoin in market capitilization. Is that what he is afraid of? Perhaps he believes that one day Bitcoin will outperform gold in the asset ranking. At least he understands where Bitcoin is coming from and where it is going to no matter his criticism which in the end has no impact on Bitcoin.",

They're not mutually exclusive. The fact that you're a big gold fan doesn't mean you have to be against bitcoin. They're not rivals, they're not competing with each other, they just have similarities and that's normal.If he knew anything about bitcoin, he would have come up with a better lie than saying a wallet forgot your password, that's embarrassing to say. Even if we assume it's true, someone who understands bitcoin enough to criticise it should know all he needs to do is input his seed phrase in a different wallet and his bitcoin will still be there. Finally, I'm assuming he's referring to \"password\" as the password to access his wallet, not his seed phrase. If this is the case, then it has nothing to do with bitcoin. I don't think you'll blame the currency if your bank app locks you out of your account, you'll blame the bank and it's low-tech, so why is bitcoin taking the blame in this case? He should be ashamed of himself. Further, down the tweet, he said something like \"There's zero chance I forgot my password, I use simply a numeric password that I have used many times in the past\". I laughed at the clownery even though it was 5 years ago.",

He is a Bitcoin Troll not an influencer, he also either has no understanding of Bitcoin and how it works or intentionally spreads nonsense about it.What he described in that tweet (\"My wallet got corrupted somehow and my password is no longer valid.\") is like saying \"I dropped my gold bar in a furnace and it melted into the liquid metal in it, so it is no longer usable\". His statements are that stupid!There is a correct way of using everything, if you don't know it, then you should learn. A bitcoin wallet offers easy recovering options including creating a physical backup. In fact wallets encourage, some like Electrum force, you to write down the recovery phrase. If someone intentionally refuses to do so, it is their own fault to have lost their coins.P.S. by the way the only thing I got out of this tweet is that all the FUD Shiff spreads about Bitcoin, he obviously has admitted to have owned bitcoin. Isn't that hypocritical? P.P.S. Another interesting thing about that tweet is its date. 19, Jan, 2020. For 6 months bitcoin was in a bear market and kept going down. By January it starts showing the first signs of reversal and starts going up from $7100 to $8400 heading toward $10k resistance... Shiff strikes with his at that time FUD",

That's a big excuse by most of these critics, they always blame and criticize Bitcoin for their own mistakes cause how can someone say a Bitcoin wallet would forget his password instead of the other way round, it's just like saying that an ATM machine forgot his card pin when he the sole owner of the card and have to input the right pin for the machine to process the informations in the card, sounds so funny and silly. Well, i care less about people like Schiff cause they'll always look for silly excuses to criticize Bitcoin but they're fighting a lost battle already cause Bitcoin is here to stay.",
