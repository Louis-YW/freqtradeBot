If you are a long term enthusiast then its worthy if you could see the potential of what you are buying. Some are just keep steady holdimg and looking on the bright future of what they have. Yes its literally hard to see when it will bloom but when it become fruitful then youll definitely gotta see it grow in the long run.

That's why it was possible that they could lose everything if bitcoin had gone to zero and still be fine.  Compared to the average investor who has to take profit at every swing that the price does to the upside for life's expenses, etc. The best thing to do is to learn from this and just save up some money for more opportunities that will come in the future.",

I have an idea why BTC-millionaires have \"emotional control\": not all of their money was invested in BTC, so they were indifferent to fluctuations in the price of bitcoin. Even if they lost this money, it would not affect their lifestyle and welfare. A striking example is the Winklevoss brothers. Therefore, this point can be changed to \"invest not all your money in bitcoin by mortgaging your house and property. Have reserves in case of price fluctuations or even permanent loss of these investments\".Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 04:45:33 PM_Early tech exploration: They got into the industry very early which they took good advantage of, while others were guessing and still not confident about it.

No one knows. For them it is the same roulette as for us. This is the meaning of risk - there is always risk.  They buy and sell under the influence of strategy. What stops you from doing the same? Analyze (future forecast) and make an action plan (strategy).Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 04:45:33 PM_ Patience: they have the patience needed to steadily build their wealth over the long term.They have wealth (or savings) to tide them over while they wait to \"build their wealth over the long term\". Oh, it’s not easy to be patient when your pocket is empty and your stomach is growling. \"Bitcoin millionaire: Lucky or possesses more qualities that we don't have.\" - You idealize them. Don't \"deify\". These are exactly the same people as everyone else, with the exception of some points. Like the lack of empty pockets.",

Personally, I had nothing to invest during the early stage of Bitcoin, as I was young and naive. All I could make was satoshis income by completing tasks and faucets online. I really can't complain about that, because if it wasn't for this possibility, I wouldn't have any holdings right now, just like many people I talked about Bitcoin on those times and that neglected the possibility of adopting it.I believe the fact is that people who got millionaires throught BTC were at the right spot on the right time, and the ones who didn't get millionaires weren't. There isn't much to regret, complain and think about it. Let's just hope next time we can also be the lucky ones. Luck in this case, means a great sum of factors that must conspire in our favour to put us in a confortable position exactly when we need to be there.",

There's no one really did expect that it would really be a project which turns out to be mainly be that supported by the community. Bitcoin millionaires arent that simply been able to reach out those richness specially into those who had hold until this very time yet they would really be needing to control themselves in speaking about market conditions because we've been on different market cycles which involves bulls and bears on which seeing those pricevolatility would really be making you decide whether you would be selling out your stash.Also there are those people who had just recently found out their keys which it is really that somewhat that considered to be lucky at the same time. No one whom really thought that we would really be going this far and to those who had hold tons of coins are really the ones who had cherished out the tremendous amounts of profits that they've been holdinguntil now.",
