What could decide the durability and value of bitcoin? I have some ideas.. If Bitcoin were tied to the dollar, don't you think that they would have choked it with so much control and regulation? The reason the government feel threatened about it's existence is that due to its decentralized nature, transactions of users can't be monitored and this means they can't wake up one morning and dictate how you use your funds. Bitcoin has proven that it can be used as a hedge against inflation but why is the Govt not adopting it? Yeah, I know, they lose total control and that's not something they want to give up easily so they stick with their views on Bitcoin being a means where thieves can perpetuate their shady dealings. QuoteI have some ideas Yeah, care to enlighten us?..",

Bitcoin is not like other cryptocurrency that is pegged with dollar, and this is the reason why the government was against it initially. It is demand and supply that controls bitcoin price.",

While majority of the pair of it is based on the dollars. It doesn't mean that it's already tied on it, it's like the pricing of it has been with the US dollars but look at other markets, there's also the pricing of it that's been based on our fiat currencies. Nothing will change as bitcoin will still be bitcoin regardless of where people think is tied. And as for the USD, isn't it backed up by gold?Quote from: Vickky Rae on October 27, 2023, 05:45:17 PMWhat could decide the durability and value of bitcoin? The value of Bitcoin is determined by us, by our trust and by the cost of mining and don't forget about the law of supply and demand.

If you're referring to trading pairs on exchanges that allow BTC/USD as a reference point, that's still within the realm of reason, given that the dollar has been the predominant benchmark currency. However, does this mean Bitcoin is dependent on the USD? Certainly not. It's merely a measurement tool to make it easier for people to equate BTC with a tangible value.Almost everyone is familiar with the Dollar, but relatively few are well-acquainted with BTC. That's why, to this day, BTC is projected to become an alternative currency that's more distinct than the dollar. Looking into the future, it's possible that BTC will have no connection to the dollar whatsoever.",

What could decide the durability and value of bitcoin? I have some ideas..There is no tie between bitcoin and dollars. Essentially, the dollar is the world's currency and a measure of the value of almost every asset, including bitcoin. We only use dollars to measure the value of bitcoin, and that doesn't mean bitcoin depends on dollars. You can also use other currencies to measure the value of bitcoin without the need for dollars. I understand what you mean that we should not use dollars to measure the value of bitcoin and that it should operate independently. That will only happen when bitcoin becomes the world's main currency, but I don't think governments will let that happen. Fiat will still be the world's main currency and measure of value, we cannot change that.",

There's no tie or even a peg, bitcoin stands alone as a decentralized digital currency for if there was any tie the government would have been  in control to determining bitcoin value. Like how do you tie something that's decentralized to a centralized thing, it doesn't make sense, right. Dollar is only paired with bitcoin to measure or compare to get the value and worth of bitcoin at every moment just as gold value is measured in dollars.QuoteI have some ideas.. what are your ideas, I hope it makes brains.",

By just Bitcoin being decentralized itself, it and couldn't be controlled by any government, you can already concluded that BTC is impossible to have connections to USD. Only thing that government can do with Bitcoin is either legalized it for people to use it freely or will banned it if they think it would be a threat to their own currency or economy. Both might be affected by a certain issue and update causes for their value to lessen and increase but Bitcoin is more volatile and USD can be manipulated by the government so they are not the same thing but both is currency.",

The value of the dollar remains the same no matter how much it is used, even if its use decreases completely, the value of the dollar will remain unchanged, but in the case of Bitcoin, the matter is a little different. The value of Bitcoin generally depends on the usage. The amount of bitcoin purchased from the market will increase the price of bitcoin and the amount of bitcoin sold in the market will reduce the price of bitcoin, its market value depends on its use. Bitcoin's gap with dollar is huge and demand and usage of dollar is much higher than bitcoin.",

What could decide the durability and value of bitcoin? I have some ideas..Bitcoin is not directly tied to the US Dollar, it's just the most common pair currency being traded. If the two were tied together than you could exchange a fixed dollar amount for Bitcoin and the price wouldn't fluctuate so heavily. You can also trade bitcoin against any other currency. For example the Bitcoin/Euro market is also common and you can even find people willing to sell physical goods directly for Bitcoin. So, if you don't like the US Dollar and don't really own or use them yourself than just look at other currencies. And if you already have a lot of money in Dollars and you don't want more than just convert them into other cryptos or invest outside of the USA.

Bitcoin and the dollar are clearly different, they have nothing to do with each other, basically a superpower like the United States gives debt to every other country, at that time countries that were in debt started to become aware of the dollar.Why does America's money never run out and creates big projects in its country. They worried that the United States would print money without a gold standard. In the end, the United States decided to exchange dollars for gold. However, it turns out that the superpower's gold reserves are not as large as the dollars lent to these countries. In 1971, the then US president decided that dollars could temporarily be printed without a gold standard. With this policy and ending with no gold reserves, there is a possibility that its value will continue to decline along with inflation. Why do the rich get richer, the poor get poorerWas there a global elite family game behind President Nixon's decision?This is where the big actors started with Satoshi who I think understands world financial flows.

What could decide the durability and value of bitcoin? I have some ideas..The current world economy is highly dollarized. Almost all currencies in the world are tied to the dollar for them to be used in international trade. Although so many countries are trying to untie their currency from the dollar but it is very difficult because close to 70% of trade transaction is engaged with the dollar. Bitcoin value is usually estimated using the dollar because most goods and services are priced and traded in United States dollars. This situation doesn't mean that Bitcoin is tied to the dollar. Another problem is that bitcoin is still a new currency and is not popular in many countries. Many people might not understand the units or value of bitcoin except is associated with the dollar. But I assume that as Bitcoin becomes popular, it is likely that it can become dedollarised.",
