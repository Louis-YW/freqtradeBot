  "content": "Quote from: https://blog.samourai.is/dojo-1-22-0-released/Starting with this release, it will not be possible to use Knots fork of Bitcoin Core when connecting to an external bitcoin node because Dojo will actively refuse to make an RPC connection to such node.For users with bitcoind installed by Dojo (via docker), bitcoind will now periodically scan connected peers and ban those that are detected as Knots. This feature can be turned off by setting BITCOIND_CRON_JOBS=off in docker-bitcoind.conf.This feature was added to protect our users whose privacy-enhancing transactions such as tx0 or BIP47 notification would not be relayed properly because of non standard policies set by default on Knots nodes.Not a surprising move, really. If Knots are going to refuse to relay Whirlpool transactions, then Samourai are simply not going to connect to any Knots nodes with their software to ensure their transactions continue to get good propagation. There will also be people who do not run Dojo but won't want to connect to Knots nodes for the same reason.This is unlikely to make any meaningful difference to the wider network though, given that Dojo is about 3.1% of all nodes, and Knots is about 0.4% of all nodes.Low value and off topic replies will be deleted.",

There will also be people who do not run Dojo but won't want to connect to Knots nodes for the same reason.I believe it is also a decision based on their values. Of course there is a need to do it, but I think this move is also symbolic. Now, Umbrel offers a docker image of Samourai Server. I think that if you use umbrel and enable this feature, then essentially you run a Dojo node on your machine. Don't you? If so, you can easily connect your Samourai & Sentinel wallets straight to this server. And again, if you can do this, people can use this feature on their Umbrel nodes. There are many people I know who use Umbrel and perhaps this will make it easier for them. Do you have any info regarding this? Because if this is the case, then the percentage of people running Dojo can increase significantly.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 16, 2023, 08:48:50 AMThis is unlikely to make any meaningful difference to the wider network though, given that Dojo is about 3.1% of all nodes, and Knots is about 0.4% of all nodes.Any move supporting our privacy is welcome, no matter how big the impact is.",

Not a number worth worrying about. Unless they want to spin up 100s of nodes it's never going to be more then an irritation to others.

Seems like a number of their miners are giving up on them and their total hashrate is gradually falling.Their average hashrate for the past few weeks or since they started is below 400PH since they had a while of below 300PH, but let's just assume it's 400PH since the 28th of last month since that's when they first got above their first peta, that would be 20 days in total, so up to this point their luck/pace sits at about 100% with nothing out of the ordinary.Given that 1 in 7.4 blocks would have 200% difficulty, it's pretty normal for said pool to go on without having a block for another 10 days, in fact, if anything, it's astonishing how they managed to get those 500PH on board, comparing them to another pool like Kano that has been there for way too long and doesn't censor transactions but struggles to go above 50PH.However, as I said when they first launched this pool, it would be only a matter of time before it collapses, as it stands right now, they sell it as the anti-censorship, decentralization savior mining pool which clearly isn't the case, not to mention how it's almost certain that all non-PPS pools will vanish in a few years from now.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 18, 2023, 08:08:06 PMThat's a loss of 0.5 BTC per block.

Not to mention that you don't need to ban other implementations such as Knots if you run a full node like bitcoin core. The only difference in Knots is some of the standard rules and there is a reason why they are called \"standard rules\", they are preference not a ban worthy offense. For example your node may decide not to relay txs with fee rate lower than 10 sat/vb but that doesn't mean your node should be banned!The only reason why Samourai guys (ie. a light client) are doing this is because Knots had a very very old standard rule for OP_RETURN limit that never relayed their transactions but they only found out about it recently!",
