  "content": "My bankroll starts at $500, and I will update it after every result of all the games I bet on.As a golden rule in sports betting, bettors should only put 2% to 5% of the total bankroll into a single bet. Therefore, I will start with 5%, but since this is the playoffs and I find it easy to predict, I may also try a semi-martingale strategy.Update balance is 172.50.First bet: Philadelphia 76ers x 2.10 (moneyline) @ $25- L2nd bet : Warriors moneyline x2.43 (moneyline) @ $50 - L3rd bet : 76ers 1st half x 2.04 (moneyline) @50 - W4th bet : Nuggets x 2.00 (moneyline) @$50 - L5th bet : Knicks +3.5 x 1.95 (spread) @$50 - L6th bet : Warriors x 2.20 (moneyline) @$50 L7th bet : Nuggets -6.5 x2.00 (spread) @100 W8th bet : Heat +3.5 x 2.00 (spread) @$50 L9th bet : Warriors -7 x2.00 (spread) @100 W\\10th bet : 76ers x 2.16 (monneyline) @$50 L11th bet : Nuggets +2.5 x1.95 (spread) @50 W12th bet : Miami -6.5 x2.00 (spread) @$5013th bet : Warriors x 2.00 (moneyline) @5014th bet : 76ers +6.5 x1.93 (spread) @$50 L15th bet : 76ers moneyline x3.14 @30 L15th bet : Celtics vs Heat under 210.5 x 1.96 @5016th bet :  Lakers vs Nuggets game 3 is under 222 @$100.Will be updated for correction.",

Good luck with this, I do hope the result turns out to be nice. I'm following a very simple principle in sports betting, and that is to bet against the public since the public tends to lose more.With my years of betting experience, I have found out that the better team does not always win (cover the spread) because there are many factors to consider, and the biggest factor in the game is the officiating.",

If you bet too early, the odds between both sides may change until it is locked. Sometimes you bet on a team that has a lower win rate, many other people think so, and when you bet early, they put together, you know what I mean? Also, I don't think moderators can influence matches like, although it is still possible, but i believe, if it happens, they will impact matches where the stakes are bigger",

      "body": "Yes it could be especially if you will be having a good analysis of the games you are interested with. On the usual, there are factors being considered by bettors of NBA League; one is homecourt advantage, and another is whether the main players would be playing or not or if they would be vilable to play for next game. These are only to name a few things to consider when making an analogy, based on my experience in NBA betting. Also, if you would be depending on their scires during offseason, refrain from doing so 'coz most of the time, players are more serious with playoffs and quarter finals. There are many platforms to choose from and play with. Choose ofcourse platform which has a credential in this industry to avoid encountering bigger risk on your capital from the start.",

They have a lot of momentum, and even though they lost one game at home, I think they have a good chance of winning at least one game in LA. Good luck to you and your martingale style of betting - it's definitely an interesting approach.",

Currently, I am not following any specific system for bankroll management. Instead, I wager an amount based on what I like. However, I assure you that I will not lose control. The total bankroll I mentioned above will be the only bankroll I use for the entire playoffs period.Quote from: Beparanf on May 06, 2023, 01:05:03 PMThis is an exciting thread to track the real time experience of user instead of randomly post bets on separate threads.

The -6.5 point spread for the Nuggets is quite high, but I like that pick because they're back at home and coming from two losses, so they might come back strong in game 5 and take the lead in the series again. Despite Jokic's recent shoving incident with the Suns owner, he wasn't suspended, so the Nuggets still have a good chance to win this game. Let's hope they'll cover the spread.",
