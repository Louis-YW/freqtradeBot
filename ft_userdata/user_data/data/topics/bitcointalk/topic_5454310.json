      "body": "There are many good managers here on the forum, and maybe some of them want to work with you, but the payment is considered low compared to the required tasks, especially if the manager is working on several other projects at the same time. Also i can't tell if they accept working with altcoin projects.Better to describe your project here in public before passing to private. This will ensure more transparency and credibility.I have never worked as a campaign manager here on the forum, but I think I can help with the goals you want to reach after discussing the rest of the details. But make sure that you can't increase your project social presence by investing just $100/week.I will send you a private message containing my telegram username. Maybe i can help with more constructive suggestions after well understanding the concept of your project and your targeted goals.",

Not sure if this user is looking to run a bounty or if only wants someone managing their twitter account either. OP should clarify a little for those interested.",

It looks like op is looking for a community manager based on his description. He needs someone to manage his project community on Twitter so it can increase the social media activities which is cool. We have some good bounty managers here that can do the work but the pay looks too small for them to accept since it's just $100 per week. Maybe op can give a little description of what the job of the manager would be, so those would are interested can kindly zoom in knowing what there duty entails. If the description of job is known that would reduce the urge of acquiring about what the job of the manager would be.",
