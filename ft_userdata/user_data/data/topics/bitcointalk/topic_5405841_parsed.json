Investing in new projects got its own risk factors, no matter what the method is offline, online or cryptocurrency. Indeed, it is the risk taken that pays off in the end and that is why we come across the standard disclaimers like ‚ÄúSubject to market risk‚Äù, ‚Äúdo not invest more than what you can afford to lose‚Äù or ‚Äúdo your own research before investing‚Äù. A lame investor never notices the warnings, an over cautious investor sees those warnings as red flags and stops, but a wise investor understands it as a yellow light and invests only after getting satisfied with the information provided. Think about the people who had invested $100 in bitcoin a few years back. It was an enormous risk then, but not now. Again, by saying this, we are not intending to sell huge profit dreams nor guaranteeing that the value of Inddais token too will rise to the sky, but still, Inddais too has its own possibilities to reach the top scorers, and no one can deny it. Any business venture where the promises are kept will have no barriers in growth.With years spent on research, the knowledge and the technical assets we possess today will undoubtedly turn Inddais into an enhanced platform for all those people who aspire to embark into a stable crypto journey. Your contribution and trust will help us put our knowledge to work for mutual growth. The saying goes such, ‚ÄúA good crypto offers endless possibilities‚Äù and Inddais is one among them good.It is always not wise to Assume & Act - when it comes to Investments.

At INDDAIS you are not promised a profit with a money that is made in future, the profit is based on the money which is already made.Based on the most recent FARM UPDATE: https://twitter.com/inddais/status/1545735342883360768Total Seeded tokens are 34609 INIS (for which the current purchase price is 34.61 BNB APPROX) and the vault balance is 3.75 BNB Hence, if all the 34609 tokens are kept seeded until the FARM SEASON END, each token will make 0.0001 BNB per token, which is 10% of the purchase value. The vault contract is made in such a way that there can only be incoming but the outgoing transactions are strictly limited to the INDDAIS FARM.https://bscscan.com/address/0x29030117cd3000172cAdbAc806ACc6eCD0c1F54c => VAULT CONTRACTIf the Tokens seeded increases and the vault balance do not, then the profit will decrease. If the tokens seeded is the same and vault balance increases, the profit per token will increase. If both the tokens seeded and Vault balance increases simultaneously => THE PROFITS GROWS GRADUALLY We are basically a crypto mining firm, and as of now due to low volume sold, the vault balance is being updated once per week. But hopefully when we have good number of tokens seeded, we will have daily and direct vault balance update.INDDAIS is not a INVESTMENT PROGRAM, it is a COMMITMENT",

I felt, I should be the one speaking about INIS at this early stages so that there is no unwanted promises or unanswered questions. Plus I can get acquainted with the initial token holders easily, and have a strong community foundation.",

Hence, INIS cannot be judged by the number of holders displayed.
