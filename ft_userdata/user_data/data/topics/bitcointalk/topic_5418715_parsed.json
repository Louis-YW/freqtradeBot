      "body": "Can you please provide some evidences that can prove your claim? Accusing a service of being scam without any evidence is useless. It's the first time I've heard of this exchange and I couldn't find any scam accusations against them here in this forum or even through google. Edit:I thought the website in question is an exchange. It seems to be a token website. They even have a thread here in this forum. Their representative has been offline for around a year and half.",

To this day there is no answer. Warning: they are fucking scammerswhy you choose this exchange when there is so many big exchanges already available with positive review. This exchange is totally dead and you did not researched before swapping. Their telegram and other social media profiles are inactive for long time.  I think you recieved any airdrop token that was only available at this exchange. May we know which token you swapped there and how much worth it is?Quote from: dezinio on May 30, 2023, 11:25:43 AMfucking scammersNo need to use these words because these words cannot bring your money and you should blame yourself. Now just follow the scam report rule mentioned by  PX-Z to make this thread helpful",

I have researched the site myself but have not been able to find any evidence against this or any news to prove it.You also provided no information about the exchange. You also use bad words without proof.",

To this day there is no answer. Warning: they are fucking scammersI joined their group on Telegram and Discord, and there is no one to answer from the support; as mentioned by @Pandu Geddon, their social media sites are not active, and they have not published any new updates so far. This indicates a red flag about this platform; you can send them a message via their official mail: info@enedex.org; I hope you will find a response from them and help you, although I see that the platform team raised the money and ran away.What also caught my attention is that they have an excellent rating on Tustpilot at a rate of five stars, but the strange thing is that the last review was from 2021; this primarily indicates that the project team has bought these ratings and reviews to deceive the largest number of people, your loss saddens me, and I hope that you will be patient once again in choosing the exchange on which you will deposit your money or make any swap because the market is crowded with scammers.",
