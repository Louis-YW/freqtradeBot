  "content": "According to the article by Sky SportsPremier League clubs have agreed to withdraw gambling sponsorships on front of shirts.QuoteThere are eight current Premier League clubs with gambling companies as shirt-front sponsors, with an estimated value of £60m per annum; The change will begin at the start of the 2026/27 seasonQuoteA Premier League statement read: \"Premier League clubs have today collectively agreed to withdraw gambling sponsorship from the front of clubs' matchday shirts, becoming the first sports league in the UK to take such a measure voluntarily in order to reduce gambling advertising.QuoteTeams with betting sponsors on shirts:    Bournemouth    Brentford    Everton    Fulham    Leeds    Newcastle    Southampton    West HamMore information in the article I kind of have mixed feelings on this, especially when it comes to crypto related gambling sites. When a crypto related service is advertised, it also indirectly advertises cryptoWhat are your thoughts about this?",

      "body": "I think that more statements from the article must be addedQuote\"To assist clubs with their transition away from shirt-front gambling sponsorship, the collective agreement will begin at the end of the 2025/26 season.\"Premier League clubs will be allowed to secure new gambling sponsorship for the front of shirts until the ban commences.Current sponsorship deals with gambling companies can remain in place for the next three years too.It is understood that gambling brands can feature in other areas, which include shirt sleeves and on advertising hoardings, beyond the 2025-26 campaign.That means it's still safe to for the club to wear shirt-front gambling sponsorship until three years later. It's quite clear that if the new regulation is still allowing gambling sponsorship to advertise their service but in the different area of shirt. I will add more. QuoteCarolyn Harris, the chair of the Gambling-Related Harms All-Party Parliamentary Group, believes shirt sponsorship by betting companies \"normalises\" gambling for children, and that gambling sponsorship in sport in all its forms should - and would - be banned. it seems like that KYC may be very useful to protect children from gambling. It seems like that KYC will be playing a very important role to prevent the children to play gambling. I see no solution other than implementing KYC. That will be enough to prevent children to gambling rather than fully banning gambling sponshorships.",

I think it would be terrible for business to be fair but if you have the money for it then you could go somewhere else. Remember, these are the crypto casinos that pay these clubs, they can maybe find an alternative or maybe not, 10 million just for Everton is unheard of and they will certainly not find anyone willing to pay that much for example.And yet, if Stake could just pay that to someone else, they could find many clubs willing to accept, or maybe in another sport, they have the money to sponsor anyone they like, hell even whole leagues for that kind of money in smaller leagues.",

I think they are even lucky to have three more years of gambling sponsorship.Newcastle should be fine since they have an owner with enough resources. The mid and low tier clubs will take a bigger loss.Quote from: tusandii on April 14, 2023, 08:51:40 AMIsn't having a betting sponsor in front of the jersey a benefit for some of the sponsored teams because they get tax from the name printed on the jersey?Other companies will most likely get a deal as replacement so clubs gets taxed either way. Maybe proceeds from sponsorship would decrease a bit but it wouldn't hurt the Government.",
