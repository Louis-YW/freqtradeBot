  "content": "I'm posting this in Meta based on actmyname's thread from 2018, which is quite similar to this one.  If there's a better section, I request the mods either move it or tell me where to move it to.I've offered to review members' post histories a number of times in various threads, and based on my experience with doing it I wanted to formally write out some things that I find myself repeating in PMs:I.  The offer is open to any member below Legendary rank and only those who don't already have enough merits to reach Legendary.II.  You just need to send me a simple PM asking for a review, and I'll be happy to do it.  You don't need to be humble and apologize for doing so--believe me, if I thought anyone was wasting my time I'd tell them, and I wouldn't have even offered to do these reviews in the first place.III.  When you PM me, please list the specific sections you post in, especially any of the altcoin sections, the gambling ones, Bitcoin Discussion, and Speculation.  I have a lot of sections on ignore, so when I'm doing reviews I have to un-ignore sections in order to merit any posts within them (hey Theymos, could you change that by any chance??).  Just write something like this (don't worry about capitalization and the like):1. Speculation2. Altcoin (mining)3. Altcoin (speculation)4. Trading discussionYou only need to do it once, as I'll save your original PM.  Note: I don't review posts in any of the local boards.IV.  You can request a review once every 30 days at the most.  That's because there's a limit of 50 merits per member per month that can be given out, and oftentimes I do end up handing out a full 50.V.   I make no guarantees that you'll be given any merit at all, much less 50 at a clip.  If I think your posts are sub-par, I'll usually give you a suggestion or two as far as ways to make your posts stand out.  But basically what I look for is thought and effort, not length.  I can assure you, I've been reading posts from bounty hunter spamming shitposters for years and can recognize a bloated load of nonsense within a few seconds.  Grammar and correct use of the English language help, but I'm looking for posts that took some effort and had some thought put into them, so don't worry if English isn't your primary language--you definitely don't have to be perfect, just clear enough such that your post can be understood.VI.  If you PM me with a request and it's clear you haven't read my rules (especially III above), you're asking me for another review in less than 30 days, you should have known your posts are complete wads of shitty asswipe, or in any other way prove to me that you're a bonehead even before I take a look at what you've written, I not only reserve the right to refuse a review with no response whatsoever, I might just ignore you, block your PMs, or even report some of your shitposts.  VII.  Please don't send me a reminder PM if I obviously haven't done a review for you within a few days, a week, or even two weeks or more.  I've been getting more requests than I can handle with the amount of sMerits I'm allocated, and Theymos refuses to increase said allocation.  If you send me a request and I'm unable to give you merits because I'm out, your PM will stay in my inbox until I get to it.Please, one of my berzerk buttons is people who waste my time.  If you do that, keep in mind that I'm the type of man who bears a grudge._______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________So those are my basic rules.  I'm going to leave this thread open in case anyone wants to make comments, suggestions, or anything else.  I don't need people to thank me; I'm a merit source, and I do this to keep the system working because I believe in it and know what the forum was like before Theymos created it.  I'd actually be grateful for any critical feedback.",

Good name and 2. Good character. if carefully look at it these two phrases are synonymous. It is only the bearer of a name knows the important of his name not the third party. It is the character that others would confirm from the person. Since The Pharmacist is requesting to change his name to The Sceptical Chymist, he knows it best. As for the number 2 which 99% of the people or users of the forum attested for him. And as for me I give him the name The Liberal Chymist because he is one of the liberal scholars, he is a progressivist and not a conservativist. Therefore, I also join voice to plead Theymos (the boss) to change the name of The Pharmacist to his desire and suitable name. From what I saw in this thread  Public request to Theymos for a name change , the name is spelled The Sceptical Chymist but here it is spelled 'Skeptical Chemist or The Skeptical Chemist\". This spelling issue has removed (impeched) a newly elected Governor in my state. So we are careful about it.",
