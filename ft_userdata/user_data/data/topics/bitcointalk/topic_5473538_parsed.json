You're in a cue to whatever, a car wash, and that cue is in a private area, so the owner of the property can kick you out if he decides to. Someone comes in and says they'll pay double for the service if they can get in right now, so the owner stops you and lets him pass. You get angry because you have to wait, he paid double, the ownetr thought to himself that if he has to deal with angry mob he might as well ask more for the spot in line, so they all start to bid for spots so they can wash their cars without waiting. At some point the price gets pumped so that they pay so much for the spot that they could wash the car 10 times with that money if they'd only wait. How long can this keep going? Eventually they'll realize how much they're overpaying or run out of money. I'm not paying $20 to send a $50 transaction. Are you?",

It could be the latter now but I am quite sure the the current situation is a sponsored attack, more than it is just a busy network.Since 2017, most networks have implemented improvements to make them increasingly scalable. It is unlikely that purely legitimate blockchain network traffic will cause a prolonged spike in fees, especially with available layer0/1/2(and now 3's) that are available.Quote from: jossiel on November 09, 2023, 09:02:34 PMQuote from: ArthurY on November 09, 2023, 08:38:55 PMWhat further steps will look like if this spam continues?Bitcoin's price will continue too.  If we're talking specifically about a network stress attack, then actually, it can stall price movement and additionally effect sentiment, as it temporarily highlights a flaw in usability and scalability for Bitcoin.

But who knows...A solution is to avoid using bitcoin until the mempool comes back to normal, you can buy and use cryptos like Litecoin which has faster blocks and lower fees. And just like you guys, i love bitcoin and would love only to use bitcoin, but when the fees are this high it becomes a pain in the ass, and not a cheap pain.",

This could be a test by miners themselves to create a benchmark, the benchmark being how much network activity is required in order to achieve the difference in block rewards Why?In the past, the block reward was the primary revenue for miners. As BTC was distributed and as time passes, the network needed a benchmark of activity in order to ensure that there would be an incentive to secure the network in the future.As we have moved in time, the block reward has been sufficient, and miners have been able to move the market in their favor to ensure mining is profitable (as long as activity trajectory mentioned above is suitable, which thankfully, has been!)Now, moving the market requires liquidity that miners may not have, same with purchasing power. It's more about fees, and so, measurements must be made. This might be what we're seeing.I wonder how this will effect the halving as we know it....",
