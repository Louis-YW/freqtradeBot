      "body": "Well, Bitcoin transactions could be verified by everyone. The blockchain is transparent. You can check which address sends to which address. You can check how much is sent. You can check whether the transaction is already confirmed or not, or whether the funds is kept or spent. You can check when the transaction is done. But if you are asking whether a Bitcoin or a Bitcoin transaction could be traced to you, I don't think there is an absolute yes or no answer to it. Although Bitcoin is only pseudonymous, anybody please correct me if I'm wrong, but if you were careful enough and have valued your privacy every step of the way and you cleared yourself of any tracks every time, I guess it is possible for the likes of Ciphertrace not to complete the puzzle and finds certainty in linking a Bitcoin to a real-world identity.",

What can make the thing easy are if the scammers or hacker uses an exchange account or if using IP address to connect to wallets. Are you scammed or what? Why asking this question.",

The vast majority of people who use such privacy services are simply ordinary people who do not wish governments, businesses, ad agencies, marketers, and a huge number of other third parties tracking everything that they do. Keeping your financial activities private is just basic security and common sense.",

Mostly with p2p transactions and without KYC to people involve, it will be hard to trace where a BTC or cryptocurrency will be. For instance, if one wallet to another is transferred to an offline or hard wallet, then it won't be traceable online. It could also be considered as lost crypto too.",

If you want to break the link then you can use other options like coinjoin or mixer to obfuscate your transactions, assuming you don't expose other information that can reveal your personal information.

The network has no concept of which addresses happen to belong to hot wallets or cold wallets, which wallets are currently connected to or disconnected from the internet, or even if an address is not part of any wallet at all and no one knows the private key. All transactions are public, regardless of the addresses involved.Quote from: joniboini on June 01, 2023, 01:24:32 AMI don't think people consider them as \"lost crypto\" too.Also correct. You cannot say that just because an address is dormant that those bitcoin are lost, and the 4 million or so number that gets thrown about various blogs is a complete guess. The number of provably lost bitcoin which can never be spent due to technical reasons is very small, around 2,828 BTC.",
