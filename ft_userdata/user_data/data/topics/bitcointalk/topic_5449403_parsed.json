  "content": "Due to the recent use of A.I in assisting man's job, it just came to my mind this morning that what if I try to ask ChatGPT about which club is liken to win the premier league match this season and this is what I got shown down below..So what are your say on this, is ChatGPT right or wrong on the 3 clubs it suggested and the reasons given below??Because by this A.I, you could see it chose \"Manchester City\" as the first club likely to win the league this season, while, Liverpool stand as the Second club likely to win the league, and Manchester United stands as the third club likely to win the league this season.So what are your thoughts on this, do you agree with ChatGPT or not??",

Who is Manchester United and Liverpool this season when talking about Arsenal to win the league? The clubs are not just to be compared with Arsenal. Only Manchester City is mainly competing with Arsenal. Who to win 2022/2023 EPL: Arsenal or Manchester City.",

They didn't mention Haaland because Haaland was joined Manchester City in this season, Mahrez and Kevin De Bruyne were carried Manchester City in the last year. They didn't mention Sterling because he already joined Chelsea.And Manchester United are the present information because they are comeback after Ronaldo was terminated.",

And also I'm not sure if they have started to integrate recent knowledge into chatGPT because most of its knowledge is quite old. And because of that it might not be able to give an accurate prediction.",

At the moment when the AI is \"online\" in the sense that it has all possible data, then it will probably be able to give much more accurate and precise answers.This could be a problem for bookmakers, because players will have a very good tool for analyzing matches, and thus a greater chance of winning.",

There's a possibility that there's a changes in team and in management which would affect the performance of the team. For me, I think you really can't rely on the AI alone and you really can't base your bet because you think the AI have a point of what it is saying.",

All AI have to rely on is the team's old performance data, which you and I know that old matches can't be used to predict the future upcoming matches. Sometimes, a team who have been losing matches will just decide to become more stronger and agile and it will shock everyone, this has happened too many times in soccer matches before. You can't or shouldn't rely on predictions from AI on games like the premier league, AI can't have information about who will be fit for the next matches and perform better, AI is not a God.",

ChatGPT was only listing some clubs that might be potentially winning the game but if you are comparing with the fact if liverpool and manchester united have no chance to win EPL. City is the only candidate that already mentioned by chatGPT. It's likely that chatGPT was not able predicting who will be winning EPL. The correct answer shall be around Manchester city or Arsenal. Those clubs are the closest club to get EPL title this season. ChatGPT has no ability to predict the future. It was making an answer based on what already stored on its database. It's useless to ask chatGPT about which team that will potentially win EPL. Liverpool and Manchester united are performing so bad this season. ChatGPT needs to be update with the real time news related to the EPL team to make it even more accurate. I can't agree with what already said by that AI.",

It has several things that can be useful, but it can't get the data of contracted players, eventual problems, injuries etc. to give a good hint.But it is an interesting exercise for learning and experience.When it is updated in real time, it can become a good ally to help predict something, but it is only really helpful for those who rely on statistics, for example if a certain game between two teams usually has many goals, or if a certain player has many chances to receive cards during the game.",

Even yesterday's devastating victory with 6 goals scored doesn't contribute to this.Manchester United will not 100% win the Premier League this season. Too big gap from the 2 main leaders on points.Manchester City can again become champions this season, because they have already succeeded more than once and Arsenal have lost too many points due to the last two draws, which gives Arsenal a high chance to overtake them.Arsenal (ChatGPT didn't even mention them) still have the opportunity to hold the lead until the end of the season and get the cup.Football is a very unpredictable sport, where an injury or replacement of even one main player can affect the future of the team, not to mention other factors that affect the outcome of each individual match and the entire tournament as a whole.",
