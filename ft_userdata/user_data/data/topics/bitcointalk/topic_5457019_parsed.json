  "content": "As of today (June 20th), the following year on year returns are as follows. As highlighted, Bitcoin is currently the best performer vs traditional stock market indexes:DJI: +12%S&P: +17%NDQ: +30.7%BTC: +31.5%I realise this is subjective as Bitcoin's initial capitulation was in June, whereas traditional markets had already fallen considerably by May, but still the statistics remain relevant:If you had invested X amount into BTC one year ago at $20.5K, it would have outperformed the major indexes available; Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100.Do you think Bitcoin will continue to outperform these indexes by the end of the year, or will traditional stocks or fiat currency outperform in Q3 & Q4?",

      "body": "DJI, S&P and NDQ are all build on different compositions of American companies. Would be nice to see something more in poll like Gold or commodities (in the form of a simple index like S&P GSCI Index). Without that current poll just asks if US stocks will continue to pump, because mostly when US500 pump than bitcoin pump^2. Same with dump.personally, I expect that soon (1-2 months) there will be a rebound on the stocks, which will meet a local low on the inflation chart, and the money will be transferred to commodities that have already dumped 40% from the peak in March 2022, which will give fuel for another wave of inflation and stock panic (BTC will panic^2).I actually hit a logical wall writing this. After all, according to the SEC, bitcoin is a commodities and according to crypto community its a digital gold ... so it might not follow stocks during this dump and rather go up with gold and commodities fulfilling the dreams of some about BTC/USstocks decoupling ?",

Nevertheless we have seen how it's price fluctuation is. In the beginning of this year the price goes up to 40%++ if I'm not mistaken and it could indicate that more is coming and that's what we get in the first 6 months.So I wouldn't be surprised that money from investors is going to pour in the next 6 months in preparation of the block halving and the eventual bull run that everyone is expecting. So wise investors knows where the money is, and for sure they have been accumulating already and this pattern will continue and so Bitcoin market will outperform this traditional market not just this year, but perhaps in the next 2 years.",

      "body": "Looks like I should have waited a day before making this topic, as now Bitcoin is up +50% year on year compared to NDQ at 27%... which is a much clearer difference than a couple of days ago.This is why I wasn't worried about the de-correlation between Bitcoin and traditional stocks, as once traditional markets hit local tops then BTC would likely benefit from this. So far over the past few days this is exactly what has happened. S&P, NDQ, DJI have all been corrected slightly for the past few days, with Bitcoin increasing another 15% in the same time-frame.The main irony I find is that it took 3 weeks for the S&P to increase by another 5% to reach 15% for year on year again. Bitcoin literally achieved the same gain within a few days",

      "body": "Well, when you ask this at bitcointalk, I think people usually having bitcoin as their response makes sense, it is the logical reasoning. We are at bitcointalk because we prefer bitcoin over other investments and that means we are going to like it a lot more. I am not saying that traditional markets could never outperform us, of course it possibly could and that has happened before I am sure of it.However, I think when you look at it on the long scope, like many months, or if you look at it on a simple approach, then you will realize that it is not going to end up with bitcoin being better. Whenever anyone asks me \"would you prefer bitcoin or X\" I will always prefer bitcoin, that's always the case for me and will always stay that way.",

      "body": "Bitcoin will outperform these indices by the end of the year. My goal is to buy at the right times and achieve high rates like in the example here.According to others, Bitcoin's movement can be very fast. When we look at the ratios, it turns out that we prefer Bitcoin, but this may be the case when you make your investment at the best time. So we can invest in everything we mentioned, but the important thing is to find the right time. That's the point. So when I look at these values, I'm glad I invested in Bitcoin, but when you find the right time for others, you can still have the same pleasure. I think finding the right times is more important than the ratios.We are people who prefer Bitcoin. Therefore, the real value of these rates is the rate at the time we make the purchase. In other words, in order to achieve a success like the rates here, I need to invest at the right time. I take the time to achieve this.For example, when I bought bitcoin, if I had bought it from others mentioned in the subject, maybe these rates would have been very different. Because when I bought it, it gave a different result than the rates stated here. I'm just trying to find my own best rate.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is so volatile the year to year comparison will often show it either as the best investment or as a total failure. People who bought it as $69,000 don't think that it's the best investment.And Bitcoin is so young, that it's hard to talk about its future with any certainty. Clearly the performance of the past, when it was increasing in value by 10 times will not be replicated, because conditions are different - there is mass awareness, there's no euphoria about financial revolution.",

      "body": "It is such an obvious answer for me that BTC will do better, not because it is a simple answer in just time, but it is a simple answer when you consider long term as well. Even if it goes down today, and dow goes up, making it bigger, wait for another few months and BTC will pass again, hold it for a year and it will be a lot higher, hold it for a few years and the difference will be staggering. American markets can't grow in a sustained manner due to wealth gap, which means they will always need to print more money, and increase their debt ceiling, making dollar less valuable, and increasing bitcoin price even more. Hence, there is absolutely no way to pick anything else, Bitcoin is the best investment among any of them without a doubt.",

But Bitcoin is affected as part of the financial markets by what happens in the markets in general and what happens in bullish times is that more money is put into Bitcoin in the same way that more money is put into Nasdaq 100 stocks than into the S&P 500 ones. However, even if the downturns are more spectacular, it is more profitable in the long term. I don't know why you include fiat currency, because the only way it will \"outperform\" the rest of the investments is if there is a downturn in the markets, which would leave the investments in negative, that is, worse than fiat despite inflation.",

I think that in the third and fourth quarters, Bitcoin will be more aggressive towards traditional markets and will make its investor happy. Those holding BTC will be happier as the halving time approaches. In traditional markets, the effects of inflation may continue until the end of the year and even in 2024. While traditional markets seem to derive most of its value from debt, this is not the case with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has value beyond the trust of its community. Bitcoin is not based on a debt system and its value depends on how effective it is as a medium of exchange.Cryptocurrencies can be bought and spent by anyone anywhere and anytime without the need for a bank or government. This is what makes them so innovative. Bitcoin has created a new form of trust for our future global monetary system. The system behind Bitcoin is completely transparent and that is why i will continue to invest in Bitcoin forever.",
