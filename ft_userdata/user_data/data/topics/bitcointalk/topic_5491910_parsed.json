  "content": "Bitcoin's total market cap has soared past $1.3 trillion, now sitting at a staggering $1,370,542,241,397. It has surpassed the total market value of the world's four largest banks combined! BTW, with just two weeks left until Bitcoin's fourth halving, there are only 2,000 blocks remaining. Coinbase's institutional research analyst, David Han, dropped a report yesterday, highlighting Bitcoin's evolving status as digital gold. This increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a 'digital gold' could potentially attract a fresh wave of investors into the market. This means that more demand brewing in this market ecosystem. So, brace yourselves, folks.  Unlike previous cycles, we might witness a more aggressive buying spree during price pullbacks. Even in the midst of volatility, buyers could be more proactive this time around.But let's not forget the golden rule of crypto: expect the unexpected. Bitcoin's journey has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride, and volatility is its middle name. After all, in the world of Bitcoin, one thing's for sure: it's always an exhilarating ride!",

People often look at the price of bitcoin and think that it is too expensive and that investing in it at this point will no longer bring significant profits. But if they look at the supply and market capitalization, they will realize everything is still very early and there are still many opportunities. The capitalization of gold has surpassed 15 trillion USD, while the capitalization of bitcoin is only 1.3 trillion USD. Think about what percentage of profit we will achieve if the capitalization of bitcoin is equal to the capitalization of gold in the next 10-20 years? We are still very early in investing in bitcoin.",

It's really not surprising anymore that bitcoin is able to do that because I've had that faith renewed when bitcoin was able to bounce back when it dump when the all-time high price was still around 20k, it was a panic for me at that time but I trusted that it will go back and then it did, a year or two of waiting isn't a big deal anymore, I'm excited for what the next halving does because there's no way that it's going to be repeat history with the new ATH showing before we can even go to the halving.",

There was news of BlackRock's Larry Fink calling Bitcoin digital gold, but it wasn't Larry who coined it. But, yeah, if the impression of Bitcoin being a digital gold is spreading among the influential financial players across the globe, it indeed means demand. But, again, demand doesn't necessarily mean belief. Many who buys Bitcoin doesn't believe in Bitcoin. That includes Fink and the rest of them. So, indeed, it would still be a rollercoaster ride from here on. These actors could quickly dump Bitcoin as soon as they made a profit from it.",

As long as nobody sells and there is still demand, theoretically the price of a bitcoin can go to infinity. However we know that there will always be some sellers who will create even more pressure on the price as the price goes higher. That’s why every once is a while btc goes into a bear market. So don’t feel bad if btc goes back to $30k’s or even lower soon. If that happens, btc will come back even stronger because more diamond hands will be buying the dip. We have had many price cycles in the past and there will always be more.",

Yes, there's more work but what I can see here is just an opportunity that you won't be missing out for too long in investment because bitcoin will take a long time before it grows, imagine those that are DCAing at a small amounts, they're going to like this the most.",

Well thats inevitable I guess we saw the pattern in each cycle that after halving it should do its work. But since this market us upredictable expect the unexpected always. Right now btc is moving up and down for the past few weeks and as we get closer to halving we can see the potential movement of overall market which either can go bullish all the way or have some misfit along the way.",

I don't think the reason is market cap being high, at least not the main/biggest reason.When you are comparing 2013-17 with today you should also compare the economy of 2013-17 with today. We've already had 2 major recessions in the past 5 years and that takes toll on the economy and people's investment habits and capabilities.For example in 2017 when price soared to $20k in a couple of months people across the globe weren't struggling to make ends meet like today and they weren't struggling to pay back their loans at a much higher interest rate that went up overnight.Now I believe not only such massive rises (eg. going from $70k to $1 mil in 6 months) is possible but it can be very easy IF the recession ends and they reduce interest rates. Because first of all after interest rates coming down, the extra money people paying back their loans are going to be left with is going to be invested in things like bitcoin. And the money that had gone into the scammy bonds government print is going to exit and flood into other markets including bitcoin. The tsunami of money coming into bitcoin can shoot up the price very easily.",

What I learned in my almost 8 years in Bitcoin is that so-called analysts just throw lazy explanations for the current trend, because no one cares about actual research. Market participants just want an easy narrative to stir them to buy or sell. Bitcoin ecosystem today is not different from the ecosystem half a year ago when the price was 3 times lower. This means the price growth is a result of the halvening bull-bear cycle and not people waking up to digital gold.",

That's why if you've been here for a long time, you know what I am saying that it's been said and treated already as a digital gold even long time before. Thanks to the most holders out there as we treat our Bitcoins as the digital gold that everyone will not have. Yeah, it's not going to be on the hands of most people because many are still skeptic of buying because before, they're scared of it thinking it was a scam. Now, they're thinking of it as something expensive that they don't want to buy while waiting for its price drop which is unlikely at these moments.",
