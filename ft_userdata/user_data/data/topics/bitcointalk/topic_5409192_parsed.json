  "content": "If you’ve been watching the crypto startup industry closely, in the last year, you may have noticed a striking theme among many of the newly launched projects — a large chunk of them are launchpads designed to launch other new projects! There are two reasons why you might want to invest in a launchpad project. The first, and most common, is because you want to gain access to the projects launched via the platform. The second is because you believe that the launchpad’s native token will appreciate in value — or sometimes both. However, there are considerable differences in the quality of launchpads and the projects they host. This is mostly evidenced by the average return offered by some launchpads compared to others. This can be measured in both average all-time high ROI (the maximum value tokens reached) and average current ROI (the current return compared to the IDO price). One such platform is AdLunam which is industry’s first NFT-integrated Engage to Earn seed crowdfunding and IDO launchpad using a Proof of Attention model.Learn more: https://adlunam.cc",

      "body": "The secret to success in pursuing the emerging crypto market is the investors who get in early on promising projects are the ones who find the most prosperity. Although some investors might feel that engaging too early may be a riskier move, recognizing upstanding ventures at an early stage raises their chances of gaining higher returns. However, the tricky part about this particular investment strategy is identifying which early-stage projects are promising and worth taking the risk. Is it possible to spot such worthy initiatives before they become mainstream? Thanks to crypto launchpads, it is possible! Crypto launchpads are the safest route for both experienced and novice investors to get a share of crypto-based projects. The platforms filter the top-notch initiatives and showcase them to interested investors willing to commit funding during the early stages of development. As an early adopter, an investor can fund a project during its pre-sale phase and benefit from price increases as the product matures. You do not want to miss out on what an opportunity like this can offer!AdLunam being the industry’s first NFT-integrated Engage to Earn seed crowdfunding and IDO launchpad using a Proof of Attention model is here to disrupt the whole industry.Learn more: https://adlunam.cc",
