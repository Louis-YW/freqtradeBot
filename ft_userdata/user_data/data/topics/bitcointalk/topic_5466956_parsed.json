You guessed it right, everyone knows about real estate investment or money kept in a bank or any other investment. In case someone dies suddenly, the family members get the assets easily. People who have invested in crypto currency or Bitcoin no family member knows only they know where and how much their investment is.So if we face such a problem, whether we have shared our passphrases or passwords or information about our assets with our family members is a very important question. It is also a problem for you that you do not have a wife and children. First we can give information about our assets to wife and children. I think you should keep your Bitcoin investments secret,and the best way is to save all your passphrases and passwords in a diary, and keep it in a cupboard that only you have access to. If something happens to you, later on, your family members can easily access your Bitcoin or crypto currency assets by knowing everything from a single diary.",

The question about management of personnel asset including digitals ones like Bitcoin is well understandable. It is crucial to exercise caution when considering sharing your wallets seed phrase, and any one access to it can potentially take control of your Bitcoin holdings. I would strongly recommend discussing your decision with your legal or financial advisor who can surely help you to make an informed decision based on your specific circumstances and laws and regulations in the country of your residence.In summary, safeguarding the security of digital assets holding is of utmost importance and consider consulting with your legal advisor to develop a comprehensive plan that aligns with your wishes and ensure protection of your investments.",

If you are having this kind of teaching in your mind and you are wondering what will happen to your holdings if you are no longer there to safe guard them, then I will advise you to make the choice of sharing your bitcoin idea with a few of your family members that you can trust a little. I know there is not much trust when it comes to money. But for you to be on the safer side, you can create a three-signatory wallet, where you will have to move the bitcoins that you have now over to those wallets, and you can have access to the three phrases of the wallet, as you are the real owner and might want to spend it anytime without the need of seeking permission from anybody. Then you can look among your family members and pick three of them with whom you can share access to one of them. For them to be able to make use of the fund, they will first of all have to come to an agreement, and they can't do this while you are healthy. This way, you can rest assured that your funds are safe without thinking about what will happen to them again or how secure they are in the hands of the person you hand them to. Now everything is in the hands of your family to decide what will happen to your bitcoin if you are no longer able to access it.",

I mean, you're dead, and as you've said, no wife or child. If you care that much about your relatives though then feel free to do so. The only real secure way here is to write it in a will or something similar, or put it in a safe then build some kind of instruction list that can be released when you're proclaimed dead. I honestly wouldn't think of this at all if me and my relatives aren't that close and I don't have a wife/child.

The only thing I've shared with my family is my debit card PIN, and at this point, its balance is no larger than the BTC I have in my personal wallet.I've considered leaving a box containing access keys to all my assets and bequeathing it to my younger sibling and mother. I understand they may not grasp the concept of private keys or Bitcoin, but I've provided a contact who happens to be a friend of mine, who has aided me in navigating the world of Bitcoin.My friend has a higher income than I do, and they are the one person who has consistently been there for me when I needed assistance. There is no one else I trust more with matters of inheritance than them. So, rather than entrusting my private keys to my friend, I've asked them to assist my family when my time in this world comes to an end.

Trust is gradually fading in this world due to greed and the quest to get rich. But the fact remains that if you are planning on how to transfer your wealth to anyone or organizations, someone has to know where your seed phrase is.
