The fee structure of AIMINDS has been revised to incentivize various stakeholders. AIMINDS applies a 7% fee on both buying and selling transactions. The fee distribution is as follows: 2% for sales liquidity, 2% for marketing efforts, 1% as rewards for token holders, 1% for the treasury, and 1% for burning tokens to reduce the supply. This fee structure AIMS to create a sustainable and thriving ecosystem for AIMINDS. The burning mechanism reduces the token supply over time, increasing scarcity and potentially leading to value appreciation. Additionally, the reward distribution rewards long-term token holders and the allocation to developers incentivizes their contributions to the project.Tokeneconomics ✅50% of supply fair launch ✅3% marketing and developer budget ✅5% airdrop ✅10% other exchange listings 🔥 25% burn activity ✅%7 Distribution holders with jackpot app✅Genpad pre-sale begins.✅60 Lp ✅super deflationary✅Tax 7✅ 2 big exchange 🔐 Audit & KYC🚀 Massive Marketing😎 Based Teamhttps://gempad.app/presale/0x66c1Ba855F9C3b227175327f8bD87bD79270CFe5?chainId=42161",
