Few days ago, the Arab countries pledged support for Palestine and those kind of influence are what could lead to such shortage in supply of oil and increase in price and yesterday there was a little increase in oil price which could be as a result of the pledge both countries are already having because US also are making statement to support isreal despite they having military strength to defend and prosecute the war. So, more or less it may lead to another NATO interference and of course sanctions will fly here and thereby causing oil price to keep surging.",

You are right. I also think this war has little effect on the economy on a global scale. Even if some big players start a proxy war with each other in palestain there won't be much effect because they are not big exporters of any essential elements. The Russia-Ukraine war has massive effect on the global economy because Russia is a big player in the oil, mineral, and wheat export market. None of these are valid for israile and hamas wars.",

In case the war escalates as well, I believe the OPEC gauge would only be set aside and those oil-producing nations with higher capacity would increase pumping. This will not affect the world's production and manufacturing.However, Gold is not a necessity for daily living and production, it's just a store of value and a show of luxury.

I don’t hope to see any reasons to it but, it’s unlikely the Israel and Gaza war would take long or have any great impact on the world economy.I feel Gaza would be the most affected in this as you can see how they’ve been under fire since the start of this war and Israel aren’t giving much soft landing.",

They've denied Palestine the rights to lands that they should've owned as early as 2 years after the second World War and now they are playing it off as if Palestine's the one that is oppressing them. It's stupid and all funny at the same time lol. As for oil prices, it's due time we find a new resource to use, I believe the series of wars we're getting right now are going to be an eye opener as to just flimsy this oil-based economy is in the face of an uncaring world.

This is a war in Israel by the hands of the Hamas creatures and their collaborators. The second is to destabilize the world economy. The third is to destabilize the US economy. All three goals are very necessary for the \"puppeteers\" who control Hamas. They don't care about Hamas, they don't care about the people of Palestine, they want CHAOS. Everyone knows the names of the customers, but officially we will learn about it a little later. Chaos allows to \"deactivate\" the world legislation, get economic trump cards (for example - rising oil/gas prices), become almost unpunished in their actions and plans. The world is indeed seriously affected by the tumor of terror, which has gone beyond local problems to the format of a worldwide one. A bit reminiscent of the Soviet theory launched by Lenin - \"red terror\", I recommend to familiarize yourself with the roots of world terror and controlled terrorism, and what are its goals?",

Since the occupation of Gaza is supported by the US, the Oil countries in the Middle East will also support Palestine.Israel blocks water and electricity to Gaza, the Oil countries might also stop sending oil to Israel as tension arises.
