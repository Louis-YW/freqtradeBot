  "content": "Cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges have gained a lot of popularity in the last few years. With the rise of Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, in 2009, many other cryptocurrencies have been created. Cryptocurrency exchanges, on the other hand, are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. In this article, we will explore the growth of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges in the last five years.Overview of CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. They are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority like banks or governments. Cryptocurrencies work through a technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions on the network.Growth of CryptocurrenciesIn the last five years, the growth of cryptocurrencies has been phenomenal. According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 4,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, with a total market capitalization of over $2 trillion. Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, has grown from a value of less than $1 in 2010 to over $60,000 in 2021.Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have also seen significant growth in the last five years. The total number of cryptocurrency users has also increased, with more people investing in cryptocurrencies as an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds.Overview of Cryptocurrency ExchangesCryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers and charge fees for their services. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be centralized or decentralized, with centralized exchanges being more popular.Growth of Cryptocurrency ExchangesThe growth of cryptocurrency exchanges in the last five years has been remarkable. According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 400 cryptocurrency exchanges in existence, with a total daily trading volume of over $300 billion. Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.The number of cryptocurrency exchanges has increased due to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies. As more people invest in cryptocurrencies, the need for platforms to buy, sell, and trade them has also increased.Impact of Cryptocurrencies and Cryptocurrency ExchangesCryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges have had a significant impact on the financial industry. They have provided an alternative to traditional investments and have allowed for faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. However, they have also been associated with criminal activities like money laundering and have been subject to regulatory scrutiny.Challenges and Future of Cryptocurrencies and Cryptocurrency ExchangesCryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges face several challenges, including regulatory uncertainty, security concerns, and scalability issues.

Currently it is not possible to giants like Binance with an Exchange script but different concepts and specialized concepts still can gather users if promoted well.We also have an unique market starter liqudity provider that can even own tokens that are not listed anywhere. So using this with stake and also automatic token deposit on joining system can give value to a token.Thanks for your input.Regards",

The SEC is putting too much heat on crypto exchanges in their jurisdiction. They should just find another place or country to start their crypto exchange, not the US so that there will be no hassle problems later like what is happening now.As long as they build a local exchange, that's fine as long as it's legal and helps the government and the people, why not, right?",

To be able to create such a project from scratch requires a lot of experience, we have been doing development agency for 20 years before switching to product so we had an established team already.We built Exbita to overcome this problem.Here is our mission which I am pasting from the company page of our landing site:“Our mission is to deliver an all-inclusive crypto exchange script and substantially lower the barrier of entry to this market for entrepreneurs. We meticulously developed this product, paying particular attention to security and ease of use, and created a top-notch service so that our clients can focus their attention on growing instead of reinventing the wheel.”As a software company, we realized that entrepreneurs needed an easier way to enter the crypto exchange market, without having to go through all the technical challenges, which we could solve for them through our expertise in blockchain development.But even after all the development we are doing, you still can't compare it with a platform like Binance based on the features it has. And this feature gap will continue to increase as it's not possible to match their development resources.",

Does it go to your servers and how is safety or data integrity is kept considering it’s a complicated code. Nice development but script for something related to financial domain is risky bet. Hope to see expert opinions on this. We understand your concerns. The system does not send any kind of data to our servers other than license check request which only sends the domain, IP, and license number. All other data stays in your system and database. External provider connections like SMS use your account credentials. You can even delete the license checker but it would prevent you from getting the updates and our support.At the base, it is a PHP script built with the Laravel framework. So if we were to purchase the script, what we would do is investigate the source code with git, staging each file one by one after checking. There are more methods you can use like investigating network traffic, using firewalls, etc.While we agree with the concerns of users, we also claim that It can be used 100% risk-free by using a couple of methods.Let's assume that we decided to commit a crime to steal exbita users' funds. You can prevent this easily no matter what we put into code by using many methods. Some of them:- Use coinpayments for all tokens/coins. This does not even require any edits to the code. You just set this from admin. By using Coinpayments for all deposits and withdrawals, you can turn the hot wallet into a cold wallet managed by Coinpayments. In the Coinpayments system, you have the option to manually approve withdraws so even if your entire system including your Coinpayments API credentials are stolen, there is no way to get any funds out of the system without your manual approval from coinpayments.com.- Exbita supports cold storage. You can just use the cold storage support and don't keep any funds in the hot wallet other than a small amount to cover transfer fees. When the system receives a withdrawal request that the hot wallet cant cover, exbita will ask you to fund the hot wallet from cold storage to process the withdrawal request. You can set an amount to your hot wallet to send the extra funds to cold storage when a deposit is received.We did not add any technical solution here, but using some firewall support, it would be impossible to get hacked, no matter what we release in updates. Please contact us for more options on security if you have concerns.But in the end, the trust issue happens due to being a small company. For example, the Wordpress plugin WooCommerce also deals with financial stuff, collects credit card details, etc, and huge companies use it, We don't think any of them checked the source code for any foul play. Also, Exbita is a starter, if you can find an opportunity and grow with it, you can hire your dev department, and they can handle the rest.",

Isn't much more money needed for the operational work of the exchange? I believe that anyone who wants to legitimately start this type of business must have a lot more money available, and in that case, a $400 script might not be adequate.What you present here is not a bad thing as a kind of reference for your (or the team you are in) skills, but it would be completely frivolous for someone to start a business in this way.We can all see that trends are regularly upgraded, new regulations are set, and significant changes in the functioning of almost every coin. Do you have the capacity to monitor something like that and do regular upgrades? I am talking about a longer period of time.",

In the recent years, exchanges have set some standards that determines whether it's a shitty exchange or top-tier exchange. Exchanges like FTX make it even harder since there's less trust in centralized exchange services.My stance still remains the same: Creating the exchange product - \"script\" is the easier part compared to actually getting customers or users to use that exchange so it needs to be a well thought out decision.",
