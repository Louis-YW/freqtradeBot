Eth pow already dead and it has no demand anymore in the market. Those youtubers were only shilling and no more. If you keep believing with those youtubers and you must be dumb enough.

They were not having long term prospects. they were building based on the hype and once the hype gone and those projects build in the shitty ETHW will be dead too. I think that you must learn what happened with project build in the ETC",

If they hit and get the back and support of most in the community, they'll make a quick buck.But if they don't get the support many in the community, they'll still make a quick buck for any exchange where the old and outdated chain is listed. The reality is that we'll keep moving forward and most of the outdated projects will be left behind.",

Because they are not. I mean why would they? Eth 1.0 was a dead end. NFT people are dealing with artsy environmentalists who want nothing to do with the pow, i mean they were already getting death threats for doing nfts. The beauty of the whole Ethereum is that dozens of brilliant minds are building the same ship, if some rogue wants to keep on developing ETHpoW, go ahead, but there's a huge team of actual geniuses developing eth2.0 and L2 projects that chose it. That's because it NEEDs a lot of people and every specific skills to build something like that. And it takes years even from those guys to make it work. Why would some random rogue devs who think that good old ETHpoW is a way to go could be success compared to that? People saying otherwise have been listening the bitter miner propaganda. Bitter because they can't profit from mining eth anymore.",

I see very few people on the forum that are interested in ETHW, I have also done some research on it and can say, ETHW should be interested and put on the watchlist for the next bull season. According to some news that I know, currently most of ETHW is being held by miners a lot and retail investors have sold out after receiving the airdrop and these miners are mostly from China. Personally, I think there will be a big pump in the future for ETHW for miners to sell and you should note that currently binance is still holding ETHW but they are not open for trading.",

I am certain that it will still survive in the future because the miners won't abandon it. But whether it grows and becomes big depends on many other factors. Like ETC still exists today but has not received any notable development. If you invest then be careful but if you are a miner can mine and sell them.",

ETHW was only a forking blockchain being issued by miners. These miners are loosing income from ethereum caused by it has been migrated into the POS so these miners were trying to create their own ethereum that used old consensus as a way to get money and make their rig alive. The price of ethw already plunged a lot. There's no reason to buy this shit scam coin issued by greedy miners. There are two old ethereum ETC and ETHW. ETC is much more viable compared with ETHW. ETHW is pretty much the same like bitcoin fork coin issued by miners. The developers are only aiming for hype. Hype = money. Once you can get the hype and you can get money easily without any effort. that's the main aim for those developers keep used the old garbage blockchain like ethw.",

Miners were only using it as a way to get loads of money to funding their mining facilities. I don't see any urgent release that scam fork coin other than being a money bag for the miners. Miners are so greedy pretty much the same like scammers but they were blatantly issuing the scam coin like that and spread hype to make sure people wanna try to buy that. It's basically nothing like any other fork coin in the market. there will be no improvements for sure and it will survive without any volume next year as people will be dumping their shit scam ETHW to the market.",

As I said about the future of ETHW, I am not sure but to make a profit and leave afterwards, I think ETHW will be more desirable than other top altcoins that's why I chose it.

I've made so much money with the coins i don't even know what they are supposed to do. When i don't believe the fundamentals it's easier to sell your bags on the right time as you aren't emotionally attached or in any way delusional.But i still in my heart believe that if you pick the right horse, preferably with low marketcap, that has good fundamenals it could turn out as it did for early ETH holders.
