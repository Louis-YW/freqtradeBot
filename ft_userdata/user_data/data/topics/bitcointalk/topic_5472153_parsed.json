Interest levels were close to zero, and there were segments receiving government support with limited opportunities to generate quick income. This is different from the situation now with high interest rates, but everything may change with... The beginning of the second quarter of next year, so I expect that we will be in the range of 35k to 55k until next May based on the current price movement.",

Those who had done this in the previous bull run had actually re-entered having to buy again. This isn't the last bull run and Bitcoin isn't ending after this bull run. Many investors do this seriously, they accumulate when bitcoin is in its bearish period and then sell during the bull run to earn profits. I donâ€™t see anything wrong about this in my opinion except maybe you invested with an amount that you canâ€™t afford to lose and then when the bull run doesnâ€™t comes it causes you panic. But for someone who actually invests and holds on to it and during bull takes profits and then come back again when itâ€™s low to accumulate more then itâ€™s ok. QuoteWith the halving approaching I would advise new guys to avoid falling for trends and hype that would create FOMO and FUD because there would be lots of panicking next year around the Bitcoin halving be smart to fall for pump and dump altcoins .I have to agree that we canâ€™t do away with the huge hype thatâ€™s coming 2024 aside the bitcoin halving promising the start of the bull run, the biggest hype will be the ETF saga. Many people are banking on bitcoin and the entire crypto market to rise after its approval and some are accumulating Altcoins, my advice is make sure you arenâ€™t using money that you canâ€™t afford to lose because banking on Altcoins is just like gambling.

I hope in those days when the last Bitcoin block is mined, the world will be much friendlier.Although almost everyone hopes the world would be at peace. Concerning the price of bitcoin I would say I am one of those who actually love it at where it is today, because if the price is actually higher like about a $100k then I would say the newcomers or wouldnâ€™t be privileged to buy at a price less than $30k. So there is still some positives in the price still been this low",

I do not actually see any terrible thing that could happen imminently. Maybe the postponement of the Bitcoin ETF approval. This might actually cause some declines but since we already have the Bitcoin halving on the pipeline, huge declines may not be experienced. Interesting times are ahead for Bitcoin and it can only get better.Anyone still doubting should check recent market behaviors.",

Loading your bags with Bitcoin all because of the coming bull run is actually not making sense. Those who had done this in the previous bull run had actually re-entered having to buy again. This isn't the last bull run and Bitcoin isn't ending after this bull run. Yes, however, if you are looking for long term, it's better to fill your bags and accumulate as much as you can before the eventual bull run and new all time high after the block halving. History has proven itself every 4 years unless the cycle breaks. So it make sense to be ready instead of selling and re-buying. Specially if you don't want to complicate things on your end. And if you are a retail investor just like the majority of us here.Of course, it's obvious that this will not be the last bull run and Bitcoin isn't ending after this bull run. But you have to take advantage of the cycle itself.Quote from: BIT-BENDER on October 30, 2023, 03:28:50 PMWith the halving approaching I would advise new guys to avoid falling for trends and hype that would create FOMO and FUD because there would be lots of panicking next year around the Bitcoin halving be smart to fall for pump and dump altcoins .Altcoin market is very different when it comes to bull run, yeah, majority of them are going to be fuel by pump and dump scheme. And that's why smart investors knows where to put their money, and that's clearly on BTC.",

This is all bad, and manipulation is also hyped, but spot traders are making great profit, and those who have filled their bags with BTC when it was under $30,000My theory here is that BTC will come down again to $30,000 or $31,000 after touching the resistance of $37,000 or $40,000. Because correction is needed here and this all manipulation by the media and DTCC meant nothing for the whales, I don't see any type of huge profit booking from the whales, which means the game of manipulation is still on.In the long run, we are bullish. Your 78-week chart was a good one, but you should also add a source link to your picture if you have taken it from somewhere, and if you have made it yourself, then it is ok.",

Don't keep on accumulating and hodling bitcoin without a price target of when to sell. We should all at least have a target price. As for me, I am accumulating and hodling my bitcoin assets till the price gets to $100k. I will sell up to 80%Â  of my bitcoin holdings during the bull run and reinvest during the bearish market little by little.",
