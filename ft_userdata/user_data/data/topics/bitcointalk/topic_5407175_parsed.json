You'll find that the people who go to such lengths are usually pretty creative and have found a strategy that works but requires scaling up rather than bigger betting. Like you, I struggle to look after 2 or 3 tables without fumbling at important moments, like multiple great hands coming out requiring attention at the same time, so to play this they must have lightning reflexes with lots of practice in playing poker efficiently. If you're able to calculate pot odds quickly then that can do a lot of the work for you, when you're sensible with betting and can read opponent behavior.",

You have to invest in equipments, energy to recharge all of them and there is also a natural degradation of each device, especially when using them often and for long periods of time.
