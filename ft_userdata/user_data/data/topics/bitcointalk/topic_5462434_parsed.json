If it is generated in a manner that is completely random and you're including all of the alphabets (both capitalized and non-capitalized) with all of the numbers, then you might possibly be safe. Given the correct criteria, I would think that so long as a good key stretching function (think Scrypt, and salted) that is sufficiently strong and slow is used, it should be safe.However, note that this isn't exactly recommended because there are still various points of failure involved. You are better off using one of the wallets to generate a seed instead.",

Again, this is very much dependent on your chances and if you're generating a wallet from random letters, then using an established HD wallet is far better.",

The total of 62 characters (lower/upper a to z and numbers) is the simplest list of characters that doesn't even include regular symbols (*.,/\\'\":; and so on). Not to mention that technically speaking UTF8 encoding which is common for character representation can encode more than a million characters (not just the 62) ergo depending on the list you used, each of your characters can indeed represent a lot more than just 72-ish bits.",

So, based on his examples we have to assume [A-Z][a-z][0-9] and not necessarily UTF8 which gives a way larger character set.It's questions like OP stated that lack some details for good reasoning. Why use a limit of 12 symbols which are hashed to a private key (i.e. a sort of brain wallet, if SHA256 is used to hash the string of symbols)? His examples appear as a random sequence of symbols.

SHA256, even double SHA256 and salted might not be good enough. SHA256 is naturally a pretty low resource hashing function to bruteforce as compared to other commonly used hash functions, Scrypt for example which is memory hard and expensive.

This is pretty much the same as double SHA256 hash we use in mining bitcoin. With the size being fixed and we knowing most of the initial blocks for each iteration, some of the computation can even be skipped during the internal block compression in each round of SHA256 and in the second SHA256 which would optimize the code significantly.The reason why KDFs are created and used for storing passwords is partly this. You can't just skip computation like in a simple subsequent SHA256 computation.",

From combining email addresses, passwords and nonces to generate your entropy, to backing up your seed phrase as colors or even emojis. Why?None of these harebrained schemes that people come up with will be better than the standardized processes we already have in place. You'll either be decreasing your security and making your coins easier to hack, or you'll be increasing the difficulty of recovering from your back up and put yourself at risk of locking yourself out of your wallet.If you want to do this because you don't trust dev/urandom, then you should use a physical process such as unbiased coin flips to generate your entropy (and also get a new OS). If you want to do this because you are going to save your 12 characters in a password manager or try to remember them, then you vastly increase the risk of theft or loss compared to writing down a seed phrase. I can't think of any other reason you would want to do this.Quote from: DannyHamilton on August 22, 2023, 08:55:44 PMI'd want my generated seed to be AT LEAST 20 characters.
