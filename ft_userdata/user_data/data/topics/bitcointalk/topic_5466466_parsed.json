You may not notice it but it is there and has a big impact on how you play.QuoteSo, What Is Adrenaline?Adrenaline is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body. It is also a type of medication used to help people who are in significant pain. When adrenaline is produced, it has several effects on the body. These effects are an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, dilated pupils, increased blood glucose levels in the brain, and growing air passages leading to the lungsAn adrenaline rush is a sudden experience of these symptoms and can make us feel more alert, somewhat like having a cup of coffee. An adrenaline rush can also heighten our emotions, whether they be excitement, anger, or something else.So How Do You Manage Your Adrenaline Rush In Gambling when you lose your bankroll but the adrenaline rush is still too high, people who cannot control their Adrenaline Rush are often people who commit the mistake of chasing their losses and adding more funds to their account, amount that usually they cannot afford to lose.In my case, I stopped drinking energy drinks or coffee this is one of the contributing factors why I have an adrenaline rush and it took to long to subside.Note: I'll be monitoring every reply and include the best reply and will become a reference Quote from: Oshosondy on September 11, 2023, 10:44:49 PM if you are gambling and you are very excited about it and jump up and rejoicing over your winning, your body adrenaline level will increase also.

      "body": "Adrenaline is also called flight or fight hormones. When the body not in the resting and relaxing state, more adrenaline will be produced. What I am saying is that if you are gambling and you are very excited about it and jump up and rejoicing over your winning, your body adrenaline level will increase also. What you are saying is that what makes someone to gamble responsibly in a way that if losing, the person will stop. I have experienced it countless number of times that if I lose and continue to lose, that I have to stop. If I do not stop, my money will all be spent on gambling. That is enough to stop me. Past experience is enough to stop me.Even if I have won, I stop.",

Well for most times I just reduced my stake to the minimal because at that moment thinking straight is very hard so when I reduce the loses start looking small so as to remove that flow or rush of anxiety all over my body.",

      "body": "That is precisely the reason why we gamble. I mean I do not gamble with a lot of money because I do not have that much money, its basically just \"fun\" money for some people, think of very small, but the idea is to get some adrenaline rush while gambling and that's what happens. Its the act itself that makes me excited and that's why I like to keep doing it as much as I can for as long as I can. There is no reason to try to block that out, try to learn to live with it, in fact try to enjoy it if you can. That is how you do very well and you are going to end up doing much better on the long run. It will be a big help for a lot of people in the end and should be considered improvement on their betting.",

This usually is enough since my adrenaline rush cools down really fast due to my thinking while I'm trying to deposit more into my account lmao. It might also be due to my habit, it's more of for my eye kind of practice, I usually look away from my monitor after say, 20, 30 minutes of using it for like 20, 30s. Now if I happen to lose my funds, that's usually my call to do this (regardless of the time I've spent looking at my monitor), just to take a break maybe due to winning or losing much. If I do get that adrenaline while I still have money to bet, then I just continueI used to have these kinds of moments in the past though. I couldn't stop it so I just prepared to like run in my bathroom (pretty close to my spot) and wash my face with cold water to wake myself. While it did work sometimes, I also had instances where I forgot to do so.",

Simple by not expecting to much on gambling like winning more profit since the more you wanted to gain to more you lose. There are instances that you became greedy when you want that and that's when frenzy mode start so for me or us not to be in that situation better set your expectation low and target to have fun since this is more fulfilling feeling when you enjoy playing those games.",

Its why I stopped betting on casino games because whenever I'm about to lose the coins I deposited, I've already doubled down to max bet and then crossing my fingers for the last bet. Sometimes it work but mostly don't. Stopping myself from playing those dice and slot helped me managed the adrenaline and at the same time lose money.",

      "body": "I don't know about other gamblers but whenever I lose in gambling, the excitement decreases a bit. When my losses are already happening one after another, I might not enjoy anymore. I think losing takes away this adrenaline effect. If there are times when I still continue to bet despite a series of losses, that's not out of excitement anymore. That's probably just out of the desire to get back or of frustration. But it's oftentimes not fun anymore. The adrenaline has already subsided. I think winning is the thing that boosts this adrenaline rush. So it's possible that instead of having made a good profit already, since you didn't stop because you are still excited, you go home with nothing.",

When that happens, I know it’s time to stop playing and head home with my winnings. On the other hand, nothing dampens an adrenaline rush in me like being on a losing streak and ultimately losing all your bankroll. The confidence fades and at that point, I’ll not be so enthusiastic as before about playing anymore. Losing out takes all the excitement away. With very little motivation to go on, I wouldn't wait till I’m cleaned out before heading home.",

I will stop when my limit attained .But I love your way mate, not drinking energy drinks and coffee will help you lessen that one.because me myself is not a coffee lover nor drinking .",

Just like in gambling, everyone definitely has their own adrenaline when it comes to winning, some have strong adrenaline and some have weak ones.If a gambler has strong adrenaline then he is always optimistic about winning, whatever other people's advice he ignores because he doesn't judge how much money he will bet because he is confident and optimistic that he will win.Meanwhile, someone whose adrenaline is weak then he still has doubts about gambling and he can still think that one day defeat will happen to him, he even still looks for professional gamblers to gain knowledge in gambling so that he doesn't lose and avoids the possibility. risk. will happen to him.",

I can get enough adrenaline even without betting when I watch my team's match. Coffee and especially energy drinks won't do you any good, even without bets, so it's worth thinking about if you value your health.
