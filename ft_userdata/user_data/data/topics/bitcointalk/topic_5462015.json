Altcoins have centralized coins and they are created with each bull run of Bitcoin, each new trend in cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. When a trend is over, new technology in blockchain is developing, altcoins from a past trends will face with risk to be forgotten and dead.",

It would be better if you install Bitcoin Core and run full node, this make you become the one who contributing to Bitcoin network.",

I tried taking a page out of some of the altcoins out there following my evaluations that it was bound to boom.Unfortunately, you never can be too sure with cryptocurrencies and it even gets worst with altcoins. You end up looking at your coin gets liquidated to a point where, trying to withdraw it as a means of cutting your lose comes with zero effect.Series of these events have made me stick to bitcoin where the disappointments are way less and hodling for a long term haven’t been much of a problem for me. Still, I don’t consider myself a bitcoin maxi. I just use it the way I perceive it and the prevailing circumstance of the time.",

But I still hold a few altcoins, which I take in as a result of taking a few profits from them. Even though it poses a great risk in terms of leading me to lose everything, I still take the risk and grab a few for some quick selling and taking profit.",

I purchased a small amount of bitcoin and gradually increased my hodlings from then. I don’t consider myself a Bitcoin Maximalist because I also have some investments in altcoins. I’m here for the long term and only invest in projects I believe are going to do well in the future.",

Scammers capitalize on the poverty, illiteracy, and greed of the people to swindle them of their hard-earned money. People are easily attracted to get rich quick projects because of the promise of high returns. I have seen friends and family members lose money from shitcoins that promise to make them rich. Some have also been lucky to make a fortune from these risky altcoins. I am not a good risk taker and not also in a haste to make quick money. And I don't also want to learn by experience, so the bad experiences of others is enough lesson for me. I have not had any bad experiences in the crypto sector because my only choice,, for now is Bitcoin. The stability and uniqueness of Bitcoin attracted me to it.",

Any token sale Whitelist or hyped public token sale I can get my hands on will be a go for me to participate. However, my approach changed when the bear market came and the profits dried up as fast as they filled up. After taking some time to reflect, I felt managing risks properly would be a much better play if I plan to be in the space for the long haul.A lot of people won't agree but it's actually a zero-sum game especially with moonshots and shitcoins.",
