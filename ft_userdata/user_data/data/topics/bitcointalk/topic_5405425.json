For example, Bitcoin doesn't exist? the answer is that you will not know anything about Bitcoin, nor will altcoins and shitcoins be born, you will not make money in crypto, and maybe you will be a fiat slave forever. That's a typical answer, so what kind of answer do you expect?",

      "body": "depends on how it was to fall..you are asking a very simplistic question wanting a simplistic answer even though there are hundreds of variables involvedEGif you mean a catastropphy event where all nodes and miners went offline at same time where no blocks were made and no way to transfer ownership to do trades.. and it to never return..well that would be an unprecedented event to have something that never returns. you would be talking about if a solar electromagnetic wave wiped out all electronic devices/chips type of event. peoples first concern would be their house electric/heating and water meters were not functioning too. no power no running water (back to Victorian era/wild west cowboy days)if it were not a EMP event. and instead if it were a break in ALL cryptography where nothing is safe and wont ever be safe. then bank accounts, debit card tap&pay devices, website secure payment gateways, phone calls and other tech would be in trouble. toobut while the world goes back to paper money and real people stood at a desk at a bank branch manually counting paper.. there would be no blockchains, where even internet would just be simple splash screen information stuff style internet of 1995(just prettier)there would be no blockchain no bitcoin no altcoin.. just back to good old paper money again and no fiat gateway to do online fiat stuff. its all like everything went back 50 years. lets call it on balance of averages.. 1980's era lifestyleif it were not that but instead just a backdoor bug in ECDSA/SHA. that would affect other world devices too so expect real world (non bitcoin users) panic too. while banks and any smart device changes and does software updatesas for bitcointhen thats just a wait for devs to change the algo's to then get mining and trusted transaction ownership signing/transfers to start again..then thats a timescale to panic and then timescale to rebuild trust again. and how volatile the value change happens inbetween. (unpredictable to give you a number)chances are that not everyone would trust it again. or take years to rebuild it to the levels that took years to build in the first place. in all cases too many variables to predict which path follows. probably an alt that never used ECDSA/SHA might become popular. but i dont think there is one that doesnt use ECDSA. so dont expect that to be the main path the future goesif it were not that and instead a code bug local to bitcoin only.chances are devs could backdate the node software. while keeping the latest block at last seen height. and eventually get things running again. by which you are then asking about timescales and panic and rebuilding trust and confidence.. much more sooner but not minutes/hours to be \"normal\" but also not years of lost confidence either. somewhere between weeks to monthsthe network may function again very very quick in minutes/hours.. or days at most. but the trust and confidence might take weeks to months. some may just drop bitcoin to use an alt that never had those bugs. and some may see it as a success story about overcoming disaster and trust it more that the community is stronger then other projects by being able to overcome/fix a catastrophy too many variables to tell",

There would be no alternative to the current broken system and no fix for it, because even if they would try to fix it, it would still require trust to work. You would be completely in the hands of some sociopath politcians, take canada for example. They could censor you however you want and freeze all your accounts forever, for doing a donation to a protest. You would have no real alternative to escape inflation. Authoritarianism would thrive even harder, without much to put against it. We wouldnt be here talking about decentralization. There wouldnt be many possibilities for an individual to stay self sovereign in all of this. This is our biggest weapon in not letting totalitarianism get out of hand.",

Before Bitcoin it wasnt really clear to me how to fix the money, someone who isnt familiar with the concept of decentralization might not see that trust based models will always fail on a big scale. And they might be believing more control is the answer to solve these issues.",

You know that many people have made their living better because of bitcoin.It has given many of us the financial independence and also thought us a lot of things from finance, economics and other things related to money matters.And to my life, I guess I'd be stuck in saving my money in bank having that 1%-5% per year that will also be lessened due to inflation and won't be forced to know about financial freedom",

A continuous network outage or a metheor to hit the earth and wipe us all.Well, for price to go down, I don't even know what woul need to happen. There will always be people buying and selling.For a network outage to b effective it would have to be kind of for ever, otherwise, as soon as a node could connect to the network, the network could be brought back up again and continue!The other option is not even discussable! :pSo, I can't see Bitcoin falling without any other major events/catastrophes also taking place!",

For sure we dont have crypto market as of this moment and if theres one then for sure the top coin would be always the originof all crypto just like on what people been seeing on BTC itself.Deal with falling price and instead on freaking out then its better to see or look for these moments to be a good opportunity for you  to buy in.",
