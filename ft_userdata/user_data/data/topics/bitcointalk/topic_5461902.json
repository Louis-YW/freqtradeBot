Correct? Okay.Yee, you are absolutely correct.The company that buy bitcoin and offers bitcoin spot ETF trading, the customer of the company will be able to trade the spot bitcoin ETF without actually having the real bitcoin. So they are not trading bitcoin, they are trading bitcoin spot ETF. Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 03, 2023, 05:23:36 AMMy question come be say, e dey possible say our own indigenous investment companies fit still apply for this Bitcoin EFT from our own SEC?Yes, it is very possible. Especially if a company or some companies (in countries like United States) bitcoin spot ETF have been approved, like BlackRock that applied for example, and also if Nigerian government regulates cryptocurrencies which is the first and mainly necessary.Quote from: Davidvictorson on August 03, 2023, 05:23:36 AMRemember say our own SEC no demonize bitcoin like CBN did.It is not only about SEC, cryptocurrencies need to be legalized and regulated in Nigeria, unlike now that our government has not passed any bill related to crypto regulation.",
