However, there might be 5% of altcoin projects that are presently being prepared to create their all time highs when the market recovers. This is a market for investing in good development teams. The time of marketers and shills are over.The sp500 was pulled from the bear market yesterday in the last 2 hours of trading. Othervise it would close weekly candles 20% below ATH which would confirm that we entered bear market. Its very risky moment for investing. especially in crypto. All projects, no matter if good or bad, can dump another 80-90%. Is it good time for long term investments? I guess not because even good projects can not recover in 2025-2027 bubble because in next 5 years new, better technology can be developed. And I think that If we are about to see 1-3 years of bear market its not like 5% of altcoins get to new ATH. There are 18 000 coins and i think that only ~3-5 are quite good. 5-20 are interresting. Rest of them are shitcoins. So we are talking about 0.1% not 5%.",

Investors who are ready for a bear market can experience significant gains by waiting it out for a while. In addition, the rewards from investing in some of the good projects that will survive this bear market is immense.This situation will make some projects fail, most probably. But it will also produce some of the best blockchain applications with a lot of value, that will survive the bear market and perhaps end up as the next multi billion dollar market.",

Not only that, there could be exchanges that are going to closed in this bearish trend just like in 2018. So it's going to be very tough for everyone, but for those who have seen this in 2018-2020 sure knows what's coming and how to adjust in this cycle.",

I have come to the crypto market pretty late and therefore sadly i am not owning a good bag of BTC or ETH like many of the early investors do and usually i also don't want to invest into projects like BTC and ETH because i just don't like the fact that i would buy BTC for 50k USD per coin or ETH for 4000 USD per coin while others have bought them for 10$ per coin a few years ago.A long and hard bear market is always bad of course in general but it also offers the opportunity to invest into one of those projects that are usually so extremely expensive already. I mean you will probably never get ETH for below 100$ again but 1900$ is definitely a better entry point than 4000$.",

During the bear market, all altcoins have dropped a lot in price and can be seen as a cheap buying opportunity but there is no guarantee that they will rise again after the bear market is over. There are only a few that do that and choosing those altcoins at the moment is really hard. Looking at 2018, we can see that only bitcoin and eth are still holding their ground, most altcoins have been overtaken or replaced by better new ones.",

Maybe waiting if bitcoin have bullish and reach higher price very nice for researching about which one top altcoin to buy and hold, but if bitcoin can't reach higher price not any chance for getting profit although with few percent only because less consistent getting coins can reach higher price.",
