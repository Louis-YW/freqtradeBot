This is how the journey basically begins. If the question is already written and we can read multiple answers provided then its better to read those post made. Since its no sense to create another thread intended for that question since they will just get the same answer or they will not get a direct to the point opinion from people. To many helpful threads created on each section wherever they go that's why instead spending some time waiting for some people to answer its better to research since this can help us increase the awareness on many things and we can get a lot of information by browsing since to many related stuff that we can search on.Although its really good to ask but people need to make sure first that if there question has not been asked already so they can avoid any negative thoughts that might place on the thread they create.",

Personally I feel there won't be much need for some questions we see here if the Op was diligent enough to have done their homework before bringing it up here. Although I might understand what the op is trying to pass across because I've observed that some users here try to avoid criticism if they ask for clearance to a question that bothers them and instead prefer to just keep it in and since they are not conversant with the search engine, the problem goes unsolved and they know less about that area.",

There could be some feelings that you guys feel when you asks questions and then you're answered impolitely.

In two weeks we would see a newbie who would make this same mistake by registering today and jumping in to ask questions with doing their due diligence or worst still writing to advise others. This doesn't apply to newbies who already have good grasp of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.",

TBH, I'm hesitant to ask questions here as well, so what's the solution? Search button.Now with regards to search button, I believe that the forum has been the main source of my knowledge when it comes to crypto, but aside from that, I also watch educational videos on Youtube as well. In this way, I don't need to ask, but I'll just use the search button, and there you go... my answer is there already. I'm not saying that don't ever ask questions here, but there's always another way to get those answers.",

When I was new I don't even bother to use the search engine on the forum to find answers to my problem, and most members on this forum have reacted in a unpleasant ways for asking questions that have been discussed over again, and some members still answer my questions even even when they knew its not a new topic. We are not all created the same, some will react in a very good way and some will get on your nerves and probably even insult you, do not mind, you are here to acquire some knowledge so, keep doing your best and avoid breaking the forums rules, you will be alright.",

Every great person started as a newbie so enjoy the learning process.Some newbies will simply join forums by asking questions that are not meant to ask. Some of these questions can even annoy you, which is why some newbie accounts get tag or banned from the forum. Still, some newbies are not going to learn from their mistakes. To help each newbie, there is a search button at the top right of the forum to support us in our search for whatever we want to learn about. Newbies need to be aware that this forum is to produce a good quality post and conduct thorough learning on bitcoin before asking what they don't understand. He who asks will never lost, so they need to realize that. It takes time, effort, and patience to move forward in this forum. Everyone who wants to learn should ask questions in this forum, but we should be aware of what questions to ask. I don't think anyone is above learning something they don't understand. Some newbies may even get upset when high rank members aren't taking it easy with them. However, everyone who wants to learn should not be upset for any reason.",

So is very important to read more and write less in most cases and the ability to select the area of focus in your research guarantees faster and lasting understanding.",

When you ask question, there is always a high percentage that you learn from what you ask because asking is part of the educational process that involves one learning by asking question and it is imperative to know that you will only know what you have no idea about only when you ask question.So therefore question is very important and a vital role in education and learning process. No matter how irrelevant it is, there must always be an information one would get from that question asked no matter  how stupid or irrelevant it is.

Members don't take any good question as foolish. Newbies who get bad responses, most a times asked again an answered question. When reading bitcoin articles I send questions on google and get answers that lead me to this forum. The forum contains lots of answered bitcoin related questions, I noticed. If you don't want to feel foolish, look it up on google, not on bitcoin talk. Google will direct you, to a thread that answers your question in bitcointalk forum. In searches where the preferred answers are not found here, then you can ask the forum and they'll rarely criticize your post, as it serves a good purpose. Yet newbies fail to notice this, and rush to ask questions with no prior research, whether it has been asked. That's why we still see thread where the Op might feel foolish. Causing a decrease in the forum activities of the newbie. He'll have a million and one reason not to ask questions again. Hence, dropping them to the non active member crew. This thread, which I love, will help newbies like myself to summon the courage to keep asking questions and participating in the forum despite what we feel from the criticisms of our previous mistakes. Soon we'll learn and make lesser mistake, as such.",

I have h as d this experience where I am always in a haste to invest in projects without doingy own proper research and upon doing that, be they run away or rug pull with investors funds without any tangible reasons and in most cases no one hears from team again.
