  "content": "I think someone sent me the conversation taking place between thanos and some FBIagent, let's read it together and understand the situation.Quote from: FBIagentBecause you know, we know gov very well and can assess very well which offenses are extremely frowned upon.You have committed a lot of frowned upon offenses, which we even told you to avoid via PM. You made fun of it and happily continued to act against gov standards.Gov will not tolerate such abuse and mixer advertisements.If you don't want to have problems, just stop your mixer advertisement, stick to the gov standards, stick to the washington rules and stop shitposting!I'll also archive your entire forum so we have something to laugh about when the time comes.Shitposting and running your mouth like this never worked before gov!Quote from: thanosUmm, Ok done. Check this out, how do you like it boss? ðŸ˜‚Unfortunately this anonymous source didn't provide any more data, just these two quotes.I hope you are not offended.ðŸ˜‰A dark comedy by ~dig.",

      "body": "Sorry to tell you... but this kind of speech is very far-fetched.How reliable is your source?I believe that there may even be corridor conversations, but it is more of a warning that the authorities will start to tighten their grip on those who publish mixer links. Than this kind of speech.That seems a lot like invention to me. Something very similar to TV series or films.EDIT: Now that I saw your level of trust! It's all explained.",
