  "content": "Hello,Btcpuzzle.info website is a platform built on “Bitcoin Puzzle” and provides free services for this purpose. Btcpuzzle.info's main goal is to provide a \"solo pool\" service built on Bitcoin Puzzle. Although our website is a pool website, it also offers extra tools and services.Pool website; https://btcpuzzle.info/Github repo (100% Open-Source client);https://github.com/ilkerccom/bitcrackrandomiserVanitySearch;https://github.com/ilkerccom/VanitySearchBitcrack;https://github.com/ilkerccom/BitCrackIt only works with BTC Puzzle 66, 67 and 68.- This is not a shared pool.- If the private key is found, only you can see it. No one else can see!- If the private key is found, it is not shared.- Once a private key is scanned, it is not scanned again.- Your luck; One in 33 million.What is a solo pool?Solo is a general term and can be explained as a type of pool where people work only individually and ultimately gain the entire reward/service for themselves. Although we work with the logic of \"solo pool\", we use shared workforce. Here people join forces, but only one lucky person gets the full reward.What is the working logic of the pool?Btcpuzzle.info pool works with the “range” logic. Here private keys are no longer important. The pool sends a “range” to each user and asks them to scan it. It contains approximately 1.1 trillion private keys in its range. When the user completes this range, he/she sends a flag request to the pool saying \"I scanned\" again and the relevant range is marked as a scanned area in the pool. It can never be scanned/requested by anyone else again.Our pool works with the \"proof of work\" logic and asks users for proof of its work. This proof aims to find “3 extra private keys” for each existing range. Each time the user requests a range from the pool, “an additional 3 BTC wallet addresses” are transmitted. All of these addresses are within the transmitted range and the user is asked to find the private keys of these wallet addresses. The private keys found are hashed with SHA256 in a special order and transmitted to the pool server as proof of this work. If the evidence passed is correct, the scanned range is now correctly marked as “scanned”.Does the pool share the rewards found?This is a solo pool and rewards are not shared. Only the labor performed is shared. The person who finds the private key gets the full reward.How can I trust the pool?Our main goal is security. You can access the application that allows you to scan (bitcrackrandomiser) as 100% open source and examine it with all its codes. In addition, all additional programs (Bitcrack, VanitySearch, etc.) can be accessed as 100% open source on the Github page. With the API documentation we offer, anyone can write their own client and join the pool.In addition, Btcpuzzle is hosted on AWS servers with daily backups and works with a \"proof of work\" system. This prevents unauthorized and incorrect information from entering the pool system.Does the pool know the private key found?Our BTC puzzle pool does not have information about the key found. If any user finds the private key through the pool, only he/she knows it. No notification is sent to the pool. You can see more information by reviewing the open source codes of the application.For more questions, visit https://btcpuzzle.info/faq.",

No keys were found in <~8% from the beginning. Easy to find if sequentially scanned from start to finish.But as you said, it's not a guarantee.Thanks.",

No one else can see!If the private key is found, it is not shared.Once a private key is scanned, it is not scanned again.Your luck; One in 33 million.Puzzle 66 HEX ranges as follows. It starts with 2 or 3. Any private key in this range is 17 characters long.20000000000000000 to 3ffffffffffffffffWe take the first 7 characters and delete the rest for now. The result will be as follows.2000000 to 3ffffffWe now have about 33 million possible private keys to search. All possible private keys are stored in the database. A random value will come up each time a scan job is called and will be marked as scanned when the scan is complete.I can scan each key in about 10 minutes on NVIDIA 3090. This actually means about 1,1 trillion private keys. When the private key is scanned, it is marked as scanned. So it won't show up anymore.Thanks OP.Is there a linux version?I admit I'm not to keen on cross-compilation.",
