  "content": "Discover The New Generation of Tokens in ATYUMATYUM is building a market-leading, decentralized marketplace that offers robust solutions to the many problems of the crypto trading and mining industries.ATYUM is a new-age crypto marketplace designed with a focus on high security and user privacy.Project Highlights:✅Atyum is based on the physical transfer of digital assets and the custody falls on the owners themselves who are network nodes.✅In Atyum no type of global consensus algorithm is used since the architecture of the network does not need it, and uses local consensus algorithms directly connecting the wallets of the end users.✅Digital assets in ATYUM are protected; guarded by each wallet and there is no global (public) status of the assets of each of the wallets. ✅ In ATYUM, every participant in the network is recognized and the intellectual authorship is signed in the token itself. If the user is not the real author, he is fully recognized within the network and buyers can take legal action. Our VisionAt Atyum, we want to use tokenization in real cases, providing solutions to different industries and creating, together with our clients, new business models. Technology Atyum uses a digital asset transfer network where custody rests with the end users' wallets. To guarantee the integrity of the tokens, each of them is assigned with two mathematical proofs. If the token suffered a modification the mathematical proofs would be different.Each ATY token has its own private blockchain and records all modifications and device changes that the token has undergone since its creation. Features & Benefits❇️ Flexible mechanisms for the creation of tokens❇️ Adapted to European legislation❇️ Allows the safe custody of the tokens directly in the wallets of the end users❇️ Enables the local or remote execution of the Smart Contracts❇️ Privacy - no public access of user wallets❇️ High Security - physical custody of assets with double encryption❇️ Highly Efficient - each wallet can process more than 230,000 transactions per second❇️ Self-sustaining network with surprisingly low energy consumption❇️ Rewards for every successful transfer❇️ All transfers are peer-to-peerAtyum Founders (AST)A security token, it works as an NFT that will be minted directly in Atyum’s network.

      "body": "Benefits of ATYUM Blockchain and Cryptocurrency MarketplaceATYUM offers a number of unique advantages over other cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms in the market.Some of These Benefits Include: Increased user privacyUnlike other blockchains where the user wallets and translation records are public and can be seen by everyone, Atyum offers increased privacy as there is no public record of what each user has in their wallet on the Atyum marketplace. High securityAll owners in the network have full physical custody of their wallets and digital assets and they can store them securely on or off the network. The access to private wallets is minimal with double face and device biometric encryption to ensure high security of user data and assets. Efficiency & scalabilityExisting blockchain networks, including Ethereum blockchain, have limited capabilities and can only process so many transactions per second. Moreover, the energy consumption is high and the networks produce massive CO2 to affect the environment. Atyum is created with high efficiency and productivity in mind.Not only does the network require minimal energy to operate but also it has a high capability to process up to 230,000 individual transactions per second independently in each wallet. Rewards for tradersIn exchange for their help to maintain and grow the Atyum network, all network nodes will receive a reward for every successful transaction/transfer they process. The reward amount will be randomly chosen by the algorithm and credited automatically to the wallet of respective users. Truly decentralizedAs a fully decentralized blockchain network, all transactions in the Atyum network are peer to peer, i.e. there are no middlemen involved, which further ensures higher security for users and data on the platform. SustainableAs mentioned before, Atyum needs very low energy to operate, since it does not depend on mining and ensures the maximum utilization of resources, which helps save cost and achieve better sustainability overall.The Atyum marketplace is slated to release in Q4 of 2022. The STO will also be launched around the same period. So, be prepared to buy the most innovative cryptocurrency of the year — Atyum coin and get access to a revolutionary crypto trading platform and marketplace.Visit the website: https://atyum.com",

      "body": "ATYUM TECHNOLOGYATYUM  uses a Digital Asset Transfer Network where custody rests with the end users' Wallets.Atyum uses a digital asset transfer network where custody rests with the end users' wallets. Unlike traditional tokens, Atyum tokens have the ability to mutate. Every time a token changes state, the value of one of its properties changes, or it is transferred to another user or device, the system causes a physical mutation of the token. To guarantee the integrity of the tokens, each of them is assigned two mathematical proofs. With these proofs, there is no way to know the content of the token, but if the token suffered a modification the mathematical proofs would be different. When the access keys to the private parts are changed, Atyum encrypts the data again. The bytes of the Token and the access keys are changed, so the identification and the public key are modified. For this reason, it is considered that the physical form of the Token mutates.  In addition, each token has its own private blockchain and records all modifications and device changes that the token has undergone since its creation. The different parts of each block of that chain of blocks are digitally signed by different wallets (nodes) of the network, following an unalterable sequence of signatures. The sequence of external signatures, together with the algorithm that prevents a node from being able to sign twice with the same digital signature, guarantees the immutability of the content of the internal blockchain. By linking the blockchain of each token, with the mathematical proof system, Atyum guarantees the validity and veracity of the token. Just Start Investing : https://atyum.io",
