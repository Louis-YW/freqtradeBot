  "content": "Hello everyoneHope y'all having a wonderful day. And so I was doing some research about the best way to store your Bitcoin Pass phrases. I know a lot of people do not really think this is that important because you can simply just copy out the phrases and just dump it in your diary or on your notepad, or maybe on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere in your room and then just assume it's safe there. Well I used to think so too, not until I come to realize that storing up and securing your phrases is actually the primary thing in the Bitcoin journey and a lot of Bitcoiner are quite ignorant of this fact.I began my search as I surfed the web and also checked forum too. Then I bumped into a thread by @fillippone which literally contained the answer to my questions. He spoke about storing and securing your phrases through what's called a WASHER. didn't have a clue what that meant so I had to dive in to take a look. Honestly I was quite fascinated and think everyone should take a look at his theory because it's important everyone know about the safest way to store up your phrases and keep them away from intruders. According to Jameson Lopps, he said in a tweet \"Most folks figure an Evil Maid attack will never happen to them because they don't have a maid. Yet nobody ever expects the Naive Child attack...\" You never can predict where the attack might come from so it's important protect yourself and avoid it.I also followed a link on the thread that led me to an article by Jameson on how to also choose the way to back up my phrases. On the article I bumped into something that kinda cracked me up. I couldn't stop laughing for a while after reading this because I found it really hilarious. Image below.Well, the reason for this thread is to offer some sort of guide to anyone who's also asking questions about the best way to back up your phrases.",

For us, offline is very safe with a storage method that can be anticipated when disasters such as fires and floods occur.fillippone's post is very detailed and for me how to secure the important 12-24 word phrase that is explained by fillippone -> Securing Your Seed Phrase with Washers is very safe.",

Seed phrase is not common target of physical attack which means don’t store it on an obvious place which a thief will target to open such as vault or bags. In my case, I put mine on a page of my Bible since a thief will most likely not gonna touch that when doing a sin.",

Definitely the last place a thief would think of going, well except they're already informed there's something precious there. How about those that don't have a physical bible, where would you suggest they hide theirs?",
