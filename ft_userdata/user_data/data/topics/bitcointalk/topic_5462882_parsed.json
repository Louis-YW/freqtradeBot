The hacker already has access to your wallet and I am even shocked that he left some tokens or coins there since you can see them. It would probably be a bait to lure into thinking you can withdraw your funds there and you send in gas fee. This gas fee will be wiped out by him every time you send them there. For future references desist from all this airdrops of connecting your wallet and if you feel obliged to do so then Make sure you connect an empty wallet to it. Separate your funds from this kind of wallets",

I gave it a quick read, and you're probably going to need some technical knowledge for this.I'm curious though, are you sure that's what you have? I would imagine that in order for this to work, the attacker would need your private keys/seed phrase, and you can't just get it by linking your address.[1] https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/5716855323675-Fighting-back-against-sweeper-bots",

      "body": "An auto-withdrawal bot has been installed on your wallet, and this was done as a result of your connecting your wallet to a Web3 scam airdrop site that ended up backing up your wallet data. And since your extracted phrase is what was only needed for them to activate the auto withdrawal, you might have little chance of recovering those funds in your wallet since the bots are always activated to target blockchain coins, which are mostly used to cover transaction fees. For you to recover your fund, you will need either another bot faster than the one installed on your wallet (this depends on the amount you have in that wallet, as those bots aren't cheap at all), or if the bot gives a little space before it could move out your fee, then you might just need some extra hands, one of which can serve as the gas sender and the other as the token sender.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on August 11, 2023, 07:34:46 AMI'm curious though, are you sure that's what you have?

I'm sorry for your loss.Airdrops are not profitable, and they are also a technique for hackers to gain access to your wallet and shift whatever you own through the wallet connection you have used.I'm not sure how they do it, but perhaps the standard wallet connection is less secure than others because scammers can clone anything to obtain access to what they want. I would encourage you to avoid airdrops.",

What you can do is forget the money and believe that if you are alive, you can earn it back with your knowledge and skills. That's how I actually thought of it and decided to make it back, still work in progress though. Good Luck mate!

There's no solution for a hacked wallet but to abandon it but if the hacker wasn't able to get all your funds then you still have a chance to transfer it to another wallet before the hacker steal it and then abandon the hacked wallet. I'm sorry that you have to learn it the hard way but that's all there is but to only abandon a hacked wallet. It is already compromise if the hacker can access your wallet which means the hacker have the secret seed phrase that you are keeping safe but failed to do so.",

Since sweeper bots are design to loot your eth right after sending. The best solution is to protect your wallet at all cost since you dont want to refeived a potential airdrop and knowing that the one will get it are hackers. As much as possible always take caution on those connected dapp or site cause they might be a chance that these are harmful to our wallets.",

I think you should stop sending any money into that wallet, because it is already compromised and you'll be incurring more losses.

However, I came across information stating that it is theoretically possible to create transactions that can perform both functions at the same time - funding the address with ETH to cover gas fees and withdrawing tokens from the address. Such a transaction would be executed in the same block, thereby preventing the sweeper bot from stealing the funds.I'm not expert enough to provide you with precise instructions, but you can read this comment on the Ethereum Stack Exchange to learn more: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/112099QuoteYou are in the correct path. MEV can do this for you.You can use MEV to submit two transactions with the following properties:Either both or none of them go throughThey should be executed in the same block, next to each otherThe first one adds Ethers to the walletThe second one transfers the assets outYou pay the miners directly in Eth, disregarding any gas feesThe transactions are not broadcast publicly, but are sent privately to miner(s)You can use Flashbots to accomplish this. If the total value of the assets is big enough, you can ask their whitehat hackers for assistance. Or you can do it yourself with their tooling, which requires some developer know-how.",

Then, hackers will not be able to steal you because your wallet is empty, and in the worst case, you will lose gas fees, which are less than $ 5, but remember that you do not need to have a balance in your wallet to claim Airdrop.Stop using your old wallet seeds or downloading random apps or add-ons you don't know about.",

You can have a wallet where you apply for them and where you would get paid in and then have another wallet where you would be sending your tokens to this wallet should be preferably offline. When you actually give priority to what you have than what you can get you would be better off.",

Next time don't use your main wallet on airdrops since its hard to spot which airdrop is legitimate and which is not so to to aid that possible happening use alternative wallet and choose hype airdrops and not those random one you pick from unknown source.",
