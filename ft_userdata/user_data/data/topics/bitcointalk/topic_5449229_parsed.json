Only 1% will survive to the next bull market and break a new high, the rest is slowly falling to zero.Â Similarly to how NEO, NEM, EOS, LISK, and XLM were popular during the 2017 bull run (all dead now and going to 0), Near, Celo, SOL, and DOT were popular during the 2021 bull run. Maybe one of them will survive, maybe not.",

      "body": "I haven't even heard of CELO. Is that coin really prestigious or a top coin? You are indeed a newbie if you haven't noticed how the top altcoins are changing all the time. They come and go rather quickly. Except perhaps for Ethereum in the second spot, the rest are constantly moving. Many in the top 10 are replaced with new ones, that will also be replaced with new ones, that will also be replaced with new ones. This doesn't end. The reason is that majority of the altcoin projects do not really serve a practical purpose in real life. Most of them are just riding a hype.",

Its true that these projects has been quiet but that depends on them on how they could go back to spotlight. Now it will be a fight between new projects and old projects. But the important one is the rise of btc cause even though these new ones rises but bitcoin is dumping then its still not a good or healthy market. Btc will always dragged everything with it.",
