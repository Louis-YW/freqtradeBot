Because gambling is always a loss and always a win.That's why if you always experience winning there are only two things, either you are really lucky or you use fraud. Today, the loss of gambling by players often in a casino is normal in gambling and cannot be changed.",

Why do you feel fucked when you should already know how gambling works, it is not a win-win situation because sometimes you lose too and in your case you've had a good start and can win quite a lot compared to your losing time, but what also messed you up are you inability to cash out your winning and rather you went all in and there after losing everything in the process. By the way, do you mind sharing some screenshot evidence, that can show your betting pattern plus how much you time you spent in gambling, but since you said you do sport bet so you were not involved in the game so I can ascribe this to addiction but your case is something that close to addiction.",

While you go all in be patient and make a really good analysis of the event you are going to bet in.If we check the odds of all different sports,like soccer,basketball,tennis,baseball I am sure you as a sharp bettor will have no difficulties to find a couple or 3-4 games which in total will make the odd of 2 and bet all in in these type of events together in a parlay.I am saying so as no matter how sharp you are you are risking a lot in parlaying a lot of high odds in your sport bet events.If you want to get over it and forget the 1 million dollar dream,just be patient,count the days,do not think about gambling,go and recover in a rehab center where you will be offline with 0 chances of gambling and I am sure you will forget about sport betting then.",

You have a serious problem on taking profit. I’m sure that you don’t have any target profit when you are gambling which is why you keep chasing huge profit at some point when you have a huge bank roll because you are already bored on playing slowly.Do you play small bets from your starting bankroll until you get that final bankroll before you all in or you keep doing all in bet since the beginning?Quote from: NAPK1NS_RA3 on June 09, 2023, 06:34:18 AMHow do I get over the countless failures? I’ve been chasing the $1,000,000 dream for years. This is your problem. You have small bankroll while your target is very high. You are getting too excited when you are already climbing near it. Set a maximum profit per game and just maintain a balance for a starter bankroll again so that you can secure your profit and build your target profit slowly. The chance of doing this over and over is very high because you are not taking profit out of the casino. You already have the talent? Just use proper bankroll management.",

You bet very boldly and risky and also feel dissatisfied with what you got, and you have to realize that the ambition to play will end in disappointment and also have to realize that in the end the house will take it all.You are not a professional gambler but a reckless and greedy gambler who wants to always win or chase losses because this is highly discouraged, and your confidence will result in two things, if you lose you will be very sorry because the amount is very large, and if you win, you will be a very lucky person and become rich.",

If you have goals and targets why not continue to pursue getting it, $ 1000 to $ 100k that's already great in my opinion and you are a bold gambler in my opinion so that you can make money fast and also run out fast, I don't assume that you are an addict, but you are just a crazy gambler who made too much money and chance.I will not be as brave as you, if I win $90k then I will immediately withdraw it then keep it as an investment by buying some crypto for the next few years, but it all comes back to you as long as you still want to chase $1 million dollars you can chase it if Want to. keep going guys, don't forget to control yourself and the game",

You're so lucky not every gambler has the opportunity to reach that earning but unfortunately, you have a worse habit and mindset of not getting satisfied, you are trying to reach the $1 million in one go that's a long shot it can be considered a lottery jackpot.The first thing that you need to do is to let go of that $1 million goal and be satisfied with tripling your earning you are good at gambling but lack the control and the right mindset you know that the house will eventually beat you as you keep on chasing that big jackpot, but you keep denying it and so you end up losing.You can eventually reach that $1 million all you have to do is to be satisfied with small earnings or it will become a cycle of winning a lot and then losing everything in one go.",

The only one who can solve your problem is yourself but it doesn't just take overnight to get over with it, you need patience to yourself as well.

You are letting yourself to taken over by your greed. Create some rational plan for your playing sessions. Do not forget to implement it each time you gamble. From the plan you had, program or automate your decisions. I suggest, if you won around your desired profit, stop the playing session and come back fresh. If you lose from that, accept it, pause for a while, then come again with a fresh mind.This is not proven nor from my personal experience, but I think this discipline will help you with that issue.",

There's nothing wrong with you than insatisfaction coupled with greediness, if you had applied the wisdom of taking the profits for investment on a profitable assets and using the initial stake back to gambling, you wouldn't have been in this kind of shoe because the more you keep attempting to hit big the more you realized loosing beyond measure, there are times you will also need some space to be able to rethink and plan well for the next steps, when you gamble, use the amount you can afford to loose, when you will, remove your profits and invest and return the capital back to gambling.",

If you add up all the winnings that you indicated, then an amount close to 1,000,000$ is collected. Start immediately putting aside part of the prize money and don't touch it until you reach the amount that you have been dreaming about for years.90,000$, which you, as you say, won and lost, in fact, it turns out that you didn't even win.

Well although your digits are quite big compare to most other little gambler but one thing is certain in both which is the ability not to control yourself to stop whenever you have not reach your goal. and this problem is not experienced by only you and most certainly all type of gamblers. The ability to wait and pause when gambling seem to be very hard and it's always land the gambler in situation where he would be regretting why he hadn't done so.",
