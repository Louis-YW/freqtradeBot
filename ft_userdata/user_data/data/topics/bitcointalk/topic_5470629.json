      "body": "Nice of you to create this post op.I understand your aim of wanting to organize our local board however there are a couple of things you need to take note of;1. This is a local board so an off topic thread would not be very necessary ( based on say na we we de dis forum). Other boards having off topic doesn't make it a must for us to have one also.2.These so called off topic posts is like a form news to some of usÂ  here ( I don enter here many time see better better gist way no relate to Bitcoin but Dem still make sense)3.keeping off topic posts in a particular thread will kind of hinder noticing recent posts or gists.4. Lastly If this was a grave importance to the board I believe a legendary member or rather a moderator would have come up with this idea.",

You make valid points for the others you but I say make I talk about this one. Nah true say having an off topic board no dey necessary because as you point out, some posts being made no consan Bitcoin but them still dey and even dey thrive but I no think say nah only senior members sopoz think up these kinds suggestions else e go make am look like restriction of thought. Â If you get idea and bring am up, nobody go kick you say you make, highest thing nah say these big ogas go help table the matter to the right authority.Some of the posts wey dey here no dey related to Bitcoin and I no see how e wan dey of use to us for the forum but e still dey and I dey ask why dem never delete or lock those threads as e dey make the forum look littered.",

Op this your thread dey related to one wey @forever101 post so na this be my reply in response to this thread ðŸ‘‡Quote from: Samlucky O on October 19, 2023, 08:12:40 AMOp every thing you talk for here naso e be. Me personally na victim of that thread but when I reason wetting I post say e no make sense I wan delete but no way rather I lock the thread. As we all dey here we dey learn everyday. If you check the group we dey coordinate ourselves even say moderator no Dey. For example if you post already existing thread and somebody comment say the thread Dey active or say na off topic you go see say that person go lock the thread that is a sign of say we dey take correction.If you check the forum now you go see say many Facebook topic don reduce after that thread. And any post wey no make sense people no dey comment am again. If you post no body comment on am, you already done know say wetting you post no make sense. Most of the Bitcoin topics wey don past before, people don dey go comment on am and in go come out for top Post. And people go emphasis am. Just like the way ona talk every body no be the same we from different places and so our atitudes dey show for our body. But make we take that as an advantage to correct ourselves. Sometimes people no dey no wetting Dem dey do until you tell them. But I believe with everything wey I talk for here say people don dey change.Quote from: Hatchy on October 17, 2023, 03:47:27 AMwhen I observe other local board them, I come see say Dem too don get sub boards to take discuss other issues. their normal board jus dey for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies alone. But for we board, we never get any child board at all and many other request wey don de ground but Dem Admins Dem never still grant us any. the OFF TOPIC board, na one board for now, wey I think say go clear if we get for now, but I no know how possible, e dey wey Dem go fit grant us this request. so I wan ask our oga them wey be senior men for we local board, make Dem still try as na only Dem know how to take run the matter.if you check these topicsNa something dey bring out matter. If you check out very well for those places wey you dey point hand, you go observe say maybe na this kind offer topics Dem wey you dey talk, wey make them bring other sub boards. So na gradual process be that. Even if you talk from now till tomorrow if no moderator or say them no creat other sub boards ego just dey continue. Any place wey no get leader or rules wey dey guid them, Dem dey behave lawless. So to me since e be say dem never create Sub board, I think say them for creat thread of rules and regulations com pint am for top sothat anybody wey introduce himself here go see the modules operandi of this group. I think that one for better.Quote from: Hatchy on October 17, 2023, 03:47:27 AMLady cries out as ex-boyfriend reclaims container shop...End of year wahala!

Lastly If this was a grave importance to the board I believe a legendary member or rather a moderator would have come up with this idea.Senior members no be God wey know everything, them still be human beings like us and no be every time you go dey expect them to talk something before its termed necessary. OP here made a very important point here as limiting what is posted on our main board to important things will increase our board reputation and even go help us get moderator very soon cos them go see say we dey package ourselves wella. Separation of concerns na very important thing, if you wan visit real topics, you come main board, if you wan visit other topic, you go off topic thread or board. I don go other boards see even say them get child boards of their main board. Its high time we let's the forum community know we're matured enough and organized to handle things and have a moderator to furtherÂ  boost the presence and recognition of this our naija board. Abeg OP, you've my support on this",
