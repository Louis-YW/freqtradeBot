  "content": "In the month of June and July, lots of FUD spread due to the bear market and how the price of Bitcoin was affected. Those who still believed that Bitcoin can never be devalued nor crash bought Bitcoin when price dropped to $17k and if they had sold on July 30 2022 with Bitcoin opening price of $24,581, they would still have made have made $7k+.   In cryptocurrency, Bear and Bull market will always come, but some people are only concern about the bull market but always cause FUD when bear market begin.    Bitcoin price On June 10 2021 was $36k+, same day an expert of crypto-asset said Bitcoin could surge to $1 million in 6 years as it becomes more scarce than gold (https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-06-10/Bitcoin-to-surge-to-1-million-in-6-years-as-it-becomes-more-scarce-than-gold-says-crypto-asset-expert.html#:~:text=Interviews-,Bitcoin%20could%20surge%20to%20%241%20million%20in%206%20years%20as,gold%2C%20says%20crypto%2Dasset%20expert ). Five months after then, Bitcoin grew over $68k (https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-history/amp/). That has given me the reason to see that Bitcoin will be as scarce as Gold in years to come.",

      "body": "You know, after reading the source link you gave, I don't think that Bitcoin will be scarcer than Gold dude. Do you know why? Because first of all it is not correct to compare Gold with Bitcoin, we all know that gold has been in the world for thousands of years and Bitcoin has existed for 13 years plus since it was created as a digital currency. And in accordance with kitco, it is also possible from 100k$-1M$ each Bitcoin in terms of value. Then it's a bit vague to say that Bitcoin will be twice as difficult compared to Gold, that's still a bit wrong, because the only basis is a speculation for my understanding and opinion.Look at this graph image below, imagine that since 2010 the starting price of Bitcoin is less than 0.1$ that almost no one pays attention to it and as each year passes and more and more FUDs come out about Bitcoin and that FUD destroys in Bitcoin is still going on until now that I noticed that none of these things are coming true but if you look at the history of Bitcoin price has increased more and more until it has surpassed the price of Gold in the market for a thousand years of existing in this world, whereas Bitcoin has existed in this world for more than 1 decade. So, how are you saying that Bitcoin will be scarcer than Gold, when its price continues to increase in the market, and it was even said in the link that it is even possible to become 100k$ to 1M$ each bitcoin.Referrence: https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/price/",

Bitcoin and gold belong to different leagues of assets. They don't have to be compared with each other. Both of these assets have different use cases. In a nutshell, it doesn't matter if bitcoin is more scarce than gold. On and off, I am seeing a frequent comparison between bitcoin and gold which doesn't really make sense! Even if we consider both as an investment, still they ahould not be compared!",

But, it's not the scarcity, alone, that's making it valuable. It's the inflation rate's predictability. With a quick gettxoutsetinfo, there are about 19,110,092 BTC. Each block increases the supply by 6.25 BTC, and a year is equivalent to about 52,500 blocks, which increase the supply by 328,125 BTC. Therefore, the annual inflation rate (of the last 52,500 blocks) is (328,125/19,110,092)*100 = ~1.71%. And I can do this for any year.Good luck on finding another asset with such characteristic.",

The \"yearly production\" is currently ~328500 (6,25 * 144 * 365). This is, in 2022, around 1,71 % of the current supply.In the case of gold, the estimations are about 187000 metric tons, 244.000 if we include still unextracted discovered underground reserves (source). So the 3.000 metric tons extracted per year make currently up between 1,2 % (including underground reserves) and 1,6 % (not including them).I think the second number (1,6%) is more appropiate, as we could compare the unextracted gold reserves with the \"unminted\" ~2 million bitcoin. So it's actually quite surprising that the numbers for gold and Bitcoin are so close at this moment. Their \"scarcity level\", thus, is currently in the same order of magnitude.But the big difference is that in the case of Bitcoin it is known that the scarcity will increase as the mining rewards are reduced each ~4 years. In the case of gold, everything looks like the production could even increase further, not only due to the historical graph but also new technologies being constantly found for extraction. And thus, it's indeed likely that \"Bitcoin will be more scarce than gold\".(PS: Yes, of course, Bitcoin is a different asset that gold and their characteristics are different, but it is partially used for similar purposes - as \"scarce\" assets meaning to serve as a long-term store of value. So I think it's legitimate to compare certain aspects of them, like their \"scarcity\".)",
