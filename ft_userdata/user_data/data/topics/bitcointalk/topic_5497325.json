Because of its discovery, we step up in the evolution of new technology which is popularly get the fame as Blockchain technology. Due to its existence, we get the infrastructure for digital payment systems without the interference of any intermediaries or centralized bodies, also have some popular currencies like ETH, BGB, BNB, SOL, MATIC, TON etc. utilising these emerging features of Blockchain.",

Even if you lose that test at the middle of the way, it's probably still a good thing because you're still going to get a lot of profit out of it but the caveat is that while you were hodling through those years, you're also accumulating your bitcoin to increase your stash.",

Not exactly. Scarce goods that are in demand are valuable. Never forget this second part of the equation. Then we can go into whether scarcity is a good reason for people to demand it, and it probably is, along with other factors, such as being decentralised and being able to be transmitted quickly.",

For it to shrink, more than 450 coins have to be lost every 24 hours.But overall you are correct that with the capped supply and a decreasing reward we have scarcity in bitcoin and lost bitcoins contribute to that scarcity as well.QuoteHow exactly does \"costly production\" improve scarcity?I'm not sure if this photo was designed to talk about Bitcoin because in Bitcoin even if it costs $0 to mine blocks, the supply will still remain scarce.QuoteMoney needs to be scarce to preserve its value and Bitcoin is scarce therefore the future of money has to be Bitcoin and this is one of the best chances we have to accumulate it before it becomes more scarce.

Indeed, money continues to circulate, but its value is no longer in accordance with the price of goods for now if we want to shop for something. Of course, this cursory study leads to the fact that Bitcoin also offers an option that can be used as a protection option against inflation while being decentralized in nature and Security on the other hand can also be used as a tool for Investment and Storing Value.",

Don't have inflation is key, not scarce because with same total and circulating supply, with time there will be more people in one country or on this planet and demand on that currency will be higher. It helps to increase its value but the first condition is, that currency must be accepted and used widely already. Better, it is legal tender already.You can fork Bitcoin source code, create your currency but if nothing to make it interesting for people to use it, it will have no value now and next 50 years.Keys are: have good use case, utility, good value, adoption, not inflationary or better deflationary, with time its value and price will increase. Scarcity does not decide value or price if other things don't exist.Year finance's YFI token is an example that scarcity does not help value and price.It has only 36,647 YFI tokens in total supply but its price is only $7,236.",

These investor manipulate that market like the way they want and they don't care much about the sacrity of the BTC but they just want to have good profit for themselves not matter how many traders will go through the loss they don't care.",

Don't loose your sleep over the scarcity parameter. It is proven that the amount of people who are yet to accept Bitcoin is far much greater than those who would dismiss Bitcoin and this would definitely raise the demand for it. If we do have to compare the rate of adoption in Bitcoin over the years we can tell that it has improved with good significant figures which creates more demand and if in addition with Bitcoin scarcity then we can experience a price hike.

Indeed, creating a currency with a scarce supply is not that difficult, and I have never appreciated the supply factor as what makes bitcoin so special. What makes bitcoin special is the use cases, the benefits it offers, and decentralization is what makes bitcoin special because no other asset has this feature. An asset has value and its value will be determined by demand, if an asset has a limited supply but people don't need it then it will become useless.

      "body": "Op let me start by spotting out the fact that the graphical representation of supply in this post is wrong for that of the one you illustrated as the one you intended for Bitcoin. The reason is simple. The supply of Bitcoin isn't actually increasing slightly like the graph is illustrating, however it is constant. Bitcoin has a constant supply cap of 21 million coins. The economic aspect behind it is the rate at which coins are circulating. The rate at which new Bitcoins are added from the supply to the circulation is cut in half after every halving event. This causes demand to rise thus causing the value of Bitcoin to increase.The graph you used op should likely fit better for the demand of Bitcoin after every halving event but still for a proper analysis it isn't supposed to be a straight line graph or chart.Here are two graphs for illustrationBitcoins pumped into circulation is constant every 4 year but it's halved after every halving event.",

Those people or institutions who used to pass scary statements about Bitcoin have now also started to believe in it and start to invest in Bitcoin. BlackRock world's biggest company was also believed that Bitcoin is an illegal thing and used for money laundering but if we see today this institution is also highly involved in the Bitcoin investment. Well, we also can see some of the negative comments passing people around us also these days and the reason behind that is they are illiterate and have insufficient knowledge about the ecosystem of Bitcoin. haha, I used to listen kind of stories from others who don't believe in Bitcoin that many people lost big money in Bitcoin indeed there is no doubt people may lose their money here but they should also focus on their approach like what are they doing many of them lose their money in Future trading with high leverage, some of them use insecure wallets to store their bitcoin just because of insufficient knowledge. They should conduct good research before entering into the crypto industry that insecure wallets can be compromised easily so if one is losing money here in the crypto space, most cases rely on their own mistakes. In the end, I would say a good amount of knowledge is required for one to survive safely in the crypto space/industry. So always conduct DYOR if you find any term different and doing this may add up to your knowledge. Many Thanks",
