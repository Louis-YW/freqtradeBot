  "content": "-  Sam Bankman Fried will speak to the New York Times as if nothing happened at FTX via twitter. That many people think that this person should be jailed because of what happened in Ftx. Now to confirm if this is true, So I check the New york times on the DealBook summit. It is about business, culture, and politics. The host here is Andrew Ross Sorkin brings together today's most vital minds on a single stage.But why with SBF? and we all know that Ftx is bankrupt and under investigation. It is said that FTX is the biggest Fraud history in cryptocurrency and customers lost billions in this incident.Source: https://twitter.com/SBF_FTXSource: https://www.nytimes.com/events/dealbook-summit#overviewNow in 2008, Bernie Madoff was arrested within 24 hours of his fraud being revealed. But now in 2022, Sambankman-Fried will be attending New York Times Dealbook Summit after His fraud was revealed.Source: https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billionaire-conman-bernard-madoff-arrestedSo something is going on here, And I read something there on Twitter but I can't find the difference between the two that Bernie Madoff stole from a politician while Sam Bankman-Fried stole from his customers and donate to the politician.And it seems like a conspiracy. But why hasn't SBF been jailed until now? and will speak at the Dealbook summit with various well-known CEOs of large companies around the world such as Ceo Ben Affleck(artist Equity), Ceo Tiktok Shou Chew, Ceo and founder Reed Hasting of Netflix and Founder and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky and others.Source: https://www.nytimes.com/events/dealbook-summit#overviewSo why is Sam Bankman-Fried still here? It seems awkward because your business failed and you lost billions of your customers' money and yet He's still part of this event.Now, if you are one of the customers of FTX, you lose money because of this person's negligence, then you will see how his image is improved in the mainstream media, what do you think? Maybe he paid the New York Times, it seems possible, right? or his connections are really wide and he can control the well-known media in the market. And the interesting part of SBF's tweet is that he already said this,He wouldn't retweet that if he didn't want to convey anything. So, it may be just my speculation based on the news that came out, and SBF is saying in the tweets about a restart, probably revive FTX or a new Exchange or we don't know. Just from what I can see, there seems to be something brewing that we just don't know, but still, look at what will happen in the future.",

As far as I know people don't need him to explain, don't need him to apologize, what they want to know is if he will give them their money back or not. But with $8 billion in debt, I don't think he's going to pay everyone. If he couldn't return everyone's money, this interview wouldn't be necessary.",

      "body": "This New York Time event is getting interesting.  With the powerful and successful Business CEO's speaking, I wonder why Sam Bankman Fried is still on the list.  Are they comparing two kinds of CEOs?  It would be fun to take on the topic like that and have these invited Speakers as example of these kind of CEO. As the topic of the New York Time, I found out that their catch phrase are as follows :So I wonder how would SBF deals with those possible topics on the picture above.  How can he address people about successful business when he himself had failed in maintaining his own business let alone he even cheat his investors of profit when he loaned huge amount from FTX and invest majority of the investors funds through his Almeda Research firm and not directly from FTX.",

Because Sam really seems out of touch and hanging with company like that just shows that he isn't ready to remove himself from the spotlight. Who knows what he says, either shameless promotion of his \"vital\" mind or words of wisdom about how to lose a multi billion dollar business in a week. Maybe he will even lash out to CZ and blame him.Quote from: Mr. Magkaisa on November 24, 2022, 03:03:58 PMBut why with SBF? and we all know that Ftx is bankrupt and under investigation.

But now in 2022, Sambankman-Fried will be attending New York Times Dealbook Summit after His fraud was revealed.-cut-Bernie Madoff scammed Americans directly, and FTT international section that failed, prevented people from US using it. There's a big legal technical difference. Also the fall of the FTX seems to be because pure incompetence and irresponsibility. Proving that they had any intention to scam will be harder then with direct ponzi.Quote from: Mr. Magkaisa on November 24, 2022, 03:03:58 PM-cut-So why is Sam Bankman-Fried still here?

Also there's a change this still gets cancelled because of public outcry.And even while i loath the irresponsible behavior of SBF, at this time i might even might buy some ftt as a gamble, not much because it can go to zero, but it looks like bottomed out, and if there are any rumors of recovery i have to consider that some others believe them too. And that would mean some recovery, not to ath but even 3x this point wouldn't be impossible.",

It might work out, the FTT market might react positively in connection to the event where SBF is speaking.  We know crypto market is crazy, hypers and pumpers needs a small news to start pumping a target coins or token.  So, I believe this event will somehow turn the red market of FTT into a green one in a short span of time.",

I only question whether Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried will have to spend years in jails after all bad things they did.If jails are not places for them, I am sure they will continue to play around with cryptocurrency but they will more difficult to receive support and crowd funding like in the past. Their terrible record can make investors very fearful that prevent them to fund new projects from Do Kwon and Sam Bankman-Fried.",

The news looks so bad about how criminal was still able doing the thing like that by speaking in front of lots of people. There must be a justice for the victim from FTX.

It seems NYT is curious about the vegan diet of Sam and want to know more details about the daily life of this celebrity who belong to the select group of the beautiful people, the demigods of our times.This interview is a shame and a disrespect to the customers of FTX who were scammed. I believe the media should be investigating him and his connections, not interviewing him friendly.Anyway, I'm not surprised he isn't on the jail. Scammers from previous cases aren't in prison too. Mashinsky and his wife are mocking investors from Celsius and sharing their beautiful, wealthy and peaceful life on social media in a daily basis, as nothing has been happening. So I guess it will take a while until SBF will go to the jail (and that is, if he goes...).I thought the justice system worked on first world countries, but I was wrong.",

This is not the first time SBF has donated to the Democratic Party, in 2020 SBF also ranked 2nd on the list of Biden campaign supporters with 5.2 million. Despite FTX losing big, SBF still donating to politicians, it seems everything was planned to avoid jail time after FTX declared bankruptcy.",

A sabotage is still possible but let's hope that there's no worst thing will happen like assassination given that he has a lot of hatred from other people now especially those who invested with his FTX project. The organizers should put extra effort on security since they have a speaker that has a recent scandal. This will be an interesting event for sure.",
