With lightning network, you can open a channel with another person, consisting of a multisig means of sending bitcoin offchain. You will fund your lighting network wallet which would be through an onchain transaction to open a channel. Once the transaction is confirmed, you and the other person can be able to make transaction using lightning network as the other person open the channel with you with. It is fast and of low fee. You can close the channel and move your coin back to your onchain wallet at anytime.

Please I want to know the difference Bitcoin and Lightning Network aren't the same thing. Bitcoin is the first and no-1 cryptocurrency of the world and it works on its own network named Bitcoin network. The lightning Network on the other hand is a layer 2 scaling solution that mainly works on top of Bitcoin to increase the transaction speeds, and reduce the transaction fees.The transactions based on Lightning network aren't always recorded instantly on Bitcoin blockchain and have faster speeds than regular transactions. The Lightning network is the recommended choice for small transactions as the fees are low for those transactions. Lightning network basically creates payment channels between two individuals, and that channel can be updated without being recorded on Bitcoin blockchain. Once the both parties agree with the transactions then they can close the channel and after closing the channel the transaction will be recorded on Bitcoin blockchain.",

LN transactions may not be instantly written on bitcoin blockchain but after the channel is closed the transactions goes to on-chain (correct me if I am wrong).Lightning Network is an off-chain which means none of the transactions happening inside Lightning Network, isn't recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can consider it with a custodial wallet transaction as well. When we use Binance for receiving Bitcoin from another party, we can use a Bitcoin address from Binance. After receiving Bitcoin, if we want to send Bitcoin to another Binance user, we don't need on-chain txs.The same thing happened in LN too. When you open and fund a channel in LN, one transaction is recorded in Bitcoin Blockchain. After that, through LN, you may have thousands of txs but none of them are going to be recorded on the Bitcoin Blockchain ever, because the transactions aren't happening in Bitcoin Blockchain, they are happening in LN, another chain you can say. When you decide to close the channel, you will receive the fund you have in LN after all the transactions are settled and one transaction will be recorded in Bitcoin Blockchain. So, even if you are having a lot of txs in LN, only 2 transactions will be recorded in the blockchain. When you fund the channel and when you close the channel.Quote from: WatChe on April 30, 2023, 12:32:06 PMLN has some WOW features to offer but somehow it failed to took off. People despite all odds still prefer to use bitcoin on-chain instead of LN.It's because LN transactions aren't yet comfortable for a lot of people. Though it's easier than a lot of people think, it's still not the same functional as Send and Receive. More development on LN-based wallet is needed I think which will make it easier to use without having a lot of knowledge on how LN works.",

The result is a digital system that grants electronic transactions that cannot be counterfeited. Such system is very attractive to build onto. It's clearly resilient to human failure, as far as anyone can tell. It takes advantage of the human psychology, without including the flaws of human nature. Every person who owns part of it is encouraged to secure it, but no person who's against can do much. Lightning is one network built on top. It tries to help on Bitcoin's scalability (as network), and it inspires for further creative and innovative ideas.",

Bitcoin is a coin and LN is not. The comparison should be between the LN channel and the blockchain (or Bitcoin network).So, OP the LN as others have said is a second layer of bitcoin network, which is introduced to fasten transaction and decongest the bitcoin network. You and your friend can open  a Lightening Network channel, and the opening will be registered on the blockchain, every other transactions you do are off the blockchain until when you close the LN, and the summary transaction would be broadcasted in the bitcoin network. By this, you do not have to pay for the transaction fees which happened between you and your friend throughout the channel existed.",

Imagine, you have opened a channel with 1 mBTC and spent 0.5 mBTC, you also received 0.2 mBTC. At this point, you want to close the channel. Your settled amount will be 1-0.5+0.2 = 0.7 mBTC.

Sometimes I buy stuff from you, and sometimes you buy stuff from me. We get fed up of sending money back and forth between our bank accounts (i.e. standard bitcoin transactions), as it is time consuming and the bank charges us a fee every time. So, next time I come to see you to drop off some goods, we get out a jar and both put $100 in it. (Think of this as opening a Lightning channel.) I drop off the goods, and we agree you owe me $20, so we both record that when we open the jar, I get $120 and you get $80. The next day, I need to buy some stuff from you which costs $50, so now we agree that when we open the jar, the split will be $70 to me and $130 to you. This can go on and on for weeks, months, even years, with us both agreeing a new way to split the money, but without actually opening the jar. Changing the balance like this is instant and free. The banks (i.e. the bitcoin network) have no idea this is happening - all they know is that we both took out $100 to put in the jar in the first place. They don't know how we are agreeing to split that money, or how that split is changing.Next week, I need to buy $20 of stuff from another business down the road. I don't have a jar with them, but you do. So we deduct $20 from my balance in the jar between me and you, and then you give $20 to this other business in the jar that you have with them. You essentially route my $20 to this other business without me having to set up a jar with them, all instantly and for free.At some point we decide to open our jar (i.e. we close our Lightning channel). At that point we both take out whatever amount of money our final agreement was and deposit it back to our bank account. Only then do we need to make a transaction with a bank (a transaction on the bitcoin network), and only then does the bank/bitcoin network become aware of the final split of funds.",

I think there is no better way to understand LN then reading this short but informative explanation.There is question I wanna ask. Since the opening and closing of channels are the only thing going over bitcoin blockchain. Who is responsible for the integrity of intermediate transactions that are going on once channel is open and before its closed? LN do it on its own or in consultation with bitcoin blockchain since the final transactions will be going to Bitcoin blockchain once channel is closed.",

To get a little bit more complicated (the jar analogy doesn't really hold up beyond this point):Let's say you and I open a channel with 1 BTC each, for a total of 2 BTC. We both (or rather, our software does this automatically) sign a transaction which sends 1 BTC to you and 1 BTC to me. This would be our closing transaction, if we broadcast it. But we don't, we just save it locally, so no one knows about it except us. Then I pay you 0.2 BTC, so now we both sign a transaction which sends 1.2 BTC to you and 0.8 BTC to me. Again, we save this locally but do not broadcast it. Every time we make a new payment between us, we both sign a new transaction to reflect the new distribution of coins. When we want to close the channel, we simply broadcast the most recent transaction we have saved.And so it is each participant in a channel who is responsible for the intermediate transactions, while the wider network only ever knows about the opening and the closing transactions.There are additional complex systems built on top of that in order to encourage honesty and punish any attempted theft. For example, if the latest transaction we had signed was 1.6 BTC to me and 0.4 BTC to you, but you tried to broadcast an old transaction which splits the funds 1 BTC each, there is a mechanism to allow me to dispute that and claim all the funds for myself, meaning you lose everything as punishment for the attempted theft.",
