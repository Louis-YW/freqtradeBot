      "body": "Firstly, it doesn't matter because any Bitcoin you acquire should be ok. It is the exchanges' duty to block or freeze funds from illicit transactions before you can actually acquire and withdraw them. Secondly, a lot of the coins come from fractional reserve, meaning they only exist in the books of the exchanges. Since not everybody at once is going to withdraw, you'll get some of the \"real\" ones when you withdraw from an exchange into your wallet. Thirdly, if you are concerned that your Bitcoin has ever been used for illegal things, are you also concerned that your fiat money has ever been used for illegal things? It most likely has. Now what?",

Is it important ?OP, the bitcoins you see on exchanges come from various sources such as retail traders and others send in BTC to exchanges, and it is the responsibility of exchanges to detect which bitcoin is dirty or not. On your own, you can't figure it out, and you have not committed any crime by buying such bitcoins; that's because you are not aware. I believe you are advised not to store your bitcoin in CEXs? After purchasing your bitcoin, move it to a self-custodial wallet to which you have sole access. One of the consequences you will face if an exchange discovers a dirty or fraudulent Bitcoin transaction, or any other coin transaction, is that they will have to freeze withdrawals from their exchange, and if you were so unlucky as to keep your coins in that exchange, you might not be able to withdraw them until their investigation is complete. After moving your bitcoin to your private wallet, if you want to attain more privacy, you can use any of the Bitcoin mixers to mix your bitcoin.",

When Bitcoin is deposited into a centralized system, I guess the system checks if the address has been flagged for scams before or not. If they pass those processes and it's successfully deposited into the exchange account and an order is being created, then those coins have been mixed with other coins.That's to say you can't buy an illegal coin from an exchange, even if they are illegal. If something were to come up in the future, the exchange and its authority would be held responsible for it.",

There were some analytics done on this by companies like Coin Metrics and all that you've listed is correct. Some of the coins will come from crime, just like when you get cash from an ATM, some of it will have traces of drugs on it. Bitcoin is like digital cash, a small percentage of it will come from illegal proceedings. I borrowed the picture from here.QuoteHow can I know if the bitcoin I buy on the exchange is \"legit\" or \"dirty\" ? Is it important ?The largest suppliers of fresh bitcoins are of course miners, but some come from old addresses. There are auctions where you can pay premium for clean bitcoin that has never been transacted before. It really doesn't matter if you buy bitcoin on exchange or straight from a miner. Governments sell bitcoin that is seized from drug marketplaces, so it would be ridiculous for them to go after the people they sold to.",

Is it important ?You have asked a very nice question. The bitcoins on those exchanges mostly come from miners and some of those coins come from traders. Many of the miners sell their bitcoin in bulk, and for them the best place is an exchange. Their mined bitcoin get sold very soon on those exchanges, drug dealers or criminals will never use those exchanges to deposit their coins. They won't use the exchanges mainly because most of those exchanges, and almost every centralized exchange cooperate with governmental bodies. They will stop the withdrawals of those bitcoins and share the details with the governmental authorities. Those drug dealers will most likely use tor and they might use other services to exchange their bitcoin into something else. I assure you that any bitcoin you buy through a reputed exchange like Binance is completely legit and no one will ever take legal action against you. The coins that you buy from those exchanges come from legit and legal sources so chance of them being dirty is 0.00001%, that's why you can buy without any worries.",

It is difficult to determine what transaction a UTXO has been involved in since it was mined, you can only try to use blockchain data and run that over different searches to know if it turns up for any illegal activity.It could be important further years down the line. Today there are only restrictions by exchanges for mixed coins.- Jay -",

First of all, while there have been some instances of bitcoin being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering or drug trafficking, this is no different from any other currency. The reality is that the vast majority of criminal activities still use cash, not bitcoin. Second, the vast majority of CEXs have strict regulatory requirements that they must follow to prevent illegal activities. This includes performing KYC checks on their customers and monitoring transactions for suspicious activity. If a CEX is found guilty of money laundering, they can be fined and shut down by the financial authorities. In fact, the requirements for CEXs to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities are often stricter than those of many banks.",
