Can Anderlecht make the expected comeback? Or will we see a new champion? Here is our new Belgian League topic.*self-moderated thread to delete obvious spam.",

Club Brugge put up a tight defense after taking the lead. We saw Cyle Larin, who later entered the game, on the field for the first time with his new team.With this result, Club Brugge won the Super Cup for the third time in a row and took the cup for the 17th time in total. They are the team with the most Super Cup trophies.",

Union Saint-Gilloise was content with one away point. In yesterday's match, Standard Liege and Gent drew.Tomorrow, Club Brugge and Genk will play each other. Anderlecht also has a match. In the first weeks, the probability of loss is high. That's why I avoid betting. In fact, there are good opportunities but you should use small part of your bank in early weeks.",

Eupen's away game was normally a match that should have been written 3 points, but they couldn't even save the draw. Even though Eupen had 10 players left, Club Brugge couldn't find the goal. Cyle Larin entered the game very late. They should have made the moves earlier.Genk on the other hand easily defeated Standard Liege. Things are not going well for Standard Liege this season, just like last season they will be in lower places. Cyriel Dessers made a fast start to the league for Genk. He can make a big difference this year.",

Finally i expect a match with high tempo and high goal rate.Both teams to score option would be tempting when you look at their games with other teams but it's a no-no for me after I see their matches against each other. Last seven games finished with under 2.5 goals so it's a pretty risky bet, especially for that 1.49 odds which is very low. Considering their current form I wouldn't pick a side bet either. It's best to just stay away from this match or watch and make a live bet according to the game.Royal Antwerp started marvelous and didn't make any mistake in first six games. I wonder how long their winning streak can go. They may be a real contender if they keep on winning but when Club Brugge and Anderlecht get a good form they may feel more pressure. It's too early to talk about their chances honestly.",

The probability of a goal scoring match is high. I think both teams will score against each other.In four matches Anderlecht has lost three and drew one. It's not an encouraging result for a team that is playing in the Europa Conference League. The team lost some players in the transfer window such as the outstanding defender Sergio Gómez to Manchester City. They also lost Josh Cullen to Burnley and Elias Cobbaut to Parma. But also got a whole lot of good signings such as the 20year old Moussa N'Diaye from Barça Atlètic, Ishaq Abdulrazak from Norrköping and Adrien Trébel from Lausanne-Sport. This team is going through a lot of restructuring and rebuilding. They have a good and young team that has the ability to compete for the Belgian league top position. Westerlo has not also been a better side in recent times having lost three of their four matches and winning one. In their last match against Antwerp they conceded three goals. I agree there might be a goal of rain in this match. Both teams would want to win back the confidence of their management and fans.",

Anderlecht have been performing far from their old days this season, but their play in the last games has shown signs of improvement. In their last match, they performed well against Genk in the Belgian Cup. I had the opportunity to watch a part of that match. They are in a really bad situation in the league this season, but these matches can turn into an opportunity for them. Otherwise they will fall towards the bottom of the league. Sporting Charleroi lost 4-1 to Genk in their last league game and they are close to Anderlecht in the league. I predict Anderlecht will win this match. They cannot continue to play bad football forever. Their positive appearances in the last matches could be a harbinger of series wins.",

But it seems they have learned from their mistakes and are not taking any chances this season. From the last six matches, they have lost only two points because they won all of them and drew only the match against Bruggs. If they continue this way, they might still make a difference. But I still doubt that they would be able to catch up with Genk because of the eight points gap and the quality of the Genk team. But ending the season in the second position would still be a big achievement because they might have the opportunity of playing in the champions league this time if they put in more effort. But last season's opportunity to win the league that was lost was the club's best chance.",
