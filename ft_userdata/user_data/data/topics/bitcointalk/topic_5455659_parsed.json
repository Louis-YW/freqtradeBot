But if you are worried about your security, try to exchange amounts where you don't have to show an ID or fill in paperwork that leave a trail that could be used against you. Shops like that usually have a threshold where no KYC is required. If you want to exchange more, you can always go in twice, use several different shops in town, or have a friend help you out and exchange a bit in your name.",

For now, the deposit process and WD are still safe, although there is a bit of anxiety, too, seeing the recent news about Binence being sued by the SEC, whether it will affect the platform I use. Yes. that's all possible from me.",

I don't support the use of physical exchange or black market shops this has more negative effect of the coin holder as the risk of getting attacked is high since most people will know when you make use of such exchange and even the police as mentioned can keep an eye on your activities once their picked your presence is such exchange shops. And there is no way to compare online exchange to physical exchange even though with the high risk of scams associated with online coin exchange or can't be compared to what you face when you decide to do a face-to-face exchange, in fact, the physical exchange is not an option to me.",

Never heard of any problems too. I think the chances of encountering with a problem in a reputable crypto dealer is pretty slim. I think your example is a bad one because that security guard clearly made a mistake and people make mistakes. They probably fired that dude too. Just because that one bad incident happened, it doesn't mean these dealers are crap. People do have problems with all kinds of online crypto exchanges everyday (sometimes they even get hacked!) and yet, millions of people still use them.",

She was harassed by security officers pretending to be police (which I guess is illegal?)for making her transactions public?Physical exchanges.. you mean ATMs, real exchange offices or people who do face to face meets for exchanging? ATMs are pretty safe, unless you’re there with a bag of cash on you and you catch the wrong guy’s attention. Physical exchanges (offices) should be pretty safe unless there’s KYC involved in my opinion. Face to face meetups.. it’s more like gambling. Like try your luck and see how that goes.Face to face meetings are sometimes risky even for less important exchanges like selling a phone on Craigslist. But when it comes to crypto, a bad actor knows what’s up and they know if you do this physically, it means you probably have enough money to care about your privacy and to stay covert. So if you arrange a meetup with a bad actor, they’ll assume you have much, much more in your wallet than what you actually own.Anyway, sometimes even face to face meetings can be set up safely. Some countries’ police departments have rooms specifically for safe transactions and negotiations. So nothing can go wrong, you’re in probably one of the safest places you can be for negotiations. But this involves a con: you don’t have privacy anymore and I’m not sure whether the cops will have to question you beforehand and have a physical proof that you went there to exchange money. So if you’re trying to meet up face to face for privacy, it’s a bad idea to enter a police department lolz",

If it is an exchange of crypto to local currency then why not use p2p first on cex. And I personally avoid p2p using a bank account. but it can be tricked by using a digital fiat wallet application. but that only applies to depositing a small amount of money for the application that I use can only be a maximum of under $ 2500USD in a month.I am quite lucky because in my country everything is quite safe and under control. physical exchanges and such are not given much attention by the government. and here bitcoin has become legal as a commodity asset. so that the sale of these assets is also legal anywhere. as long as it is not used as a means of payment to replace local money.",

I have come across a case where a young guy was publicly molested, but he got justice by doing the right thing.Those dealers who are publicly advertising themselves are safe from such harassment because they have not done anything wrong; they can't be charged in any criminal or fraud case unless they have solid evidence; you can't just walk up to someone's office or shop and harass the person over nothing. Nigeria is not a complete crypto-ban country; you and I know that. What they just did was serve out a memo and send out a direct warning to the banks not to associate themselves with any direct crypto transaction since it's not legal tender in the country. However you want to do it, as a citizen, to some extent you are free. We have lots of publicly-operated crypto exchange firms in the country, and they are all paying taxes to the government.
