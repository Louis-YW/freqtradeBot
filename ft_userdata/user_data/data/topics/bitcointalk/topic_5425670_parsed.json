I didn't understand the permutations or computational algorithm of the numbers and so I stay away. I know people that play it and if they happen to win the cash out is very high but most times they lose. The stake for the game is very high and bettors tend to like it because of the potential when they are lucky to win. I think they play it 3/4 times daily and results for all the time are released one after the other. They have different names for the daily games. The results look like the picture @ Daltonik posted.",
