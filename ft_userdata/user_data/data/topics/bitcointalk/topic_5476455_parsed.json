  "content": "Hello Guys,I have been searching for days on the internet but haven't found anything useful. Could anyone please explain to me how I can migrate Dexioprotocol V1 to V2? I have never migrated a coin before, and I think that it is a different procedure for every coin. Would anyone be so kind to explain to me how it works?",
