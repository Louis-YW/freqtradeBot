Seriously now, this is simply another step along the lines of wanting to control the cryptocurrency market (including Bitcoin, obviously) in the same way that the banking sector or the stock market is controlled. We already saw a preview of what is intended, which is KYC for all transactions without a minimum exempt among other things, the preliminary draft of which has already been approved:Goodbye, privacy, goodbye, it was nice while it lasted.",

Many people will raise concern over private and similar stuffs but bitcoin's buggest enemy is its own reputation and its unwanted involvement with criminal proceeds. If the upcoming legislation can provide a framework related to crypto businesses, that will definitely help to reduce illegal use of cryptos.I foresee that slowly many other countries will start having their own legal framework around cryptocurrencies and their transactions. May be EU will lead the way here!",

In fact, it is an upgrade of AML 4&5, but which, as far as I understand, in the new AML6 wants to standardize exactly what information member states must share in the future.As an example, Malta is cited in relation to Binance, which for years has used its apparently highly adapted systems to take advantage of the benefits provided by the EU, but at the same time, Malta has shared very little data with EU regulatory bodies regarding their operations. The new rules will enable the EU regulatory body to bring such a member to the European Court of Justice.In other words (if I understood correctly), EU member states should adopt the same standards for everything related to cryptocurrencies, and not that some member states have very strict laws, while other member states do not implement even some basic regulations on the matter.",

In August 2022, the OECD approved the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) which provides for the reporting of tax information on transactions in Crypto-Assets in a standardised manner, with a view to automatically exchanging such information. The CARF defines the Relevant Crypto-Assets in scope and the intermediaries and other service providers that will be subject to reporting. In doing so, the CARF incorporates recent developments in the global anti-money laundering standards of the Financial Action Task Force. In line with the CRS, the due diligence procedures require the identification of both individual and Entity customers, as well as their Controlling Persons. The CARF requires reporting on an aggregate basis, divided by type of Crypto-Asset and type of transaction. In August 2022, the OECD has also approved amendments to the CRS to bring certain electronic money products and Central Bank Digital Currencies in scope. In light of the CARF, changes have also been made to ensure that indirect investments in Crypto-Assets through derivatives and investment vehicles are now covered by the CRS. In addition, amendments have been made to strengthen the due diligence and reporting requirements (including requiring the reporting of the role of each Controlling Person) and to foresee a carve-out for genuine non-profit organisations.\"",

It is mainly about being more vigilant with KYC and KYT. Something that the public is already used to.It is in reality particularly problematic for small and medium-sized companies that will not have the resources and financial means to be as vigilant as large companies with a system (already in place) worthy of a banking institution.In the end, it will prevent companies from being formed or from growing. For some of them, it even means slowing down or stopping R&D.An absurdity for those European countries that claim to want to be among the digital pioneers.The postponement of this law is also ironic when you think that a clause has been added to allow the digital euro to settle quietly.

Their fear of cryptocurrencies (especially stablecoins) is, in my opinion, somewhat justified considering the position in which the EU and the euro are in relation to the US and the american dollar.The whole thing rests on very fragile foundations that are often shaken by vested interests that reveal how united we really are. Therefore, the EU wants to regulate all cryptocurrencies in every possible way so that they have as little influence as possible on its financial system - and the digital euro is something that will not become a reality for years to come anyway, and according to everything we could read in the past, each individual will be able to have limited number of digital euros in your digital wallet.",
