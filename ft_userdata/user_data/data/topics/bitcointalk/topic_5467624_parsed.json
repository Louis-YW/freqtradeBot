But I just want to remind you that never forget your health and life insurance which will act as an emergency fund for your family even if it makes them a fortune for their remaining life.Honestly, it is one hell of a fear that every man holds with them so never forget about leaving what you made in your life to your family, and hopefully it's not a debt.",

It will have been really sad if they were not able access it and those coins were lost forever.Anyone who holds up to 1BTC or even up to $1000 - $5000 worth of bitcoins should create a way in which those coins will not be lost if they lose access to it through a tragic incidence. We should have at least one person with knowledge of how bitcoin works and if we fear they can steal it from us while we are still alive, then we can use a timelocked transaction or address.- Jay -",

The way things have been going lately has made me despondent. I started to believe that one day, all of us will pass away and cease to exist in our planet's surface. I've also heard tales of people dying and their families not even being able to find their deceased loved one's assets. Sharing specific information with family members is therefore not at all a bad thing. I always believe in legality if you feel you can not trust anyone then you can get a lawyer to keep proper documentation of your seed phrase has a bitcoiner rather than keeping such information to your self because when you die with it since nobody is aware of the assets it will be of no relevance to anyone. And that is if you the person  wants his or her family to benefit from investing in bitcoin there proper procedures that can be taking that will favour your family even when the person  departs.",

I have read so many threads about the issue and what I have come to understand is that using a timelock system is the best option. Of course this is useless if your beneficiary knows nothing about how bitcoin works. This is why it is important to involve your partner or children in your bitcoin activity, I understand this is kind of difficult to do since bitcoiners have a need to protect their privacy. But at some point, you will need to relinquish control to someone else.",

Its ideal that telling your family specially your spouse or wife in regarding about your holding but pretty sure that not all would really be that confident about telling it whilethey are still that alive because of some trust issues? I cant really blame those men though because even myself having those doubts too.",

You aren't off point in your opinion and it is the fact that having at least one person who you trust in this life, be it a friend, family, lawyer, doctor or anyone or even calendar and AI, is more of the education that anyone would need to be aware of such an inheritance of legacy. The next would be an interpreter or lawyer to dicipher what the information left behind means. How else are lost treasures found? I wonder!",

The best way to do this is to honestly let them hold coins themselves. Or let them set up a wallet. Experience is the best teacher, after all, just blabbering on and on about what they should do would probably not get anything anywhere. Might even be best if you let them use whatever method you use you are going to set up for when you die, albeit do it in a short term instead e.g. a week if it was using some tech, just to let them familiarize themselves.If you aren't going to do so, then I don't think there's any point in setting up a plan to let them get the coins after your death. They'd probably have no idea how to do so in the first place, or even get scammed trying to get help in accessing it.",

The common steps are teaching them basics about Bitcoin, recover, back up, make an on chain transaction.

The service is called Mixin Safe, in which I and others have reviewed before on Bitcointalk. There is also a more manual way of handling as suggested in the first reply on this thread. In any way, it is necessary to plan and give out all the detailed information to the owner's beneficiaries as suggested by the referenced tweet.",
