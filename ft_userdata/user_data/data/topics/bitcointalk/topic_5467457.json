  "content": "]Just looking to the future. Anonymize your payments and savings!With the advent of cryptocurrencies, everyone dreamed of decentralization and anonymity, as Nakamoto bequeathed. But in recent years, anonymous currencies have been losing their positions on leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and the volumes of decentralized exchanges have been seriously falling since their appearance.
