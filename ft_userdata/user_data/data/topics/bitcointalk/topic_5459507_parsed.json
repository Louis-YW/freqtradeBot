If you are using this feature you have overspend on transaction fee than you should.My brother was a victim and I discover that the charges are too high, compare to me buying Bitcoin on Binance exchange and withdraw it back into my wallet, the wallet charges 4$ for a transaction where as on Binance it's not up to 1.5$ Not much? Do this transactions for few times in a month, it's still something, before you know it, 50$ worth of transaction fee will be 100$ fee using exchanges within wallets.Go on popular exchnages yourself and buy your Bitcoin and withdraw back into your wallet, a little drop of water makes a mighty ocean, stop getting those crypto wallet companies rich. They are Banks in disguise.",

It it is better to buy on an exchange, buying directly from someone selling on an exchange with good exchange rate. Because buying like that directly on your noncustodial wallet, you still have no privacy just like on centralized exchanges.Quote from: FirmWars on July 12, 2023, 08:17:47 AMMy brother was a victim and I discover that the charges are too high, compare to me buying Bitcoin on Binance exchange and withdraw it back into my wallet, the wallet charges 4$ for a transaction where as on Binance it's not up to 1.5$If you check the exchange rate if you want to buy directly on your noncustodial wallet, it is not favorable. If you use an exchange, withdrawal fee to send altcoins can be cheaper. But the withdrawal fee for bitcoin is high and you can decide to buy directly on your wallet if not charged more than $4. But the more amount you want to buy directly on your wallet, the higher the fee because of the unfavorable exchange rate.",

OP might be using other address but even a legacy address on binance is 0.0001BTC which is around $3.

More so saving is done on something that has value or is a store of value and if an asset or coin isnâ€™t an hedge against inflation then it is not a store of value. With usdt claims that it is pegged with dollar then it would certainly be affect with inflation. Also the centralization of it is another thing that makes bitcoin a better investment than it. But it can be used for a quick transaction when there is mostly congestion in the mempool and bitcoin transaction fee is high",

Unfortunately people love to pay for convenience instead of caring about being cost efficient or savvy. Until that changes, these apps will always be in business. To be fair on the apps, mostly these charges are due to the risks and costs involved with credit card processing. The fees involved are different for every business.If you want to be superior in privacy and justify the cost in doing so, use a platform like AgoraDesk or HodlHodl, where you can at least get privacy for your money and the profit goes to people, instead of institutions like Binance.

You want to know something funny about this post? TrustWallet is owned and operated by Binance. You are telling people to go away from TrustWallet (Binance) because they are banks in disguise....and yet you are redirecting them to the same company.",

You should do some research on the wallet, especially what services they collaborate with to process payments. Wallets that integrate 2p2 exchanges usually work with a centralized service that charges a flat rate or a percentage for fiat, not network based. Also service fees are sometimes not stated explicitly, but accumulate in what they call \"transaction\" fees.Btw, what wallet are you talking about?",

They are Banks in disguise. Going to exchanges like Binance may be advantageous due to low transaction fees, yet the most important thing to think about is your privacy.Before Binance will permit you to purchase Bitcoin and send it out from the exchange, you must complete KYC verification, which entails providing details about your identity. Simply said, this means that even though they claimed the data was secure, they can manipulate it. You should never trust anyone with your personal information since anyone may use it to blackmail you in exchange for money.",

      "body": "These wallets use a third party to perform exchange between cryptocurrencies, and therefore you pay two commissions, one of which is related to the third party, and the other is the real transfer fee, and it differs according to the cryptocurrency pair and the source of those coins from CEXs or DEXs, and therefore comparing it with one CEXs seems unfair.I am against integrating central exchange interfaces into wallets, but it is a good alternative for beginners with zero knowledge, and not for traders. But if you are a trader, you will definitely have ways to withdraw bitcoins with the lowest possible fees.Sometimes withdrawals to the wallet are considered additional risks and additional costs like the need to track the news of the developer team to know the accelerating variables (hard-fork/burn/change smart contract add) to those that developers can freeze inside your coins inside your wallet.",

Also, the withdrawal fee will vary from site to site and wallet to wallet and there is no standard here. Some may charge you extra while others may have nominal charges.Bitocin ATM and shopping sites using Bitcoin also charge higher rates and I guess they do it because they think that the customers won't notice the difference of 5 to 10$.Also, I noted that buying the bitcoin from inside the wallets is more expensive as compared to buying it on exchanges.",
