You are basically announcing your website in the community. Service Announcements will be a better board to get traffic for you.If you are an official of the exchange then I will recommend to buy a copper membership and update the post with better graphical interface. It attracts visitors and you get their attention. Welcome to the forum and good luck.",

I expect few user would have question about logged data or what happen if they send too little/much coin. 3. I also tried visit your .onion url, but i find it's rather slow. It took about 30 seconds before the page is fully loaded. But it might be due slow circuit on my end.",

To make matters worse, ChangeNow will require KYC at certain times according to their terms of use. Given that they claim that no KYC is needed, one really wonders what would happen if changeNow blocked some funds and requested for KYC?Typical scam.",
