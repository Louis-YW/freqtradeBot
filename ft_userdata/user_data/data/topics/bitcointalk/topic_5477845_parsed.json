  "content": "This is a shocking news of a young Nigeria who killed himself because he loss 2.5m to bet. This is not the first time I have heard such news and I don't know why someone with soft heard would involved himself in gambling and when loss out from the game they would killed themselves. I bring this information to warn those gamblers that have soft mind and when they loss even small amount they do like the world has come to an end. The loss would pain them very well and if such persons loss big amounts of money to gambling then what happened to this young man is not far from him. One thing you have to know in gambling is it is 50/50. Either you win or loss. So always prepare your mind on that. Because if you put all your hope to the game that you will win and finally you loss then you will be thinking the otherwise. And if you don't have liver (mind) then don't gamble.After losing the game the guy informed his friends that he wants to leave the world and meet his heavenly father and that day was his last day on earth. And finally he killed himself. https://www.instagram.com/p/C0yMgJItyy1/?igshid=OGY3MTU3OGY1Mw== Have a thick skin when gambling.",
