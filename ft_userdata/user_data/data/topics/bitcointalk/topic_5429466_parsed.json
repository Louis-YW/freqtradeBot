I remember reading an article in the past that there are some platforms that allow you to bet on yourself and play against someone(who bet on themselves) on an online game(whatever game you are playing) and the winner takes the pot. I forgot what platform it was. anyway, I don't know if we'll see this in a casino because I feel like they'll need to create a whole different platform just for this type of gambling. also, I am pretty sure there will be concerns regarding cheating.",

I do not see why there would not be individual betting as there is collective betting on teams and very large prices to be honest. However, I do not see this being integrated in betting platforms, but rather a separated bit.",

There have been a lot of discussions around PVP/skill-based gambling but I have not seen it materialized yet and I don't think it will ever be! At least not in the near future! But there were some telegram groups who arranges such kinds of gambling events where they used to pay out using bitcoin. I don't know if they exist now. Hopefully, someone will be able to point out some such groups who still arrange similar kinds of events. But I have not seen such things in any of the well knows crypto casinos till date!",

It's a nice idea, but you just need to understand the difference between the two concept of which you are trying to compare, i.e MMA (world wide recognize fighting game with an international dashboard to enable users predict who could win a fight) and mortar kombat (an independent virtual p2p fighting game that has no record). But unless you mean in a situation whereby the Mortal Kombat game is programmed just like we have a virtual football game on most sportbookers that plays repeatedly every 60 seconds, programmed to always be in favour of the casinos.Example..",

This seems more like something that would be done on a blockchain with smart contracts than Bitcoin though. I could see a metaverse or NFT collection implementing a game like this without too much imagination. I’m sure someday this sort of thing will be common on Xbox and PlayStation. It’s too obviously something people want.",

So this do talks about PvP which it would really be that interesting specially into those fellas who had been born on 90's and have that experience with this type of game and also at the same time if you do seethis on which you could possibly be able to make bets towards against player then it would really be that interesting but we know that it cant really be that easily integrated or something that gets really trust and interest considering that you cant really remove into your mind that what if you are fighting with a bot? There's no way that you would be able to determine that you arefighting with a real player on the other side which it is really that something that creates doubts.No one will really be that too confident but well there are ones who  do really get interestedon fighting even if its a bot as long they do entertained themselves.",

Perhaps people only want to game and not add any money to it because they know they suck at it  but it's a pretty great idea if you ask me. I've been playing those kinds of video games for decades, and in my childhood days we used to go to other cities just trying to find people whom can we make a bet on with these games. Most of the time we win, but a lot of times we're just chasing the thrill of it. Kinda forgot the name of the site but they even had tokens that you can exchange to crypto once you've accumulated enough of it in your PvP journey.",

Esports betting and peer to peer betting are the best options for online games I think. But in esports betting, games are limited to those which has huge community of players and those are usually games being played in PC. There are tournaments for mortal combat, tekken, and such but betting I guess more often occur between players themselves and not the typical esports betting procedures. But that would be a good idea for sure. I did play mortal combat before because I am into fighting games. But unfortunately, it does not have a huge fan base for tournaments. Only for those who are avid fans of it. But this is simply possible. You just need to find an organizer who is also into this game to create such event.",
