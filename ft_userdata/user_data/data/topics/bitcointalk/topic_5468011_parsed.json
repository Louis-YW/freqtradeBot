  "content": "Hey!I thought I'd open a thread about a project I'm really interested.. Its unique Web3 gaming platform wich will build in BASE. True decentralization with DAO. The Aviator project also includes former Shiba team members.If you want to know more, I will be happy to discuss this and share information   I thought I'd also share the latest news about this project here.  But yeah.. why im interested just this project? Because I already know most of the team from other projects and they are 100% on the true decentralization side. Avi is now in the building phase. Games have always interested me and now that games also entered the crypto world, the possibilities are limitless, it has already been seen... I can't wait for the Aviator Arcade game platform to be ready. @aviator_ac X www.aviator.ac https://t.me/aviator_ac official Telegram channel",
