I will give you an example here https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0xa6cc3c2531fdaa6ae1a3ca84c2855806728693e8That address was related to the pools for eth/link and once you are scrolling down, you will able to see these tabsAdds meant liquidity that being added to the pools by the contract owner or liq provider. Uniswap's chart site is also supporting so many blockchain like BSC, Arbitrum even Optimism.It's very easy for you to track liquidity that being added or removed from pools by liq provider.",
