On other part who are salaried but got work from home jobs may face such scenarios like you mentioned because they know you are not that rich then they assume how do you manage to survive without doing any works. Nothing to worry about as long as you are making money which doesn't violates any of your laws in the country where you're living.",

I could afford a twice bigger one but I don;'t need the extra space. I'm not going to hire a cleaning lady for it. Many women face this when they are jobless because they take care of the house, but other women see them as lazy or without ambition. In reality the woman who takes care of the house and the kids does that because she can afford staying home, while those who talk behind her back have to work every day and barely have time to talk to their children.",

In BTT, we are always advised not to resign from our paying jobs to focus solely on Bitcoin investment or campaign earnings because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are not like Ponzi scheme which people see as a quick money giving thing rather cryptocurrency investment(Bitcoin) can make one a millionaire depending on the current market situation (Bear and Bull run ) and the kind of investment you are into so sticking to your paying job and doing your crypto investment is the best idea because through your job you can gather funds to increase your crypto investment and hope for a better return.",

Bitcoin profit making give a massive profit that changes standard of living in quick term but the young guys are too careless to manage their emotions. They buy luxury cars, spend in the club and some even buy guns and pay for security. In the third world countries with weak currency, the dollar conversion make those profit so massive. I think the young guys dont need to use their gadget outside for everyone to see, live on lowkey without excesses, get streams of businesses from the profit in cryptocurrency and get married if possible with responsible lifestyle.
