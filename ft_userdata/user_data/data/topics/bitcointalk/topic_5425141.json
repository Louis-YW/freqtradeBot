  "content": "Do you know what's the hardest part about selling or buying online from another person? Trusting the other party. Can they really deliver what they claim to do? Or, is there a guarantee that you will get paid after you deliver the order?What if there was an escrow service that isn't centralized, where you would have full control over your funds? We started digging deeper and figured out that blockchain can actually provide such features.Guess what? After 1.5 years of research and development, we finally made it. Now, we have a tool using which you don't need to trust the person you're selling or buying from to have safe and secure deals.  And we want to share it with you all. Z​enland - Escrow Smart Contract Platform How it works?Full image: https://talkimg.com/image/d3xfdStep 1. Both seller and buyer log in using Metamask.Step 2. One of the parties (doesn't matter who) fills in the form they see after logging in and creates a contract.Step 3. The second party receives a notification about the new contract and approves it (or adjusts if he doesn't agree with its terms).Step 4. Buyer deploys the contract into the blockchain and transfers the funds into it.Step 5. Seller finishes the order and sends it to the buyer.Step 6. Buyer checks the order and releases the funds if everything is alright.Here you can find a demo video.How much it costs?We charge a fee per contract deployed. The fee depends on the contract amount. The bigger the sum, the smaller fee we charge. $0 - $10K: 1.75%$10K - 100K: 1.5% + $25$100K - $1M: 0.75% + $770$1M - $10M: 0.5% + $3250 $10M - $100M: 0.25% + $28275>$100M: 0.1% + $178275What if something goes wrong and the buyer doesn't want to release the funds after the seller has done the job?We have a two-stage dispute resolution mechanism. In the first stage, the parties are given time to discuss (revisions, replacements, etc.) and resolve the issue by themselves. If they are not able to come to a consensus, they can escalate the dispute to the second stage where an agent is invited into the case who will neutrally investigate and decide who will receive the funds (sent to either one party or split between two parties). The role of the agent is taken by Zenland team until we’re ready to launch Zenland DAO. When DAO is formed, agents are picked by the community.Agent fee. Agents are paid a small fee for resolving the case and the fee is deducted from the contract amount. FAQs1. Can I use any currency to create a contract?As long as our app is decentralized, you can use only crypto to pay or receive funds using Zenland. Currently, you can only use USDT, USDC, BUSD, or DAI. 2. What blockchains I can deploy a contract to?At the moment, you can deploy a contract to 5 major blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, and Polygon.3. Is Zenland audited and is the smart contract source code publicly available for anyone who wants to audit?Yes, we have already passed an audit and you can find the source code on Github. Also, here is a link to the Beta tests we held on Bitcointalk. Every new user gets $1 to their Zenland balance to cover the platform fee upon registration. If you will have any questions, please reach out to us via PM or one of the links below.",

But I am confused about how many people will be interested to use your service. Because the service fee you have mentioned is too high while decentralized exchanges take too lower fee than you.",

      "body": "Hi. Thank you for your message.We created Zenland primarily for trading digital products and services even though it can be technically used for any value exchange. A simple example of this can be website flipping. If you were to sell a website, in 90% of cases, you'd want to use escrow. What does the current market have to offer for this particular case?1. If you were to sell it directly to an individual, then you would use Escrow.com or Epik.com's escrow service. Epik.com's escrow fee ranges from 1.5% to 5%, while Escrow.com can charge as low as 0.89% and as much as 3.25% if you don't use their Concierge service which doubles the fee. 2. Or, if you were to list it on a marketplace, you'd use Flippa, Empire Flippers, Motioninvest, Investors Club, or a similar platform. Selling through any of these options would cost you at least 4 times more than through Zenland.These numbers show that in terms of service fees, we can compete with any competition we currently have. Other than the fees, no competitor can even come close to Zenland's awesomeness in terms of privacy, transparency, or decentralization.",
