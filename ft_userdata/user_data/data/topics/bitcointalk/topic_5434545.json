  "content": "Just wondering why someone would send 4BTC to the Genesis block which is over $75K.Here is the transactionhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/6805b175260c47549995c3ff19c3c51596651c26269e9f1b31c243986433a0b7I understand many want to send a small amount so they can get a piece of history on the block chain but sending over $75K which is pretty much a burn address since most likely it will never get spent is kind of crazy. Why do you think they did this?",

Even while I'm unable to think of why something like that was done I'm sure that the whoever did that must have a very good reason why such action was carried out. Perhaps it was just to burn it so that the amount of Bitcoin in circulation will be affected which in turn might affect the price of Bitcoin or maybe just to show appreciation to Satoshi since the it was sent to the satoshi's address.

I totally doubt this was a mistake.This exactly. There's so many former bitcointalk forum users who hoarded a ton of bitcoin in the early days when it cost next to nothing, or was essentially free minus some basic computing power.  That four bitcoins sent to whomever it was, is likely a drop in the bucket for them.  They wanted to do something kind of cool as well as decrease the pool of available bitcoin which makes all other bitcoin more valuable.",
