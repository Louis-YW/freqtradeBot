  "content": "Hello all,Just making a quick topic to let you all know that my Stoog Bootleg Toys - BART SATOSHI - \"Bart has gone all in\" has been listed on Scarce.City.QuoteThis is your chance to own a unique piece of art, made by the elusive artist Stoog Bootleg Toys. There are less than 50 of these in existence, as Stoog made them until the mold quality deteriorated.These are almost impossible to find, as the creator has dropped from the face of the earth and they barely ever come up for auction.Don't miss out on this opportunity to own a piece of history and secure your own piece of Stoog's legacy before it's gone forever!Feel free to check it out: https://scarce.city/auctions/stoog-bootleg-bart-satoshi",
