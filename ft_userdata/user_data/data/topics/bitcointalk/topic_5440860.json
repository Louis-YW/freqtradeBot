According to his last thread, he is trying to sell fake coins stuck in scam website. Best to avoid any form of communication with him.Quote from: condoras on October 23, 2021, 08:47:50 AMQuote from: RapTarX on October 22, 2021, 06:44:51 PMQuote from: ArcusIsidar on October 22, 2021, 06:40:32 PMThe guy offers coins stuck in scam website.Or the website is own by OP and trying to trick people to scam LOL. This is very possible & with such scam trick, I have seen few cases where scammer himself pretend to be the victim.Be aware, anyone. Don't fall into his scam trick.This is a \"typical\" strategy for scamming more when the victim wants to withdraw his hypothetical earnings/profits from the scam site.In this case, I don't know if the OP is a victim or the admin of this crap but for sure don't care to pass his loss to others and get paid. Anyway, now nobody will fall into his hole.",
