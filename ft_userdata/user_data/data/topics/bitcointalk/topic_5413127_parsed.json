Basically miners compete to be the first to solve the complex puzzles, however the algo increases the difficulty not in electricity consumption.Only way that electrcitiy consumption is increased is if someone buys more miners or ASICs or GPUs. But the algo still stays the same. What the main goal of the article should of been is just to state that it consumes lots of power during an electricity shortage.",

What the main goal of the article should of been is just to state that it consumes lots of power during an electricity shortage.Well since 50%+ of miners could go offline right now and things would be ok, the network performing the same - they could try to instead limit the amount of power per person for mining - but that just seems like a lessor of the two evils to me.QuoteSabrina Toppa is an award-winning journalist focusing on cryptocurrency, blockchain, DeFi, NFTs, and Web3.

This is the first time when there is an actual electricity shortage and energy shortage and I am not surprised if more laws like this won’t get passed.You need to understand that if Bitcoin mining is going to lead to blackouts then obviously it’ll be outlawed, especially during peak times. Maybe allowing mining during nighttime should be allowed if laws like this pass.",

Maybe allowing mining during nighttime should be allowed if laws like this pass.But we don't even need all the Bitcoin miners that are running right now to be online anyways for Bitcoin to function at the same speed it is now, so seems like if laws do have to exist it would just limit amount of power each miner is allowed etc.Still a shitty solution.They could force a POS version of Bitcoin if the laws got too insane, but that would be another split.",
