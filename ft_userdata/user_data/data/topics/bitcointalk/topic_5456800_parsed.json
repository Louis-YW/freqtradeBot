  "content": "Guys, my Ledger Live desktop app for Windows has been stuck in some kind of nightmarish loop. This happened after I logged in and clicked on the \"update to new version\" message at the top of my page. Now I can no longer access my Ledger Live functions, and every time I try to open it, I get this error page:https://imgbb.com/ykLCNN2When I select the \"click here for possible solutions\" purple button, it takes me to this page:https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012598060?utm_source=ledger_live_desktop&utm_medium=self_referral&utm_content=error&support=trueI've tried every solution they recommended to no avail. I even went a step further and totally uninstalled and reinstalled Ledger Live, and restarted my computer, but I keep getting the same error page no matter what. I'm totally stuck. I'm not sure what went wrong, but I might have mistakenly clicked on the link to update one of my shitcoins (Stratis), which is no longer supported by Ledger, and this caused my app to glitch. The problem is that I can't seem to solve this issue.Any suggestions?",

You are a lifesaver. I only wish that Ledger's advice was as valuable as yours.

Good to know there are alternate ways of accessing my Bitcoin, in case my Ledger happens to crap out on me, or is no longer functional for whatever reason.",

The only problem starts when we don’t turn them on for very long period of time and forget to upgrade the firmware and software. In my case the only issue was firmware update and I realised that when ledger wasn’t working very well. Not real glitches or something but it used to stuck with misplaced info about balances.

In my case the only issue was firmware update and I realised that when ledger wasn’t working very well. Not real glitches or something but it used to stuck with misplaced info about balances. It was well known Issue so it was resolved immediately after I updated the firmware. That's precisely what I did. I actually printed out the page with the steps to take and saved it for future reference. I should note that I didn't actually follow BitMaxz's advice exactly, since my desktop doesn't have the same options he described, but I followed most of it. What I did differently was, instead of going to different files and deleting them separately, I just searched my PC for files with the key words \"Ledger Live\", and deleted them. Worked like a charm.",

The problem is that I can't seem to solve this issue. It's worth mentioning that updating the individual crypto apps is completely different from updating Ledger Live to the latest version. To update Ledger Live, you only need to click on the update button you see at the top of the app once you run it. To update the apps, you have to open the Ledger Manager (I think they now call it My Ledger) and physically confirm that action with button presses on the hardware wallet. After that, you need to manually click on the app/apps you want to update on the list you see on your screen. So it takes several steps to make that mistake.Now after the situation has been solved, can you remember exactly what you did to cause the crash? Ledger Live update? Update of the Stratis app which isn't supported?Something else?",
