As it is now, it's not bad but there are room to improve.And clicking on any news opens up a new tab which for me is a bit annoying. You can put a preview of the news and then add a button in the end of it maybe saying Read more or View full storylike this  Read moreHope this help.",

What is it, are you one of the creators of this website or are you part of the team that created it?But even so, if I look at this site platform that you provided, it is like a type of crypto news platform, with other features that are also shown to the community here on the forum. But I think it still needs a little repair and improvement to be perfect.",

Here is a website I've been working on that shows crypto news, crypto graphs, and even a bitcoin explorer with live global transactions. The graphs are still elementary, but looking for feedback/  thoughts from people who like to follow crypto! Thanks https://d2index.com/Just from the first look it seems like an interesting site but might need some improvements.A few things I recommend: The interface itself is a bit lacking in the user experience design area. I would add some \"sneak peeks\" or summed-up information whenever you hover your cursor over the news, charts, etc. area on the right top side. Also, right top? Seems a bit out of place. Our eyes naturally go to the first thing on the left. Furthermore, whenever you click on an article it opens a new tab. That is a bit irritating. On the bottom you should put FAQ, contact info, social media links and so on.When you click the articles, it sends you to different news sites? No original content? Not sure how that is going to be viewed by the original writers, especially if you do not have permission to use their articles.",

It has a simple and well-designed interface, but I was surprised that the news headlines are linked to external sites and not to pages within the site!!! As if you are free advertising for these news sites!!Also for bitcoin browser it seems not to work. I pasted the address of bitcoin and TX but I didn't get any results even though it shows a message that the download is 100%!!I waited for a longer time, but I did not get any results. I do not know if it is not complete yet, or is there something wrong?",

The format and idea is identical to cryptopanic and the only difference was you add the image per article which is great. Maybe add some feature that let reader react and comment anonymously for a possible interaction to your website.Typically news aggregator like that display live price on the top part of the website to let reader know the crypto price while reading news since some people love to check price frequently.",

Here is a website I've been working on that shows crypto news, crypto graphs, and even a bitcoin explorer with live global transactions. The graphs are still elementary, but looking for feedback/  thoughts from people who like to follow crypto! Thanks https://d2index.com/I decided to visit your site and here is my initial feedback. On the home page, i saw some news. At first, i thought these news were written by your site authors but by clicking on them I realized that they take to the respective crypto news site. Well, it is good for anyone who wants to get glimpse of crypto news at once but I think it is not good for your site as it takes people to other sites and they won't spend time on your site. With this apporach, you may get difficult to generate revenue when you monetize your site.My suggestion will be to read the news from those sites and try to reproduce them in your own site.Now coming to the charts section, i thought i may get some customized charts for bitcoin but was disappointed to see charts which no real value. Would it be good if you can include onchian charts or other charts which offer some customization, like trading view charts explaining the movement of bitcoin and ethereum?Just take my feedback as positive, i am delighted to see that you have started the site and hope you will continuously improve it.",
