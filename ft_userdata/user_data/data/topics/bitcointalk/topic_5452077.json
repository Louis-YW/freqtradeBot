  "content": "Bitcoin has always been the number one digital cryptocurrency. And let the solutions appear faster, he was an icon, a kind of Gold in the world of cryptocurrencies. You all see what is happening with transaction prices now, because of the brc-20. The number of unconfirmed transactions is again high, as it was in 2017 and not only. Has the era of bitcoin passed as the number 1 cryptocurrency? Or is it a move to strangle his price?",

OP, first off Bitcoin has always taken longer to confirm and had higher fees than altcoins because it is decentralized and much more popular.And yeah fees are high but that's because there's an attack on Bitcoin right now. In fact today the fees are already much lower than the past couple days. Cuz attacks can't last very long since they are very wasteful for the attackers. Maybe yesterday you had to pay $20-something for a transaction but now its back to like $6-$8 where it was for the past week, and before that is was like $2-$3 the past few months so hopefully it goes back down to that soon.tldr: Bitcoin is fine.",

You need to know that nothing in this world is 100% perfect and bitcoin is no exception. You can't just because a small problem has appeared for a few days and quickly conclude that bitcoin is out of date. The benefits that bitcoin has brought to us are immense, and it can be said that no other asset class can do that. But with just a small matter of transaction fees, you will be suspicious of bitcoin. It's disappointing that this doubt comes from a hero member of the forum.",

Bitcoin works in a free market system where autonomous miners can take advantage of the currently expensive fees of the network to put their machines to work. If I had the required equipments and structure, I would be already profiting by confirming transactions on the blockchain and earning a pretty decent reward for that. Anyway, of course others are thinking the same and will put this idea in practice, so you can expect fees to go down soon.",

I see in terms of appearance it looks like the OP is using the Truswallet type of wallet (correct me if I'm wrong) indeed the fee can be adjusted even for me with a fee of 50 sat/vB it still can't be confirmed because network fees continue to be high but if you set a fee of 150 sat/vB to the top may be above the same thing right now it's going down a little but it can go up again.But this could lead to even worse bottlenecks, even if the CEO of Binance supports it, it will likely make things worse, don't know what the solution will be, whether it will return to normal once in a while where you can pay under $1 again.",

Bitcoin will remain as the number one cryptocurrency even if some people prefer otherwise. This fees issue is happening due to the introduction of the BRC20 shit which is keeping the network busy. Bitcoin blockchain is simply not capable enough to handle such volume of transactions. That's why bitcoin is more lucrative as an investment and not as a method of transferring value. It is indeed a drawback of bitcoin network but it wasn't built for BRC-20 madness. Hopefully it will stablize within a short period of time.",
