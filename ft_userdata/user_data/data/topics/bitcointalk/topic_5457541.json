  "content": "Still in the course of learning.Got into a slight debate with a friend about bitcoin. The whole argument was if bitcoin is a legal tender or not. And he was emphasizing on the premises that bitcoin is a legal tender in the sense that it is used for the exchange of goods and services around the world. And that by the virtue of people using it it's therefore a legal tender.On the other side I was trying to explain to him that a legal tender is that which is accepted by the government and under the regulation of any central bank and this is not so with bitcoin. Furthermore, that one of the reasons people accept  bitcoin for exchange of goods and services is because the coin it is like a digital gold that has value specially for long term storage and also with equal unit of value anywhere in the world, etc. Using gold or diamond as obvious example of things that has value, I asked him a rhetorical question; that just because these objects has value and could be used as a means of exchange does it make them to be regarded as a legal tender?To clear the air about the whole argument I considered I should share this in the forum to have a clear stand if bitcoin is a legal tender or not.",

(maybe in Africa or South America?)Being a medium of exchange doesn't make you a legal tender, otherwise cocaine could be one too, for example.Quote from: Lida93 on June 25, 2023, 03:44:42 PMUsing gold or diamond as obvious example of things that has value, I asked him a rhetorical question; that just because these objects has value and could be used as a means of exchange does it make them to be regarded as a legal tender?To clear the air about the whole argument I considered I should share this in the forum to have a clear stand if bitcoin is a legal tender or not. You answered your own question, having value, whether high or low, is not enough to make one a legal tender.Being a legal tender is not subjective, there's no real debate about it, only laws that say whether or not it is.",

People are using bitcoin universal because of it decentralized pattern that makes the users anonymous and it is also a payment method. It is because bitcoin started to increase in value as time pass on and due to the halving event,this made bitcoin became valuable and people started using it as an assets and a store of value. Another reason for using it as a store of value is because bitcoin is inflation resistance. These are the reasons why bitcoin is used for goods and services worldwide. It is only Elsavado that has accepted bitcoin as a legal tender.",

Bitcoin is a legal tender, and it's also not a legal tender; it all depends on where it's being used, just as explained by iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2. If you are talking about legal tender when you are referring to El Salvador, then yes, Bitcoin is legal tender, but if it's in other countries where it's not fully accepted by the government, then no, Bitcoin is not legal tender. So the argument is that both sides are correct to me based on their own arguing points.It's only when one refers to Bitcoin being a global legal tender that I can boldly say NO. Because it's not accepted in all countries, some are Bitcoin friendly while others are not, and some are both, so we can't just judge based on the idea or story from a Bitcoin-friendly country; others should also be put into the picture.",

Bitcoin is a great option that promotes the values of privacy protection and also anonymity.With that as a point Bitcoin isn't under the control of any government, institution then who has the right to actually proclaim Bitcoin legal or not? Well the point is that Bitcoin is a decentralized system (freedom) meaning if two people or parties agree on Bitcoin being their means of exchange then it can be done. The government can't stop that.",

Bitcoin is not yet legal tender because it is not widely acknowledged as a general money for the exchange of goods and services on a worldwide scale.The Oxford dictionary defines legal tender asQuote coins or banknotes that must be accepted if offered in payment of a debt. In this scenario, Bitcoin is not yet legal money because so many countries have not yet made Bitcoin legal in their jurisdictions.Furthermore, many people are still unaware of Bitcoin since they do not understand it, and before something becomes legal tender, it must have global recognition and be something that everyone agrees on as a means of payment.",

Legal tender is a term, let's use a dictionary to define the concept.https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legal tenderWhat we see is \"must be accepted\", i.e. someone has to make sure that anyone can pay with the legal tender whenever they want, and the recipient has no right to refuse him. It is the state that has the right to do so. Accordingly, where the state, as in El Salvador, has recognized bitcoin as the legal tender, there it is. In all other countries, it is a matter of agreement between the two parties whether they agree to use bitcoin for payments, unless otherwise prohibited by law.",

What you would have explained is the part your friend explained. You would have given him examples of countries that have adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. Now let me give you some fraction on it. Bitcoin is a legal tender in world but it meant for the individual countries to accept it. If Bitcoin is not a legal tender El Salvador and Central African Republic wouldn't adopted it in the individual countries. Now some countries are afraid to adopt it because their fear is Bitcoin will take over their country economy so they ban it to be used. Bitcoin is a decentralized system and that doesn't mean that the world leaders can not stop Bitcoin, they can stop if Bitcoin is not a legal tender in the world but Bitcoin is a legal tender so it is for the individual countries to accept the new technology or not. But time is still coming that many countries will adopt the technology to support their economy as El Salvador and others have done.Op so as a member in this forum you are to boldly speak the truth with Bitcoin enthusiast.",

But as long as Bitcoin is never in full acceptance in the majority of the world's countries, it's not a legal tender yet, apart from El Salvador, which has declared it a legal tender. Apart from that, Bitcoin is not yet legal tender in most countries. because, if it is, that means banks are supposed to even accept Bitcoin and give you cash should you have such a request (just my thoughts).

Your concept us right, as Legal tender and making something legal are two different things, as many other members have also shed some light so i will just make it short, that Legal tender is the one currency that a government will use for national reserves and it will have the currency as national currency like BTC and the adoption will be made easy by the government while BTC is being Legal means, government will not help you in adoption of BTC but they will nore stop you either.",

Quotelegal tender noun /ˌliːɡl ˈtendə(r)/ /ˌliːɡl ˈtendər/[uncountable]​money that can be legally used to pay for things in a particular country So according to the explanation, legal tender is something that is officially recognized that is accepted by the law.  See the keywords there,  the law and officially recognized.  So to be able to tell if something is a legal tender, it should be recognized by the government and Bitcoin is yet to be recognized as legal tender by most of the country and in US Bitcoin is accepted as a commodity.If we are living in El Salvador, we can say that Bitcoin is a legal tender since it is recognized by the El Salvador government as one but if we live in the US, it is not.  Same goes in my country, Bitcoin is not a legal tender but was recognized as mode of payment.",

Being adopted as a legal tender in a particular country doesn’t make it a legal tender in another country. So in these countries that it is not a legal tender it doesn’t mean individuals or citizens can’t accept it from each other but this is done at their own preference and not government approved, so If anything should happen you wouldn’t hold any one responsible for it since you accepted it at your own will. Example could be an old naira which the government has rendered obsolete and not longer a legal tender. So once someone brings it to you, you have the right to reject it or even accept it if you have anywhere you also could use it. But once it is a legal tender then you have no right to refuse the currency",
