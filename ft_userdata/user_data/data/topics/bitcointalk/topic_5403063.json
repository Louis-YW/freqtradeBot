Buckle up.True, and I will repeat what I said, we might see the price even go lower, maybe lower than $15k worst case scenario.And as per @Wilhelm, buying opportunity, just imagine reaching the previous all time high, -72%. So the current price is at a discount, and this is where the smart investors comes in. Getting their wallet fat again because of panic selling from inexperience and noobs investors.",

Never give up, never accept defeat, like that knight from Monty Python.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmInkxbvlCsFor me it's just another day. Idiots dumping in panic despite it being 70% from the top and them being down on their investment after holding for a year and refusing to sell at much higher levels. It always baffles me how people can hold being at 50% loss, 60, 70 and then they hit a point like -78% and they say no more, I'm out! Like those who were selling Luna at 99% loss. What does it matter if you get $10 from your 1k investment or not? What are you going to buy with it? A rope?If only people were able to think in these hard times and take a break. After every bear market comes a bull market! I don't know how many times I told people that in 2018/19.",

I'd still say that the long term prospects are rather bullish than bearish.It's especially hard to predict because the markets are illiquid. I've watched a number of smart people talking about it on various podcasts. Compare this to stocks where let's say you have a local shipping company and the company trades on the main exchange in the country. The company puts x amount for sale, like 50% and that's all available at the exchange either held by investors, ready to be sold, or already in the form of orders. With Bitcoin it's completely different as there are hundreds of exchanges that trade bitcoin all around the world and only a few of them are connected to these big tickers that make people try to catch up to what binance, bitfinex, coinbase and few others are doing. Also over 70% of all coins are out of exchanges, so the price is based on trades of a fraction of the whole. If you want to participate you have to send money to an exchange and get it added to the balance of your account which can take hours or even days when it comes to small exchanges. Then there's miners who constantly put pressure on the market selling coins, so when a traditional company can have the ratio of buyers to sellers at 50% to stay at the same point, bitcoin needs buyers to dominate just so it can stay at the same point. When drops scare off investors, just like it happened when we dropped below the 2021 low, the pressure put by miners keeps dragging us down and it's going to continue until someone steps in and buys enough coins for the market to turn around. It's all based on belief that the bear market is over and we are going to go up, that's all. There's nothing wrong with bitcoin, but nobody wants to touch it for some reason. People are waiting for a sign of strength, but there will be no such thing until they, themselves start showing strength.",
