In your bid to just follow through because, you feel you've got no further use for the device in following through any important or financial stuff @OP, i would say you never can be too sure. So long as you ain't dumping the device just yet, you just might end up following through to download some malware and have some important stuff put in place and the thing is, these scammers are always there, lucking in the corners.You could imagine merely accessing your telegram after a long absence and they are unto you. The same would apply in the event of a malware.At times, don't play around, just move past it.",

Especially some random links in Telegram because I have been scammed before and it is used for scamming.I dont use it much since after I was scammed on it, these days I prefer WhatsApp. However, I really don’t appreciate the way Facebook sells my data to third parties and I am aware they own WhatsApp.I would consider going back to Telegram but I’m skeptical of their data privacy laws. I do not want my information to be sold.",
