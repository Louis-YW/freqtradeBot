  "content": "It appears that we have a new favorite crypto predictor. Our old favorite Tom Lee might have stopped making public predictions on bitcoin after 2018. This might have caused much psychological shock and damage on Tom hehehehe.Our new favorite predictor is Jim Cramer hehe. Algod, a trader who predicted Terra's collapse, has been countertrading him and he appears to be making good trades.Whale Who Bet $1M on Terra's Collapse Now Countertrading Jim CramerAlgod posted an update on their “inverse Jim Cramer” account on Twitter Monday, announcing that they had doubled their profits since the account launched. Algod claims that they startedthe account with $50,000; its net value now shows as $101,440.71 in their post. “Some people work a 9-5 job, i simply just countertrade Jim Cramer… it’s not much but honest work,” Algod wrote.There’s also an Inverse Cramer ETF Twitter account that likely inspired Algod, where over 84,000 followers track Cramer’s calls to ascertain what to bet against next.Read in full https://cryptobriefing.com/whale-who-bet-terras-collapse-countertrading-jim-cramer/Inverse Cramer ETF Twitter accounthttps://mobile.twitter.com/CramerTracker",

He actually ran a hedge fund before and has some experience in finance. His predictions are so bad it makes it seem he is paid to give bad tips and cause many new traders to lose money.I am pretty sure someone can randomly flip a coin and get better predictions than him. I assumed in 2008 people would stop watching him however he is still on TV. I don’t understand why.",

When that guy says Bitcoin is going up forever, you’d better sell. He seemed a little bearish lately, which is a good thing if you sold at $65K when he was with Saylor talking about mortgaging homes to buy BTC. Seems like it’s time to start getting back in.",

There is a simpler way to estimate this by only using a chart and mark them with the date of the predictions. I saw one of Jim Cramer on social media but I cannot find it anymore.
