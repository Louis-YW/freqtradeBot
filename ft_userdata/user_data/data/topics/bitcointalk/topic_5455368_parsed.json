If we have reached the necessary block, then OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY will verify, OP_DROP will clear the stack, and then all that is left will be the pubkey and OP_CHECKSIG as it would be in a old school P2PK output.Now, if we take that part of the script:Code:03a0f26cb17541045332b5e3bcaeef3a062b49d5129ac21017d369e9c52c2f12c472d8d6236e2f5116b580dd1f99fd9b321d9207c9a512f301c263bd58238dbbebf469675e09a2b2acTake the RIPEMD160(SHA256(script)):Code:54A1DF7BE7557E2FD2F65CA45FF541EE363A0085Add the network byte 0x05, and then compute and append the checksum:Code:0554A1DF7BE7557E2FD2F65CA45FF541EE363A00858CD8A9D8And then encode in Base58:Code:39QWbnkbcPFcrJFEB6yvVDc12eX5zqVt3ySo all coins sent to the address 39QWbnkbcPFcrJFEB6yvVDc12eX5zqVt3y are locked by the above script, meaning they can only be spent when we hit block 7,140,000.",

For you to have such an address, you would have to specifically create it. It's not the case where a regular address can be turned in to a timelocked address, nor for me to send coins to your regular address and specify how or when you are allowed to spend them in the future.This was a mistake on behalf of the person who created that address, not on behalf of the person who sent coins to that address.",
