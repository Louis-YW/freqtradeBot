The 9 crypto currencies are:24xbtc.com 100btc.pro pridechange.com 101crypta.com uxbtc.com trust-exchange.org bitcoin24.exchange paybtc.pro owl.gold QuoteNoncompliant virtual currency exchanges, which have a lax anti-money laundering program or collect minimal Know Your Customer information or none at all, serve as important hubs in the cybercrime ecosystem and are operating in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Sections 1960 and 1956.  Many of these services are advertised on online forums dedicated to discussing criminal activity. By providing these services, the virtual currency exchanges knowingly support the criminal activities of their clients and become co-conspirators in criminal schemes.Much of the criminal activity occurring at the affected exchanges involved cyber actors responsible for ransomware, but also other scammers, and cybercriminals.  The service’s website offered support in both Russian and English.The investigation is ongoing. Visitors to the sites will now find a seizure banner that notifies them that the domain name has been seized by federal authorities and operating an unlicensed money service business and facilitating money laundering is a federal crime.https://www.justice.gov/usao-edmi/pr/fbi-disrupts-virtual-currency-exchanges-used-facilitate-criminal-activityIt's good that this kind of websites are being taken down, but we all know that this is just the beginning. Maybe next week this operators are going to open up a new website to cater for their customers. So it's going to be a ongoing battle between the bad actors against government agencies. Just interesting though that since the war is still ongoing on Ukraine, this criminals business are still thriving.",

Perhaps this could be promoted in some places in the web that is nested by this kind of criminals, and then market it as the place they can launder their money.

All you need is to accuse these platforms of laundering money or unlawful trade and you will find enough justification to close it.The most important for platforms is not the closure because it can work from the Kayman Islands, but it is difficult to create bank accounts in the European Union or the United States will deprive them of many of the liquidity they need to continue advertisements or pay salaries to employees.",

There are thousands of such services in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and no one asks for documents.
