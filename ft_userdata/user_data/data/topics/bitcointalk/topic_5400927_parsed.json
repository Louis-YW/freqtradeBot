      "body": "It will not affect the decentralization of the entire crypto, with my reasons; Point 1: Bitcoin stands as a symbol of hope and trust in the entire crypto industry. perhaps the founders of Bitcoin were just known as Satoshi nakamoto but real identity is not known till today, yet Bitcoin keeps pushing up. The only way the entire crypto industry would be affected is when Bitcoin is no longer Trading or the price dumps remarkably (maybe price dump to $10 or $100). Bitcoin holds the industry and only Bitcoin can pull it down.Point 2: Every exchange list Bitcoin today without any application (LOL), what most of this current projects fails to understand is strategy!! (Strategy to win) Point 3: In 2009 Bitcoin was $0, 2011 it managed to get up to $1.0 and so on. But today, an average investor can not buy up to 2 Bitcoin, again every exchange wants to list Bitcoin without application.Team and project devs of this days are concerned with investment and quick growth of their project, that's why identity are not private again (they forget the true definition of decentralization). ¬†The team behind Bitcoin did not fear anything, they were just concerned about the value they created which they wish will turn out a good virtue one day and it did. If current projects can adopt the strategy, it will be better. But definitely the decentralization of the entire crypto industry would not affected unless Bitcoin stops to shine light of gold..These üëÜüëÜüëÜ are my opinion sir, thanks.",

It's all about the safety of investing in new cryptocurrency projects. Satoshi Nakamoto did not raise money to make Bitcoin work. Therefore, this project was able to appear without the disclosure of the team of inventors. All the teams of current new projects first offer to invest money in their projects, and only then promise a profit from this. However, we know that there are a lot of scammers now and they all want to remain in the shadows so that no one knows about them and there are fewer clues to find them after the deception they have committed. Therefore, personally, I immediately associate with fraud information about all projects whose team members do not want to introduce themselves to their potential investors. In addition, cryptocurrencies are often created by people without any experience in this matter, and investors have the right to know how experienced the team they trust with their money is.",

If in the past it was enough to create a good powerpoint presentation and start raising money for a project, then right now, investors dig deep to find everything about project. Public team is the best way to show what project will be capable of. If the team are bunch of no names with a background of some programs made during college study, then dont expect anything good from it. But if you see that projects team is full of google/microsoft like employees, whos experience hardly fit in A4 page, then these guys definitely would create something more than a pixeled tic-tac-toe game on blockchain.",

To be honest for me it is a good thing that most teams that are behind new crypto projects are now transparent and that you can check in what kind of positions they were working before and what they have done so far. I know that the inventor of Bitcoin is still unknown to this day and that is also a important factor why Bitcoin has become such a huge success because in the end Bitcoin was about giving the power back to the normal people and to not be dependent on a big company or a country.The whole crypto industry has matured though since the introduction of Bitcoin and i don't think that you can except people to fund your project with a lot of money when you don't even tell them who you are.",
