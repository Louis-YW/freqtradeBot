Even in the politics section, the posts are more relevant and valuable than in the HYIPs section.Let me guess; you tried reporting those posts in the past and reports were marked as bad, right? If Ann thread bumping spam is deleted I see no reason why this shouldn't be either, but this is just one of those things on bitcointalk that doesn't make much sense.I think that problem here might be that even your own admin thinks that those are legit posts made by genuine users and not bots, even though its pretty obvious what's going on there.Quote from: Xal0lex on February 18, 2023, 01:00:44 PMYou misunderstood, these users are not rewarded for their posts in this thread. They post reports about received remunerations in HYIP projects, in which they participate. Also rewards from Profit-Hunters BIZ project for participation in various quizzes, referral rewards and rewards received in various bounties. Thus, they confirm that these projects are not some kind of scams, but normally working projects where you can earn money.",

Were other boards spammed with this so it was the way to contain them in one place or something along those lines?This is quite an interesting topic for conversation... This is all the inheritance of the first moderator, under whom the structure of the Russian-speaking subforum was created.Most of the subforums in the Russian-speaking section were created 12 years ago.There was also a whole subsection for the trashcan: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=92.0Great, right? When users lost messages in the entire forum after deleting topics, users in our section did not lose anything.Personally, I don't understand the logic, but we still have a separate section for coders (never been popular): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=66.0A separate section for ideas! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=90.0There you can discuss what has not yet been implemented. Have you seen this anywhere else?A separate section for job search (never been popular too): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=185.0The section of discussion and announcements of services is called \"business\": https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=23.0This word has a fairly broad meaning in the Russian language and a historical coloring, so for many years we have had to explain to people why this section is for, why it is necessary to create topics in it if you want to talk about your service. Many people simply bypass this section because of the name.A few years after the first moderator left, we managed to create several subsections, but a lot of user requests remain in the plans.

A lot of scams originate from Russia from what I hear, but their targets aren't Russian AFAIK.  So while a scammy section like that would seem appropriate in the Russian board, it kinda doesn't.  Nor is Russia the only place where scams are prevalent.Ratimov, I support your request 100% and appreciate your description of a section that I never visit because I don't speak the language.  I often forget there are lots of local boards with their own unique communities.Quote from: NeuroticFish on February 21, 2023, 11:37:29 AMIf theymos wants he can do tests and see whether doing something about those spam bots (from locking those few topics to maybe even banning them) would stop the garbage accumulate.If not, he can properly contain that area, in a way or another, but preferably also mark it as \"Warning, this is a dump, hence pests and diseases may find their home here; watch your steps!\".Makes more sense?Sounds to me from what Ratimov said that the whole section is not only bot-infested but pretty much dead anyway.  The best option would be to just nuke it, no?",

But for some reason Russian local board is the only one that created a safe place for them to spam their useless bot-like crap.",

But does that ever happen on Bitcointalk? Do we have examples of child-boards being deleted completely because they aren't as popular as they once were? I would love if this forum had zero tolerance for scams, but since that isn't the case, then we shouldn't do anything about it. If it becomes impossible to post such crap in the Russian board, why are all kinds of scam projects allowed in the altcoin boards or the Investor/HYIP-based sub? Get rid of them all or don't do anything. As for bot activity, the bounty reports are bot activity. You have examples of bots still posting their Facebook and Twitter reports months after the bounty ended and nothing is being done about it.",
