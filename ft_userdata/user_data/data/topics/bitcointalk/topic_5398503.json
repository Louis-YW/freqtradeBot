  "content": "This has been said many times and advice given to newbies and other members that never ever keep your funds on Centralised exchange as they have the custody of your funds or in simple words say they have keys to your funds and can easily spend them if they wish to do so or in any other case they turn out to be scam.Not your keys not your funds is common phrase you might have heard of but still we see huge volumes over these exchanges and people trusting them like they will never cheat them or funds are safe but they have no idea about it.Keeping your funds on exchange have some other problems also which are not unnoticed but still some prefer to keep them over exchanges :1) Privacy : You should not except any privacy when dealing with CEX at all as your personal information is always at stake and they can always trace you with additional requirements of KYC documentation to withdraw your funds with different levels2) Freeze your account : They act just like banking system who can restrict you from withdrawing your own funds if sufficient proofs are not submitted and they found something suspicious in it 3) Using third party software for storing information and then it's used as phising scams against user who loose their funds in these scams.There are many other things which acts as sign that you must take out your funds from these exchange and they are government puppet who will act according to their will giving out then full information and trace their users or providing them information about you. Re: Coinbase the most anti-Bitcoin organisation. Make #DeleteCoinbase great again Binance selling data to Russian authorities But this thread is also created with the same intention of warning you all that you should stay away from these CEX for safety of your funds Coinbase can take your cryptos in case of bankruptcy They have their policy that in case of bankruptcy they will take your funds as they are deemed to be your property so how safe you assume yourself? Or being too optimists that this will never happen and your funds are safe there forever?I don't how many more signals people want to take out their funds from these CEX and have store them on non custodial wallets or HW with backup of their seeds and passphrase on offline places with security.There are lot of threads explaining these matters on the forum like this one from @o_e_l_e_o explain it in best way :Why beginners should pay attention to their privacyIf you still are keeping them on these exchanges then regretting afterwards will not have any impact or safeguard your from these problems because you are not taking any responsibility of your funds and privacy so seeking advice later on will not have any impact Your funds your responsibility so be sure how you keep them",

There would always be people who would not change despite the different warnings; banks can freeze your accounts at any time and require multiple credentials on registration and yet are very popular, so the concept of full transparency to any financial organization with perceived reputation is wide spread.Many would argue that coinbase should not be going bankrupt anytime soon; however, the idea that your funds can be taken away at any time, frozen pending investigations, and these third party exchanges can change their ToS at anytime and you have to agree to the changes to keep using their service (with your funds in them) is already enough signals to avoid Cex.",

This has been suggested quite often and we can only reduce the risk when funds are held in HW or non-custudial wallets.",

I know a guy who is a veteran stock trader and naturally he invested in bitcoin, but instead simply buying it and storing it on his hardware wallet he invested in it via Grayscale. I explained to him several times how easy is to set his own cold storage and what kind of contingency plan he can set in case something happens to him, but he just doesn't want that responsibility. And we are talking about the guy who was senior developer in a big tech company before he quit to go full time stock trading and has no issues grasping bitcoin technicalities.",

There is no arguing that once you are set up on an exchange,* trading is far more convenient with a centralized exchange over a true DEX. The general sluggishness of the fiat bank system will always work against DEXs, compared to the one click trading you can do on CEXs. Now, everyone knows I'd strongly argue that the convenience of such one click trading is absolutely not worth the zero security, zero privacy, and risk to all your coins you get with centralized exchanges, but you can't deny that such convenience exists.*I'd still argue that setting up an account on a DEX is far easier than on a CEX, though. Open an account and you are good to go, versus open an account, complete KYC, have that KYC rejected, wait 3 days for a manual review, upload more documents, take some selfies, link your bank account, deposit some fiat, and wait several more days for that to clear.",
