So the best way is just to report the issue if necessary to some security authorities. A refund is not guaranteed, but they might assure you of tracking the wallet, which most times leads to a dead end.",

Most times, once hackers get your Bitcoin it's over, only stupid scammers use centralized exchange to sell the Bitcoin this days, most of them go to Mixer service straight up or use some more secured privacy network to get rid of the Bitcoin.",

But as for the funds on it just like what Nwada001 said it can be traced but the possibility is nearly impossible. The only it can be recovered is when it is traced to an exchange, then if it is a government agency that is tracking the movements of the coin they would just make sure the exchange freezes the funds but if the scammer has been able to convert it to fiat then is KYC details will be used to traced them to his account. But if the funds were mixed in a mixer then I don’t see any possibility of it been recovered, especially if it is not a large amount.This is actually the debt you pay for being your own bank. So my advice is store your keys offline and be careful of phishing attacks",

Bitcoin is not like you normal Fiat or banking system that you get the chance to speak with those in control and within seconds you'll get a refund. In Bitcoin you're in charge and as such you're expected to know how to secure your funds properly.In addition to what has been said, you should be careful not to fall for more scam... In a situation like this you'll (it's a must) see people claiming that they can help you get access to the hacker/scammers wallet -- just know that it's a means to scam you of your remaining funds.",

When you get hacked or scammed, the scammer or hacker is another person who has access to your private key. Bitcoin developers don't have access to your private key, they can not help you. And most important, your bitcoin was moved and irreversible already. If developers of that Bitcoin wallet can help you, they can steal your bitcoin too and you will not want to use that wallet.Support will possible for exchanges when they can freeze your account and if you are fortunate when hacker, scammer did not move your bitcoin or did not move it all, you can get it or part of it after the exchange customer support is completed. Use centralized exchanges, online accounts to store your bitcoin is risky.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Just like what you said that if ever the transaction is confirmed, the only way for retrieving them is if they transfer it to the exchange. But, there's only a small chance since hackers are intelligent and might know this kind of stuff, so if ever they transfer it to exchange they will immediately sell it right after Bitcoin is reflected.

What are you asking? Bitcoin doesn't have any security team as it is a decentralized system. There is no support here, as in ordinary centralized services, like a binance. This must be understood and the solution of any problems is the lot of the users themselves, like you. Nobody will solve your problems for you. This is both a disadvantage and an advantage at the same time. Therefore, under no circumstances should you lose control of your bitcoin, because a return or restoration is not possible.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on July 05, 2023, 08:42:13 AMIf the hackers transfer the funds somewhere else, and the transaction gets confirmed, you can try and follow the funds to see if they ever end up at an address connected to a centralized exchange, but that's pretty much it. There's isn't much else you can do.You can try to contact the administration of the exchange, to whose address the stolen funds will arrive and try to convince them to block those funds. But it seems to me that you will have to go through a lot of bureaucratic barriers (+KYC) in order to prove your right to the stolen money, freeze the money and return it to you later.It is better to prevent this than to try to accomplish the almost impossible.",

If you have the private key or seed phrase then try to access it because it is hard for them to change the seed phrase and key unless there is a feature provided by the wallets's manufacturer. I hope you would've have gotten the idea of retrieving a wallet is not depend on the developers of BTC but it depends on the developers of the Wallet you are using. If they have a support option you could ask them in support. Just like the recent attack on Atomic wallet has affected 1% or 2% users and one of the user got its 1 million $ back:https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665226056570118146",
