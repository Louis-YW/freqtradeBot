  "content": "I got some few questions lately about the hope of Bitcoin if it's actually going to stay this year and immediately I went straight to answer them that  Bitcoin is here to stay.It is without doubt that Bitcoin really suffered greatly last year with over 60% fall in it's value as a result of macro climate and some high profile company failures, there is still more hope for Bitcoin as there are more people seizing the bear season to accommolate more Bitcoin which is a hope for Bitcoin.Read more from the link below which I found worth sharinghttps://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-coming-back-in-2023",

When the market is in winter, you will get a lot of questions about bitcoin, does bitcoin exist? is bitcoin dead?... And when bitcoin is in a bull market, you will see a lot of questions about when the bitcoin bubble will burst. If it were me, I wouldn't have to answer them because if you explained to them, they would never believe, tell them to look at what bitcoin has done over the past 14 years, enough to prove it all.",

If someone is still too concerned about its existence then that person will just be too late to invest and will always ask if it's okay to invest now whether we're in a bear or bull market.

If the price of a bitcoin is one dollar, then the bitcoin can be said to last as long as there is an individual willing to mine it.In the early days of Bitcoin, the number of people running the node was less than 100, yet Bitcoin continued to operate for long periods, yet the price was low, and after several years we reached all these levels.What I am trying to say is that price does not rule continuation.",

I'm still more haunted by what happened in 2018 than in 2022.If this question was asked 5 years ago, we could still doubt the existence of bitcoin, but if someone is still asking about this in 2023, its a waste of time if we stop to answer theirs.Indeed, for those who already have negative beliefs about bitcoin ingrained in their blood, we should not waste our time with them.",

Most of them have a short-term view on btc so this type of answer will give them closure and perhaps reduce their level of panic. I want to believe the first 3 years of btc existence were the hardest and biggest challenge, after btc was able to survive those trying years, the question of whether btc will stay or burst (as some people like to describe it) should be out of the picture. There is no doubt btc has come to stay.",

The governments of many nations are printing more money, resulting in currency devaluation. Obviously, bitcoin has come to rescue society from its financial woes. One other way to know that bitcoin is here to stay is the way it is portrayed by El Salvador, the first country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender, thereby pushing its potential for mass adoption. There are so many pieces of evidence that prove that bitcoin is here to stay.www.cbsnews.com/news/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_El_Salvadorwww.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-approve...l-tender-2021-06-09/",

Bitcoin had been around more than a decade and it keeps on getting stronger after some struggles and hurdles that happens along its way.  Like these centralized services fiasco, Bitcoin market was greatly affected but the community and the market is strong enough to withstand the effect and slowly recovers.

Honestly, but are there any good references to get knowledge about it?Until whenever 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin regardless of price. Bitcoin is here to stay even if regulation slows its adoption. Even if the government bans mining and tightens the rules then there will always be miners handling the transaction so nobody stops short.",

It means that Bitcoin will not die of these failures, wars, economic crises, etc. In fact, adoption is growing which is a big help for the crypto market to stay. I can't say it stays forever, but based on its performance and the community's trust, I would say that Bitcoin has a reason to stay alive for many years. This gives me a reason as well to ignore all the negatives I've around but rather to focus on investing more and hold for this becomes more valuable in the next few years.",
