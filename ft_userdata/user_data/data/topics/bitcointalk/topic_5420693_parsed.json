South Korea is quite scary it seems.Brazil and Argentina have generations of good young players, we take an example from Brazil, there are Martinelli, Vini Jr, and the third Rodrygo has played a very important role for Arsenal and Real Madrid. From Argentina there are Lautaro Martinez, Correa and Alvarez, all three of whom were very sharp on the front lines for Inter Milan and Man City. So the two countries really deserve to compete in the 2022 world cup final.",

I want to see Argentina to bounce back stronger, but I’m also excited to see how the other countries prepared for this year world cup, few more days left and exciting matches will happen again.",

But it's quite difficult because almost every country has a young and talented generation, so they also compete to be the best to represent their country. Let's see if this will become a reality for Argentina vs Portugal in the 2022 world cup.",

Apart from Brazil who has a complet and dedicated young squad. I will suggest that no one should underrate England, they will go very far.",

If you are rooting for certain country, you can check which country they will face first.I am sure, there's a lot of money bets during this world cup. Most casinos/bookies are offering some contests on this event.But for now, there are several teams that has the possibility to enter in the finals like Brazil, Portugal and Argentina.We can't be so sure at the moment. Let us wait maybe after 3 days of this event, and we will see which ones are winning their matches.",

The best thing that we can do right now is to enjoy the matches and place some bet as well, this will be an exciting World Cup and I know other countries prepared for this, Brazil also have the chance for a good finish this time.",

Quite a lot for a team that reached the final 4 years ago and that has a lot of quality in its team. And Modric is still one of the best midfielders in the world. There are more countries that are contenders such as Belgium, but then you are already talking about odds of 12.0. You could make quite good money with Croatia. Brazil seems to be even more the top favorite with odds around 4.00. Very little for a favorite when you consider how strong this tournament is.",

I will suggest that no one should underrate England, they will go very far.It can be said that Lukaku and Hazard are in bad form, but for Kevin De Bruyne it is still very good performance so far. England is a bit difficult to predict, but they have a young star player in the Bundesliga, Jude Bellingham as one of the central axis, while the attack line by famous players in the English league. But you also have to be careful because England also called Harry Maguire in defense, I hope he doesn't cause embarrassing incidents when he is in the world cup.Quote from: alegotardo on November 14, 2022, 01:20:12 AMI have the following bet...For the semifinal matches, I expect a super classic between Brazil and Argentina, on the other side of the bracket I believe that France should face Belgium.The final would follow with a dispute between Brazil and Belgium, where obviously Brazil should be the big winner of the 2022 World Cup.Obviously Brazil will face other great teams along the way, as well as the entire selection....

Indeed, things are difficult to predict, we have to wait for all the countries to play in the game first, then we can decide what we will take next.",

France is placed in Group D, which means that they will most probably face England in the QF stage, and then either Portugal or Belgium in the semi-final stage. The other semi-final will be between Brazil and Argentina. But if one or two upsets happen, then all these assumptions will be wasted. Personally I don't believe that France will reach the SF stage.",

This is for other users to see and compare because some of us here are going to place a bet. Seeing if which most of the teams are mentioned, could help them decide to pick that team if they are unsure with their own picks.No matter how badly we want most of the teams to win, sadly that is not possible but there will only be a few who will be honoured as the best player at the end of this event. This makes the game more intense and exciting. It pushes the players to give their best in each of their plays.",
