At the picnic, you could give a quick talk about bitcoin and have a quiz competition later to see who remembers anything you said.",

Much better if you will allocate the funds for the food and just give a toy with Bitcoin theme so that will play it most of the time that might retain in their memory until they grow to the age which they can understand Bitcoin.I already done feeding children under a care facility. Instead of the children, I educated those caregiver assign to the children so that they can educate the children once they grow old.",

Giving bitcoins or mentioning bitcoins on International Children's Day is really unnecessary and will most likely make the kids unhappy. If you want to teach them bitcoin, you can arrange another time as we have more time to spend with them than just this holiday.

I'm open to any and all suggestions!The idea is excellent, but finding practical proposals is a bit complicated, since you are looking for a unique idea for a group of children, not just one or two of your children. The children will be of different ages and from different cultural backgrounds, so the most that can be done is to organize a small celebration with the neighbors, where the children will have fun effortlessly getting to know complex ideas. Of course, $60 won't help you much in this case.There is a suggestion that you can think of, which is to introduce the Bitcoin to the parents during the celebration, who in turn will pass that knowledge on later to their children. Also you don't need those 60 bucks",

If we does then we are to also plan for your marriage. How the marriage is going to be if you have not married. And if you want the community to plan for you, the $60 is too small. Because something you would have done quietly has been brought to the public so the public will suggest that you should at least spend $100 for the children day party. And from your topic again, $60 can not make children day memorable because things are expenses. But if you must do, gather them and buy snags and give to them. Play music and let them dance and all these things you need money, you have to pay for the DJ as well.",

I'm assuming these kids are old enough to go to an amusement park. For their happiness, you can first take them to the amusement park. Then you have to buy pizza because all kids love pizza  If you increase your money a little more, you can get what they want from the market in the remaining time. You should also advise them not to have too much sugar.",

Mindset of kids changes a lot just after 6 months or 1 to 2 years and if you have kids, you will recognize that. Change in mindset is part of their growth and you can not force a 6 years old kid to play a game for 4 years old kid, it's not funny and exciting at all.QuotePerhaps a game that teaches them about Bitcoin while keeping them entertained?

The main idea is an art contest, yes it's about bitcoin. So I think with this idea kids and anyone who is aware of it will be wondering what bitcoin is and maybe you'll be an artist for a while in the community itself.",

Of course you would introduce the basics like the definition of BTC in simple way a presentation with more on visualization since kids are more into photographic memory.
