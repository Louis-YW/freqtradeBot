Laughing will also help you take in so much oxygen which helps for the circulation of blood and also help to cure heart diseases. The only way to laugh all the time is to be happy and tolerate everything around you no matter how annoying it is. When I was a teen my uncle adviced me to always laugh so that I will live longer and that if I frown all the time,I will not live long.",

You'll learn a great deal.I call it quiet time and it is the most productive time especially when i have less job or nothing to do. Sometimes after taking a few course online the time i spend alone is used to meditate on all i have learnt and how i can apply them. Recently i took a course on Digital Marketing and it was complex from the start but when i took out time to stay away from the screen and mediate i began to see and understand all i could not while i was learning.",

Thinking too much makes you unhappyHappy Sunday everyone.I have learned that spending time alone and meditating is beneficial. The world has become so noisy that you might not have the right environment to reason and analyze life's issues. Although it is very difficult for me now to stay alone because of family responsibilities and some economic challenges, I still allocate some time to meditation.If you believe or follow what you see on social media, you might become frustrated. Most of the stories you see on social media are deceptive and fake. You would always see beautiful pictures, while in reality, these people are living in pain. I don't need to tell the world that I bought a new car because it would only attract more enemies to me.",

Thinking too much makes you unhappyHappy Sunday everyone.It's funny that you bring up the topic of letting go, because many of these sayings appear to emphasize the significance of present. For example, the concept of spending time alone or refraining from reflecting on the past or future. It's almost as if they're suggesting that happiness can only be discovered in the present moment, not somewhere else. I also like the idea of being aware of your own ideas, steps, and behaviours rather than just operating on schedule, so I believe it is not good to dwell in the past or future because being too consumed with what's back or in ahead of us has an emotional impact on us and prevents us from focusing on what is truly important.",
