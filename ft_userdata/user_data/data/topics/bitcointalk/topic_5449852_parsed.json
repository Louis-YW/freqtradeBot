So sometimes you will find a variety of FUDs about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Now, if we can count on technical indicators it will only be difficult if you do not know how to read it correctly, though sometimes or often it is not accurate so the situation becomes complicated as well.",

Are they being greedy or fearful? if so, are they buying more or selling off their positions? When there are a lot of involvement in the market, guess what? It causes volatility. The market moves in a way that orders are cluttered both buys and longs. Manipulation then occurs taking one side of the market before going truly one direction higher or lower.Instead of choosing between price analysis and news, Try doing incorporating the news and fundamental research with your price action analysis. This will set an expectation as to how you also will engage the market. The more confluence you have, the more confidence you have in your trade and analysis.  That's how you will grow as a trader. Creating your own convictions and practicing your decision-making processes.",

The only time news influences the price if its seriously related on the fundamentals of coin like hack, acquisition and so on but not all news will give a necessary price action because most of them is just recycled or a minor changes on the project especially on crypto.Let's use the Feds interest rate news as example. Regardless of what the news about the interest, BTC keep pumping even though it heavily affects the price before when this kind of news first release. People is already used to it so it doesn't gave much impact to all the traders to consider it on price analysis. Technical analysis is use for long term since news is not available most of the time. TA is more reliable of you want a better trade. Stop loss is being use to counter those sudden orice action due to the surprise news.",

Real reason is because of technical indicators show that the market must have a big change so news is released to direct the market to what it should move. Do you see like after a market has its big movements, hours later you will see some articles on Coindesk, Cointelegraph and other sites to make it like there are reasons for the latest big movement. It is to make people think that the market is actually moving naturally. In fact it moves by manipulation from Market makers.",

It's news that cause fear in minds of investors, and they start bulk selling to avoid losses which results into the crash of market. There are many investors who purely invest in crypto based on news, if the news media shows that a coin is going to pump then investors blindly follow that news and start investing millions of dollars into that coin. Once a coin is bought in high volumes then next game is automatically done by bots of exchanges by bulk selling.But, we can not underestimate the importance of indicators as they are crucial in crypto trading. In Bitcoin trading indicators work and if the trading is done with a professional plan, a well developed strategy, then you can gain enough profits with the help of those indicators. The market is mostly controlled by whales who hold a lot coins, and if they start bulk selling then those indicators can save you.",

While technical indicators can provide valuable insights into market trends and price movements, news and events can also have a significant impact on the market.For example, news about regulatory changes, partnerships, or new developments in a project can cause significant price movements in the market. Similarly, negative news or events can cause a drop in prices.Both technical indicators and news are important factors to consider when analyzing the crypto market. It is important to have a well-rounded understanding of the market and to consider multiple factors when making investment decisions.",

Technical indicators and news can be your trusty sidekicks, but there's no failsafe in this high-stakes realm.That said, I'm inclined to concur that news can pack a heftier punch than those pesky technical indicators. Sometimes, a single headline can spark a seismic shift in sentiment, igniting a flurry of buy or sell orders.However, let's not forget that news can be as erratic as a squirrel on espresso.

When compared to technical indicators, people are too skeptical of this and they are not even worried about what it showed there. Pretty too different in how they respond to the news. That is why traders are not just active in the market movements but also are following the current news especially when some influential person talks about the future of crypto.",

Both are useful but fundamentals can easily crush or help the technical analysis. There are instances that fundamentals aligns with the technical analysis. There are times that patters need a heavy push for it to materialize and sometimes FUDS or good news helps it. There are also instances that a big fud or fomo can affect the long awaited pattern by disrupting it with a heavy buying and selling pressure because of the news. I believe that both will be helpful to you depending on how you use it and how you see both type of analysis.",

News leads to movement in the market that changes the technical indicators. You can grossly say that news is the cause and the market movement is the effect which can be quantified by the technical indicators. But to be honest, you cant always rely on technical to start a trade, if you see a bullish trend setting in buy and hold before the indicators show the same, this comes from practice.But there will be news that might never move the market, usually it is the case with the positive news while negative news grossly bring down the market.",
