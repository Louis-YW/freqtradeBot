      "body": "I like independence be it political, economical or social because it give people the freedom to control their own destiny. And that's what Bitcoin stands for; freedom through decentralization. It also a good thing that the government of indonesia is becoming flexible towards Bitcoin and other cryptos. I am also expecting that in the nearest future Bitcoin would become a legal tender in your great country. I hope you are having a good time with family and friends because I am sure that today would be a public holiday. Happy independence to all my indonesian bitcoiners.",

      "body": "Nothing is as important as celebrating an independence day with freedom throughly indeed in financial system, we atimes lay claims on what we are not, if we are to go by the preference of the people then we can all see that bitcoin adoption is their target, even though the government refused to see that, but everyone has taken it a personal responsibility to find a lasting solution in this through bitcoin in their finances and economic affairs, but we must also not neglect the benefits some countries had on bitcoin and how it legalizes the uses despite their failure for adoption, i think this is also another freedom indeed acquired.",
