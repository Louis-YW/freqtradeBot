It's like I don't believe that Roulette is the reason why gambling is so alive. Because for me the casino via casino slots is alive and well, yes almost all casinos indeed have roulette but of course there are many options for gamblers to play so that gambling platforms have life.So for me, not just one casino game can give color to every casino game in this crypto industry.",

It's always been a challenge for casino, but I don't see it taking over like the P2E that you are describing. It's good that we have alternatives like that, but there will be some time that this kind of games are going to be boring and so gamblers will have to find a way and so they will go back to the traditional games that offers more excitement like Roulette.P2E might exist together with some casino games, but as I have said, I doubt that they will make a big push to challenge what we have been playing for many years, casino slots, dice and other card games.",

Play to earn games is too grindy, and I don't think a lot of people will have the time to grind it out to get something off of the opportunities that they are getting. Casinos will never go out of business because they are offering fast and efficient entertainment to people who has the money that are looking to multiply it by gambling. Play to Earn remains to be a field that is a hit or miss, and most of the time it's a miss because not everyone has the time in the world to earn cents/a few dollars for hours on end.",

Play to earn games are not gambling though, because that is a sure profit while in gambling you will always depend on your luck.I don't think this is a good comparison because they are both different, Roulette is a game of luck and we have this game since then. If there's another surge for play to earn games then it can be good, you just need to consider how much you will invest with them and know your when is the ROI, again play to earn games is an investment while gambling is not.",

It's a bigger challenge for new p2e projects to maintain profitability and if the P2E game couldn't bounce back to its popularity, it will die. The competition between casinos and other businesses in crypto like P2E is getting tougher, projects die especially if they didn't innovate including the casinos.",

Some that do pop off are great initially, but in the long term, you'd be earning peanuts from them. Though tbf I hardly doubt P2E would ever combat casinos for users, gamblers are just different. P2E doesn't work the same way as casinos. Instead, they're grindy, they require thinking, a strategy for each activity, and a major investment as well in most cases. Yes, I agree to an extent that casino games are too limited compared to the number of possibilities other games have, but if you also look at it from another angle, even though a LOT of games have come out, these games are still famous among gamblers. Why? Because in the first place, the highest interest that they have in the activity is not the games but the attraction of earning more money with just luck or at least, the majority of it, in one single go.",

It is important to note, however, that the casino industry is a highly regulated and established market that has already proven to be resilient in the face of new technologies and competition. Furthermore, many people enjoy the social and immersive experience that playing in a casino provides, which may be difficult to replicate in a play to win game. while P2E games are popular, they are not yet perfected and still have many flaws, such as tokenomics issues and a lack of regulation. as a result, it is difficult to predict what will occur.",

Play to earn is not that big as it sounds in my opinion, yes they are here but it won't put a dent on games that have been established already like roulette games. It's very easy to play with little knowledge, as compare to this whole new play to earn wherein there is learning curve.
