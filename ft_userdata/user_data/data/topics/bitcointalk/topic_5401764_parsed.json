  "content": "The most unique topic you found on the bitcointalk forum? (effective, funny, horror, dramatic, smartest , heroic and other) I can't stop staring at this unique thread. this is new to me. but maybe outdated for those of you who have been on bitcointalk for a long time. This really makes my heart, which was originally wrinkled, become neat again like a shirt finished in an iron. and didn't expect this to be a historic thread hahahaha. and I think this thread is also the thread with the shortest but fun set of replies as far as I've found.Link : I AM HODLING by GameKyuubifound a thread that you find your version unique?let go of the burden of the mind for a moment and let's have fun",

And also the new rank requirements which includes karma that is also an April fools joke. I'm sure many are shock to see that there is a new rank requirements in Bitcointalk forum and doesn't like it (for others). Having KYC in the forum defeats the purpose of anonymity and freedom to prefer being anonymous. I can't imagine what others might think that KYC is mandatory.",

      "body": "The threads I've seen listed here (at least by members I don't have on my ignore list) are more iconic than unique....though obviously a thread can be both. Â But there's already a thread about iconic threads, so I wanted to share a few bizarre/funny ones from the past. Â Maybe they're not unique, but the members who started them were either absolute ball busters or raving lunatics.Haven't seen many members in either of those categories in a while, have we?Â Â Â Â Calling out the premier scam on Havelock at the moment by MPOE-PR. Â MPOE-PR was banned by the time I registered on the forum, but I remember his/her posts from my lurking days of 2014. Â I think he's a \"he\" but that profile pic kind of confuses things. Â Anyway, he had a talent for writing as well as taking other members down several notches, which I consider to be a rare talent around here.Â Â Â Â Petition to have Spoetnik banned. by Fwdxlsh. Â He was a member who appeared like a thundering troll storm in 2015 and got banned (or disappeared) not long after. Â The thread above is just one of his insane ramblings, and personally I find it nostalgic that it's about Spoetnik, a member who haunted the altcoin section for a looong time and who had an ongoing--and serious--feud with Vod. Â Probably not as serious as the one Vod had with OgNasty, but I remember being astonished at how heated their arguments got. Â OK, I popped a boner, but that was years ago and I came here for the lulz, drama, and uncensored bad words. Â Runner up from Fwdxlsh is this gem: Dear BitcoinTalk: PLEASE LEAVE MRKLYE ALONE. Heh heh.And his final thread before he sailed off the flat edge of Earth: Coinman1 real thread. Erasing posts to make him look like a freaking saint! by mixan.Mixan used to be just a normal member as far as I could tell, and then something happened (and I don't remember the details and didn't look it up before posting this) and he just snapped. Â And when I say \"snapped\" I mean other members were concerned about his mental health and were trying to figure out what his beef was. Â He mentioned me in the OP of the thread above, but I just don't recall the details. Â Ah...I do remember that he wanted to give me his account before he signed off the forum for good, but I demurred. Â I was actively tagging anyone involved in account buying/selling/trading, and there was no way in hell I was going to take possession of his.None of the members who started the threads above or who were referenced in them are around anymore (MRKLYE for instance, who ran a porn site IIRC), but all of them added their own flavor of spice to bitcointalk. Â Not everyone liked the various flavors, but it did make for an interesting broth--much more so than we have currently.",
