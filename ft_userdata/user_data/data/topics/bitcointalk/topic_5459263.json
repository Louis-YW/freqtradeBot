Newbies dont get a loan and that is totally understandable.I would also do the same and I understand the rules. Nobody would give away their money and \"maybe\" get money back.No collateral = No loan as a newbie.",

Dealing with cryptocurrencies for long does than guarantee that you will pay the loan back.",

He probably woke up just to request a loan because, after applying for the loan, he last came online on the 11th and has not shown up online again till now. I assume he probably needed the loan so he could zoom off again; perhaps he's got no reputation here, so he has nothing to lose.The guy must be a big dreamer, I guess.",
