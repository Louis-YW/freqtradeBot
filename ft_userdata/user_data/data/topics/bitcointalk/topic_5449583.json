  "content": "We all know China banned Bitcoin and altcoin trading first. Next they went ahead and banned miners. After that they rolled out their own digital Yuan. Which I am afraid did not succed as expected by CCP. Now suddenly they are allowing HK to go ahead with crypto and become a hub of Bitcoin as well as Altcoin economy. The biggest bank in HK a few days back declared that they will support crypto. I mean what do you guys think is going around with this decision of China. As per my understanding HK has become a shadow control colony of China. Which was not what they had promised to UK. This situation could become a problem for USA and it's allies in the future. Already we can see big companies (banks) in the US are now buying shares of Microstrategy, whereby they are indirectly investing in Bitcoin. As they now realize the potential of Bitcoin. Does that mean China is utilizing this negative situation in the US on crypto to its favour or they are just testing the possibilities in order to regulate it. Do remember this is how China became the 2nd larget economy in just 20 years.",

If you regulate it 1st, people will do something else. That makes it harder to control so to speak. If you are doing 'A' and the government comes in and says you have to do 'A' this way, assuming you are a legitimate business, work the way the government wants.

As per my understanding HK has become a shadow control colony of China. Exactly, That's what they also call it, \"One Country, two System\" I have no idea what promise did china made with UK about cryptocurrency (if you could shed some more light on it please) but i can see Hong Kong is the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of china which has some rules, which might give you an idea of two systems and one country statement. Following are some things from which HK is independent:Quote1. Hong Kong and China maintain a border. Chinese nationals require permits to visit Hong Kong.2. Hong Kong dollar is official currency, The Chinese Reminibi is not accepted in Hong Kong, expect in a handful of stores. 3. The Hong Kong dollar is not legal tender in China.4. Hong Kong has wholly separate legal system (common law system).5. Hong Kong maintains its independent executive, legislative and judiciary powers. So for example any requests for arrest or extradition are carried out as a matter of international, not internal law.Source Point number 4 represents the main story behind your query like that's why China had made a separate SAR so that they can test out different possibilities of accepting cryptocurrency. As I don't think the Chinese can use cryptocurrency indirectly by privileging the legalization of crypto in HK, because both systems have different currencies and when you will change your Chinese Yuan to HK dollar then maybe you will be audited for its usage. Strict rules, As china is involved in \"BRICS\" and is considered as the main pillar among them so I don't think a country that supports innovation will be left behind even in cryptocurrency, in the war against the US dollar. So, It's in there favor to legalize crypto in HK and then encouraging their BRICS currency in crypto instead of US dollar.",

I do think China would eventually make HK a hub of cryptocurrency. Go back and recheck what China started with and what it did in 2021-22. They bluffed the US in 2000 and again they are bluffing using HK as an alternative option. They know they cannot lie straight on the face and therefore they have already given a full node with the biggest HK bank. Do look into the timeline you will find the answers.",

I think that the whole thing is still in a very early stage and that it will take some time for the digital yuan to be integrated into their financial system - but I have no doubt that they will manage to do it the way they want, because no one asks ordinary people for their opinion, nor whether they want something or not.

The biggest bank in HK a few days back declared that they will support crypto. It seems to me that there is a lot of mention of \"crypto\" and too little of \"Bitcoin\", and this only means that the \"Chinese\" are much more lenient towards what can be controlled. However, how many times in the last 5 years have I read that some city or country wants to become a \"crypto hub\", so many times I have convinced myself that wishes are one thing, and reality something completely different. I don't know who would even agree to go to HK and start a serious business while the sword of the communist party hangs over his head at all times.Quote from: elevates on April 20, 2023, 01:58:32 PMDoes that mean China is utilizing this negative situation in the US on crypto to its favour or they are just testing the possibilities in order to regulate it.

The Chinese have seen how the world is turn towards crypto and the SEC having regulation problems with exchanges this is certainly a big move by the Chinese government.

I can't remember the new commission they have come up though so maybe that new commission will eventually make regulatory clarity before Coinbase moves to Europe.It's all up to the US government if they continue to push crypto companies away from the US, it will really prove that China is beating the West even in crypto.
