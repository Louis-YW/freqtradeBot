Don't trust the CEO, always look at the project or coin you were going to buy, CEO are not permanent they can be replace by someone who is better, use case of the token and future are the vital, with SBF he is just a front person we don't know who is behind him, maybe government, we don't know, the collapse of the token from what i read is his fault and some people.",

It only worsens the world's crypto business. He became poisonous to the government and society. It is difficult to create trust in the government and society that is in the process of developing. He will only turn off the financial resources for the life of him and his family, maybe he will also be hated by the people of the world. I'm sure not all CEOs are as cunning as he is. They should be conscious for long-term growth. He didn't think that the crypto industry could be ruined because of his actions. Imprisonment will not refund the losses of FTX users. The government should punish and seek refunds belonging to FTX users even though their value has dropped sharply.",

Trust only yourself and don't believe on people giving such word of wisdom either they are CEO or a investment coach since all words they say is always in favor to them and they have personal agenda for saying that. They always make people believe so that they can influence them so much better always trust your instinct about investments also do your research always so that you will not get bait for what shady activities they do.",

It should be Proof-of-Work, not Proof-of-Stake, not Smart Contracts.PoS is very inflationary and Smart Contracts have things for developers to do their rug pulls such as minting millions or billions of token from the air. With Proof-of-Work, their CEOs, their developers can not do that.Only Proof of Work is not enough. It should also have real decentralized network which is strong with high total hashrate like Bitcoin.I don't see people discuss about importance of halving period. In my opinion, it should be long enough, not too short, not too long. Because the market needs enough long period to complete its psychological cycle. If halving happens each month, each quarter, each 6 months, each year, it won't be long enough for market psychology to complete.Satoshi Nakamoto is (are) genius by choosing 4 years for each halving.",

This is the final way for SBF and its accomplices, so that they can be prosecuted in the fairest way possible for their actions which have harmed many people. But about some founders who haven't been arrested like DoKwon, of course it takes quite a bit of effort to catch them and there should also be a lot of reports coming in about the CEO's crimes. currently Do Kwon is still a fugitive and the latest news that I know is Do Kwon hiding in Serbia, the South Korean Ministry of Finance is seeking cooperation with Serbia to facilitate Do Kwon's investigation.",

Losing faith in them was unavoidable due to their bad reputation in the end, it definitely made the trust score in the industry even worse than said.Bitcoin is very different, but because of the thousands of failed altcoin projects and crypto CEO, people out there are choosing to come to the same conclusion that crypto is the easiest part to lose money on including bitcoin. But for everyone in the know, bitcoin is not what they say it is. Bitcoin is a decentralized asset without having to rely on other assets like altcoin, but the current CEO of altcoins and crypto have melted a lot of faith in the industry in general.",

What happens is that many people buy shitcoins like betting on roulette at the casino, they want to make a quick 100x to get out of their shitty life, instead of plotting a more boring but safer plan to improve their economic situation, and in that plan not even just the Bitcoin, although it is obviously part of it.",

SBF being in jail doesn't solve anything or fix the loss of the people that are affected by the FTX issue and it's also not the problem either. The problem is that most cryptocurrency investors ignore the fundamental concept provided by Satoshi when he introduced Bitcoin because his idea was to create crypto that will give people liberation and the needed power/right the common man not people making the same mistake they did with institutional banking.What I see about the SBF issue is the modern replication of institutional banking scams in the cryptocurrency market and what I fear the most the issue is the Feds, and SEC will introduce into the crypto market which lead to high implementation of KYC and regulation just like we see when ICO scam was numerous then.In the meantime, people need to wake up and understand that 98.9% of all altcoins are created to enrich the CEO and his team.",

Actually shitcoin could not be identified from the top altcoin section such as FTT even the FTX exchange with the highest trading volume was in the second top exchange position after binance but in the end it was known that it was only a scam project and also Luna shitcoin.
