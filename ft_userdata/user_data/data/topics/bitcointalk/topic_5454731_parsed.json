THE BEING BLOCK HAS INDEX = 1, THE SAME AS THE ONE FOLLOWING IT. SO IN THIS BLOCKCHAIN ​​THERE ARE TWO BLOCKS WITH IDENTICAL INDICES, BUT WITH DIFFERENT CONTENT. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NORMAL AND THIS IS THE FEATURE OF THIS BLOCKCHAIN. A unique mining system is implemented here, which stimulates a smooth increase in the value of the coin, preventing it from falling much with the onset of winter and is resistant to strong volatility, but at the same time the value increases. For mine, you need to go to localhost:8082/, multithreading is automatically turned on there and the number of threads is automatically turned on. Then go back to the menu in the top right corner and click on “Get Locked”, click on the “Start” button and then click on “International Union Corporation”, in the information window you should see “Is Mining Proper”. the update is also correct, which means that the system is loading the blockchain. Nothing will be displayed in the console, because if we display information there, mining will slow down six times for single-threaded and multi-threaded mining. If you want to turn off mining, click the “Stop” button twice, then click on the Corporation Intertation Union inscription, if everything stopped correctly, the information window will disappear. Under no circumstances should you interrupt the mining process by disabling the command line during mining or updating, as at this point the Blockchain and balance will be overwritten. When the information window goes out, mining will stop. A block is valid if the hash matches the target value according to this formulaInstructions:In the get a block tab (http://localhost:8082/mining) you can make staking or withdraw money from staking. By filling in all fields. NOTE: IMPORTANT!!!!!! IF YOU CALL http://localhost:8082/testCalculate in the console you will see a list of accounts, and the balance there is different. Be sure to report this to the server owner, since the balance either on your wallet or on the server is not displayed correctly and he will not be able to send money. look at the picture. If the server owner has discovered this problem, then he should update the resources folder and you don’t have to worry, if the problem is with the server, all the owners are exceptional professionals and know their stuff. P.S. (At the moment, in addition to the founder, you can also contact @suprtrupr and @caspar2114 on discord, since they are one of the best in these matters and can help you when I don’t have time.)Important Information:In this system, the block with the most big random wins. Big random is a number that is formed from three components. 1. Difficulty 2. Random number 3. staking up to index 247867, each difficulty level gave 9 points. difficult * 9. after 247867 each difficulty level gives 55 points. Difficult * 55. up to index 247867 hash as a seed could give a number from 0 to 55. after 247867 hash as a seed, it gives a number from 0 to 135. up to index 247867, initial staking cost 1 coin, first point. After the index 247867, initial staking costs 10 coins, the first point. Now in more detail: this is the formula by which a single score is calculated. int result = deterministicRandom.nextInt(limit); result = (int) ((int) (result + (actual.getHashCompexity() * waight)) + calculateScore(miner.getDigitalStakingBalance(), number) 1. Difficulty. Each participant can choose the difficulty from 17 to 100. Each block has a hash, where the sum of the ones in bits must be equal to or lower than the target. The goal is calculated as 100 - difficulty (100 minus difficulty.). Each difficulty level gives 55 points. That is, if you set the difficulty to 20, then the difficulty points will be equal to 20 * 55 = 1100. 2. Random number. The hash of the block becomes the seed to generate a random number from 0 to 135. 3. Staking. Each subsequent point costs twice as much and is calculated using this formula: public static long calculateScore(double x, double x0) { if (x <= 0) { return 0; } double score = Math.ceil(Math.log(x / x0) / Math.log(2)); return Math.min(400, (long) score); } but this number cannot be more than 400. All points from the three parameters are summed up. Each node (server) selects one block with the highest number of points every 100 seconds. Afterwards, each node contacts random 7 nodes and compares the total big random (of all blocks of a given blockchain) of your blockchain and the blockchain of another node. If on another node the total big random is greater than on yours + the complexity of the last block, then your server will delete blocks up to the intersection point, and will add blocks of this node. The difference between blocks must be at least 100 seconds. The mining reward is calculated using the formula (5+coefficient + (difficulty * 0.2)) * multiplier. Where the multiplier is 29, but decreases by one each year until it reaches 1. The multiplier can be 0 or 3; For it to become equal to 3, two conditions must be met. 1. The sum of all transactions in the current block must be greater than in the previous block, excluding the founder's reward and the miner's reward. 2. The number of different senders in this block must be greater than in the previous block, not counting the base address from which the reward is sent to the founder and miner. http://94.87.236.238:82/winners this URL shows the last winner on this node, but does not show the winner if it was taken from another server and to see the last final winner you need /prevBlock P.S. (before this index 187200, the reward was also different and the details are Mining and UtilsUse).History:Story: a special block was created on index 24281, with the help of which we created 12,000,000 coins and these coins were given to the participants, since the blockchain was broken by an attack in 40 days and with the help of this address jPjuyLStHTCzwYt9J7R5M7pGUKshfcmEbtE3zVvCBE52 this money was returned to all participants who lost their coins. The bug in the code that allowed this attack was also finally fixed, and now the system is completely safe. Story: Starting from the index int V34_NEW_ALGO = 187200, the difficulty is selected by participants from 17 to 100. Before this index, the complexity algorithm changed and its details are in the UtilsBlock class method difficulty. Before this index, the mining algorithm also changed. Before index 151940, the mining algorithm was also different and the details are in the Block class as well as in related classes, UtilsUse.Scoring Table:Score   Minimum value `x` + 11   112   213   414   815   1616   3217   6418   12819   256110   512111   1024112   2048113   4096114   8192115   16384116   32768117   65536118   131072119   262144120   524288121   1048576122   2097152123   4194304124   8388608125   16777216126   33554432127   67108864128   134217728129   268435456130   536870912131   1073741824132   2147483648133   4294967296134   8589934592135   17179869184136   34359738368137   68719476736138   137438953472139   274877906944140   549755813888141   1099511627776142   2199023255552143   4398046511104144   8796093022208145   17592186044416146   35184372088832147   70368744177664148   140737488355328149   281474976710656150   562949953421312151   1125899906842624152   2251799813685248153   4503599627370496154   9007199254740992155   18014398509481984156   36028797018963968157   72057594037927936158   144115188075855872159   288230376151711744160   5764607523034234881",
