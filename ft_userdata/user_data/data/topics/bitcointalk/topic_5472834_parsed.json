There are a couple of them going on and some potential ones about to start. Each could take place in a different duration.QuoteI think the next year the war will be expanding despite the middle east war i don't see bull run for crude OIL i see crude oil prices to fall slowly over the next weeks and months and until 2028 year i don't see bull run for crude oil.If war breaks out in middle east West Asia and North Africa there is simply no way for oil to stay down. It will shoot to the moon because all the oil facilities in two dozen countries would be devastated and the shortage alone is enough to quadruple the price.BTW if this is one of the wars you were saying in previous section, it is highly unlikely to last that long (2027-2029). It will most probably end in a matter of months.Quote from: Blackrocket on November 04, 2023, 03:21:33 PMOn the short term i have placed my long and spot buy orders for btc 32222$ Im expecting to see that price in 2 days.~~for my work and dedication and years of reareach of markets ~~I guess your buy orders never got filled since price remained above $34k (2 days later!) and then it started shooting up instead 3 days after you started your topic. You should add that to your \"years of research\" and experience.",

      "body": "The petrodollar agreement supported the dollar for long periods, but in recent years the influence of the United States and the distribution of the dollar and US bonds in all central bank reserves makes it an independent currency from oil and does not need it. Therefore, indeed, we have oil, the dollar, and gold, and all of them may not be completely linked to each other.Shale oil mining and the huge quantities of oil in Venezuela will prevent oil prices from rising beyond $150 per barrel.",

It's always interesting to hear different views on the market trends. I'm curious about your thoughts on the reasons behind the potential fall in crude oil prices.Also, good luck with your short-term strategy on BTC! Quick moves can be exhilarating.I know about btc also off course, for crude oil simple there is reason more supply then demand also a lot smaller investors \"net long\"positions it was good to take their money by bigger ones like blackrock...but Im blackrocket.You can have look myÂ  upcoming hedge fund.Hedgefund for average people https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5471931.new#new",
