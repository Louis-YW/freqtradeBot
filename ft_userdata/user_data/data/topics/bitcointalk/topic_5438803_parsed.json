  "content": "Since independence violence has been a frequent practice and nearly every general election held in Nigeria has been affected by violence. My mother used to tell me stories of how people are fighting and killing themselves, so ever since I was a young child when an election is approaching i always had this fear. A lot of bad things happen during election which results to loss of lives and properties.My people! As Election day is quickly approaching with only a few days left. I've heard reports and seen evidence in my community of politicians using some young people as weapons of violence. Let everyone know that no matter what we do, our lives are much more valuable than the meager sums of money we are given to use as justification for violence against others.Let everyone know that voting is about exercising one's freedom to choose their candidates, not battling someone else because they did not vote for their preferred candidate. Please let know our point of view can never be the same, with that I don't see any reason why we should let politicians use us as a tool of violence.Please i urge my fellow youths to refrain from letting any politician take advantage of us and we should turn out in large numbers on election days to cast our votes for the betterment of this country. As we all pray for free and fair election may we all witness it. Amen",

It's left for us to work towards the change we talk about; the youth have always been the politicians' targeted audience for violence, electoral property destruction, and ballot box hijacking. Unless those who are always involved in election crises decide to change on their own, there is nothing that we say here that is going to add any positive change.",

The thing we all Nigerians most especially the youths needs to know is this fights is against bad government and not against ourselves because even the politicians we are fighting for are mostly friends.No learned and exposed man would get themselves involved in election violence and thuggery. I believe as an educated man, you are fully aware of the tenets of democracy and therefore would not want  to do or get involved in anything that would smear your image, name and reputation for just some peanuts. Just as you have noted that people who mostly get themselves involved in election crisis are mostly illiterates who have no value for human life. They easily sell their conscience and allow the politicians do their bidding into them. I have come to realize something that most of these acts are encouraged and led by the so called PA\"s, SA\"s and what have you that were assigned by their various bosses to lead these thugs to the polling units for their actions and they do this things with the mindset that their bosses would release them and that is the case. They release immediately via seconds after phone call. I will advise each and everyone eligible voter to go out and vote, after voting you adjust and watch while  you  wait for your vote to be counted but if otherwise, my people safeguard yourselves o. No life is worth losing in the cause of vooting for a politician that would not even want to hear your name when they get into power. Be wise!",

In my estimation, it is high time Nigerian youth said a big NO to any politician who wants to use them during the forthcoming election to cause trouble. because the politicians will only remember the youth during elections. The moment they are in power, the youth will be forgotten again. I see no reason to fight for those who are unable to provide job opportunities for graduates or security for their citizens. They all leave their families abroad, leaving the poor masses to suffer in Nigeria.
