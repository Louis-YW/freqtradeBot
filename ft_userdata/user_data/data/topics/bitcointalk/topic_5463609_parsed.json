That way, you could safely set aside money for investments that would not be affected when emergency pops up. Folks living in countries with seemingly better economies are also riddled with inflation, bills and responsibilities as well. And without having side jobs to try to stay afloat, just anyone would be tempted to sell off some of their bitcoin holdings.",

      "body": "That is why it is necessary to transfer into bitcoin only free and extra money that will not be needed in the near future, that is, for a long time. Because investing in bitcoin shows good returns in the long term (~ 4-5 and up). It turns out that this money is frozen for this period in order to obtain the greatest profit. In countries with difficult economic situations, people have less free money than in economically strong countries, which creates a situation that it will be easier for the latter to buy and store bitcoin. No wonder. I think that nothing can be done about this and the imbalance can't be eliminated in any way. This is how the market economy works and for residents of poor countries, the way out can be to move to more economically strong countries / change jobs or try to strengthen the economy in their country by creating good working enterprises, jobs and other things. That is, it is necessary to look for ways to create extra free money.",

And also a lot of people might no invest at Bitcoin at all due to every money they have would go straight to their essential needs. If you really have the \"diamond hands\" since we all know that long term investment is really a good benefit in Bitcoin, then you'll be needing to have extra money or your savings as well to help you survive that economy issue. I don't really advise it due to savings could be used to emergencies cause you might get focused on having a better life in the future so due to holding Bitcoin than selling, your current state might worsen. If you want to save your money in a bad economic situation investing at Bitcoin is good but if you're trying to survive due to having no enough money to support your needs, then selling is the option.",

The more you have the more you invest and the less you have, you plan yourself so you don't over investment and it causes you discomfort when the market is dipping. Don't invest more than you can lose, always know your limit and invest just enough so you don't miss out.They types of salary we're receiving or jobs we're doing will influence how much we can spare to invest in Bitcoin and that's a fact but don't use because you're receiving less to prevent yourself from investing in Bitcoin, plan yourself and reserve some savings for investing.",

What do you think?I can not agree more with you but the statement I bolded to that I am not agreed. Because If you are living in the UK, USA, or any other well-developed country then you will also say these types of statements:We have to pay a lot on taxes and bills.Life is too expensive here.I prefer others to move to other countries where life is easier.etc, etc, The thing is, one finds life much easier and cheap in other countries but only in those countries which are developing means if You as a citizen of the UK or USA want to live a day in Pakistan then you only need 5 to 10$ maximum of $30 dollars for food, transport, internet connections, etc., etc. (just take it as an example) but if you are in the USA you have to spend way more in the same way. If you are in the USA you are earning $100 a day or $50 dollars a day but if you are earning in Pakistan that's $5 or $10 a day. So, that's how people began to think that their country is not a cheap one for them but they tend to move to countries which are cheaper then there.",

What do you think?I don't think it's all about the bad economy though, I mean we have been under the pandemic and survived holding our bitcoin, (at least in my case), that is the period wherein I accumulated a lot of bitcoin. Maybe the price is cheap that time or maybe you can't do anything but to save it.So for me it's not about how bad the economy is, sure if might have been affecting people to sell their stash to survived. But my point is that if we survived before and after the pandemic, what's the difference from it today? If you can save during that time and have the mental discipline then you can do it at this point, in my opinion.",

Bitcoin investing is something we must prepare for, and while doing so, we must consider the difficult times so that our objectives are not affected. That is why we usually recommend using DCA for investment, especially for persons with a monthly or weekly income, although it is not compulsory. As a result, if your profit is affected or your source of income is no longer sufficient to pay your bills, you can abandon investment and focus on your life.QuoteHolding your bitcoins has a lot to do with discipline truly, but discipline is harder to practice when you are being suffocated and suffering financially with plenty bills and responsibility to respond to.

I think as long as you buy Bitcoin whenever you have the chance, both financially and literally, you are doing the smart thing. And anyway, spending money is the very point of money.

However the excess reaches a limit and often goes too far, which means that banks start to call in loans, while making it harder to qualify for new credit when many people are losing their jobs during a recession. People will naturally cash in certain assets if it means protecting things like their home from repossession. What good is having a wallet with bitcoin in it, if the bank are threatening to take away the home you have mortgaged and will eventually own if you can keep up repayments?
