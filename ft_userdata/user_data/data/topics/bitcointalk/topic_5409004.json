I’m not update on Joe Biden solution but I’m just basing my comment on the increasing CPI points every month.All the war that involves Russia and Ukraine is not directly involved US. How come Joe Biden will make it stop while they are not the direct opponent of this 2 countries. They already throw a lot of sanctions just to stop Russia but nothing happened. I’m interested  to know if you have a solid explanation on how you come up with this theory.",

I’m interested  to know if you have a solid explanation on how you come up with this theory.Becouse usa is biggest guy on the block right now they show themselfes as weak becouse the smart ones the wall street ones want cheap usa dollars now.But every country listen usa otherwise usa will make justice if putin dont listen joe biden then nato and usa will simply invade all russia with few days and putin will look like next sadam hussen or ghadaffi.China well china cant even taken seriously china politicial leaders are alliance with usa biden is boss in china Hunter biden also is influential person nobody dont argue with them much.Inflation not problem usa can direct inflation of dollar to other country there is ways to do this.",

      "body": "The op makes little sense. Biden argued that Putin must stop many times, and Putin didn't stop and is not planning to stop any time soon. China is in interdependent relations with the USA, but it also has some leverage, and China considers Taiwan its own territory, so it won't apologise for anything (while the US officially doesn't recognize Taiwan, by the way). Since the war won't stop so easily, sanctions won't stop either. Also, Russian gas and oil are barely under sanctions right now, and the EU is still paying a lot to get them, thus effectively sponsoring the war and helping it to last longer. Also, it's not like when the war stops, everything is suddenly well. Russia not only destroyed a lot of buildings in Ukraine, but also committed many war crimes, killed a lot of people. So paying for all that is also necessary, although, of course, no payment can bring back the people Russia killed. US will remain strong, with that I agree, but we're still in for a global recession, and the fact that China is alright with giving Russia tons of money for energy (China does not follow Western sanctions) means that China is actually in an advantageous position here, so its influence in comparison with the US might get bigger than it used to be.",

China ? China never gona go against usa china will close eyes like nothing happens.So its simple the western allies are so strong its impossible to fight against them.And usa is leader and joe biden playing as weak old men but biden is actually smart and sharp minded guy even smarter then trump wasAlso biden get along with all the wrstern leaders well",

      "body": "You clearly have not seen what happened in the past. Its not that easy to stop with just a single command and like they are all under Biden. These wars were even easily prevented in the first place but weren't prevented just like Pelosi being warned. But the Pelosi already have financial crime are held by the neck so Pelosi can't do anything but to do what bosses wants despite the warning. See it could really be prevented from happening like in Ukraine with  Kamala.Think of it like your In-laws minding what you do in your house that's sort of what Pelosi did although seem unproductive really. They purposely meant to have war.",

That won't happen because USA want to show superior to countries and Russia, China are part of the blocs giving a serious competition to them so stopping the war is to go back into uncertainty of superiority. The aspect of sale of arms also is a factor because when war is on some economies benefit from what arms they are producing for sell to countries in the war.",

If not for covid we'd have at least 5 more years of slow inflation in which governments would be able to slowly increase rates. Covid made people stay at home and save up for a while and then when everything opened up again they went back to spending with twice the force. Russia only managed to make worse things that were already bad.",

I don't think he would ever negotiate with putin and Russia. The dollar is really struggling to remain the major currency. I believe that the falling of dollar should impact the cryptocurrency market positively and bitcoin adoption will become easier.The world is also in the turbulent situation and economically there is a lot of disagreement because of the war in Ukraine which Biden has interest in.",
