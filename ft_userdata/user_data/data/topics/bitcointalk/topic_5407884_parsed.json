      "body": "Web3 technologies have allowed game developers to offer players a more immersive experience than ever before. With NFT-driven play-to-earn (P2E) games also known simply as “crypto games” players can own in-game assets like skins, weapons, digital accessories, characters, and virtual land in the metaverse, and trade these digital assets to earn financial rewards. Thanks to the P2E model, gamers are compensated for their skills and gaming companies are able to attract more players — it’s a win-win. With these innovations, games are more than just a means of entertainment. Let's join Robert Greig and Josh Jones, Co-Founders of Cornucopias with AdLunam team to discuss Future of NFTs, P2E and much more tomorrow at 3 PM CET on Twitter Spaces.https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqJVBqOkdVJB",
