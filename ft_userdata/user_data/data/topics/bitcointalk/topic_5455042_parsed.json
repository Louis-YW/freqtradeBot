You deposited on their casino hundreds of times and you knew they don't have a license, so why are you complain about it know!The first thing you need to do is to post the transaction ID of your big deposit then we need to verify the recipient address does indeed belong to Bustabit.",

Take a look at their TrustPilot its reviews everyone says its scam Â I've taken a look at their rating there but it's a mixed one, there were those saying it's legit and the ones that were saying that it's a scam were much likely angry because the fact that they've lost.You have already posted on their announcement thread with the same post as this on this section. So speaking for my experience when I've played there, I had never experienced any issues with them whether I'd lost or won some.",

That's the whole point of being provably fair: Anyone including yourself and anyone reading this thread can independently verify bustabit's fairness without taking my word for it.By calculating the SHA256 hash of each game you can verify that they are part of a chain and therefore predetermined, meaning they could not have reacted to how you bet. By calculating the corresponding multiplier for each game's hash you can verify that bustabit actually used the advertised reference function. And finally you can analyze this reference function to verify that the house edge is indeed 1%.Quote from: BrainSolution on June 04, 2023, 09:08:47 PM4. Most of players are Bots , and sometimes to get more people into it he claim that an user is profiting from using script like Lightguide user , so other people fall for it to deposit and try this scriptI do not play on bustabit, nor do I employ anyone to play on bustabit, use bots to play on bustabit or otherwise fake activity. It's impossible for me to prove that, but for players the game is provably fair regardless (see above).Quote from: BrainSolution on June 04, 2023, 09:08:47 PMI made over 100 times deposits there and lost them all one by one But recently i made a huge deposit and tried to Pre credit it over 5 times but didnt work so i needed to wait till the trasaction get confirmed on blockchain ,Â  Â When i login the next day to see if my deposit got confirmedTHERE IS NO DEPOSIT AT ALL AS IT HAS BEEN DELETED FROM OWNER send a ticket to solve it , and owner that there was not any deposit and the address of deposit has changed He tries to fool me , but how can i be fooled when i made over 100 deposits and know how bitcoin work very wellÂ  As I explained to you at length and multiple times in response to your support request, bustabit can only credit Bitcoin transactions sent to your deposit address after they are confirmed by the Bitcoin network. If a transaction does not send to your deposit address and/or is not confirmed by the Bitcoin network, bustabit has not received any money and cannot credit anything to your account. For details refer to your support request (the one in which you're threatening to post bad reviews every day if I don't pay you ðŸ˜‰).Quote from: BrainSolution on June 04, 2023, 09:08:47 PMif bustabit owner commet here i would ask just to Drop the Licence number of Curaco Anyother excuse will be to protectÂ  his scam way since 2013 yeah i made Report on all online FED sitesÂ  bustabit doesn't hold a license in CuraÃ§ao, though I fail to see how that's relevant in the context of provable fairness or deposits to bustabit. Players and investors trust bustabit because it has been operating honestly since 2014, not because some government in the Caribbean says they should.",

You can't expect people to blindly take your story without proper evidences, this is not how the scam accusation board works. We scrutinize over details here, asking both parties to give their sides with supporting evidences.Above me bustabit representative has given their answer. Amongst the long post exchanged between you and them, I understand correctly that your deposit did not went through, i.e. never goes into their wallet and never got any confirmation on blockchain? Can you please at least refute this by providing us the TX ID for that said deposit?",
