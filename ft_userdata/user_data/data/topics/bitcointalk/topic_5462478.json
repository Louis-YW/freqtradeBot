  "content": "Trezor, the company that created the world's first hardware wallet, has a new CEO and also plans to launch a new line-up of products. In this interview, Matej Zak talks about the Trezor Model R (codename Trezor R): a hardware wallet that will cost just as much as the Model One (~$70), offer 3 physical buttons, a USB-C connector, and native Shamir Secret Sharing support (SLIP39, which used to be exclusive for the more expensive Model T).Furthermore, it seems like Trezor is planning to support the Model One with firmware updates beyond the 10-year anniversary of the device. So even though new products will launch, the original will still get regular security patches. Something that's truly unique in the world of consumer electronics, where even giants like Apple and Google drop support after 5 years.Last but not least, Matej Zak talks about the Tropic Square open source secure element chip (which won't enter production sooner than the second half of 2024 and therefore can't become a part of a new hardware wallet until early 2025) and explains the rationale behind adding a Wasabi wallet integration for CoinJoins.Listen to the episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts & YouTube. I've also written an article about the interview and it includes all the links: https://bitcoin-takeover.com/s14-e3-matej-zak-on-trezors-new-hardware/",
