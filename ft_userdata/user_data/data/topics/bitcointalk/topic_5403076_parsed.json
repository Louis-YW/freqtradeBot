Please provide evidence.If you really hate someone and he's a terrible troll, that does not deserve negative feedback.\"The forum\" shows this is Trust abuse as it has nothing to do with trade risks:Theymos thinks this is Trust abuse:Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.Negative feedback isn't your diary.Now why this topic, I hear you ask? And why not just add Timelord2067 to my list of Trust exclusions? Because I like some/many of the feedbacks he sent! If only he'd omit the diary part, the remainder could be useful.It also helps I'm currently not on DT1, and Timelord2067's DT2-strength is (1). That means he'll need 2 Trust exclusions to be removed from DT2. I'll exclude him if this feedback is still negative by the time I win the DT1 lottery again.My earlier more subtle attempts didn't help:Quote from: LoyceMobile on June 09, 2022, 02:43:10 PMI'm surprised Timelord2067 is on DT again. That's a good moment to clean up bad ratings made in the past, and this is one of them.Quote from: LoyceV on June 11, 2022, 04:38:37 PM@Timelord2067: what's with the trust abuse on hilariousandalt?Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.It's ironic Timelord2067 accuses hilariousetc of Trust abuse.",

It is trust abuse and he should have removed it years ago.Timelord's petty vendetta against me goes back years and all started in the first place because I excluded him from my trust-list because of his often wildly inaccurate feedbacks he left on dozens of instances and as we can see that still continues to this day, but that's the best excuse he could come up with to leave negative feedback on me after extensively combing through my posts to try find something to justify his feedback system abuse after he became butthurt after another spat we had. His trust on me is also literally inaccurate because my comments were not homophobic. If anything you could maybe argue they were transphobic or whatever non-binary-phobic is, but it's neither of them because it was what is called a joke. I would encourage everyone to distrust ~Timelord2067 until he sorts his hypocritical abusive trust out.Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on June 18, 2022, 11:21:14 AMThis is about something that happened nearly two years ago.

Pro-tip: Timelord left that feedback two years ago on a post that was almost two years older than that so he had to do a lot of digging to find it. Maybe timelord should take heed instead of being a further hypocrite.",

I don't trust transphobes either, which is why I excluded hilariousandco and their alts.There is nothing transphobic about highlighting that the theory of the many genders you can constantly change is pure ideological garbage that does not hold up with a minimum of scientific rigor.And by the way, if what hilarious says is worthy of negative feedback or trust list exclusion, this should be too, because it goes along the same lines:QuoteUnfortunately, I think that you misunderstand the system. Given the trillions of different gender identities, we have adopted a coding system in which each gender identity is assigned a 64-bit number. For example, and only for illustration (I do not wish to presume your wingspan), Apache-attack-helicopter-gendered people would need to input the easy-to-remember code 0x9b68d151aeefa34f. In order to maintain compatibility with legacy systems, however, this is done by submitting the form multiple times with different genders. For example, in this case you would input Male Female Female Male Male Female Male Male Female Male Male Female Male Female Female Female Male Male Female Male Female Female Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Female Female Male Male Female Male Female Male Male Male Female Male Male Male Female Male Male Male Male Male Female Male Female Female Female Male Male Female Male Female Female Male Male Male Male. Simple! Now, it may seem discriminatory to assign Male 1 and Female 0, but not to worry! The coding is designed so that you can also input the inverse and get the same result. And to avoid left-handed bias, you can also enter it in opposite order. In fact, you can just put in whatever sequence of entries you want and the result will be the same.So you see, bitcointalk.org is in fact the most progressive website ever, and I am ashamed to live in a world in which this system isn't yet codified into law.",

THAT IS FEEDBACK.I think one of the reasons that there can be different ideas about how to use it.  The example you give here is not how I use the system (now,) and I tend to disagree with your approach.  It's my opinion that if I risk something in a trade, and the other member honors his obligation, that should result in a positive review for that member.  If the other person risks everything, and I honor my end of the agreement I still couldn't possibly know if I can trust the other individual if the rolls were reversed, so I don't leave a positive review.On the other hand, if you demonstrate proper use of the trust system, leave accurate, documented reviews, have shown good judgement in selecting your \"trusted\" inclusions and exclusions then I'm likely to add you to my trusted inclusions.  I don't care if you have any positive reviews or have done any trading at all.  It's my opinion that decisions about trust list inclusions/exclusions should be, to some degree detached from trade history.  Obviously overlaps will occur.Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.I have a feeling I should review my reviews for accuracy and adherence to this opinion.What really bothers me about this particular drama between hilariousetc and Timelord2067 is the death of humor.  It's pretty obvious that hilariousetal was making a joke about the applicable language, but I don't think it demonstrated any bias towards transgender people.  Much like thymos' post in the same thread.  I have close relatives and loved ones who are homosexual, and I don't see anything intentionally offensive in either post.Fitting to disuses this today, because I'm a sucker for bDad jokes (happy father's day to all you papas out there,) but I can also have a pretty sick and twisted sense of humor at times.  No body is safe, and in the same vane, neither am I.  I think more of us need be able to laugh at ourselves more, and not take our own convictions so seriously that we cannot see the absurdity of dogma that lurks within.",

Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on June 20, 2022, 09:11:54 AMTimeLord is just a troll, suffering from various drama which happened in his poor life and, as a consequence he is expressing here all his frustrations -- making an absurd accusation here, writing a false feedback there, lying for years that he is part of DT I wonder why he isn't posting any replies in this topic, he is obviously following what is happening and sending merits to things he likes.Giving negative feedbacks for someone else opinions just because you don't like them is so stupid and ridiculous.Maybe it's time for more DT members exclusions.Quote from: GazetaBitcoin on June 20, 2022, 09:11:54 AMI am not a trollI said before that Troll definition is unclear, so anyone can have their own interpretation, and since trolling is not allowed in forum anyone can report trolling posts.If I rememeber correctly, I don't think that I ever reported any post for trolling that resulted in them being deleted.",
