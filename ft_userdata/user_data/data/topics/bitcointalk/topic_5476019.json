  "content": "With this news just came out today, it says that Binance will be saying good bye to the Philippine traders and investors since SEC issued this ;QuoteThe removal of access in the Philippines, the SEC said in a statement, will take effect within three months of the issuance of its advisory on Nov. 28 to give Filipino users time to pull out investments from the crypto exchange.We have 3 months to pull out our assets so it won't be lose forever as this exchange will become inaccessible when the time lapse. This would have a big impact on the Philippine crypto traders as this exchange is currently the most popular exchange among traders, and personally, I love their p2p feature where I could easily sell my bitcoin and expect payment from local digital currency.

Can anyone shed a light on this?The country's SEC is as slow as a worm, and probably clueless, too. During those times when Binance was kicked out from one country to another, from Europe to Asia, because of operating without license, the Philippines was not reacting. There were requests for investigations on the platform's illegal operations in the country, I don't know what happened to those. They probably just sat down on them. If I'm not mistaken, emails pertaining to this aren't sent to users yet.

Using Binance through VPN from a country where it is banned is suicide. Binance has KYC as a matter of requirement. It's pointless to appear as if you're trading from Brazil when all your personal details point to a specific location in the Philippines.",

Would they track any Binance address and see if any of them is connected to local exchanges or something similar so that they can block the users or send them a notice?Another choice they can make is to buy a local exchange instead of building a new one. At least that's what happens in my country. Kinda sad to see if that happens though, since they're being very aggressive and laying off a ton of people just to save money so they get more profit.

Well, I guess this is the end of Binance uers in the Philippines. The fact that SEC had already come up this decision, I'm assuming that there were already notice before that was sent to Binance since they have been accepting Filipino traders for awhile now, so this decision is probably the non reversable. I just hope there will be a trading sites that is as good as Binance that existed in the Philippines, because I believe the reason why Filipinos loved to trade with Binance because the existing exchanges does not have a decent volume and the spreads aren't too competitive. Quote from: joniboini on December 01, 2023, 03:30:47 AMI'm curious about how they plan to block access to Binance other than blocking domains,I guess they'll leave this to the NTC (National Telecommunications Commission), and the latter will mandate the ISPs in the country to comply with the SEC issuance.",
