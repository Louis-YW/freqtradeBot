You can post your wallet id so that I can send the dollar to you. Your rank is not enough good but you have earned 50 merits within the last 120 days. So, I think you will not destroy your account for 100$/130$. Waiting for your wallet so that I can send the fund to your wallet.",

I have given 2 loans in btc base on USD values at the almost same time and on both, I am a loser. So, in the future I will give only USDT and receive USDT, and if other cryptos then repayment will be based on that crypto not based on USD value. Anyway, thank you very much for the early repayment. Neutral trust already removed.",
