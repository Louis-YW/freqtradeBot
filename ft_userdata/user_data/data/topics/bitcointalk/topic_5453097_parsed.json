      "body": "We have been requesting for a dedicated moderator for almost 3+ years but I don't think it is as easy as it seem to be. Bitcointalk is the oldest and most respected crypto forum on the internet and theymos considers a lot of factors before appointing some random internet stranger as a moderator. As bitcointalk involves with dealing of millions of dollars, this role can be easily abused by a stranger. On top of that, a moderator should have gained enormous amount of trust from the community and they should have significant \"Good\" report count on their account as well before even being considered for the role.eaLiTy is probably facing personal issues after the failure of FTX and we couldn't comment on their activity in the last few months. OTOH, Scammers have been targeting our board ever since the beginning and some way or the other we report these posts actively and the thread gets trashed immediately within a day.Quote from: Bureau on May 17, 2023, 02:19:44 PMI am ready to do it if consideredBe active for an year or two, gain trust from the community, prove that you won't abuse your position and more importantly report a lot of shitposts & threads for you to be considered for the role. P.S : If I'm not wrong @eaLiTy had a whooping 16k good reports at one point of time and for all this, he has been doing that selflessly without expecting anything in return.",

      "body": "As a community, our top priority is to promote active engagement and constructive discussions among all members. While the importance of having moderators to supervise and regulate forums cannot be overstated, it may not be the most pressing requirement at this moment. Given the minimal posts and discussions so far, having voluntary members who can regularly contribute and stimulate conversations would be of tremendous value. The objective is to have a vibrant, engaging, and helpful community, which in turn can attract more active members.However, we understand that the risk of fraudulent activity remains a possibility, which is why we have a global moderator who can intervene when needed. Therefore, if you happen to encounter any fraudulent or suspicious activity within the community, do not hesitate to report it to avoid further escalation.Together, we can build a thriving community that fosters healthy interactions and mutual growth.",

Secondly, if you read the rules of the forum, it is clearly stated there that scams on the forum are not moderated and if you or anyone else were to send a report to a moderator on this topic, you would most likely get a bad report. And it's not about having a moderator. Even if you had one, he wouldn't delete this topic.",

You should have read the replies on this topic by @elevates & @IIrik11 they were sufficient enough for the scammer to understand that the community is able to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong. Members, like you need to take ownership, like you did to prevent such topics from thriving on the board. At the moment we do not have a dedicated mod but the global mods are very active. I have reported topics from child boards and the main boards and global mods have taken the required actions. ¬†Few threads that can help you and other members to improve our boardReport plagiarism (copy/paste) here. Mods: please give temp or permban as neededReport Malware and Suspicious Links here so Mods can take Action !",

      "body": "Good! Members like you take ownership and unwanted content to the mods. I had earlier reported a few and left a reply post on this thread. That topic had a bunch of malware links, and it was quickly removed from the board.Not all topics contain bad links. The topic you were referring to was more suitable on the service board, but I guess it was targeted to the Indian community. For that reason, instead of reporting it to the mods, I preferred responding to it. I wanted newbies to read those replies left by me and IIrik11 so that no one falls for such pump & dump schemes anywhere else. Ultimately, if you had not reported it, I would have done it. It's a good thing you did, and I hope in the future, more active members on our board will do what is right for the board.",

Although very few are unhandled yet I have managed to report few posts and here's my historyCode:You have reported 127 posts with 96% accuracy (117 good, 6 bad, 4 unhandled)At least 25% would be in the Indian board alone. As far as moderation is considered, it's being done correctly for the posts we report.Only thing is that we don't have an active moderator which I think is not required as long as the engagement is low on this board.",
