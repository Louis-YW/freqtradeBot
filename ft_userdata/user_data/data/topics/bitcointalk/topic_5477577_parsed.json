Clean all Paths and install like on my old one.And what a miracle it work without doing something, or inserting something.For those who have maybe also Problems,1. download this VS 2015 iso from https://www.computerbase.de/downloads/systemtools/entwicklung/visual-studio-2015/ and install it.2. after this, install python 3.7 ( only this version work for me, maybe others need another one )pip install all what you need and also fastecdsa, this is how it works now on this main PC also.I first install Python 3.7 and then VS2015 also have errors.Only this way of order work, first VS2015, then Python.Maybe it helps some of you too.",

Why not you try to install the FastECDSA library manually?To do this, you will need to clone the repository then perform the following commands: Code:git clone https://github.com/AntonKueltz/fastecdsa.gitcd fastecdsapython setup.py installIf the issue persists, then you should reach out to the FastECDSA community or GitHub for further assistance.",

It is nothing cracked there, it's the Community edition. You can download mostly freeware Software, and older versions. Don't judge before you inform yourself, bad habit. Some don't like \"Free Accounts\", it's like why don't you do all your crypro with blockchain.com, it's a \"Free Account\", no i like to use a Mixer, without registration.",
