It is, in other words, too risky for a coin that doesn't have such an obvious performance. But I've also seen a lot of shitcoins rebound unexpectedly, so I just took this as a gamble and didn't pay too much attention to it. However, if I want to spend money on it, I will refuse, because I would rather spend money on other things that I feel serious about than have the project die and be listed in a place that is too risky.",

      "body": "It doesn't even seem possible to happen. I know so well the reputation of yobit. It's very well known as a garbage exchange site with so many scam tokens that can be a trap for anyone. SEDO was another token that may be used by yobit to pump and dump. I would not be surprised that if you are seeing it as an investment. I saw you have been repeating so many times promoting the scam tokens that issued by yobit. We have bunch of legit tokens in the market and shall we invest in the scam token rather than legit tokens? that doesn't make sense to invest in this scam token.",

This one has a supply, but lots of Yobit-only tokens have nothing to do with cryptos.But you decide, this is how much effort they have put in their homepage:You really think they put any more into that token?Also their token was created in april according to github and NOTHING has done to it since.",

SEDO Token, which is a shill OP, is no exception, as it regularly promotes crappy coins that are traded on Yobit on this forum. To do this, it is enough to view in the OP's profile all his threads that were created on Bitcointalk.",

I understand that you are talking about this project: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sedo-pow-token ?The historical chart looks positive and despite the ongoing bear market, I think it could be a good time to invest in this token. Unfortunately, the problem is that it is widely known that Yobit has services that allow you to manipulate volume and price, and this is the only exchange where this token is available, so it cannot be compared to any other market. For me, the risk that the price is being manipulated is too high. I would stay away.",
