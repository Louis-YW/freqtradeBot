  "content": "If there is a better place to post please let me know.I recently built an app about Bitcoin. It is a game and never costs members anything nor do they use BTC in it. It is doing better than I thought it would so fast and has left my learning curve in the dust.I will be sending members prizes of various small amounts. $5 to $100  but I am still stuck on my first send of $10I got to thinking maybe there are people that will take cash from me via paypal (preferably) or another way and they can send the BTC to my members. Of course I would cover all costs and we can discuss a fee for doing it. They could add up nice if the app stays on it's current trajectory.Maybe this isn't even legal to do? I don't know ... yet.ThanksDean",

I think you could adopt lightning network because the fees is cheaper than on chain.This can be a good reference All Lightning Network Threads In One Place",

I guess you're know how to use CEX or DEX. You can trade with the forum members, but I doubt they will accept PayPal or any kind of reversible payment, especially you don't have any reputation in this forum.So I guess no one will interested and take a risk.",

Others have made suggestions how to trade (try out the currency exchange section - just not Pay Pal which is frowned upon).Is it sponsorship you need? Reach out to the various campaign managers.If there are no other issues to be clarified, then you can lock the thread at bottom left.",
