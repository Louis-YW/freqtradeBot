Yeah, one reason though is because we have seen the Bitcoin mempool's clogged and users complaining about the fees. Enter this account, claiming to be the fastest and biggest block size and low fees.And that's why we have the \"ignore user options\".",

But for long I never come across a post that speaks about merits decaying or expiring. Nevertheless, no tag is needed I don't think they should be given a neutral tag because sharing merits isn't a crime I believe I have also given someone a huge merits but not at a go rather occasionally.",
