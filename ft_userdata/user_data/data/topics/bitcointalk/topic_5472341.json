  "content": "Another horribly written article from bitcoinnews.com as well as a bunch of misinformation.  Honestly, is there no journalistic integrity anymore? Here's the link -> https://bitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-collection-variety-of-physical-bitcoins/Here I break down some of the misinformation..\"In the digital asset sector, there exists a unique intersection between the virtual and the tangible: physical Bitcoins. These physical representations of Bitcoin come in a range of styles and designs, making them intriguing items to include in a Bitcoin collection for enthusiasts.In this article, we dive into the world of physical bitcoins, taking a look at some the more famous models.A Closer Look at The Bitcoin CollectionCasascius CoinsCasascius Coins, created by Mike Caldwell, were among the first physical Bitcoins. They feature an embedded private key hidden beneath a tamper-evident holographic sticker. Casascius Coins come in various denominations, serving as both collectors’ items and secure storage solutions.Titan BitcoinTitan Bitcoins are known for their opulence. Crafted from precious materials like gold, silver, and brass, these limited-edition coins are not just secure storage but works of art. Each Titan Bitcoin has a distinctive design, making it a premium collectible.No mention of Titan being partly a scam and partly a completely unreliable coin when it comes to even their private key coins. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5369583.0   Denarium CoinsDenarium, a Finnish company, offers physical BTC coins with a touch of elegance. These coins come in different denominations and are secured with tamper-evident holograms, making them a secure and visually appealing choice for collectors.They no longer offer coinsLealana CoinsLealana Coins stand out due to their unique designs and variety. These physical Bitcoins are made from various materials and often feature distinctive artwork. They cater to collectors seeking diversity in their collections.Satori CoinsSatori Coins add an element of mystery to the physical Bitcoin world. These coins may incorporate puzzles or codes that must be deciphered to access the private key. They combine security with an engaging challenge.No one has ever heard that Satori \"incorporate puzzles or codes that must be deciphered to access the private key\".  This is simply not true, and I have no idea where this was dreamed up from.Bitcoin Wallet CardsBitcoin wallet cards, resembling credit cards, contain QR codes with a private key. They are convenient for storing and spending Bitcoin while offering a level of physical security.These are Ballet Cards, not \"Bitcoin Wallet Cards\"BTCC Mint CoinsBTCC Mint produces physical bitcoins with distinct designs. They come in various materials, including copper and silver, making them attractive to collectors interested in aesthetic diversity.BTCC no longer produces coinsCold Storage CoinsCold storage coins provide a reliable option for long-term storage of bitcoin. They incorporate tamper-evident holograms and are suitable for those who prioritize security and preservation.These coins are a scam! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5351100.20DIY Physical BitcoinsDIY physical bitcoinDIY Physical Bitcoin — SourceSome enthusiasts take a hands-on approach, crafting their physical Bitcoins by engraving private keys onto metal or other materials. These DIY coins offer a personalized touch and can be a fun project for hobbyists.The Casascius coin in the picture is NOT a DIY coinAlitinTwo premium coins that represent economic pioneer Adam Smith and French patron saint Joan of Arc. These are pure silver coins weighing two ounces each and designed by presidential sculptor John B Andelin.This company was a scam! https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3315347.0 Antana CoinsThese are affordable novelty coins, with each minted batch containing network statistic data for a period and a particular theme.Interestingly, each type of physical Bitcoin brings its own charm, security features, and artistic flair, making them captivating pieces in the ever-evolving landscape of Bitcoin”.",

Honestly there really needs to be a 2016-current update on all coin releases even scam and of course not scam for the purpose of history. There are so many with no reference. I don't think Elias is getting a new one out there anytime soon but I could be wrong?",
