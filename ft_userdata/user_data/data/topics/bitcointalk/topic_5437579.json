  "content": "The Muslim holy month of Ramadan will begin from March. Â So from now the raw materials required for the month of Ramadan are being imported in the market. Â I went to a raw market in my town yesterday and saw every bag of chickpeas printed with bitcoin gold. I was surprised to see that in my country so far the cryptocurrency government is not fully legalized. There's Bitcoin Gold printed on the sacks of chickpea bag. I understand that these products are imported from abroad. And I'm just thinking about how the name of Bitcoin Â is spreading globally. What do you think about it?",

Today, I think the name bitcoin will not be unfamiliar to everyone, where there is the internet and smartphone, there is also bitcoin. But the problem is people still don't understand what it is because of some barriers created by the government.",

Â Currently, people from different countries have created different products on Bitcoin and spread it to different countries of the world.

Nothing benefits from it aside from getting confused and rises questions about the real Bitcoin.

Besides, spreading the name of Bitcoin is easier if we use social media platforms and I see it was more influential way than doing what OP has shown to us.",
