To know more about Electrum 2FA wallet, you can read this: https://trustedcoin.com/#/faqKnow that the 2FA wallet make use of 2-of-3 keys for making transaction which can make fee also a bit higher than normal transactions on a single key wallets. Also TrustedCoin charges fee while making use of their server to sign a transaction, you can see that on the FAQ link.For other coins, I do not know.",

Safepal or Trustwallet are integrated with Binance as the internal exchange.Trustwallet doesn't have the 2FA based on Google, Authly, Microsoft etc only pin code or biometric of device. Biometric of device can't rely on in case phone gets lost/broken so pin code on other hand is probably possible to enter multiple times right and has no bruteforce protection which gives cool down period or block IP on Trustwallet?Safepal will checkout.Electrum works only for BTC network Doesn't wallet to be integrated with exchange just need them to be on same network like TRX, BSC, etc so can do transactions between them",

Solutions like Electrum 2FA work by leveraging Bitcoin's multisignature addresses, there's a special server that has one of the keys from your addresses and co-signs your transactions when you want to spend the coins, and it costs additional fees.",

      "body": "Yeah, you're right on point that 2FA is a common security measure, but it doesn't really work with non-custodial wallets. With non-custodial wallets, you're in charge of your own private keys and access to your funds, so 2FA wouldn't really add much. Instead, many desktop wallets support using a hardware device for an extra layer of security.On the other hand, custodial wallets, like the ones you find on exchanges, are controlled by a third party and they hold your private keys for you. That's why you see 2FA used more on custodial wallets, to add an extra layer of protection for your account.",

You don't need a 2fa to use your bitcoin, this is not safe.What you need is to learn how to handle your private keys properly  , by keep your money in YOUR custody. As you are new to all this  I recommend that you buy a hardware wallet  (ledger or trezor)",

      "body": "Buying a hardware wallet is a best solution for you.If you don't want to buy hardware wallets, let's consider to use multi-sign (multi-signature) wallets. Keep your different multi-sign wallets at different devices so that you won't fall into cases with which all of your devices are compromised that in turn make your funds stolen by hackers.In my opinion, setting up a 3-3 multi-sign wallet is good enough with 3 co-signers to activate any transaction.If you want to use safe wallet (multi-sign) from a third party company, you can consider https://gnosis-safe.io wallet. Gnosis safe wallet supports multi chains and tokens too.",

We use that one smartphone to keep our friends away or to keep unauthorized person from operating our phones, but with a PC you just have to use a strong password, I have to warn you, do not use any crypto wallets that use email and password for login, they are not self custodial wallets e.g freewallet. All you have to worry about is keeping your private keys safe and using a strong password on your PC will keep people away.",

Most of the time you have the seeds anyway so you can immediately use another device to sweep your previous wallet and use a new one. This kind of feature is probably found on exchange/centralized web wallets. Quote from: NwWork on January 26, 2023, 03:10:39 PMDoesn't wallet to be integrated with exchange just need them to be on same network like TRX, BSC, etc so can do transactions between themFrom the sound of it, you might want to buy a FIDO-supported hardware wallet that can act as a 2FA key. That being said, I don't recall wallets that support them for wallet integration other than what has been mentioned above. MetaMask, which can do what you want to do since the majority of those chains are derived from ETH also doesn't support it as far as I'm aware. Some suggestions or commits have been made to support it but I don't see it being implemented atm.If what worried you the most is the possibility of attackers gaining your keys and spending it all, what you can do is probably prepare a better seed/device protection or try to use multi-sig if your crypto supports it.
