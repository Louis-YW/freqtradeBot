  "content": "So I have a friend who I went to college with and i've stayed in contact with him for the last decade and we're still friends, we were just at our other buddies place having a little pow wow and my buddy who was really into the crypto mining back in 2013 was telling us of his wild mining stories for ETH and XRP. For ETH he was parternered with this other dude that I rushed Pike with (didn't end up joining lol but I did get a bid.) Anyways long story short the kid that I rushed pike with made a bone head move and was convinced that these shitty miners were going to work like a few months before the mining difficulty was going up. They had this operation going on in a residential home and they ended up blowing a transformer. That caused the local energy authority to start looking into what they're doing & they were questioned a bit but eventually it subsided and they were gooddddddddd untilllll it happened again and the power company was trying to make them pay for it. He said the energy bill was already so high he ended up using a lot of the ETH he mined to pay for his half. The other dude who rushed Pike with me ended up taking short term loans to cover that and he kept all his ETH. Apparently that dude has like 200 million in gold my buddy said and a shit ton of land in Colorado now. He was a bit bitter on how he ended up doing really well but not nearly as well off as he should be compared to many of his other friends who were mining crypto as well. The other story on his XRP mining was also pretty wild. He had this Mac book pro laptop that he was using with a bunch of Virtual Servers and had it running on his desk 24/7- he left it there and never moved it. One day he said the thing literally burst into flames in his room and he was so pissed becasue he didn't back up his wallets and all of the XRP he was mining was on the laptop. Once this all happened Apple reached out to him and he had multiple phone calls with like an engineeringn team he said that convinced my bud to sign all these papers and send Apple back the laptop in exchange for a brand new laptop that was even better, he took it. After all that he realized his mistake and that he might have been able to recover his lost XRP. he said that in 2017 when XRP went to $3 he would have had 500k!When he told me these stories I literally had flash backs about him bitching about the other pike dude because I remember being in the library in college studying for Accounting and he kept saying how much of an idiot that dude was lmao. Its crazy. I knew my buddy was really smart you know he always talked about these wild server rooms he was working on but he never went into detail with me. I helped him cheat in accounting too lmao I should have got some coins for that or something!!! lmao. Crazy stories from one of my good buds. He is currently just chilling with a brand new R8 &Â  just traveling and working as a coder. Anyways, I thought you all would enjoy the stories I just finally had a momemt to jot them down Does anyone else have any good mining stories? I would particually like to hear about some Bitcoin mining stories",

So he let his Mac mine 24/7 and never backed up his wallets? Did this mean he only backed up some of them or everything was gone? I can't understand how people do that, even if the price of the coins they mine weren't that expensive. Especially when you used a device that wasn't built for mining. On the other hand, how long did his Mac run his VPS? Did he not monitor how hot his Mac was? I doubt it blows up just because you run VPS for a few days.",

It reminds newbies of the need to have proper guidance during their early years and involvement in crytocurrency to avoid mistakes like this.If you also introduce someone to cryptocurrency, emphasize the need for them to ask questions in areas they do not understand.",

I would particually like to hear about some Bitcoin mining stories I sort of have one... Around late 2010 or early 2011, I mined with my GPU for a few months and since I didn't know the proper way to maintain a GPU for mining purposes, it died so as a college student, I had no choice but to sell my desktop in exchange for a laptop and guess what! Almost everything that I mined at the time was in there and I never made any backups in that time [I don't have any regrets, but I hope the person who bought my desktop knew something about Bitcoin and found a way to access them so it wouldn't be a complete waste of time].",

I mean even at that moment, my laptop was very old, I bought a Laptop in 2005, and mined with it in 2011, that has to be the wildest thing to me.Because while that was the norm at the time, we also need to remember that we are talking about just an old laptop back then, versus having literally giant mining farms nowadays. That gap is huge and I am sure that we are not going to end up with as good as it gets, it won't be easy for people that join bitcoin today to realize how easy it was to mine bitcoin, we were literally mining few bitcoins a day at the time, I mean my laptop was bad even at that time so I wasn't, but I had friends who were mining like 10+ bitcoins a day even back then. It is such a wild thing when you think about it from todays perspective.",

Â Also, as a matter of fact I did see him again about a year ago and I got to overhear a crazy live conversation with him and one of his miner partners over speakerphone, they were in search of a very particular wallet that had steady transactions and needed to have like 200-300 transactions and looking to use it as some kind of vehicle to avoid taxes or for what they whatever they were planning to do haha.I was a little baffled by the dialog as I was listening while I was waiting to catch up with him in front of the gym, I never know what I'm in for when I talk to that guy lol For anyone who doesn't know the story it was this dude who claimed to be a Truste for royals and also a trustee for the five star trust which is apparently the trust of the illuminati and he also claimed to be the money manager for like 9 world banks or some wild shit like that.

It doesn't seem to bother anyone, so it's not a problem - maybe someone will come forward with their interesting story about mining.Quote from: tread93 on February 09, 2025, 09:10:59 PMAlso, as a matter of fact I did see him again about a year ago and I got to overhear a crazy live conversation with him and one of his miner partners over speakerphone, they were in search of a very particular wallet that had steady transactions and needed to have like 200-300 transactions and looking to use it as some kind of vehicle to avoid taxes or for what they whatever they were planning to do haha.I was a little baffled by the dialog as I was listening while I was waiting to catch up with him in front of the gym, I never know what I'm in for when I talk to that guy lol For anyone who doesn't know the story it was this dude who claimed to be a Truste for royals and also a trustee for the five star trust which is apparently the trust of the illuminati and he also claimed to be the money manager for like 9 world banks or some wild shit like that.

I don't know, it seems to me that this character is some kind of fraud who can't distinguish between the real world and the one he imagined - at least that's what it seems to me. Until they show some proof, I would treat it that way. Maybe I misunderstood, is the person we are talking about the same person from the document?As for the link, I wouldn't say it's about any secrets (at least from what I've been able to see), but rather a well-documented sequence of events that shows that everyone cooperates with everyone else if they manage to align their interests.",

I've done it myself when mining coins. For instance, there was a time I tried some new coins for fun and got distracted or forgot about it. I had some of that coins that you could mine with HDD, but they were worth so little I've never even bothered to sell. It was just a fun project for me to try and why would I back up $2 of coins or something like that. He probably thought the same, but years later that $2 became $2k. I've lost a lot of shitcoins over the years. For instance, I had some alts worth a little over $200 on bittrex when it went bankrupt but they wanted me do KYC to get it out, so I passed. Hope they choke on it.",
