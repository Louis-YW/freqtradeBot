Can you illustrate it?Let us take example from Club A and Club B. If the odd for club A to win is 1.8While the odd for club B to win is 2.4If odd for draw is 3.5How is the the expected value calculated using EV = Po - 1? To know if it is positive or negative.Basically the expected value, is the average value you can expect from a game or a bet.To compute it from a bet you need to know the real likelihood of the outcome to happen.If you are likely to win 1$ half time and lose 1$ the other half you will get 50 times $1 and 50 times - $1 if you repeat the event 100 times. The average winning value will be then 1+1+1...(50 times)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)...(50 other times) divided by 100That is to say ( 50 x 1 + 50 x -1 ) / 100 = 0Here with a 1$ bet on a Club A victory @1.8 we would be expected to win $0.8 and to lose $-1 an unknown number of times if we were able to repeat the match in the same conditions 100 times.If we think this number of Club A victories would be 60 for 100 matches against Club B, that is to say if the real likelihood of their victory is 60% then we will getEV = 0.8 x P(Avictory) - 1 x P(Anovictory) = 0.8 x P(Avictory) - 1 x (1-P(Avictory)) = 0.8 x 0.6 - 1 x 0.4 = 0.08Now if we want to include the expense of the stake.We can consider we will lose it each time (100%), get it back with the winnings($1.8) 60% of times and not receiving anything($0) 40% of times, then we will getEV = 1.8 x 0.6 + 0 x 0.4 - 1 x 1 = 1.8 x 0.6 - 1 = 0.08So we can conclude that EV of one bet is its european odds (1.8) multiplied by its real likelihood to happen minus the stake ie 1 if we compute it for a one dollar bet.",

If I lose the $10, would I think about it? I can not think about it and I can not be depressed at all. Gambling is risky, the best approach by gamblers is to know that gambling is risky, they should just take it that way. Using little amount of money that would not harm our life is better. I too win than lose when I bet appropriately and not going betond my capability in term of money to bet with.Quote from: Saint-loup on September 03, 2022, 09:56:33 PMThanks. I appreciate your calculation. But if I should be sincere, is this necessary for a gambler? I think using the amount of money you can afford to lose is enough. Or is it not? Rather than to be making a calculation that most gamblers are not using at all (not you, I mean the article).",

Rather than to be making a calculation that most gamblers are not using at all (not you, I mean the article).Yes I agree with you, I don't think many people are doing those calculations because it's not possible to correctly guess the real likelihood of a match outcome, unlike gambling games like roulette or dice for example where it's fixed and known.But it's still important to always evaluate its order of magnitude I think, even unconsciously.If you have a @1.01 odds while you think the team has only 50% chances to win, it's not a good deal. A good deal is an odds above the inverse of the real likelihood(or your own evaluation of it actually). That is to say above (50%)-1 = 1 / 0.50 = 2.00 here.",
