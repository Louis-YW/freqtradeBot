  "content": "This post demonstrates this “energy crisis” is just an US attack on Germany and the rest of the EU: https://www.greanvillepost.com/2022/09/13/bombshell-classified-rand-corporation-executive-summary-research-report-january-25-2022-weakening-germany/?print=print.RAND CORPORATION has published a press release labeling the research as fake and misinformation. But guys, look at the facts. This is like suffering a hurricane and in the middle of it someone posts a weather report that was forecasting the hurricane a couple of months before (its name, where it starts, its path to mainland, classification evolution, wind speeds, rainfall loads, etc.), and it’s authors deny they ever wrote the forecast. Who on the whole Earth would care who the authors are? Even if the forecast had been written during the hurricane and if describes the phenomena precisely, the conspiracy is just in that this is not a forecast. But, still, it is just a fair and real description of what just happened. I do not care if this paper was written before the war or by the RAND CORPORATION. It describes with succinct accuracy why the war in Ukraine has been pushed forward by the US and the man made “energy crisis” it is provoking in Germany and the rest of the EU, governed right now by a bunch of knuckle heads. No need to say that this war against Germany cannot affect BTC mining in any way. The only thing in this whole story that is demonstrating that Russia is not either squeaky clean is the fact that they are not directly adopting BTC as a parallel legal tender along with the RUB (as El Salvador did with the USD) and inviting BTC miners to go there to run their operations on their gas flares. The RUB is just another trashy fiat currency that has benefited from the German and European stupidity, the US malice, and the Russian absolute supremacy over energy resources. But the RUB will lose its value against BTC in the long run. It is just a matter of time. It does not matter if Europeans finish paying in RUB for the oil and gas (they will!), or how long does it take to engineers to find a definitive solution to the fossil fuels dependence, BTC will reign over all fiat currencies in not such a distant future. So, the Russians are making here a huge mistake.",

I just saying they’re denying they wrote this paper and they’re labeling it as misinformation. But whether they did or not is not the core issue here. The dough here is that the paper is absolutely right in every statement they do. Whoever wrote it, they nailed it. It perfectly explains the US interest and benefits in wrecking Germany and the rest of the EU. It perfectly explains this is a US made “energy crisis” that cannot affect anyone except the German dopes (at least and individually, they are hoarding SATS like crazy). By the way, Germans that claimed to be not so long ago a collective superior race are demonstrating, again, not only they are not such a thing, but probably one of the most inferior societies in history of the world. They have typically confused skills in certain branches of engineering with intelligence. No, that’s called skills. Intelligence and collective intelligence are much broader concepts that it is obvious Germans lack. This war against Germany that the US just started under the Ukraine war camouflage, while Germans are behaving as the dopes they are, is the clear proof (read the RAND analysis in my link in the initial post). They were kicked hard in the ass during WW I. They went completely nuts on WW II to become the most embarrassing nation history has ever seen. And now, you see, how easy a country as the US can temper with them and cripple down the result of years of hard work and national reconstruction. I’m I wrong? Do not answer to me here with some bla-bla-bla blabbing drooling speech. Walk the walk. Whenever I see Germany walking out of NATO; spelling US troops and bases out of Germany; reestablish relations with Russia; buying their gas and oil wherever they wish and not where the US tells them to; and definitely behaving as a collective smart and independent nation, without barking nonsense idiocy about the Jews or whatever other scapegoat they might try to find to explain your own collective incompetence; I’ll change my impression about Germans and reconsider my idea that, at the end, they’re just a bunch of dopes. They’re just the wannabes that have never been and express their own obvious frustration pretending to be better than the rest, which they never were, and it looks they will never be.",

So, the Russians are making here a huge mistake.The adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador seems like a failure at this point.Why do you think that Bitcoin adoption would be more successful in bigger and well developed countries?I don't see Bitcoin dominating over fiat currencies at any given point. The Gresham's law about money works. \"Bad money takes out good money from the circulation.\" Fiat currencies are bad money and Bitcoin is good money. Why wasting your good money, when you could simply HODL them?Nobody is saying that BTC mining is affected by the energy crisis. The BTC mining can only be affected by the governments and their stupid regulations.I don't care about the conspiracy theories about the USA wanting to manipulate Russia into invading Ukraine(and weakening Germany by making the Russian gas expensive). This might be true or it might as well be Putin propaganda. Who cares?",

Considering the fact that the stats never showed Germany to have any high amount of hashrate, this crisis does not affect bitcoin at all.Quotethe Russian absolute supremacy over energy resources.That's where you are wrong. There are a lot of other countries that have lots of energy resources, some even more than Russia. The problem is that the Western bloc (that doesn't have nearly as much energy combined) has isolated itself by sanctioning EVERYONE else who has a lot of such resources!Quote from: JaimeAlejandro on September 19, 2022, 04:42:13 AMIt perfectly explains the US interest and benefits in wrecking Germany and the rest of the EU.I disagree. It's not about US interest in wrecking EU specially if it all falls apart (mainly NATO). More so when you consider that the world is dumping US dollar as reserve and trade currency and the only thing left for US quadrillions of printed worthless currency is EU. In simple terms they need EU to export their inflation to.The thing is, US gains more interest in weakening the Eastern Bloc (or at least trying to), currently focusing on Russia through their proxy war and later on China with yet another proxy war (through Taiwan). The options are either they succeed so they can get back their superiority (1 world 1 superpower) or they fail and it solidifies the new world order (which formed a while ago) where US is just one of the 4 superpowers and possibly even the weakest one among them.So it is a win-win scenario for US but a lose-lose scenario for EU as the casualty of the new world order.QuoteAnd now, you see, how easy a country as the US can temper with them and cripple down the result of years of hard work and national reconstruction. It's not about the race (despite your racist remarks here) or anything like that, Germany is the loser of WWII so it is humiliated and occupied which is why they don't have any independence when it comes to geopolitical decisions. Rest of EU is not so much different either even though they were on the winning side, they too lack the same independence.",

More so when you consider that the world is dumping US dollar as reserve and trade currency and the only thing left for US It is obvious you haven’t read the link to the RAND CORPORATION in my first post in this thread. My boss yesterday was saying… “people do not read”. He was referring to our clients who ask for our technical support services, we answer them and then, they ask the same question again. Solution is in the mail thread. They haven’t read it. He was saying, there’s monologists now everywhere. Everybody talking, nobody listening. Read the link and you will see how the US and why, yes, the US has promoted the war in Ukraine to wreck Germany (why this wrecks whole EU). So, once you have read it (you haven’t), I’ll take my time to keep the conversation with you.  Quote from: Fundamentals Of on September 19, 2022, 09:13:59 AM... it doesn't matter to them whether the war was mainly caused by the instigation of the US or the insanity of Putin... They're all probably against the war because they're suffering from the effects of it. Your comment is already so biased. If it hadn't you would have written \"the instigation of the US or Putin\". US trying to wreck the most industrial country in the EU is not “insanity”. What the hell is it? Putin is insane and, I guess is also your point, any country who responds to US aggressions is “insane”. The US can attack without any justification any country in the world, but that is not insanity! US can attack Iraq because they had “arms of mass destruction”, which they didn’t, and the US walks away with it. US can provoke the Arab Spring while the US President promoting those wars holds a Peace Nobel Prize in his hand, and that’s not insanity. The US promised not to increase NATO with old Warsaw Pact countries at the end of the Cold War. US never complied with their promise. Not happy with bringing countries to NATO that have frontiers with Russia, the US promoted a coup de tat in Ukraine in 2014 and organized a manipulated election process that was a complete scam. So, I guess you haven’t either read the RAND paper at the beginning of my thread. That paper cites the US provocations that would undeniably lead to a Russian invasion. Who is the aggressor? The US is. And it does not matter? It does not matter to people who lives on the benefits of US promoted wars everywhere around the world. It matters to all people who suffers those wars, as it is happening to Ukrainians right now. It is my point that it does not matter to the German dopes. If it did, they would already be doing something about it, which they are obviously not. And no. People in Europe are against this war because most Europeans have traditionally been since the 90’s against US promoted wars. Now, their governments have fallen in the hands of globalist elites, and they don’t care if the consequences of the US promoted war fall on their citizens knuckle heads (as soon as they stay still and protests are not general and massive… knuckle heads). But the case of Germany, which is the most affected country, is so pathetic (Italy, Portugal and Spain are buying mostly Algerian natural gas). This is what I have already said that bragging about being “the superior race” (yes, it is so racist) and then behaving as plain collective dopes, which they are at this very moment, is contrary to the historic truth: Germany is a country of dopes. And, of course, this is not affecting BCT mining in the slightest. It will promote BTC as many trying to escape the European hell as this war evolves and things start getting really messy, they’ll need to resort to reliable money as BTC.",

I did skim through it and I still say the same thing since I'm not commenting on the article, I commented on your take of the article.It's true that US started this war and is still fighting the proxy war with Russia (to the last Ukrainian according to their own statements) and they are prolonging it for years as it was planned. It is true that there is a lot of benefits for United States in this war and any other wars they started. But destruction of EU or any specific country like Germany is not part of the plan, it is the result of the plan. In other words Germany is collateral damage.\"To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.\"QuoteIt is my point that it does not matter to the German dopes. If it did, they would already be doing something about it, which they are obviously not.The real question is, what can they do? All options Germans (and most other Europeans) have are terrible. They knew this day would come the day they \"bent the knee\". They can't just undo all that, kick US out, get out of EU and NATO and declare independence. They can't even be independence when they need to import tremendous amount of energy!Not to mention other consequences of such actions. For example Poland (all of a sudden) decided that after 70 years they want to talk about the losses caused by German invasion ($1.3 trillion) and demanding payment which is a good sign that US is sending the Germans to not even think about kicking them out!QuoteAnd no. People in Europe are against this war because most Europeans have traditionally been since the 90’s against US promoted wars.They only think about protesting against such wars when it starts significantly affecting their lives. They didn't give a shit when they were bombing for example Iraq for no reason. They didn't give a shit when they (ie. NATO) started the Ukraine invasion either. They started caring about it when their inflation went high and the fear of a cold winder loomed.",
