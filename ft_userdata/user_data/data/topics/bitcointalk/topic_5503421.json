At that time mining bitcoins required very little computational power and mining rewards were up to 50 bitcoins per block.The fact is earliest miners mined bitcoin and ran nodes not because they knew bitcoin will be this big today but because the saw it as FUN. It was simply letting you computer play around with some hashes till a valid one was found and them you get some bitcoins as a reward.",

It is a built-in feature. ...And if there were no miners validating new blocks, then Bitcoin would cease to exist because transactions couldnt be confirmed.  The whole network relies on miners to secure the blockchain and prevent double-spending. If we remove that, then Bitcoin no longer has a purpose.",

It must be all fun from beginning and all those that participated in the mining alongside satoshi will just be doing it for some other purpose like while away time, seeing it like a game between themselves on who will accurately solve the next puzzle before the other did. They wouldn’t have known bitcoin could have grown to this stage, but it’s all good that they kept up mining and many other miners came on board to took over and are now all inclusive and a hard one to crack when mining the next block into the blockchain.",

Miners get rewards for mining because of the mining fees. And the incentive is enough to keep miners motivated, and judging from the high fees some people paid post-halving, I don’t think many miners would be giving up any time soon.OP this topic has been discussed at length so many times before. Just use the forum search engine and search for questions like \"what happens if all miners quit” or “what happens when the 21 million bitcoins are mined\".",

That wont happen, if all current miners stop, it means that the hashrate will go down drastically that it can be mine again using GPU, to cheap GPU, and maybe to CPU again. So all those \"still bitcoiners\" will probably mine again bitcoin on their computers until hash rate grows again and difficulty soars and mining requires again a stronger asic to mine, it's just a cycle, it wont stop.",

The blockchain is essentially just data or records stored on a hard drive, paper, or even written on a wall. What miners do is extend the length of the blockchain and make changes to the data. So, in a scenario where nobody mines Bitcoin for a year, it simply means the data will stay the same; you can't change it, but nobody would lose their coins or keys. You can still propagate your transactions; they just won't be written into the blockchain. The moment someone turns on a miner and finds a block, the transactions will start going through.There is also another important function that miners perform: they keep the difficulty high enough to ensure the security of Bitcoin. However, it's important to note that even today, miners aren't actually building the blockchain 24/7 despite trying to do so. It’s only when a block is found, which happens on average once every 10 minutes and takes less than a second to occur.",

I don't think Satoshi's the only person that was mining when bitcoin was released. They had cohorts and companions who he gave access to mine for testing purposes such as those listed by Mia Chloe, and furthermore, it was not through mining that he was able to create the blockchain metaphorically speaking, it was through people holding it one after another, until such a time occurred where everyone just agreed bitcoin's this valuable (which it is), and made mining the gold mine that it is now. As a bonus, I don't think bitcoin's gonna die soon as everyone stopped mining, even if there comes a time where people just got tired of mining and stopped altogether even before all bitcoins are gathered. We have a lot of coins in circulations, approximately 3/4ths if I'm not mistaken, we can cycle that amongst ourselves and effectively create an economy which will definitely diminish bitcoin's monetary value, but at the very least it would make bitcoin a full-fledged currency that will stand the tests of time, so long as there's internet of course.",
