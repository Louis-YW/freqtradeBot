If Elon Musk really wants to go ahead and keep supporting Twitter - then he's probably going to be spending a lot of money in the next few years.",

It appears that Twitter has gone back to zero since Elon Musk became its owner. But I'm still not sure.",

Because blue checkmark sales are clearly not enough.Did anyone on this forum, who use twitter, notice any unusual or significant increase in hate speech? Personally, I haven't noticed. Has anyone here watched BBC's interview with Elon Musk? The interviewer so absurdly talking about hate speech increase while in fact he had no evidence to prove his claim. I think freedom of speech is very important and Elon Musk clearly pointed that out in that interview, who is fair to judge what's true and what's false? By the way, Elon Musk's approach towards Twitter, as a company, is very strange. To my mind, his mistake is that he ignores the fact that people aren't as dedicated and hard-working as he is and by firing so many employees, his company is not doing well and he doesn't want to return them back too.",

Buying a company and immediately firing essential employees, demanding people to work long hours and in general trying to \"fix\" what wasn't broken is just a sign of general incompetence. Any normal CEO would do anything to please the advertisers, because they are the main source of revenue, instead Elon chose to ignore their concerns and switch to a different revenue model - premium subscription, without any strong research to back it, just his genius entrepreneur instincts.",

Do not rush to say that he is wrong in business when we are not equal to him and do not have any business experience. I am also not good and have the right to judge anyone, but I know one thing, in business does not always things go smoothly.

Advertising structure works the same way. Only difference is people don't get banned for saying politically inconvenient truths.There isn't a rise in hate speech -- it's mere propaganda by the same platforms that used Twitter to do their political bidding (MSM) who no longer find their propaganda reach as wide now that free speech is allowed on the platform. Therefore, they work to spread disinformation against Elon and Twitter, like the nonsense that Twitter is a hub for hate speech.",

Well.. that is the point. The subscription alone nets them $96 per year per user. And the expenses are down, because they laid off 95% of the staff. Ad revenues are down, because the left-wing groups are engaging on a boycott campaign against Twitter, due to the right-wing views of its owner. FoE doesn't exist for left-wing lunatics. But Twitter still maintains it's absolute monopoly in the micro-blogging domain. None of the competitors even come close. If they maintain their monopoly, then sooner or later, the ad revenues will recover. According to Travis Brown, there were 444,435 paying Twitter Blue subscribers by end of March 2023. That is around $42 million per year.",

Perhaps this is the spawn of simultaneous shifts in advertising fashion and the global economy. Twitter may be a little slow to adopt the latest and greatest in marketing strategies, such as influencer marketing, native ads, and video reels, which are currently setting the internet on fire.Musk's proposal to divert money from his other businesses is riskier than riding a unicycle on a tightrope and might lead to a breakdown in corporate governance. Fiduciary duty to shareholders is as important as the final piece of pizza at a party, thus this must not be forgotten. Elon Musk needs a solid wall separating his personal wealth from the inner workings of Tesla and SpaceX.Concerning sponsorship from foreign governments, one must walk a diplomatic tightrope. It might tarnish Twitter's free-speech reputation with a muddy puddle of political dispute. Twitter might do better to attract strategic partners or advertisers who share their brand's values and community's ideals.",
