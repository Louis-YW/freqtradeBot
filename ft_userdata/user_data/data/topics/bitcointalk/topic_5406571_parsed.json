If they want to shill Segwit and make contribution for Segwit adoption, they can charge different withdrawal fees on different address types. Most expensive withdrawal fee on Legacy. Medium withdrawal fee on Nested Segwit. Cheapest withdrawal fee on Native Segwit.Why they did not seriously support Native Segwit is big question.Quote from: nc50lc on July 17, 2022, 04:31:15 AMIt's because the transactions for the withdrawals do not use their users' deposit addresses as inputs.

Is it easier for them to manage their hot wallets with Legacy or harder for them to manage hot wallets with Native Segwit?If it is the same, not harder, not easier, why they did not move to Native Segwit?",

      "body": "On exchanges, bitcoin withdrawal fee equals to bitcoin transaction fee + extra fee deducted by the exchange.The extra fee deducted by exchanges are always too much. You can make bitcoin transaction with less than 0.00005 BTC fee, but exchanges are charging over 0.0002 BTC and higher. The extra fee is enough for them not to differentiate the fee charge for bitcoin address type.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on July 17, 2022, 05:54:46 AMWhy they did not seriously support Native Segwit is big question.Exchange not support segwit can mean the exchange users not able to transfer bitcoin to a segwit address. But you can now be able to send bitcoin to segwit address from most reputable exchanges.There won't be a good reason exchanges are not supporting segwit, it's five years now since segwit activation.",

When you will explore your transaction hash to the block explorer you will discover many transactions on the same transaction hash. This means they sent Bitcoin to multiple addresses at the same transaction. This means they spent very less fee on that. It's their business, they charge us higher than cost. That's the reason they set a default withdrawal fee for all types of address.",

They don't want their customer service wasting time answering question such as \"What's difference between address 1..., 3... and bc1...\" or \"Why fee for this kind of address is lower?\". It also ease burden of developing and maintaining their backend software.I think it may be beyond that. I have used four exchanges before that include the withdrawal fee of altcoin pegged with bitcoin on the same lists of bitcoin withdrawal. If they can do that, including bitcoin address types should not be a problem for them. Like on Binance, even legacy and native segwit address are included along. I think the basic reason is just that they are all bitcoin network and the exchanges charge far higher than actual bitcoin transaction fee which makes it not necessary.",
