  "content": "Just got my silver Alpen bar in the mail (she’s a beauty) and received #25 of 200. I am hoping to make a pair of the same serial numbers, so wondering if whomever got the #25 gold Alpen bar would be willing to trade it to me for my gold #76 bar plus maybe a little extra. As a side note- Mopar is trying to pair my #76 gold bar with his #76 silver Alpen bar. Unfortunately atm he doesn’t have a gold bar to trade for it, so hopefully if I’m able to make this trade, the person I trade with might be willing  to eventually trade it to Mopar so he can complete a matching set with his favorite number (#76).  (Also anyone please feel free to use this thread to try and do the same if you’ve got an unmatched pair of Alpen bars)",
