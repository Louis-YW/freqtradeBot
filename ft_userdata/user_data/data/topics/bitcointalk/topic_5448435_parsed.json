      "body": "Well, you know what they say - money can't buy you class. And it certainly can't buy you manners or a sense of decency. Some people just do not know how to act right, no matter how much money they have.Personally, I think it is important to treat everyone with respect, regardless of their wealth or status. After all, you never know what someone's been through or what they are going through right now. A little empathy and understanding can go a long way. But, if you are going to be a scumbag, I have no problem with calling you out on it. I know that there are people who will disagree with me, and I respect that. Everyone has the right to their own opinion. But, when it comes down to it, being a decent human being is not really all that hard.",
