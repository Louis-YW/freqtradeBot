I appreciate it.QuoteWhat do you mean by that, the role of the wallet is to manage your wallet seed, how will it make their lives easy, automating transactions, sending at a specific time, automatic updating of the balance, or easy integration of the wallet with the payment gateway for games.You are correct, the main feature of a wallet is managing your seed. Other features you have mentioned are quite valid features that can be implemented into this new wallet. Thx for the ideas There is another feature some of the crypto gamers are asking is multi-chain support. Currently, crypto gamers are using different wallets while playing different games. I am planning to unify all those wallets into a single one. That will make their lives easier.QuoteI do not know crypto gamers or how payments are made in them, but if what you are trying to develop is open source and related to Bitcoin, you can transfer your idea to board No. 12.0  (Project Development) Otherwise, what you are trying to develop has nothing to do with the Bitcoin sections.Thank you for the heads up.

If musicians, drivers or gravediggers have such a market cap, I will consider building something for them.QuoteWell, there are already a few multi chain support wallets, the most popular ones being trust wallet (closed source) and Unstoppable Wallet (open source). I am well aware of both TrustWallet & Unstoppable Wallet. Last time I checked Unstoppable Wallet, it was a small project and did not have enough support for different blockchains. But it looks like they have improved a lot. I will look into Unstoppable Wallet. I am planning to make the wallet OpenSource or maybe source available.QuoteDon't understand when you mean when you say that you want to unify all those into the single wallet, perhaps develop a wallet integrating features of all the wallets?All those different wallets were developed by the developer of the games.

We have different banks for different industries. For example, there are credit unions that will act as banks for the agriculture industry. There are central banks responsible for monetary policies.

How different is your wallet from a multi-currency wallet? As far as I can tell, there's no difference at all.

That was one of the things that discouraged me from starting this project. Why would people use my wallet when great and popular wallets can do almost the same thing? But, end-users love shortcuts and usability. If the wallet can solve a pain point of end-users, they use it.I received some valid feedback from gamers who play blockchain games. I asked them which wallet they use, and we ended up discussing a wallet that could support some of the blockchains that are not supported by major wallets. The other feedback was that they had to use different wallets for different games. I am still trying to validate this idea with other cryptocurrency gaming communities.

There are people using cryptocurrency to gamble and there are some big products that do the job quite well.There is a huge player base for play to earn blockchain games. Of course, there are games that are not play to earn. Instead those games integrated blockchain & cryptocurrency directly into their game. Check out this link:https://coinmarketcap.com/view/gaming/One of the ideas that came to my mind was designing the wallet from the aspect of games, not the tokens. Users will be able to activate the supported game from the list and all necessary tokens, blockchain networks, and NFTs will be enabled for that user. Instead of players to figure out which token or NFT belong which game, they will be able to interpolate which game uses which token, NTF or blockchain.I have the base of the wallet built with React as Chrome Extension.
