Any adequate project would refuse to cooperate with such a manager in order to maintain its reputation.I also warned Sindban that Royce has quite a few red marks, and I think I'm not the only one.Here's another good example. Royce is running a signature campaign that has an open allegation of fraud and a clear connection to the fraudulent 1xBIT casino.",

Can you put a link to the coinplay thread btw?(Edited to add the following) I see it is this one:Coinplay.com | Brand New Crypto Sportsbook & CasinoAs far as I can see, apart from the accusation of being related to 1xBit, there are also people in the thread complaining about not getting paid. We would have to discern on a case by case basis as we see many accusations on Scam Accusations that we later find out that the user had broken the rules and such.",

It's about his good works.8: Somethings are unique and different Royse777 did today. posted on Service Discussion by elevates and another positive topic about him.9: Royse777 is a big fraud. posted on Reputation by bladee, as usual no exactions but hate10: What is wrong with Royse777? posted on Reputation by elevates. Poor elevates really did not understand the joke so this is with a different taste.11: And the latest is this Incorrect use of red feedback. posted by airfinex. The title does not have the keyword \"Royse777\" and if I am not wrong then I saw many other topics about him without his username on the title.Even with my poor searching skill, I managed to find 11 topics where 1 is elevates poor understanding of April jokes, 2 are from elevates again but with positive encouragement for him, 1 from himself [This is the start IMO so I ignored two to three other topics which were bounty threads] but the remaining 7 out of 11 are to throwing mud on the wall and expecting to ruin him [?].At the end, he is one of the most desired campaign manager for the companies who want to advertise their business on the forum and currently have highest active signature campaigns [I hope I am not wrong] on his portfolio.Now I suspect, are you all hired by him to maintain his TRP LOL?It includes Poker Player and JollyGood too 😂P.S: It will be interesting to see who is the most talked forum member since the last year. I can bet $100, no one will even be closer to Royse777.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, unlike your previous thread about Cygan on Cygan abuses DT - Proof! which is quite correct, this one is not simply because that is rougly how feedback meant to be used. If I may take snippets from Loyce's Guide,Quote from: LoyceV on October 10, 2019, 03:37:17 PM[...]Once you fully understand the system, it's important to start using it:Did you do a trade in which you risked funds? Leave feedback!Did you see users who left accurate Trust feedback on many accounts? Add them to your Trust list!Anyone can leave feedback, and anyone can customize their Trust list![...]Don't confuse your Trust list with feedbackTrust feedback: leave feedback to people you trust or don't trust. Or leave neutral comments.Trust list: a list of people who's judgement on others you trust (username) or don't trust (~username).Trust feedbackTrust feedback (Positive/Neutral/Negative) can be used to express your opinion about someone's trustworthiness. In other words: would you trust or have you trusted this user with your money?[...]Trust listYou should add users who left accurate feedback and have good Trust lists to your Trust list, and you should exclude users who leave inaccurate feedback.This means your Trust list should be based on how you value the users' judgement on others, and it should not be based on whether or not you Trust those users (with money) or traded with them.[...]Or if I may refer you to the post made by Little Mouse on that very own other thread of yours, helping Cygan to understand how both system works and their differences:Quote from: Little Mouse on March 31, 2023, 08:08:33 AMDon't include people in your trust list because they have dealt with you and you can trust them with money. This deserves a feedback.When someone leaves accurate feedback in your perspective, only include them in your trust list. If they leave wrong feedback, exclude them from trust list.For reference, LoyceV guide is the best- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5191802.0Once again-1. You have trade with someone? Leave feedback.2. You trust someone's judgement based on the feedback they sent- Include them in your trust list.In other words, in case you still didn't get it, feedback is for your opinion when you dealt with someone and/or having a good or bad experience with them. Trust list is for when you trusted someone's judgement.Departing from these basis, your thread on Cygan has its weight, he did use the system wrongly, as he openly admitted, due to being clueless about it. This thread on Royse777 and the feedback he left against Poker Player, did not. Royse left a negative feedback against PP based on his opinion instead of distrusting Poker Player [~Poker Player], so he actually use the \"red\" feedback correctly.And no, I'm not writing this to take side with Royse or because I'm on his campaign or --if we stretch it out-- I'm currently wearing signature of the project being mentioned and questioned here. I'll still wrote the same suppose the situation is reversed where Poker Player is the one who left the feedback to Royse, or someone else leave feedback to some other else.As for CoinPlay campaign, I have to say that yes, they're currently having a situation and in my very own personal opinion their team handled the situation quite poorly, I'll use this chance to state my stance for that case that I am quite disagree with how they handled it. They could do better.I was, am, and will actively monitoring the situation --trust me, you don't know how much I went back and forth between parties involved on that case prior to it being published, and even after then-- I even made a draft of a very long post questioning both sides, written on Friday and ready to be sent when Saturday come, in case the deadline made by OP of that scam accusation reached and CP still choose to be silent, which now sitting quietly on my email because CP agreed on the request made by the OP.If you carefully read the thread instead of --I can only assume-- skimming through it just to build your case, you'll be aware that the current and last conclusion of that case is:Quote from: CoinPlay_official on March 31, 2023, 03:11:23 PMQuote from: GekkeBelg on March 31, 2023, 02:40:34 PMCoinplay, thank you for letting Askgamblers have a look at the case. Can you email me a screenshot (or post it here for even more transparency) of what request you have sent to Askgamblers? You don't need to include your \"evidence\" with it, only just show us the email you sent to Askgamblers with the request for them to review the case.We meant to say that you should open a complaint on Askgamblers, where we both will provide the necessary details for them to review your case.So this demand of yours is quite... ridiculous senseless, because both parties has agreed to take them to an arbitrator. I don't see why Royse should intervene if the case is already under review by AskGamblers.Quote from: airfinex on April 02, 2023, 08:12:55 PMI'm outraged and looking forward to the next one.[...]2. Royce will intervene in the discussion related to coinplay and, if he does not receive any results from the casino, will immediately stop the subscription campaign.[...]As for the feedback given by TwitchySeal on your screenshot, while I am not sure how true CP's clarification is --I think no one on this forum do, except CP themselves-- but if only TwitchySeal read two pages further, he'll see CP had made a clarification for the situation, which also has been acknowledged by several users 1 2 3 raising that concern and questioning the similarities:Quote from: CoinPlay_official on December 01, 2022, 01:51:40 PM❗ Hi everyone, Coinplay Community Manager here! I'd like to address the elephant in the room and clear up some confusion about us and 1xBet/1xBit:Coinplay.com was partially built with some software used on 1xBet platform – that's why the website might have similar code and tools – but it's a separate project that works and develops independently.

Or to agree to hand over the case to an independent investigator such as Askgamblers or Ecogra (you can choose which one). If you do neither of these 2 options then a flag will be created and a complaint will be filed at the Curacao Antillephone license, which I know has the best reputation out of all 4 license providers in Curacao, and they will take my complaint seriously.You can end this right here and save your reputation. Be wise.It sounds like pay me or I will destroy you. I gave up defending for the accounts come and use us to fulfill their demands. Many times, later I discovered it was the casino or the sportsbook who was the victim. How in the hell someone can have 50 accounts with different gambling sites and play a lot of money with newly came casinos on the web? Why don't they go with highly trusted, reputable casinos like Stake, Sportsbet.io or even Duelbits? They know they can not fight against them if they caught abusing because those are too big to convince everyone.The case seems to me a case of arbitrage betting to be honest, I could be damn wrong. But arbitrage betting is something we know all the sportsbooks don't take it easily and freeze if found the abuse.",

The person will feel bad and disappointed. I have read a lot threads that against you in this reputation board which is not good. Please I am begging you to calm. There are some things you have to avoid to carry everyone along as a manager. Please calm down.One love and let love lead in the forum. First, I don't think it has anything to do with the members Royce is getting out of the campaigns he's running. Royce's career on the forum is exciting, and his ability to prove his competence in performing his work amazes us all, despite all the crises he went through. It is true that a large percentage of bitcointalk community trust him, but this does not mean that everyone is a friend. Most of these topics were published by new accounts controlled by members who do not want to use their accounts in order to target his reputation and destroy him for nothing but because he is successful. Unfortunately, the enemies of success do always exist.Secondly, in any campaign there is a rule that says that the campaign manager has the right to remove any member as he deems appropriate for the success of the campaign. I don't think anyone has the right to be angry about this.",
