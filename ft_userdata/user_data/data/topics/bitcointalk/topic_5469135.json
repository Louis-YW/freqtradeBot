  "content": "Hi,Let's say you purchase crypto assets via a dollar cost average method every month for 5 years. Or you mined BTC or ETH (when it was POW) over a period of 5 years. Each month your BTC or ETH balance increases. The asset prices go up and down during this period. Which means your purchase price varies over this time period.Then in the 6th year you cash out say 1 BTC or 10 ETH. How do you determine which BTC or ETH you just sold? Was it the BTC / ETH you bought / mined in the first year? Or the second, third, fourth or fifth years? If you mined BTC / ETH I understand that you have to pay income tax at the price you were paid every year. The capital gains tax is what confuses me. There is no way to tell when you sell BTC or ETH, at which year it was acquired. It's just all pooled into one wallet.Example:Year 1:Bought 1 BTC for $20,000Year 2:Bought 1 BTC for $30,000Year 3:Bought 1 BTC for $15,000Year 4:Bought 1 BTC for $10,000Year 5:Bought 1 BTC for $12,000Balance after 5 years:5 BTCYear 6:Sell 1 BTC for $25,000.What is your capital gains tax? Which BTC is used to calculate the capital gains tax? Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?",

      "body": "Edit: I found this link which is helpful. Still not sure how to actually implement it.Examples of using each cost basis accounting methodLet's assume that an investor purchases 5 BTC over time, with the following prices and dates of purchase:- January 1, 2021: 1 BTC for $10,000- February 1, 2021: 1 BTC for $12,000- March 1, 2021: 1 BTC for $9,000- April 1, 2021: 1 BTC for $15,000- May 1, 2021: 1 BTC for $18,000The investor sells 3 BTC on September 1, 2021, each for $20,000 for a total of $60,000Using FIFO:Under FIFO, the investor will sell the first three BTC purchased: those bought on January 1, February 1, and March 1. The cost basis will be calculated by adding the purchase prices of those three units as follows:- Cost basis = ($10,000 + $12,000 + $9,000) = $31,000.The profit realized on the sale will be:- Profit = $60,000 - $31,000 = $29,000Using LIFO:Under LIFO, the investor will sell the three most recently purchased units: those bought on March 1, April 1, and May 1. The cost basis will be calculated by adding the purchase prices of those three units as follows:- Cost basis = ($9,000 + $15,000 + $18,000) = $42,000.The profit realized on the sale will be:- Profit = $60,000 - $42,000 = $18,000Using HIFO:Under HIFO, the investor will use the three highest-cost Bitcoins as follows:- Cost basis = ($18,000 + $15,000 + $12,000) = $45,000The profit realized on the sale will be:- Profit = $60,000 - $45,000 = $15,000As you can see, each cost basis accounting method results in a different profit and tax liability for the investor. It's important to understand the pros and cons of each method and choose the one that works best for your specific situation.https://www.accointing.com/en-US/blog/crypto-cost-basis",

Which BTC is used to calculate the capital gains tax? Year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?There are several accounting methodologies to account for the \"inventory\", typically FIFO, LIFO or even average cost. the laws in your country will allow you to use either one or more of these. It is very common that they consider that you have sold the one you bought the cheapest, so that the benefit is the maximum and you pay more taxes sooner than later. So, this is something specific to your jurisdiction I am afraid, nothing that can be generalised.",

      "body": "Bitcoin works differently than Ethereum.In Bitcoin there are UTXOs. You can imagine them as dollar bills. So, if in year 1 you buy 1 BTC and send it to your wallet, there will be 1 UTXO of 1 BTC in your wallet.If in year 2 you buy 1 BTC and send it to your wallet, there will be 1 more UTXO of 1 BTC in your wallet..........If in year N you buy 1 BTC and send it to your wallet, there will be 1 more UTXO of 1 BTC in your wallet.So, if in year N+1 you decide to sell, you can decide which UTXO you want to sell. You can also sell a fraction of the UTXO, or combine multiple UTXOs and sell them.I don't know how it works with accounting but that's how it works with Bitcoin. If you know your UTXOs and also know the prices at which you bought them, you basically know which BTC you sell at every time, provided that you have a self custody wallet with coin-control ability. If you keep your Bitcoin in exchanges, then it's a whole other story and you should WITHDRAW YOUR BITCOIN FROM EXCHANGES",

For my country it is FIFO. Beyond that you may be able to write off some gains (if any) against other losses.If you are talking about the numbers you posts as real then yes consult a local tax advisor that understands crypto. There are a lot of different options and variables and getting advice from an internet forum about this is shaky at best.If the amounts you posted are not real (i.e. you did not get 1 BTC for $20000 but only got 1/10 BTC for $2000) then the risk of being wrong and paying a little more in taxes is not as bad as if you bought 10BTC instead of 1BTC.-Dave",

If I have a ton of losses on my portfolio, I might use that as a chance to balance out my older BTC gains. If I don’t have any losses to offset gains then I will most likely use the last in first out method to keep taxes reduced. It’s nice to have options when tax time comes.",

In the first year you only declare the gain from your first bitcoin, so 5000 in profit and that's your taxable income. The next year you report the sale of your second bitcoin and declare 15000 in profit and pay tax from that amount. In most countries you don't have to pay any tax if you don't sell your bitcoin and don't profit from it. Both of these things have to occur for a taxable event to appear.",

If he sells 15 he will pay taxes on the first batch profits and on half of the second batch profits. In the UK the last time I checked they allowed Share Pooling so it means the median value of the bought coins versus the selling value.So, it's all about the country's tax system.Quote from: apogio on October 05, 2023, 11:47:24 AMBut what if you don't use exchanges?

There is no way  Four hours spent each day for one week at the IRS and you'll come up with a solution.  Remember, it's your problem, not theirs, from their point of view if you can't prove you have paid anything for them then they will claim it's zero so you're going to pay tax on profits for the entire selling value.",
