It is not United States Department of Justice that is in lawsuit with Ronaldo, it is people that bought the NFTs that he advertised that sued him.Ronaldo's net worth is not even up to $1 billion, but sued for $1 billion by these people that were no able to do research how those non fungible tokens can be very risky.",

What are your thoughts about this?Firstly, I don't think DOJ is doing too much, if CZ were actually proven to be using Binance to launder people's money or other criminal activity, than DOJ could pursue the case, that's their job, if Binance were cooperative to open their data, it shouldn't be problem for Binance. Secondly, the class action lawsuit towards Christiano Ronaldo wasn't by DOJ, it's made by Binance customer.",

Not CEX fan still I've spend my initial jour ney with the Biannce and that was from where my crypto journey started.",

Each NFT statue depicts Ronaldo in an iconic moment from his life, from career-defining bicycle kicks to his childhood in Portugal. On November 18, at 09:00 (UTC),45 of the highest value CR7 NFTs (5 SSR and 40 SR) will be held for auction on the Binance NFT marketplace. The auction will remain open for 24 hours, with NFTs awarded to the highest bidder. Bidding prices will start at 10,000 BUSD for SSR and 1,700 BUSD for SR. An additional 6,600 NFTs (600 R and 6,000 N) will be offered via our Subscription Mechanism Launchpad, starting at 77 BUSD for the Normal rarity.where they are paying for a picture of a footballer for prices between $77-$10k .. and the buyers could not then find other buyers to sell to.. so want to sue the guy in the photo for not being as valuable as face value first thought..well the buyers should not have accepted the offer so hastlyif what they bought was a true NFT then they own copyright of the picture they hold..the 5 guys with 5 unique super rare photos. can easily each print 2,000 posters of their property and resell the posters for $5 each to tourists and football fans to break even.. guess they dont know all the capabilities of ownership proof(copyright) of NFT and how they can turn it into real moneythat said i never looked at what technology/protocol the NFT were minted on to see if they were even true NFT.. so it could be that what they bought was not a true NFT to allow copyright claim to legally then sell reprintsalso lets do the math5 * 10,000 =50,00040 * 1,700 =68,0006000 * 77Â  =462,000seems less the $600k offer.. no where near $1b on offer",

There is conspiracy to attack this exchange in order to affect something which I'm not sure of but I solely believe that the this guy's are trying to fight some thing which is secret to them. Asking Christiano RonaldoÂ  pay $1 billion is outrageous, are they tryna bankrupt this guy?. Every single person that bought this NFT bought them to favour themselves so asking someone to pay for there mistake or problem is just stupid.",

Promoting financial services is always dangerous.That's an old promotion that Cristiano had done for Binance and they are suing him now, they are just money makers and they will find a way to extract it from anyone using a mere loophole. Those who will well for it will lose funds. It is no doubt that the whole thing is sad but for Cristiano, it might not be that's why we should not worry about him instead we should worry about Binance because it has more impact on BTC than any other player like Cristiano.He has his lawyers and it is not new for Ronaldo to pay fines he also paid fines on his cars and it was in millions, he is the biggest influencer in the world even though he might not have that on crypto but still his words make sense and if he is advertising then the platform will get consumers.

What are your thoughts about this?This is not something new, They (the US government) always try to find a way (link) to sue someone whether its a celebrity or a celebrity (hehe) CZ was also a celebrity of the crypto industry, he had a big influence over a lot of people and him accepting the accuses also put bad impact on the market. But hey all these celebrities have enough funds to face these trials.And that's a good thing because if they can't then they will be bankrupted which is bad, if CR7 then for me it's not because he has no influence over the crypto industry but CZ has. So all support here goes for CZ but in terms of Football CR7 hehe. I know it's so obvious but this can be dealt with some fine I know this because the USA is after money and they are finding ways to get it.",

They're doing their jobs actually. If Binance had not broken any rules they wouldn't have paid that much money. They are a centralized organization, so they have to follow regulations. If they don't follow the regulations they'll get punished. Apparently, the high fine on Binance was set as a warning to other exchanges that won't comply with regulation. If this will prevent another FTX-like situation then it's all good. The problem is, that regulatory bodies are against crypto as a whole, not just against the lawbreakers.",
