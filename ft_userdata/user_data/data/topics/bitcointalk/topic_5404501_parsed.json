I want to bring prosperity to the people . The project will provide , promote, and bring about progress towards programs , education, and a platform that will perform as a foundation for launching. I will bring ways for being involved/compatibility for any person to earn passive income either by performing task or starting with $1. I have the tokenomics system drafted and many features the app/project will offer . I am only one man army and having to be patient with time progressing as there’s a plethora of moving parts . I love to have finically for a true Philanthropist pioneer in this metaverse . I have passion rarely seen , good quality ppl around me that I could have help delegate work to, I refuse to be out work, always craving knowledge, and I know what needs to happen. I love 5k as minimum investment 10-50k is more ideal . I believe the has the opportunity to change the lives of many ppl forever. If you read up to here I know that the mind behind the screen wants better for man and is looking for pioneers . I ask that I get assistance to able to have an opportunity to be able to help myself with the right person. I know I can have ever lasting change brought to this planet . Allow me to plz help me lead the new generation of voices and nourish the ones to come. There is enough abundance here that everyone should not know what suffering and the sorrow we endure. The main reason why I believe in the project im creating is for the future generations of all my family and friends families  (my friends are the family I have chosen to surround myself with) I want the people I love to work with me. I want to have their skills be used for helping me bring the peace, power , and passion to the project surroundings. I have push back ,crawled thru the mud, bleed, learned lessons , and persistent. I’m all in on this and will make it happen no matter the cost for I am willing to pay the price because it worth every moment striving for it.Telegram @D2theaceYours truly,Ace The One",

Seeking support does not really portray the good character of someone who will be committed to building a project to unite humanity.Besides, you did not exactly include here a sample of this project of yours, how do you want people to believe you are working on anything or this is just a trick to get money from users",

If you are really into it, you have a options, either showcase your power what you have put into it (words only won't work). Your word though are in nice direction no doubt. But atleast you must understand that timewaster are 99% here. I guess it is better, if you are serious, show some project power. Money is not a problem here for many, but trust is the problem of everyone.",
