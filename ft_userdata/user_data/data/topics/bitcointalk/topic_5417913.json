The skeptical me is worried that because of desperation and to cause Nato to join the war, Ukraine might detonate a nuclear bomb in a city in their own country and blame it on the Russians.",

And in this case the war is not even over. I fear that the recession may be longer this time than many expect.I will tell about his tweet the same thing I usually say about this or that guy predicting bitcoin price: this kind of predictions have 0 value and they're usually biased. So you better look closely why \"near 2024\" was picked.",

But we already see that all the economies of the states are very weakened by the coronavirus pandemic, which does not want to retreat even a few years after its appearance. And then there's Russia unleashed in the center of Europe the most destructive and bloody war, which has not been since the Second World War. This war has long gone beyond the boundaries of only two states participating in it. More than 50 states voluntarily agreed to further restrict their economies by participating in economic sanctions against the aggressor country.

Last time I've checked the world economy was still not relying (yet?) on cryptocurrencies.The quoted part was telling about world economy's recession and the expected time to recover. Still, the things you wrote are pretty much unrelated to that (time).And back to crypto and your last line: while crypto can bring nice surprises indeed, it's expected that during a recession they will also not do great (if people don't have money, they won't buy, and if there is no demand, the price can only go down).",

An asset for speculation. I reckon there is nothing wrong about this, however, many people in the cryptospace appear to be in denial of this. They cannot accept that much of those who enter the cryptospace are in here to make fiat. From the forum dwellers like us to the billionaires like Michael Saylor.",

The bigger the loss, the stronger the motivation to create hype and the stronger hope that a pump will arrive soon. I am not criticizing because this is only natural behavior for us smaller investors hehe.However, when other people tell us to see reality, we attack them to defend the holiness of our cryptocoins and excommunicate them. This is like holding a certain cryptocoin has become a religion.",

I am talking about the limitations of bitcoin as a store of value, medium of exchange, a currency. If you challenge their beliefs on this, they will call you an antagonizer, a bitcoin hater or something similar to a heretic. I am not quite certain if the cannot see reality or they refuse to see it because they only want a pump.This is very head shaking behavior.",
