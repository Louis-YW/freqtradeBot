  "content": "The SEC, the American media and Binance's competitors from America. It appears Changpeng Zhao might have a very challenging year for 2023. I reckon he should ask for some business maneuvering advice from Paolo Ardoino of Tether on how to avoid a government takedown, how to manage media attacks and how to manage stress hehehe.Also, CZ should start asking for assistance from his backers from China.Coinbase has recently announced in one of their recent tweets that the exchange is planning to suspend the trading of Binance USD (BUSD). The exchange mentioned that trading will be suspended on March 13, 2023, at or around 12:00 p.m. EST.The exact reason for the delisting has not been mentioned. However, Coinbase stated that they regularly monitored the assets on the exchange to ensure they met the listing standards.Binance and BUSD are going through a tough time due to increased SEC scrutiny of stablecoin issuer Paxos. Paxos was asked to stop issuing BUSD, and the stablecoin started slipping away from its peg. However, at press time, the BUSD has regained its peg. There has also been a drop in the market cap for BUSD recently due to ongoing issues.Read in full https://watcher.guru/news/coinbase-to-suspend-binance-usd-busd-trading",

However, at press time, the BUSD has regained its peg. This \"loosing its peg\" is imho slightly exaggerated because from what I can see, in the last two weeks BUSD didn't go below $0.990.

At the current state, crypto exchanges took the worst things from banks (and unfortunately that's how many see exchanges) while offering no protection to their users.",

I think Coinbase exchange will have big problems in future with shitcoin securities, so this BUSD doesn't mean anything if we look at bigger picture.Regulators are probably going to target all stablecoins in near future, maybe because they are making move for introducing of their CBDC slave currencies.We are in big trouble if people don't realize this on time.... because you obviously wont be able to buy and sell anything without that junk.",

This is about the recognition of trust on BUSD. Coinbase made it appear to everyone in the cryptospace that BUSD is not trustworthy. Look at the market capitalization of BUSD. It is down $5 billion since announcement from Paxos. Tether is up $4 billion and USDC is up $1 billion hehehe. The whales from the cryptospace think Tether is the most trustworthy stablecoin?",

Yep, that sounds plausible. Anyway, it's a pretty interesting development if you ask me. Especially in light of the fact that a few days ago Circle's new stablecoin EUROC went live on Coinbase.Source: https://www.coinbase.com/how-to-buy/euro-coinIt seems as if Coinbase want to protect themselves against possible regulatory uncertainties, but on the other hand also push their own coins. At least it looks like Coinbase is not afraid of the SEC, because the SEC is not only targeting BUSD, but also other stablecoins.",

Given what happened, it's only a matter of time before BUSD is shut down, and it doesn't affect Binance at all. Not only is Binance moving towards TUSD, but it is also reported that they are looking for partners to produce stable coins pegged to JPY or AUD.",

It might be the backers of Sam Bankrupt-Fraud from the Democratic party hehe? CZ was the one who triggered the liquidity cascade for Alameda Research's loans backed by FTT as collateral and this also brought down FTX. Someone might want revenge against CZ hehehe.",

I think it has more to do Paxos not being able to mint BUSD anymore than Coinbase trying to hurt Binance.

After all, CZ also announced that Binance will have to move away from BUSD and start removing BUSD trading pairs eventually.

If it is limited to those two maybe USDC is better, not to mention it has larger volumes in my preferred exchanges. Other than that, maybe USDT if it is not yet dead by the time I need to swap to stablecoin. That being said, trading BTC and altcoin directly is probably the best way to do it if liquidity is good enough to do that, no more hopping around stablecoins that can go down anytime.",
