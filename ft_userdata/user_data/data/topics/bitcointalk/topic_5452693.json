Or may be if we request imgur personally to allow image linking from https://bitcointalk.org/.It seems that the most viable solution lies in imgur's willingness to allow this functionality once again. By personally reaching out to imgur and collectively expressing our desire for image linking from bitcointalk.org, there is a possibility that they may grant our request.I'm sure if certain number of people request the same thing they might allow it Here's the request form select \"I have suggestion\" or \"My topic isn't listed here\"https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/requests/new Sample request:You can copy paste below QuoteI kindly request your attention to the matter of enabling direct image linking on the esteemed Bitcoin forum, bitcointalk.org. I have been an avid user of imgur for posting images on this forum, but to my dismay, all of my images have suddenly ceased to appear on the forum. Despite their continued availability on the imgur platform, the linking functionality to bitcointalk.org seems to have become ineffective.I would greatly appreciate your assistance in permitting image linking from this esteemed hosting service on bitcointalk.org. It would be immensely valuable for me and thousands of other bitcointalk users to continue utilizing imgur as my preferred image hosting platform. Therefore, I kindly request your consideration and support in enabling bitcointalk.org image linking.Keep the subject \"Allow images linking from https://bitcointalk.org/\"https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/requests/new",

And also the console tag code which created by another member of the forum today is also good to fine out the previous uploaded images in imgur. Imgur is going to be a past site in the forum. Many people are going to abandon it because of their disappointment",
