  "content": "Hi I want to mine BTC with GPU (CUDA), does anyone recommend a miner not nicehash betterhash or those bloated ones I don't really want a big GUI just looking for something to connect with a pool on command line. I have been trying to get ccminer working but getting this errorGPU #0: result for 08742f4e does not validate on CPU!Do people still use ccminer? Would also prefer to cut out all the crap for the other coins to reduce compile time but was having trouble when deleting it from the makefile so I have kept it in for now.Is it hard to do your own what would you have to do send rpc commands to a stratum pool to receive the work and execute it on the gpu or something does anyone know of good documentation I was reading stratums but it wasn't explicit about using it for bitcoin.  thanks if anyone has suggestions or material to read",

Is there that many more btc miners to make it that difficult? Seems like there is a lot of eth miners I would assume it would have the same issues ahhh just saw the rest of your answer thanks I didnt know that",

Seems like there is a lot of eth miners I would assume it would have the same issues ahhh just saw the rest of your answer thanks I didnt know thatIt's not that sha256 is not suited for GPU's - it's that the algo is very easily implemented in 'hard wired' ASIC's without any of the other circuits that a GPU has in it. Just 1 of the chips used in Sidehacks Compac-F has 8k SHA256 cores in it. Compare that to how many cores (spread over several chips) even a top-end GPU has...Current BTC hash rate is several 100's of ExaH/s so yes, its difficulty is *very* high.",

You can have a more compact F if you are looking for profit or only have it for a lottery. The only problem is that the price is a bit expensive compared to buying used s9 miner. I hope that you are not spreading any links you can just edit your old post and merge them instead of constantly posting.And another thing is that the official thread of this Compac F can be found here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1764803.0",

More details here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415861.0Yes, however by design the coins have ZERO monetary value. Purchase and sale of them is strongly discouraged as Testnet and its coins are for testing software -- not making money... Mining them and holding them is also pretty pointless because the Testnet chain is periodically forked to render previously mined Testnet coins unusable. After a development project is over it is expected that all Testnet coins mined during testing are to be donated back to the Faucets.",
