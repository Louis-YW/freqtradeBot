Now that we are progressing in terms of technology upgrade and other innovations then it wont really be shocking that trends would really be something like this.You would really be able to see on what projects would flourish out and which projects would really be left behind and expect that if the trend would be going with AI coins or projects then expectthat the market would be flooded out by lots of AI coins in the market on which its never been something new if we do speak about it.Game changer? Yes but only a few would really be recognized heavily by the community and the rest would really be just copycats and would really be trying out to get some market share in the market on which its never been something new.",

But for off-chain operations like query the blockchain and doing stuffs with the blockchain data is one area that it currently excel. The best technological advancement of the future could be from a combination of AI and crypto technology.For trading, I'm not sure how AI could help exchanges improve their products or how it would help users make better trading decisions.",

And this happens because on the markets you are competing against other traders, and the more of them use the same strategy the lesser the reward for each of them, this is why good traders never reveal their complete strategy since it plays against their self-interests.",

I couldn't say it was a useless project because many people had already benefited from this technology but we must also know that everything has its limitation. It can be applicable to some areas but can also be not suitable to others like in trading. I'm not sure if it will be effective on gambling as I didn't try it but I think I shouldn't use it as well. So for now, we are still uncertain about the output of this technology, it is too early to draw a conclusion, and we still need to be cautious when investing.",

If you see a pattern, many AI-powered projects will be scam and die too because they don't have own data centers to collect data and analyze data. They are like tokens which operate on a blockchain of a big project like Ethereum. If Ethereum die or stop support those tokens, those token projects will be dead.AI-powered projects which don't have their own data centers, will be affected a lot by policies of giant corporations like Microsoft for data.

One cannot just Begin to invest in every project that shows itself to be AI-based because the majority of them will be scams. There is one of my bosses who really made a huge profit with a few Defi project, but before then he had really made investments with a lot of Defi that turns shitcoins along the line, but he just kept investing (more like he was gambling then). He just had the money to waste, but when he profited with a few, he really made back almost all the funds he wasted on other shitcoins. Who is ready to make such a gamble on those emerging altcoins?",

If an investor is knowledgeable, he or she will not fall victim to scammers who convince to use AI. They will always consider very carefully before making a decision, which is why most of their decisions have a better possibility of success.

Don't worry, very soon another hype will soon emerge and they will sheeply invested and waste money without any profit for 365 days, isn't that shameful!",

AI-related crypto projects can surely gain good from this hype. I will say it is hype most of the Ai projects currently are having lacking vision. Some of them are really mindblowing but as for the metaverse, the Ai is also a bubble at least for now. it will take time to setup.",
