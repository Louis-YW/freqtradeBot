I've got the complete set of silvers...  I had hoped to sell my brass coins before breaking the set up though.  However, money is a loud talker and I'm always looking to score more BTC.  If you want to make me an offer I can't refuse via PM, I'd be open to hearing it.  I'd consider me a last resort though.  There are no doubt people who are less attached to their collection and willing to accept lower offers.",
