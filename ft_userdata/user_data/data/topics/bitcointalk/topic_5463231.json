And one thing that has always united them is the fact that usually don't even understand what words \"truth\" or \"evidence\" mean. And looks like this is one of them vague posts. I am guessing you live in somewhere where this war doesn't affect you that much, so just be happy that you have buffer states between russia and you, as you don't seem to have a grasp of hard reality that's war. Or basics of empathy  if you think war is fun or personal show for you .And again for some reason, this war has nothign to do with the fact that Putin decided to attack in sovereign country? Or that Russia is bombing civilians and is threat to whole EU? No, obviously it's just a magic show for you. You know you can learn empathy. You shoud try it.",

It's cool to be in the know, but sticking to info that's backed up by facts is super important. And about that war affecting Europe's economy, it's not quite right to say the EU is totally done for or that Germany and France can't handle things on their own. Oh, and the idea that Greece isn't up for working with Germany anymore? Not exactly the full story.Let's remember, war isn't just some game – it's real people's lives we're talking about. So, how about we aim for empathy and chat responsibly about this?",

But you can expect defense-industrial complexes to be springing up anywhere in the world where there is some kind of an advantage for them to be there.The Mad Propaganda Push To Normalize War-Profiteering In Ukrainehttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/mad-propaganda-push-normalize-war-profiteering-ukraineThere's been an astonishingly brazen propaganda push to normalize war profiteering in Ukraine as Kyiv coordinates with the arms industry and western governments to convert the war-ravaged nation into a major domestic weapons manufacturer, thereby turning Ukrainians into proxies of the military industrial complex as well as the Pentagon.At an event in Kyiv which hosted 250 \"defense\" industry corporations from 30 different countries on Friday, President Zelensky gave a speech urging war profiteers to open factories in Ukraine to cut out the middleman of securing and delivering so many weapons from abroad. This is an investment that the arms industry would ostensibly have plenty of time to set up, given that western officials are now going out of their way to communicate to the public that this war will stretch on for many more years to come.Zelensky's speech twice made use of the phrase \"defense-industrial complex\", and used the phrase \"arsenal of the free world\" no fewer than three times.\"Ukraine is developing a special economic regime for the defense-industrial complex,\" Zelensky said. \"To give all the opportunities to realize their potential to every company that works for the sake of defense — in Ukraine and with Ukraine or that wants to come to Ukraine.\"\"Right now, the most powerful military-industrial complexes are being determined, as are their priorities and the global standard of defense. All of this is being determined in Ukraine,\" Zelensky tweeted with photos from the event.----------Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Boлoдимиp Зeлeнcький@ZelenskyyUa·FollowWe held the first Defense Industries Forum in Ukraine gathering 252 leading defense companies from over 30 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia.Right now, the most powerful military-industrial complexes are being determined, as are their priorities and the… Show more...",

It is not only \"not hidden\" it is more like published all over every single day. The rest of your claims are of someone who is trying to interpret this without the minimally required understanding of the world.Just go and pretend to be smart somewhere else, here posts like this shit are a cent per 100 units.",

I can agree that since the exit of the United Kingdom, the strength of the Union has been questioned and it is possible some countries would consider whether it is advantageous to stay, but to me it does not make much sense to star a war in Ukraine due to that.",

You saw the first thing the West did was blow up the pipeline to give themselves a hand up in selling them oil. Now we’re trying to exhaust Russia’s finances to cripple their ability to mine/deliver more of their resources to Ukraine and force them to sell to other countries at a discount.",

Who is going to conquer the West now that they are out of weapons?NATO At 'Bottom Of Barrel' Of Weapons Stockpileshttps://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/nato-bottom-barrel-weapons-stockpilesDutch Adm. Rob Bauer made the comments on the first day of the Warsaw Security Forum. He said NATO military budgets increased before the Russian invasion but that the Western arms industry did not increase production capacity.\"And that has led to higher prices already before the war. And that actually has (been) exacerbated by the fact that we now give away weapon systems to Ukraine, which is great, and ammunition, but not from full warehouses,\" Bauer said, according to TVP World.\"We started to give away from half-full or lower warehouses in Europe and therefore the bottom of the barrel is now visible. And we need the industry to ramp up production at a much higher tempo and we need large volumes,\" he added.According to more from Reuters:Bauer last month warned that a drastic rise in ammunition prices meant that allies' higher defense spending did not automatically translate into greater security and called for more private investment in defense companies....",
