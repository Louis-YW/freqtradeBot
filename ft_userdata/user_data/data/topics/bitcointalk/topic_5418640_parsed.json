If I am not wrong then your clients are exchangers who do the end users currency exchanges. You are providing them API?PS: It's a good ANN design but you could make it wider to fit the width 100%. By the way, If you are considering bitcointalk promotion then feel free to contact me. My team can design and manage effective promotions to build a good brand value around the community.",
