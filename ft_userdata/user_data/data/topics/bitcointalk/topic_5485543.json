I know you're trying to say that now centralized exchanges are somehow as main way to purchase Bitcoin and something like that, but that doesn't mean that Bitcoin is centralized itself. Those are just exchanges which someone may need to use in order to purchase Bitcoin and by the way it can still be purchased from decentralized exchanges.Regulators have always been trying to regulate Bitcoin and make it regulated but that's not possible for anyone to do. Now, it's more considered as an asset than a p2p payment system but still it works as a p2p payment system and no one controls it other than the wallet owners. You still don't need any third party's permission to transfer your Bitcoin and that's enough to say that it's still as decentralized as it used to be during the times of Satoshi Nakamoto.",

Those two things are very much true. No person, govt, company, organization, etc can stop bitcoin or control who has access to it. Govts can of course make laws that say it is illegal for their citizens to participate, but they can't actually stop or control access to it entirely.Look at essentially any other cryptocurrency and you'll find some governing/controlling body residing over that crypto that basically has final control over what direction the crypto takes, and that serves as a single point of failure for that crypto that govt can go after. Bitcoin is simply a technology that runs on many many computers all over the world. I compare it to the end of Terminator 3 when the main characters realize the can't shut SkyNet down because there is nothing to shut down, its just software that runs on computers all over the world. That's decentralization, and that's what Bitcoin has. That doesn't mean its perfectly decentralized, nothing can be. But it absolutely has operational decentralization that gives it the protection that is the goal of decentralization.",

However since no one can stop this, the big answer is still no. Yes on trading there are some who are buying and selling it as investment purposes but the users can able to use bitcoin freely within decentralized space as long as they want.

You can read if you want. 12 years later and people still don't know to use Bitcoin nor what it's good forI read the post, there is information given why it is better not to use exchanges and banks, the topic of anonymity is not disclosed. Everyone knows that all transactions remain on the blockchain and all bitcoin movements can be tracked. Therefore, you cannot remain 100% anonymous. In any case, third parties may receive information about you or your bitcoin address, for example, from the person to whom you sold bitcoin or from whom you bought it, if he is not anonymous enough. And then further study your transactions and search for data about you. There are many examples where the police have found people who stole bitcoins if they did not use mixers or Monero.Bitcoin is decentralized, but I think that it is not anonymous enough if you do not make additional efforts to anonymityRead the article about the \"Crypto Dust Attack\", this is one of the methods of establishing the identity of the owner of the crypto wallet.https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-crypto-dusting-attack-and-how-do-you-avoid-ithttps://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-dusting-attack-bitcoin",

Now is clearly better. Exactly. Bitcoin didn't actually become decentralized until Satoshi left, given his control over it. Similar to Buterin with Ethereum, people try to claim Ethereum is decentralized, but one of the major points against that is that Buterin essentially controls Ethereum, whatever he and the other top people decide is what happens with Ethereum, and those top people in Ethereum are never going to relinquish their control. I would bet part of the reason why Satoshi left is because he knew his vision for Bitcoin could never be achieved as long as he stayed.As for the things that people normally complain about when trying to say Bitcoin is not decentralized, those things are simply the natural result of Bitcoin's growth. Stuff like mining companies and mining pools are the natural consequence of the PoW mining that Satoshi used. Centralized exchanges are the natural consequence of people wanting to be able to easily buy and sell Bitcoin. ETFs, and wealthy people or companies or governments owning Bitcoin is the natural consequence of Bitcoin getting popular. These are simply the consequences of Bitcoin's natural growth. Bitcoin is now far more decentralized than it was in Satoshi's day. Though we do need decentralized privacy-keeping options for buying and selling so everything doesn't just go through centralized exchanges. As far as I know decentralized exchanges for Bitcoin are very small and therefore not good places to buy and sell.I'd say the ultimate test for Bitcion is:1. Can it be shut down?     The answer is no, never.2. Can it be co-opted and controlled?     The answer appears to be no, never.3. Can anyone gain access to and use Bitcoin?     The answer is mostly yes, though in countries with tighter internet controls on the population and more restrictive controls on society the answer is more like you have to get creative and risk illegality to do so.4. Can people preserve their privacy while using Bitcoin?     This one is the only one where Bitcoin doesn't currently score great. You CAN, but its hard to, because the main way to get Bitcoin is through centralized exchanges, and then there are companies whose whole goal is to try to track anyone who goes through centralized exchanges. This is where a larger decentralized exchange ecosystem would come in handy, and it would also help out question #3 a bit as well. But also you have to realize that it is going to be impossible to have perfect privacy, so the answer to this will never be a perfect yes. Because even in a world where you obtain your bitcoin with perfect privacy, when you would use bitcoin to buy something online you have to put in your address, which is associated with your identity, and therefore your identity is then linked to your bitcoin address, and that is the type of information govts would request from companies in order to track where money flows. But still, Bitcoin DEXes getting popular and useful for the average person would I think be the final piece of making sure Bitcoin retains Satoshi's vision for it.",

I mean, as time passes, more and more people get to know about bitcoin. Many of them dive deeper inside the rabbit hole and they decide to mine and run their own nodes. These 2 actions improve bitcoin's decentralization. So as far as I am concerned, bitcoin is more decentralized now, but if you want my opinion, it could have been even more decentralized, especially in terms of nodes. Because running nodes is much much cheaper and easier than mining. So, I reckon that the number of active nodes (we can only estimate how many there are), should have been larger. According to bitnodes there are ~50k nodes. Of course the real number is higher, but again, I would like to see it growing much more.",

The price is growing and will grow more, the network has seen a solid growth from transaction to speed without compromising decentralization and scalability, thanks to segwit sofyfork and lastly the LN even if the adoption hasn't been massive as many people anticipate for its growth.Bitcoin ETF are not my problem because Bitcoin is an open market, anyone with money can buy as long as they has money and they can do whatever they like with their bitcoin. As long as 80% of people hold the remaining circulating supply, the rest can do what they think it's good for Bitcoin instead of focusing on the main vision of Satoshi.However, even if there are some places Satoshi can't be impressed about Bitcoin, he knows what government is capable of doing and I believe that was the reason why he went into hidden to protect the network, the people around him and the investors because he knows that the government don't like anything related to what they can't control and Bitcoin isn't that of asset you can control and that's pain them.",

Whether it did or didn't, Satoshi's got no say in how bitcoin works anymore at this point. His brainchild's began to grow its own pair of wings and fly away from the coop, away from Satoshi's influence and reach so no matter how much bitcoin's strayed from the ideal path that Satoshi has created, if he even created any in the first place, it wouldn't matter at all because bitcoin's the people's property now and not his. Personally speaking I think Satoshi even intended for it to be this way, otherwise he wouldn't implement a specific feature that will eventually centralize the whole supply of the network to the few millions/thousands of users at the upper echelon of the bitcoin hierarchy. He understands that bitcoin, as decentralized as it is isn't going to be decentralized through and through, and would require a little bit of centralization to service millions of people with no issue. I think you're overthinking this, the fact that you're appealing to someone who didn't even bother to show his/her/their face to the public's a little too tangential. I say you focus on your investment first and foremost if you have any, and make Satoshi's desires the least of your worries.",
