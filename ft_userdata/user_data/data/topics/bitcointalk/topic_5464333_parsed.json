  "content": "It is already confirmed and has been reported by several outlets that Jerwin Ancajas will challenge Takuma Inoue for the WBA bantamweight title. So Ancajas a former champion at IBF junior bantamweight will have the first crack at the brother of Naoya Inoue as he will defend his bantamweight.Interesting to note though that the fight is going to be in Japan. So Jerwin will have to travel to the Inoue's homecourt and try to get back that belt.https://www.boxingscene.com/takuma-inoue-jerwin-ancajas-wba-bantamweight-title-fight-set-november-15-japan--177163",

And it's good that he had a good tune up fight and won by a knockout.And if I'm not mistaken, Takuma is not as good as Naoya in my opinion. So it's another good chance for Ancajas to become a world champion again. I don't think that fighting in Japan will be a issue for him. It's that he needs to prepare more here and show that he can still bring honor to his country with another win in the road against another Inoue.",

Maybe some may think that Takuma have great advantage on this match but actually I will go with Ancajas this time since he is not great in my opinion the same as his brother. But let see he's fighting on his home and maybe crowd cheering can help him to get hype and gain extra energy for this fight. I also don't mean that Takuma will be easy for Ancajas but he really need to put a big work with this knowing that he's opponent is comfortable on a place where their fight will be held.",

But in this weight class, I think he could be more stronger now and yeah, he won via KO in his last fight so he could be back already.And I do agree that this is a good fight specially for Jerwin Ancajas. And if I'm not mistaken he is promoted by MP as well so it's good to see that they have prioritized their boxers like Jerwin here and then Tapales taking on the other Inoue.My prediction is that Ancajas could win here via KO or he can bring his power to this division.",

It's that he carries the name of Inoue's so everyone thought that he could be as great if not greater boxer.So I will also go and vote for Jerwin Ancajas, he used to be one of the best Jr bantamweight and defending that belt many time and some of his win are in the KO category. And with that I wouldn't be surprised that even if he travels to Japan, he could score a scary KO against Takuma in front of his fans.",

Takuma Inoue is not as good as his brother, so I'm confident that Ancajas will be able to win the belt. His brother's only loss is against Nordine Oubaali, who was KO'd by Donaire in their fight. Judging from that, we already know what kind of quality fighter he is.",

He really needed that KO/TKO win against Takuma Inoue, who is currently the champion, as we cannot trust the judges who are on their home court. This is why some boxers do not fight outside their country, due to the possibility that the fight result might be manipulated. Ancajas was once hyped as a boxer, but his two losses made him disappear for a while from the championship discussions. So, it's time for him to come back by beating the brother of Inoue. Who knows, he might even become a unified or undisputed champion in the bantamweight division.",

I think Ancajas still can box Though he didn't improve since he kept losing his fights against Fernando Martínez, he still has the power and the ability to upset his opponent especially when they underestimate him. There will be no better chance for him to regain his honor than fighting Takuma Inoue and adding some winning streaks to his record in order to get the chance to win another championship belt in their weight division.",

Ancajas has an advantage when it comes to experience but Inoue being younger than him is faster and that's what he should careful about especially when he has consistent defeat in the past.He needs to train and improve more or else he will lose his spotlight again just like what happened to his last match. It will still be a good and exciting match for sure but I hope Ancajas will take all the negative comments and doubts against him as a motivation to improve his skills on the ring again.",

I also voted for Takuma Inoue by decision. As much as I would like to see Jerwin Ancajas getting another belt, I just see nothing special in him anymore. There is nothing new to him anymore which is not good as his opponents already read his moves and style. I wish he could demand a change of trainer so he can learn new tricks and strategies but I guess he is not the one deciding for his own career. I also do not like people around him vlogging. Jerwin's only chance of winning here is to hurt Takuma or much better if he stops him. Maybe set up a counter hook because I felt like Takuma would try to hurt or KO Jerwin.Takuma Inoue is one hungry champion eager to prove that he is also a good fighter just like his brother. He should be able to win an easy decision here unless he tries to go toe-on-toe with Jerwin or he gets reckless.",

But he comes back in a tune up fight and won by ko/tko.Yes, it was the younger brother of Naoya Inoue and others are comparing them. However, I do not think that Takuma possesses the same power as his brother that's why maybe Ancajas has a chance to get back that belt and become a world champion once more.",

I know it's early to say that Ancajas might redeem the throne but I'm confident to say that he got way more chances in this fight against Takuma and yes, that experience alone will speak for Ancajas on why he got a good chance in this fight.",
