  "content": "Hello. I am fairly new to the osmosis liquidity pools and have some questions that someone here can probably answer.How do the rewards get distributed?I have scoured the internet and cannot figure it out. So I will just explain it here and hope someone answers...I am invested into Osmosis Pool #1- Atom/OsmoI superfluid stake the Osmo.The reward calculation says 19%APYComprised of:- Fees ~ 2.5 %- superfluid staking ~ 3.5 %- External added osmo ~ 13 %OK. That all sounds great. I do get a daily distribution in osmosis - BUT!!!Every attempt to calculate the APY based on the daily distribution of OSMO received is way lower than 19%. My calculation is: (daily reward X 365) / (OSMO LP Balance X 2)   and that comes out to something like 8% APY.SO. What am I missing?I am used to LP shares gaining value from the FEES in other protocols... Do the LP shares in OSMOS gain the fees so the Atom/Osmo value grows?Either way, that still wouldn't explain an 8% APY... as the External Added Osmo is supposed to be 13%Anyone? Thank you?",
