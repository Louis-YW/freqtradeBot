Something new might happen, probably the halving event ATH will be created in this year instead of next year, who knows.Looking at the table, I have this feeling of I cannot explain. The halving of 2024 will be very difficult to predict because  there are many complex, interacting variables at play and it is way unique and than those of 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2020. We cannot tell if the price day after, will slump further or that it pulls back 30 days after, as the reduced issuance rate gets priced in. With institutional investors buying, this is different from the other halving's we have experienced. I think that a new record and history will be made.",

The op's link indeed doesn't work, and Nicehash link, provided by Poker Player, says that halving is in 1 day and 23 hours. Another website says it's 1 day and 16 hours away, so the estimates vary. If it's op's first halving, it can be pretty exciting. As for me, it's my third one, I believe, so it's just the end of a cycle and a start of a new one. It won't have any direct impact on the price, nothing magical will happen around April 20.

If that's the case then we shouldn't be expecting a new ATH because we have already seen the last for this year's halving which is $73k (new ATH) if I'm not mistaken. I still don't get it why things are being mixed up, but let's see how it will be like with the  countdown.",

It would be more remarkable for you, if you get to witness the halving with some Bitcoins in your wallet , so as you get a first hand experience on how it is. As we anticipate the halving, am sure many investors are psyched up to take advantage of the bull run that precedes and for those who DCA, it's not of much consequence because we will maintain same ratio to meet the target we have set for ourselves, unless we do otherwise.",

Of course I don't think so, every bitcoin moment is really Worth celebrating but it I'm to make a direct point then I'd consider the bull run when the ATH is most remarkable moments in the bitcoin market cap to be most warrant celebration because it's period of time investors gives count of most profitablities to their holdings in the main time of their investment until the next circle.We'd keep believing that any future terms of details about bitcoin would always be assumptions.So obviously your speculation about the halving in comparing to your recent bitcoin value in the market cap was wrong.We're expecting the bitcoin halving yes, but no don't know when it would come but as at now there's no such to say we've dipped in to the halving yet.Check out the bitcoin price at when I made this post and when you made yours then you'd notice even an increase of bitcoin price instead of depreciating. That's if we were actually and already at the pool of the halving.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/Less before I forget, Happy Birthday to you OP.",

What I feel is that the situation have changed and we might see Bitcon taking a deep dive in the red zone. What I am confident is that a country like Israel will not stop. If that country attacks then there will be a global energy crisis and that situation would let to a big catastrophic across the world. I don't think that Bitcoin would be to counter the situation as in the past with COVID 19. At that time everyone was trying to save themselves from the virus and also from their economic downfall as the fiat market was going down. In the current situation they will not have time to do it as the inflation and pay parity index will be overwhelming. I don't thing that the upcoming 2024 will be good for us or for Bitcoin.",

I don't want to spoil your excitement, but I need to remind you that when the halving event happens, it doesn't mean it will immediately trigger a bull run for bitcoin. Halving can be considered the most important event of bitcoin and bitcoin investors wait for this event no differently than people welcome a new year with the hope of having more joy and better things in life. But don't forget that this is also a financial market and things will not go as we expect and especially when the crowd gets too excited, bitcoin may move in the opposite direction. Like what happened in recent days, most people expected that as the halving approached, bitcoin would continue to increase in price but finally. Bitcoin is still in the correction phase.",

Good for you if the halving will happen on your birthday so just treat it as it is. The price though might take some time to increase and the immediate effect of the halving will not be felt. It might take weeks or months before we can see the price moving up. The current price is $62k++, so it's good for us to see above $60k during halving time and if by conservative estimates we might look at x2, then it will be $120k new all time high next year.",
