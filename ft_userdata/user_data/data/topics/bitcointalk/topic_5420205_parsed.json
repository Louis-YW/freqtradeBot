      "body": "It is commonly said that a man's food can be another man's poison and its true..Personally, to be sincere now, I used to see gamblers as irresponsible people indeed, I used to see them as wasteful people and peeps without a future since to me, it seems they waste lot of money gambling and even when they win, it is never evident in them, I believed all until until I started gambling myself,.And today, I hide my gambling activities from my wife, this is because she's a kind of person that will joy with you when you bring some thing to the table, but when you loose money no matter how small, it becomes a problem for her, she will start reminding you the better thing you would have done with that money.... This is why I keep my gambling activities away from her, and thanks to online casinos that have come and made gambling way more easier,  now I gamble from the comfort of my home, I don't have to go out anymore and be queried like a kid when I don't come back home on time.I also keep my gambling activities from my pastor, and church members, no special reason though but I feel that if my pastors or any member of my church knows I gamble, they might take me unserious and wasteful, just the same way I used to think gamblers are, until I started gambling.",

I have tried to convince her this depends on the individual but she insisted that she has witnessed it twice from different people. I also hide it from my church members I don't know why but I feel it should be a secret in other for them to know am someone that can be relied on in carrying out the church activities with trusting",

And If I remember, there were similar threads in the past, like if the person holds a public office but he was a gambler, what he should do? And I think the members here are split, whether to hide or it's better to just stop gambling but it's hard to do.Or if you are being hire by companies to manage funds or funds of others, I think that's one thing for sure that you need to hide from your employer because of the sensitive nature of your job as you might be tempted to steal just to continue with your gambling activity.",

Probably the worst enemy of gambling companies, I manage to pull in a few hundred a year through taking advantage of all the various promotions and free bets that are available every day consistently. Sometimes you'll even get lucky and win one of the bigger amounts out there if you play competitions long enough. Like guessing the outright winner of 5 horse races, it only takes 1 win out of 2 years of trying free entries to get yourself a rather large fortune but many people will only ever play the game once or twice.",
