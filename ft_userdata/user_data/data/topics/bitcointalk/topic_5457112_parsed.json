  "content": "solvedusername - DeradulloOn June 7, I registered on the site and made the first deposit of 1300 $June 8 After the game, I won and asked for money for withdrawal. Immediately received a notification in the mail - you need to pass the KYC verification. On the same day I passed it, and the next day I received a payment.Now my account is fully verified! It is important!On June 10, I make a deposit of 1200 dollars. I lose everythingJune 11th I deposit $1900. I lose everythingJune 16 I make a deposit of 2000 $. After the game, my account becomes 6375 $June 20 in the morning I make a withdrawal request.Fortunjack won't pay out my money citing some standard check...Tonight June 21 in the evening they send me an email saying that my account was linked to some other account, which was previously blocked for some bad actions and now all my winnings are canceled! I that I can only take the deposit because they are so kind!As a result, my deposit was 6375 dollars, and they allowed me to withdraw only 4550 dollars!!!$1,850 was withheld!I repeat once again - my account has been fully verified! While I was losing, Fortunjack turned a blind eye to everything??? Or was there no connection? But as soon as you saw a large amount on my account, you immediately didn’t want to pay???Now my account is already blocked. Fortunjack covers his tracks very quickly. If you ask me to make new screenshots, I won't be able to make them for you. But I have done some.My deposits and my balance - https://prnt.sc/Fr35N2X5Jvw6Ask KYC - https://prnt.sc/BhdzupGtGMidKYC finished - https://prnt.sc/OkoU2ubqAHo_Delay of my last withdrawal - https://prnt.sc/W0sr7AMosFp2fortunejack not want pay - https://prnt.sc/YxtyeVc9qemMFortunjack is not consistent in his actions! A fully verified account suddenly decided to be accused of having links with some other accounts!Clearly a scam!Fortujek, you can close the dialogue by mail! And here you will have to answer for your theft!In order to close this dispute, I demand the return of my honestly won money!Fortunjack, you have no right to steal money unilaterally like that! And then close the dialogue!I have verified my identity! You are obliged to carry out such a check on each account so that there are no matches! Then people will bet safely!I hope that a representative of the bookmaker will join this thread and solve the existing misunderstanding !!!",

      "body": "Fortunejack should have tagged your account during your KYC verification process if there is any problem like your account being linked to another block player.  It should have been implemented right on the spot while you are processing KYC but they did not.  It is somehow suspicious but probably they noticed it after you successfully passed the KYC reason why  I think they are trying to void you of your claim on your winnings which is obvious when they stated that they are only sending your deposit back. If this is the case then fortune jack is quite generous since you should only take back $2k  since your previous deposit is already lost.Another thing, it is also possible that they tally your deposits, winnings, and losses.  Since your first deposit won some amount, it is possible that they deducted the amount won on that day from the total deposit you made on a later date.",

A free VPN connection is available for anyone to use and mostly the casino sites don't block VPN connections because they want more gamblers on their patform. If a gambler who uses VPN has done some kind of malicious activity could get his account frozen, but in your case your funds are frozen because of someone else's malicious activity who seemed to use the same IP address that you used. In that case we can't consider the casino a scam and accusing them for scamming isn't fair.I agree that your IP address is not written on your passport and that's why they are allowing you to withdraw your deposit. The only thing you can do now is to tell them to allow you to withdraw all the deposits that you have made on their site. If they allow you to have all your deposits back in your account then that's the best thing for you. I recommend you to be careful with a VPN connection next time because sometimes it could cause problems with the casino sites. Next time you should use a dedicated VPN for big casinos if needed because there might be many gamblers who could be using the same free VPN on such sites, and if any one of those gamblers makes a malicious activity then the all users could be in problem.",

Although the connection to the IP address is 100% false.And now you are comforting me. And you say that the bookmaker can do this???  NO CANT. This is theft!Identity verification is specially made for this! If you see two accounts that you suspect are connected, then you have no right to accuse them of multi-accounting - these are all guesses. You must block two accounts and require them to pass verification! That is what it is for. If the account refuses to pass verification, then you can somehow withdraw money, although in this case, not everything is clear!The bookmaker must create conditions under which he can always refuse a player to accept bets, but must never cancel a win! This is the main condition for fair play!The bookmaker should improve himself, and not figure out how to deceive the players!\"Made your bets, and then we will decide whether to pay you or not\"You know, today I read a lot of all sorts of complaints about cheating, and most of them are just about the use of bookmaker's mistakes, some kind of robots. And in my case, the bookmaker does not even try to say that I had dishonest bets. (My last bet was on Finland winning the match with Slovenia.) The bookmaker just verified my account first, and then decided not to pay!I completely disagree with your position! I would accept your position if the bookmaker, during verification, immediately indicated to me that I have a connection with another account and refused to pay. But in my situation, this is generally irrelevant! What if I lost??? would I then have a verified unblocked account on which it is impossible to win *about balancesthere in the last link it is written in detail about balances and payments. The bookmaker calculated the amount of all my deposits and withdrawals and decided to return the balance, plus decided to keep the game!You write to me that \"maybe the bookmaker did not notice the connection with another account, and then he saw this connection.\"I then want to ask you a question - How then can ordinary players understand that they are safe and that they can beat the bookmaker and are not afraid that bets will be cancelled? your friend came to visit you, played on your Wi-Fi and here's the link for your account!You see, there are facts that can be verified in my case. And there are actions of the bookmaker that are not consistent and we cannot even check them in any way!When you are a giant betting company or even a giant gaming machine, that $1,830 is very little money for you! But for me it was a player, maybe a lot of money. You must be consistent in your decisions! You have to give guarantees to the players. The account is verified - there is no way back! Now you are setting a precedent where your verified users will have a clear idea that you are not safe! If you wish, you will not be paid your winnings! some people live the dream of winning big. They play free predictions all their lives for a big prize, and then it turns out that they won’t pay for it !!! but because they found another account that once belonged to a scammer, now we will give you back your deposits. Goodbye! It's horrible!",

Tell the idiot who doesn't want to take advantage of the bonuses offered by the bookmaker? Do you think this is a coincidence??? This is not a coincidence!3. Look at my bets https://prnt.sc/-V98g3_fxaK1 They are all made for super top events Champions League, Euro qualifiers, Italy Serie A, To win the favorite! Do you seriously think this is a coincidence?You just admitted that you verified my account first and there was no problem for you. And only after a request for a withdrawal of a large amount, you decided to look for something to get to the bottom of!YOU are so good, you give us a bonus when registering, and then you write that abuse of the bonus is strictly prohibited! How shoud I understand this? Do you give it or not?Now everyone will understand for themselves how you work! You find the reason without difficulty to take away the winnings. You consider yourself clean because you returned the deposit, but if I lost everything, then there would never be any problems and you would be in a very big plus!The return of the deposit is not a gesture of good will! You accepted a bet and refused to pay out the winnings on an indirect pretext on an account that has already been fully verified! This is theft!Account verification is carried out by you. This is your face! recognizing the account as fully verified is your guarantee that the account has the right to place bets and not be afraid of some kind of \"coincidence\" because of which you can then lose all the winnings. YOU gave me such a guarantee! And now you are telling stories about how you suddenly decided to re-verify and decided not to pay... After that, your face is worth nothing!As a result: Your words could only have taken place before the account verification. The fact that at first you didn’t have any questions about your account, and after winning you changed your mind is a bad form!I do not despise your decision! I think that on indirect guesses you do not have the right to do so and are obliged to return my winnings to me!",

And it doesn't necessarily proof that you did the KYC fair and square. Not that I am saying you faked it, but I've haunted this board way too long that I am well aware of malpractice in KYC verification. Ranging from buying credentials, to using someone else's ID, that I know people shouldn't just take statements as-is. This is not the first case I attended where someone passed KYC and later found trying to abuse the platform by faking credentials.However, I'd also like to know the basis taken by FJ for this accusation. Lest it be baseless and wrongful. The forum are open and stand in neutral ground. FortuneJack, if you're still attending this thread and wouldn't mind to answer some follow-up questions, does all the other accounts suspected to be related to OP has also done their KYC? Do their photos or other details on the document bring a connection to OP? You don't have to divulge it here, just a simple yes or no would be much appreciated.",

If they have evaluated the case and concluded they will not pay on the basis of fraud taking place as well as the OP willingly sign up to terms and conditions that he is now (allegedly) in breach of, there is not much he can do.FortuneJack seem to have paid back deposits but are not willing to pay winnings based on fraud. If the OP wants to take this to a complaints tribunal then he really should proceed if he believes he is in the right.Quote from: PX-Z on June 22, 2023, 10:55:51 PMQuote from: FortuneJack on June 22, 2023, 01:04:08 PMThe Behavioral Analysis team discovered a common pattern among these three accounts, including similar depositing methods, participation in a specific sports event, and matching geographical locations.
