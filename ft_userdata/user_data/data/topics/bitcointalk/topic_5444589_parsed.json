But, na true shah, the rate and frequency way these thread just carry dey bump up eh, e reach watin person go dey cry out and with time, I know say people go learn to behave. Like the drastic measure way Agbe take days ago, na to tell people say, e no sweet for eye at all.Our nation na country way matter too full, I agree. But, most of this matter get threads way them fit go in.  I feel say, one thing way dey contribute to these multiple threads na improper organisation of the original or first thread. Make una try dey use time come up with better idea and broaden the scope of your thread to ensure proper discussion. No con dey carry anxiety dey create thread in just few minutes. E no reflect well on most of una way dey do this thing. Slow down and follow the forum, na the way!",
