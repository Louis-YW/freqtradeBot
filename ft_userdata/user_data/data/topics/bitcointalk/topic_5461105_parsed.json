  "content": "For many beginners, mining seems like an enticing world to explore. Recently, I have also developed an interest in cryptocurrency mining, particularly in Bitcoin mining. With my remarkably low electricity costs, it appears to be a promising opportunity for me.Amid various discussions, I came across the Iceriver series of miners, and the KS3 model, in particular, has been catching my attention. The astonishing price I found on www.asicfinder.com and the calculated daily net income left me in awe. However, as a newcomer, I am well aware that in the world of mining, risks and opportunities go hand in hand.Through comparing mining rewards data on www.f2pool.com, I discovered that the Iceriver KS3 miner generates approximately 2100 USDT per day, while the Antminer KS3 produces about 2200 USDT. This provides me with valuable insights into the profitability of mining.In making my decision, I have also given serious consideration to electricity costs. Given my electricity rate, I can anticipate a substantial income. Nevertheless, I still wish to calculate the actual return on investment and profitability.During my research, I encountered some concerns about the KS3 miner.  This serves as a reminder for me to remain vigilant, and I am torn between the two choices. I hope to receive valuable advice from someone who can shed light on my dilemma",

You won't mine BTC or any other sha256d coin with this ASIC.You could always mine some KHeavyHash's coins and convert them in BTC, but you still would'nt mine Bitcoin in this way. If you are really interested by talking about the Antminer KS3, you should open a topic in the Altcoin mining board of the forum.",

Probably the topic will be transferred to altcoin mining.",

      "body": "The Iceriver KS3 miner is not compatible with Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin uses a different algorithm called SHA-256, which requires different hardware and software. The Iceriver KS3 miner can only mine Kaspa (KAS), which is a relatively new and unknown cryptocurrency that has very low market value and liquidity. According to CoinMarketCap, as of this writing, one KAS is worth $0.03802 USD, and the total market cap of KAS is $756,995,505 USD. Do what you will with that info and good luck!",

      "body": "2200Usdt per day sounds amazing, but keep in mind that it will fall dramatically in the next weeks and you have no chance to mine a other coin with this miner.Think back to the Antminer A3 for Sia coin, this made hundreds of dollars the first week, after 1 or 2 months it dropped under 1 dollar. Same happens with the first Dash miner D3. Buy an KS0 for under $1000 so you can´t loose much, all other is a gamble.",
