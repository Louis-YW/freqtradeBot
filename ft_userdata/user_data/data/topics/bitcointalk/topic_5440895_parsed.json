For instance, I hope they don't get tagged as farmed accounts as alts with others here too. Many users were caught unawares like that in the past because they sold bounties to same users and their wallets got connected. I'm not saying that's exactly what's going to happen here. Just stating my perspective and one cent opinion.",
