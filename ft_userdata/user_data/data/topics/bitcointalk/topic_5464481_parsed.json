That's why they're also observant before doing the scam and you don't display all your sensitive information on the web or any social media platform.Quote from: Smartgoat on August 24, 2023, 10:10:21 PMwhat can we do, to avoid being a victim.Talk to your family that you should have a sign or words to say that you're actually legit the ones talking to them and vice versa. If that word isn't mentioned by the caller then that means it's not you that's calling them for help. Start to do this in circle of your family and have yourselves call sign that you and them only know it, don't tell it publicly because the scammer might know what you're up to and will also copy that call sign of yours or anything that's going to be unique and you can identify each of yourselves easily.",

      "body": "The number of scammers are increasing and the number of methods are also increasing. Scammers try to make use of new technology before a number of people know about them to defraud their victims before the technology becomes popular. For these new kind of scams, a way to avoid falling victim is to always verify and ask for reasonable evidence. I understand that friends and family are supposed to help each other, but even for that reason, no one has the right to demand my money that I disciplined myself to keep, nobody has the right to demand for it via emergency that will make me make decisions without thinking.",

This pattern of scamming has been on for long time but if you are careful then you will pick the red lines. One way you can get these red lines is to delay the process a little or stretch the conversation they will begin to be restive to continue. Also you can get hold of the trick with the third party bank account details like you did. This is also the reason some businesses don't allow third party financial transaction especially if you are requesting to withdraw like in casinos and other online business transactions because they believe any thing is possible to happen to your account like being hacked, so if you are not requesting withdrawal to be received in your account registered with them you may need to go through longer process that is not the usual just to delay you and in the process verify. We have to be careful because scammers come in different ways.",

I have also heard a similar story sometime ago and the scammers used same kind of AI voice cloning tools to scam many people by mimicking the voice of their loved ones. Sometimes we really can't decide that what to do in such situations and we become helpless because the scammers create a scenario that we can't ignore at any cost. Like in your friend's case he had no option but to send money to his friend because his friend's mother was in hospital and a good friend will most probably help in such situations without asking for much details, but your friend was smart enough that he called you because otherwise he would have lost his $2000 to a scammer. I think you've done a great job by telling us about that scamming tactic those scammers tried on your friend because such threads can educate others to be aware of such scams and they can then avoid being victim of such scams. AI is really going to cause much trouble in future, and that's why I think we should be well prepared to find solutions for those troubles in advance.",

Most casinos and exchanges are already aware of this which is why the prohibit third-party payments.",

And that's why it's easy to copy the voice of their targets.But these scammers won't just attack and call you right away. They're wise and will do some studies first on what kind of voice the victim have and they'll resonate with the voice based on what they heard.So, you probably have met or talked to them and they've got some recorder or just on their minds and have it remembered as they copy your voice and call your relatives.",
