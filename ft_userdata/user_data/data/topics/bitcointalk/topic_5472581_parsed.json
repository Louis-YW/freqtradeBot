The reason that they refuse to apologize is because they are bloodthirsty evil people (including all students, faculty, and administrators) who need to be locked up and punished severely. When I cancelled class for one fucking period because a fucker was threatening me with violence, I was punished for this.All of you who still think that college degrees are worth anything are fucked up pieces of shit. Your education is worthless. The only degree that is still worth anything is the Ph.D. because at that level, the departments filter a lot of the bullshit and the stupid people. Anything less than a Ph.D. belongs in the trash. If you talk to me about your education, and your education is anything less than a doctorate, I will give you the middle finger.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.P.S.

The Covid-19 pandemic officially ended on February 24, 2023 because the threat of WWIII is more serious, but I conjecture that Covid-19 caused the violence we see today by putting everyone in a fucked up state of mind, and this state of mind sets the stage for WWIII. Or maybe we need another pandemic released from a lab to really set us up for WWIII.",

Do you know why our teachers are here? Why do our parents bring us to college? And why do they pay our fees and bring us to a brilliant college? To this day, That we use this type of language?Also, your education is worthless then, when you don't try to educate yourself in a way your teachers want you to be. For your information, if we see people on the top tiers, these are just due to their teachers in a sense and also they are someone's teacher who taught them how to live in this society and how to earn here. Can you please tell me why teachers are here?",

B.S. degrees are only useful as stepping stones for Ph.D.'s. Anyone with just a B.S. should be considered to be an uneducated piece of trash because academic institutions are so unprofessional. But it is not the Ph.D. that is worth anything either. It is the knowledge that is worth it. I have more mathematical knowledge/skill than you and that knowledge/skill is what is valuable.Quote from: EluguHcman on November 07, 2023, 09:14:41 AMYou probably need somewhere around the corners and find yourself a comfortable place because majority of schoolars are not phD holders and the rest are either illiterates.The problem with your idea is that academic institutions refuse to apologize and they refuse to acknowledge any wrongdoing.

And people want to argue with that because they are bloodthirsty and love evil. I will therefore lump you in with those at universities who want to @#$%ing murder me. If you side with those making violent threats against me and the institutions who pander to those violent threats and who fucking punish me for taking steps to insure my own safety, then you are a waste of meat.Quote from: PytagoraZ on November 07, 2023, 12:13:36 PMYes, I know that the truth is only with you and everything else is wrong.I do not care what other people think. People are @#$%heads. People are so stupid that they would walk right into another pandemic while refusing the safety measures that I have proposed in order to prevent such a pandemic. I was looking out for my own safety, and I will reject anyone who thinks that is a bad thing. Universities hate me for looking out for my own safety because universities are full of bloodthirsty worthless chlurmcks.

After all, if you add Ph.D. after your name, you will need to demonstrate a Ph.D. level of knowledge in your area of expertise. I can do that without any problem. If you can't do that, then adding a Ph.D. to your name will make it obvious that your degree is a fake degree. If you do have enough knowledge to communicate like someone with a Ph.D., then you will most likely also have enough ethics to refuse to put Ph.D. after your name unless you actually have a Ph.D.larry_vw_1955-Your comment is the reason why I have ignored you.

And they refuse to apologize for this shit. The reason that they refuse to apologize is because they are bloodthirsty evil people (including all students, faculty, and administrators) who need to be locked up and punished severely. When I cancelled class for one fucking period because a fucker was threatening me with violence, I was punished for this.you would need to provide actual evidence and details so we can know more. you are a scientist right but yet you expect people to believe stories like this without a shred of evidence or anything.  Of course that doesn't make sense, because if he is an educated person then he knows how to solve this problem. He just needs proof and reports his actions to the police. As far as I know, in any country attempted murder and violent intimidation are acts that can be brought into the realm of lawBut I don't know, maybe his Ph.D degree alone wasn't enough to make his thinking more logical and structured. LOL-Evidence goes the other way. Do you have evidence that universities do not promote violence? And I also demand that all college graduates provide evidence that they have learned stuff in college. Oh wait. They refuse to invest in any cryptocurrency with a mining algorithm that is designed to advance science, so they CLEARLY DID NOT LEARN ANYTHING. This is because colleges are too busy promoting violence.Quote from: DYING_S0UL on November 19, 2023, 03:04:52 AMSome universities does some universities doesn't. It depends on where you live. But yes, even if I don't agree 100% of what you said, I agree 50% of it. Where I live, it's not entirely the universities fault. Rather the violence is causes by some evil minded bully political figures (Students). These guys thinks they are the bosses of us all and they can do whatever they want. There were cases of ragging, bullying, injustice, even death of students. These students makes gangs to oppress the weak students. Where the universities should have taken steps to make their campus free from these violence they turn a blind eye to this. I don't agree with those with higher degree can be different from lower degree. Evil is everywhere. The most important degree/P.hd or whatever the education should be (in my opinion) \"Being a good human being\". That's it.OP, try to change your tone. You could have said everything with a sound tone. We are nor your friends or enemy. We barely know you. You seemed frustrated with the system. We get it. You are not alone here. There are injustice everywhere. Although I won't believe everything from an one sided story. Hope you understand that. Not everything thinks as you think.-What makes you believe that the city police would have done anything? I was called into the public safety office at the university, and I did talk to them. Then after they told me I was being threatened, I cancelled class, and I was punished for it because universities are filled with violence promoting creeps. Maybe if I waited until I got attacked or murdered, the state police would have done something. But I am not interested in that. I would rather PREVENT violence.I WILL NOT CHANGE MY TONE. TELLING ME TO CHANGE MY TONE IS WHAT PEOPLE WHO PROMOTE VIOLENCE SAY! Since you do not believe you (the other side refuses to communicate, so do you believe the side that refuses to communicate? Yes you do because you are bloodthirsty), I will no longer promote a specific bio-safety protocol that biological laboratories can implement that may prevent the next pandemic. I have been the only person advocating this protocol, but I do not want to do this when everyone else does everything that they can to convince me that they deserve another pandemic. People do not think. They do everything they can to exacerbate the person who has been trying to prevent another pandemic because they are that messed up.Quote from: thefreethinker on November 19, 2023, 10:26:42 AMI'm sorry to hear about the challenges you've faced.
