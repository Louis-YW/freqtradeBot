There have been a lot of examples of blockchain development companies (and some exchanges) taking on extra developers/staff and trying to attempt more projects than they would've been during the bull market.",

Especially those countries that have prohibited bitcoin transactions. Would they make a U-turn and take a leaf from the US?On the other hand, despite the price  people in Gaza, Ukraine and Afghanistan are turning to bitcoin to for survival.",

It was created to be a part of our society from financial, social to political aspects so it must go through all challenges our society has.With 21M, a fixed total supply, it has a capability against inflation but along its ageing, it can not rise forever in price. Fortunately, price can not grow forever but value grows gradually and stably with time.",

All products are subject to the principle of supply and demand, and in the case of Bitcoin, this principle is affected by the psychology of users and not by the real need to offer or demand it, since most users are investors and do not use Bitcoin doing other businesses such as using it to buy and sell products.",
