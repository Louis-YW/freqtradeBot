  "content": "One of the most populous continents in the world, \"\"Africa\"\" has contributed greatly to the cryptocurrency industry. But due to limited technical advancements or government-imposed restrictions, the majority of African nations are still unaware of cryptocurrency.      I made the decision to look into some of the African nations with the highest levels of involvement in the cryptocurrency industry, their percentage contributions, and those where utilizing cryptocurrency is prohibited.1#Nigeria: Nigeria has the greatest percentage of cryptocurrency owners in Africa, with over 10-22 million users, 10% of whom own several cryptocurrencies. It is one of the leading nations promoting cryptocurrency in Africa. Notwithstanding the CBN's restriction, young people between the ages of 18 and 66 continue to engage in cryptocurrency.Most Nigerians now possess more cryptocurrencies than fiat money \"Naira\" due to the recent significant devaluation of the Nigerian currency.2## Ethiopia:. Ethiopia's government, recently declared cryptocurrency trading illegal and banned the use of Bitcoin and all other forms of cryptocurrency due to fraud committed by some citizens of the nation.The \"Birr\" is regarded as the only legal money in the nation, but over 1.4 million Ethiopians continue to engage in cryptocurrency trading this is considered as a significant felony or serious crime.3###South Africa: It's incredible to learn that South Africa is also making a contribution to cryptocurrencies, with 4.5 million of its residents and 88% of its adults owning cryptocurrency.   As cryptocurrency is not prohibited in South Africa, it is actually accepted as payment for goods and services. In fact, this has greatly aided the nation's economic growth.4####Kenya: Kenya, a well-known nation in Africa, struck agreements with various cryptocurrency trading firms and professionals to help develop their economy, and this has resulted in lucrative earnings over the past few years.   Also, it is claimed that the government of Kenya intends to adopt Bitcoin as its official currency.In Kenya, 8.9% of the population now owns bitcoin, while over 4.4 million Kenyans have expressed interest in trading cryptocurrencies.5#####Egypt: Due to the depreciation of their own fiat currency, young adults in Egypt have made the decision to search for alternative sources of income. The demand for cryptocurrencies has surged in Egypt as a result of the participation of over 67% of young adults in the country in cryptocurrency trading.6######Ghana: Around 17% of the country's young adults hold cryptocurrencies, and 3.1 million adults trade them.    In Ghana, cryptocurrency is accepted as a form of payment for trading. With the aid of some crypto institution offered by their government, this has been made possible.I discovered during my investigation that majority of African nations have cryptocurrency trading bans, therefore I've also decided to list some of them.Here are some of the nations where cryptocurrency is prohibited.Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Zambia, Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and Lesotho are just a few of the countries represented.These restrictions may be implemented as a result of fraudulent activities, money laundering, or other Ponzi schemes operating in these nations, which compelled their governments to do so. Future consideration for the repeal of bans is possible. What do you think about the African nations who aren't allowed to use Bitcoin? Do they merit these reprimands?Do you believe that the government is genuinely allowing its people to lose out on the exciting world of cryptocurrencies?Do you anticipate that these restrictions will be lifted?If you are in Africa, what is your countries contributions in the crypto market? Please let me know in the comments if I missed anything particularly important. I'd love to hear your feedback.( some of the information here was compiled and gotten from research through Google search engines)For more information on this topic use this link:https://www.itnewsafrica.com/2022/07/the-top-10-african-countries-with-the-most-crypto-holders/",

I wouldn't say anyone knows the body language of the governments of most African nations with regards to cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin. This is because these people always wait to take a cue from the governments of the Western nations on the topic of bitcoin before they make bold statements about whether they are for or against cryptocurrency. Sadly, they have not taken the time to research bitcoin and its use cases. Why? Because they want the West to do it for them. They want the West to tell them whether it is good or not. This is why, in most of these African countries, the US Dollar is used to buy and sell assets, as well as to pay for some services, rather than their own local fiat. No wonder we see that in a country like Nigeria, the naira has lost its value. Please do not get me wrong, I am not saying that these African governments should accept bitcoin as the Messiah of their economies hook, line, and sinker, I am saying that they should really do in-depth research and find use cases in every sector of the economy. If they are afraid of scams and frauds, they must know that these vices are as old as the existence of money. They can find smart ways to deal with it.",

Cryptocurrency and its knowledge are widely spread across all of Africa. Most countries have the knowledge, but it's not widely accepted because of government restrictions. In places like Nigeria, as you have highlighted, we no longer hide our knowledge of crypto, even with the government ban and restrictions. Countries like South Africa seem to have publicly accepted crypto, and it's a great improvement and a big win. Lots will adopt. One thing I understand about the African government being against crypto is that they have not yet figured out how they can gain from it, which is why its citizens are transacting in it.",

So, what does that tells us? They could change their point about bitcoin depending on what people say, if enough people say it's bad, then they will ban it, if enough people say it's good then will make it legal.It is all about votes that they could get and what they do will bring in how many votes. My nation did that for example, government didn't like it, people protested, now they made it legal and can be used very easily.",

Btw looking at some of the listed countries in the OP, if crypto has the likes of Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt just to name a few I think this is a big win to be honest. If am not mistaken these are some of the biggest economies in Africa and a great bench mark for other non crypto nations to emulate and adopt crypto, its just a waiting game for now. Quote from: crypticj on February 28, 2023, 03:40:00 AMI think it doesn't really matter if the government like bitcoin or not. Totally correct, as long as a user as access to the internet and the alike legislation really does not matter tbh, but am not saying do illegal things be a good citizen",

Because high citizen interest will certainly be a consideration for a government in a country. because if they ban it it will only make its citizens continue to use crypto in a clandestine way. So those governments in African countries will then think that supervising their citizens in using crypto will be much better. and they can also implement a crypto tax that will add to the country's unique income. which can be used to improve infrastructure and improvements within the country itself. because the digital era is unstoppable. and like it or not all countries have to be open with it. that's just my thought. maybe the people of Africa will know more about the possible actions of the government there in the future. I really like the enthusiasm of the African community in getting to know crypto. even that gives me a little motivation.",

The government is fully aware that Nigerians are still dealing on crypto but they have no option than to play dumb and blind. The banks too knows about it and there are some bankers too who do the crypto and bitcoin stuff too. Why the delay from the government to legalizing bitcoin is that there is no way they can launder the treasury through bitcoin as it is an open and transparent ledger where  every one individual would see what is in the wallet and another is transaction fee and taxes which will be of benefit to them hence the delay in implementing and adoption of crypto and bitcoin.",

It seems that roughly 35 million adults like in South Africa, and 4.5 million is certainly not 88% of them. But okay, let's say it's 35 million. Add to that 9% of Kenyan population (around 5 million), 3.1 million traders in Ghana. That, excluding Egypt (because calculating a population of young adults is tricky), gives us almost 55 million crypto users in this handful of countries alone. Isn't is a bit too many? I'm especially interested in the 88% of adults in South Africa. Could that really be true?As for policies, it seems that African countries opt for restrictive approaches, while the people try being crypto-friendly.
