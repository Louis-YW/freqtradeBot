He becoming richer and we becoming poorer lol. See even all the market red how was pump doge? Any brands shouldn't charge for verification like Facebook or Twitter. So it wouldn't happen. Rather they might start some other service where they can accept doge like ads.",

If we're talking about introducing DOGE to Twitter, clearly not as a way to collect money from verified accounts. It would make more sense to add DOGE as a way to pay for tips, donations or to pay for some merchandise within Twitter. Surely Musk would make some sort of internal marketplace.",

Will you pay a monthly subscription just to retain being verified, I'm not, if this happens Twitter will be the first popular social media site that implements monthly subscriptions, he loves challenges but instead of building Twitter and moving it further, people will just leave Twitter and look for a free one like Facebook or instagram, his loss will other social media gains.",

Those who are verified have no more choice but to pay or just give up that verified status.But that'll take out the whole special feeling of been verified, people won't value it again since now it isn't earned but bought. If everyone can buy a verification sticker then nobody value the verified symbol anymore or people working hard to build up their reputation so they can be easily verifiable when they apply will be lost and all accounts now looking concerned  Elon won't want that at such I don't think paying for verification would be introduced. Also if twitter finally goes through with asking for payment for verification and still want dogecoin to be the payment currency, they can do that by doing the necessary things needed to make that possible and they'll be getting lots of support from the cryptocurency community.",

Twitter has other ways to make money though as far as I know, and it Musk wanted to keep this social media then what he needs to go is to introduce something, improved and your food for thought might not be in the list.Yes, he could be the biggest holder of Doge and we have seen his pushing it very hard to the extend that we call it manipulation.But he is a smart man and he doesn't want Twitter to go down, he might have few ideas on his own to make it still on the top of the social media game and then continue his manipulation of Doge to whichever way he can.",

Like, Elon Musk came out of nowhere and made Dogecoin as his \"toy\".\" I believe that Elon Musk will continue to be involved with Dogecoin as long as he and Dogecoin continue to be hyped by the public. As long as Dogecoin is solely a meme currency, any proposed applications are, in my opinion, doomed to fail. Because the issue of scalability must be addressed. Worries about safety? or any other such technicalities We don't want any catastrophic problems to crop up when it's employed on a large scale, do we?",

Let's see as this go.Those verified accounts are likely to pay that on a yearly subscription and that's an easy amount for them. They've got huge followings and usually, they're being followed by those so does the money follow them.It's not a problem for them and it's going to be like an investment for them if their Twitter account being verified generates them money.Maybe Elon would add the option of receiving those $20/month in Dogecoin if he's really into it but I doubt it.",

For sure Twitter got their own decision that will help the Twiter itself, charging customers just to get verified (blue check on their profile) is not effective.

Speaking of Dogecoin, for sure Twitter will start accept such cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin not only Dogecoin for some part of the Twitter.",
