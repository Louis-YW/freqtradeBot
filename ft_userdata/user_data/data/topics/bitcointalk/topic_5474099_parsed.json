Â  or at least every few months. i think we got a real serious problem that they are either going to have to raise that debt ceiling by larger amounts in one feel swoop or they'll be voting to raise it every few weeks at some point. it will really be ridiculous at that point. fast food employees will be making $50 per hour minimum. saying that's not enough they need higher wages.QuoteI find it pretty boring, actually.yeah it is boring NOW. but it used to not be. used to be there was some amount of uncertainty. we know going forward that it will always be approved to raise the debt ceiling. even into the hundreds of trillions most likely. and nothing will change except people complaining how making $100 per hour is not a livable wage... (and it very well might not be at that point!)there is the issue of how wages don't follow inflation fast enough and by the time they do catch up, inflation has already left the train station once again.Quote from: DeathAngel on November 15, 2023, 10:41:21 AMSeems this happens every quarter, they make a threat about potential shutdown & then at the last minute agree a deal.

Therefore, all problems have been resolved for now.In its first phase, the bill provides funding through Jan. 19 and includes appropriations for agriculture, military construction and veterans' affairs, energy and water. The second phase, which is proposed to be extended until February 2, will include funding for the remaining government agencies.",

The fact that you can have totally sensible, what should be middle ground politics, that descends into taking the most extreme positions from the single other party that poses opposition is terrible for America and democracy in general. Politicians should not be seeking to throw up barriers at every opportunity, but work with each other to reach a fair compromise on some of the trickiest questions that society has to face. The fact that over a hundred Republicans are being held hostage by 8 of the most extreme right wing supports is destroying the country and the fastesr these extremists are voted out the better, as they are only serving themselves at this point.",

If you look at the debt chart over the years, it has been constantly rising and there are always jumps in the chart whenever the regime starts a new war.For example from 1995 to 2000 the US national debt is in $5 trillion territory with not much rise but in early 2000 as Bush (a republican) starts his wars the US national debt doubles in a little more than 5 years and before his term ends in 2009 he has successfully brought the debt to $12 trillion.After that Obama came and was both caught in the ditch Bush had dug for him and the holes he dug himself with the money he spend supporting ISIS he brought US debt from $12 to about $20 trillion.Then an idiot came along called Trump who had no understanding of anything and dug those holes deeper and in only 4 years he brought the US debt from $20 to $28 And of course the senile Joe who is in all those holes his predecessors had dug and new holes he keeps digging so this is where we are today.The worst part is that on one hand they can not change these policies because the artificial country called United States has been built on wars, invasion, resource theft, colonization and mayhem. The day a POTUS stops overseas killing for resources is the day US ends.On the other hand US can no longer keep the overseas \"adventures\" up anymore because it is no longer post world war time where other countries are either weak or destroyed so US can come and steal their everything.Look at the recent news of the past 5 years for example. Every day US military bases overseas are attacked and over the past 40 days the number and strength of these attacks have increased significantly. One of the armies attacking them is the Iraqi military arm Kataeb brigade that has been bombing the shit out of US military bases in Iraq and Syria ever since US deployed troops in Gaza. All US has done in response was to sanction them",
