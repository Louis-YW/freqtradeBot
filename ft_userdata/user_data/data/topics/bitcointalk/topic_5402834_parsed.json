Don't be fooled by altcoin ranks on coinmarketcap because many won't stay in top 20 anymore after we go deep into this bear market. Same as above. Quote from: CryptoATM on June 16, 2022, 11:31:34 AM3. History have proven that many altcoins will be replaced by new ones and that's where huge investors will be making most of their gains in next bull market.Not entirely. \"Many\" is such a broad word and some of those top altcoins are still gaining trust from investors while swallowing the truth that this is just a bear market. What are those \"new\" altcoins that will replace the old ones? There's a mass creation of new tokens and there's no assurance about what they could be in the future. Anything for now which includes investing is a risky move. Have you had eyes on some that look like they will be one of the tops?",

It's just the matter of time but if you meant for short term and yeah it will not reach ATH again. Quote from: CryptoATM on June 16, 2022, 11:31:34 AM2. Don't be fooled by altcoin ranks on coinmarketcap because many won't stay in top 20 anymore after we go deep into this bear market.  Totally depends with the market trend and development progress from the project. Just beacuse the bearish market doesn't mean if that will change lots of big cap altcoins.

      "body": "There are quite a lot of reasons why you prolly shouldn't buy altcoins, especially in this period, the thing is that most of these altcoins are pump and dump coins, and they are only pumped through hype, right now in the network there is no such hype and most altcoins are going to dump and never rise again, since they actually do not have any utility. Altcoins are short term projects, and buying coins in this period only means you have the intention of hodling it for a long time, thus you shouldn't really be buying altcoins now cause you shouldn't be hodling altcoins for the long period. If i had any altcoin at this time, i will sell them so i do not lose everything completely, and prolly buy when the market is okay again, and when there is hype. If there is a coin you should buy now that would be Bitcoin.",

I still believe on them and most probably they will survive on this crash. Some of the good old altcoins are still on the top position, that can still be a good option to buy it, just continue to analyze and you can be good. On a bear market we should be more wise, decide on which coins to buy, fundamentally this can be a big thing during bear so look for a coin with a good technology and you think that can survive in bear, the market will rise again eventually.",

Basically, the ones that are having great quality still persists.If you will look at the top alts, let's say ETH, BNB, for me, they are worth the risk. Because the team behind it is solid and won't disappear just like many other alt projects. Their respective dev teams are in continuous pursuit of innovating their network. Though we can't say that their future is absolutely very bright, but in comparison with most projects, they are much better for me, in my opinion. So yes, you can explore your opportunities with alts, but you need to make sure you do your job of scrutinizing them.",
