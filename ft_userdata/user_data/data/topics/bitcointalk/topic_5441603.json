I heard that even Bitcointalk Mods bought and sold forum accounts in the early days. But, when scammers started scamming using purchased forum accounts, DT members started tagging them. I guess you already know that.But my question is, what will people do with such newbie forum accounts? Anyone can create an account with an email, and it's free. If trolls and scammers want to return after getting banned, they can pay evil fees and return with a brand new account.",

So you come here on Feb 17th, you are merely a Newbie user yet 10 days later you attempt to sell your account... believing that someone will actually buy it?! Lol. Buy it for what? For having the Copper membership, which costs 0.00129002 BTC, respectively 30$? And how much was he expecting to get, anyway? I assume that by selling the account he was trying to cover his \"huge loss\" or a part of it. Probably he would ask for 15$ or so. Is that really an amount worth ruining your reputation new \"career\" on the forum?Really... I am always trying to understand people, to understand what is inside their minds, what they could possibly think when saying some things which are outrageous. But in some occasions I have absolutely no clue why someone would do a very idiotic thing, like in this case.Now his account is ruined and he paid those 30$ for absolutely nothing. Nobody will ever buy this account, not even for 1$ and the actual owner will never use it for any kind of trade, as nobody will ever trust him for anything.(P.S.: I also tagged the account.)",

As for the loss of buying Cooper Member, it's simply out of necessity wanting to get past the restrictions of posting image. Anyone can buy copper members, even after Legendary if i am right.",
