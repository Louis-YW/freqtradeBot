Usually, if a few posts get deleted, your account must not be banned.It's quite strange that you think your account was hacked, how did you regain the access from the hacker? You must prove that someone else had posted the message if that's the only reason you got banned for.",

There has been cases where a hacker got access to an account and the original user still has access to it, no password or email change. This is possible if the the owner of the account fell for a phishing link and revealed their password which gave the hacker access to it. I use hack losely here cause it doesn't exactly count as a hack.Op, to many this could be just a lazy excuse for a user who was cut out plagiarizing, but in this case could be true as we have had similar cases where a hacker gets access to an account and posts a malware link.",

He doesn't come off as a person who would plagiarize text for financial gain, but the account getting hacked and the person behind the hack posting malicious links might be true, as I have seen some victims in the past.offordscott has been offering his service and has tried to build his reputation over time. He is one of the few trust members who sell mining gear in the forum. Out there, we have all sorts of scammers I would like the Mods and admins to look into this and maybe unban his account if their findings prove that OP might be innocent. They could also look at the IP logs to determine if the account change hands at the point the malicious links were posted or not.",

I hope he gets his account back I have just encountered one of the reasons to be a good and respectable member of the forum. In cases like this people will come all out to vouch for you and protect your interest. Scott has been defended by almost half of the members that responded to this thread. It reminds me of a verse in a religious book that states that a good name is better than riches. I also hope the moderator investigates this case and hopefully Scott gets his account back to continue his good service to the community.",

Who does that on this earth? Of course, this is your fault. Imagine if anyone has some confidential data from your other accounts. They can use it for their purposes. You could be in trouble for your laziness. Anyways, If someone hacked your account and logged in the last 30 days, You can find their IP address here https://bitcointalk.org/myips.php. I don't know you. But, If forum members Vouch for you and you can get attention from one of the Admins or Global Moderators, You might get a chance. I believe they can verify the claims. Good luck!",
