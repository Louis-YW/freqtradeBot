In crypto, we should avoid using the word wallet because it implies physical cash or credit cards.Since our cryptocurrencies and digital assets are not physically inside of our wallets, they are on the blockchain, which is a running ledger of transactions distributed worldwide.

      "body": "I would say it is almost the same if we reason it logical. The crypto wallet could easily be said to be a digital one but we all know that once anyone gets access to the wallet they get access to the funds or items in it. Same thing applies to crypto wallet too, even if the bitcoin is stored on blockchain with access to the wallet you get those coins stored there. The clear difference is when someone even gets access to your keys they can easily even steal your funds without access your wallet like the traditional one that needs to be in there possession So the way the traditional wallet needs to taken care of same way the digital wallet also needs to be secured because it is the gateway to your funds and that is why it is even password.",

This might be because i know very well that they already gasp the point of view I'm coming from. On the other hand, when talking with a beginner, you have to relate it to them properly, so you don't get them confusing a physical wallet, for a crypto wallet. They both mean the same thing indesence that both are used for storing valuables. But at some point you have to be specific and so they would understand fully what you are saying. As for me if am talking with someone who already know cryptocurrencies very well, I usually don't add crypto before the word wallet. Except I'm being specific about the type of wallet I'm saying.",

On top of that, you can have close source or open source but they are all called as wallets.Custodial vs Non-Custodial Wallets",

For example, for several years we have been using virtual money, and no one is surprised at the expression \"transfer money to a card.\"  Likewise, if you are trying to educate people about cryptocurrencies, start with the basics and in the simplest terms. Anyone who has some knowledge of digital money is unlikely to be surprised by the word \"wallet\".

I think we all understand that Facebook is not a literal book so we don't need to rename the service to \"Online repository of friends, family, and businesses\". The same is true for bitcoin wallets. The term bitcoin wallet is used because people are already familiar with the concept of a wallet. There's no need to make Bitcoin even more confusing by calling wallets \"cryptographic key pair storage software\" or something.A bitcoin wallet holds your private keys like a wallet holds cash or credit cards. When you want to send bitcoin, you use your private keys to sign transactions. I think that is what new users need to hear and then after they are further down the rabbit hole, we can further educate them on the technical underpinnings of what a bitcoin wallet is and how it works.",
