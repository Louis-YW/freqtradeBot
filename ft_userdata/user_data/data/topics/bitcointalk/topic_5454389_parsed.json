With this you won't just go into you account and start gambling with everything you got.Another tip would be for you to set a duration, you could just set your alarm and once it sets off logout of your account and continue with your life, although this depends on the type of game you're betting on.One last important tip is to never chase loses, when you have lost always accept that fact and move on because if you try to play to win your money back you'll only just end up losing more money.",

Another thing is that punters have to be disciplined, if a punter do not discipline himself or herself, life or gambling will disciplin the punter. An gambling addict should realise that gambling is not for making money. What led them to be addicted is that they thought they can be making money from gambling but gambling is not like that. Punters should set their weekly budget which should not be more than 5% of the money they are earning weekly. Any gambler that is gambling with more than 5% of his or her weekly earning is greedy and can become addicted.",

And get rid of all the gambling sites or apps that are on your smartphone or computer, and you also have to be able to distract yourself with other activities that can forget your addiction and I think the best choice is to have work and positive things, or other activities that can help your addiction.Such as religious activities or other positive activities for you or others that you can do after work or when you are not working, and you should also admit to yourself, family members and close friends that you have a problem and need help. They will support you and your recovery, but you have to be honest with them.and the best thing to do is never gamble even for fun, and never hope or think about the money you lost because it will never come back, forget it.",

One should be able to know when his or her gambling habit  is out of control so as to make necessary corrections by minimizing their gambling lifestyle.I think the following could help Have a daily or weekly gambling budget if you want to. Do well not to exceed it per gambling day or exercise.Do not gamble too often as you will be seen as an addicted gambler. Make out some specific days in a week for gambling and stick to it s it would guide you through then as time goes on gradually reduce your casino visit time.Do not get into a gambling competition with any one as it is not advisable to do so.And lastly,  learn to have self restraint while gambling. This will help you to control your ego while gambling so as not to do otherwise.",

This allows you to link your identity to self-exclusion for a chosen period and thus limit the risks of falling back into gambling.Some casinos and online platforms also offer Cool-off periods of several weeks/months, when you need to take a break. During these periods, you cannot gamble.Otherwise, more or less every country has institutions responsible for blacklisting people with gambling addiction problems, and you can spontaneously ask them to blacklist you for life, or for a few months/years. For example, in UK : https://www.gamstop.co.uk/The only limit to this is if you use non-KYC gambling platforms, but that depends on the user only and no one could assist him in this last case.",

Once in a while gambling doesn't form an addiction. When the once in a while automatically becomes a daily need then it is called addiction. There are two ways to control gambling addiction. 1. Self control2. Professional help.Self control doesn't mean resisting your addiction. It means controlling you spending habit. Allocations a fixed budget and gambling within it will help in reducing the risk of this addiction. It will help you to satisfy your urge and will not destroy you financially. Self control is easy to explain but hard to adopt. If self control doesn't work then the last option is to take professional help. When you know you will get destroyed and your will power is unble to takeover the urge of gambling, then you should go for professional help. Consider it to the the last resort.",

I remember this before when I was betting a crash game. I just thought the money that I allocated was enough, so every time I lose, I will increase my bet times two, which at first is working, but later on it is getting bigger and bigger until I lose it all.

I actually mentioned this before that there exists this \"gambler's cycle\" where an addict suffers the endless cycle of chasing their winnings only to end up with more losses.In order to actually help yourself in combating addiction, you must first acknowledge that you are indeed suffering from it. Once you have recognized that it is about time to take action, there lies infinite number of possibilities and solutions to this. But from several threads that also asked the same question, one answer remains above all- which is to remain dedicated and consistent with action.Try to substitute your addiction with different activities to keep your mind busy. Remember, this is also not an easy process where you can get out in an instant- it takes years to become addicted to something; and it will also take some time in order to address it.",

Looking for more positive activities that take up enough time so gamblers can forget about gambling a little.2. More often to interact with family because family can make a person happier and feel warmth in gathering with people he loves.3. Avoid any form that can lead back to gambling such as gathering with gang members who like to gamble or visiting gambling places. If gambling with an online casino, you can delete several browsers used to access gambling sites.4. Set aside money or save money from part of your income so that you don't feel like you have money to gamble.And actually there are many more, but that's all not guaranteed because success depends on the intentions and efforts of a gambler when he wants to stop.",

So it's like it is better for someone that gambles daily but is responsible enough than someone that is not a regular gambler but always wanted to take back the losses which makes matters worse.
