  "content": "I notice that last years a lot of new companies start appearing and offering ASIC miners for different algorithms. I started wondering how it's possible so many companies to came with products ready for the market in so short time. It's not clear from most manufacturers webpages if they are using there own developed ASIC chips or rebranded from some main patent holder. I would like to know if anyone has any information on mining equipment companies who have developed their own chips, or are buying them from somewhere in order to make a list that might give more light in the tunnel. Companies with own chip development:Bitmain - EtHash, SHA256, Scrypt, X11, EquiHash  Canaan (Avalon Made) - SHA256",

I personally was surprised when this came out because I really did not think they would make a product for what compared to the rest of what they sell would be such a small sales numbers product. But, on the other hand due to their size and fab capacity they could probably crush just about everyone else if they wanted to.-Dave",

      "body": "There are many right now who produce ASIC chips but for Antminer I think they develop their own ASIC chips same goes for Canaan or Avalon units. However, there are produced ASIC chips outside of these manufacturers most of the source is from China.I don't think you can buy only ASIC chips directly from ASIC miner manufacturers before they do sell them but right now they don't sell them you can only buy them on 3rd parties like on zeusbtc.com.",

An ASIC is dedicated purpose integrated circuit chip that is used a device: It can be for a sha256 processor, heart of a tv remote controller, wireless mouse, digital clock, RING video doorbell, etc. Mining chips amount to just a tiny fraction of ASIC ships produced.",

Because their 76% off offer is too tempting for a 96Terahash Asic miner, can anyone confirm this is real? Some kind of Xmas bonanza or fake? Anyone should please confirm and drop a reply, I am still buying Asic miners right now.",
