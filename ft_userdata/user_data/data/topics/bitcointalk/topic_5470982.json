  "content": "Phil Zimmermann is the creator of PGP and the man who fought the US government in court to normalize open source cryptography. Without his courageous actions, Satoshi Nakamoto wouldn't have had access to all the cryptography libraries that he used (such as ECDSA) and couldn't have hidden his identity (he used PGP and Tor for his communications).I had the honor to interview Phil Zimmermann in Prague during the Proof of Work Summit and I'm happy and proud to share the recording with you. I've asked him about Bitcoin, I've asked him about Hal Finney (who was his first employee at PGP), and we've also talked about other cryptography projects that he finds interesting. He's the kind of cypherpunk who cares about privacy much more than creating sound money, and his work definitely reflects this path.The interview is available on YouTube, Apple Podcasts & Spotify (as well as many other podcast apps). If you want to search for it yourselves, look for Bitcoin Takeover Podcast S14 E15 with Phil Zimmermann. Here you can find all the links, as well as time stamps and a full transcript: https://bitcoin-takeover.com/s14-e15-phil-zimmermann-on-bitcoin-cryptography-pgp/If you like this interview, please subscribe and leave your feedback as a comment!https://ibb.co/xJZZ5RT",
