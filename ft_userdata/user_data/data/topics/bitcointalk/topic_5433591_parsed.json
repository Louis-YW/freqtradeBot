      "body": "The tokenization of securities will open up new investment opportunities for users who have not been able to participate in traditional markets. True it can bring more money into the market since there will be greater liquidity and accessibility of assets. If they chose any existing smart contract projects in crypto, I guess this is the realization that crypto is here to stay. The laws around it and the demand for decentralization will be a bigger issue for the people because we already saw what happened to FTX.",

There are too many people who are acting as if they know it all, but they shouldn't really talk like this, it just doesn't make sense. You do not have a magic ball that tells you the future, you are just a CEO and you have an opinion and your opinion is not guaranteed. So, just say \"I assume\" or \"I believe\" or whatever.Because then it would mean that you are just making a guess, and everyone can guess, but if you say \"the next generation for market is tokenization!\" that means you are saying something that WILL happen and nobody knows what will happen, they can only guess.",

      "body": "Let me include another part of the article:QuoteDespite his bullish view on the future of tokenization, the CEO said he believes that most cryptocurrency-related companies “are not going to be around” in the future, though he did say that blockchain technology will be “very important.”The way I take the point of that views of tokenization is it will be hardly alike to what currently works. Extensive centralization and regulation acceptance will be required to incorporate things quoted on OP with blockchain. Do note that blockchain is the point in this case, not cryptocurrency. In that sense, the current of how public blockchain being utilized did not align with what those companies expected, that is the reason why they favour tokenization in a sense of private blockchain. The reason might be simply due to how it can be easily integrated with regulation requirements.",

The tokenization of goods, services, raw materials, and other resources. This is our future. But where there is digitalization, there are additional risks related to regulation and security. These aspects will have to be fully worked out for tokenization to succeed.",

      "body": "Tokenization will be great move for the market. It will allow retail investors to invest in assets that are usually beyond their buying capacity. But it will also open up a whole new area of financial scam. So a tight regulation is needed in order to win customer confidence here. A simple example of an already existing tokenization success is the mutual funds in India. If the similar facilities can be extended to the other markets, that will bring the investors in, especially beneficial for commercial real estate.",

      "body": "I think tokenization is very obvious and will be something that will unlock a lot of possibilities for finance and upcoming companies.  It's crazy to me that right now I own stocks because some website says that I do, but I have no way to prove it to myself or anyone else outside of showing them that website.  I feel like this day and age, things like stocks should be provable that you own them on blockchains.  That's just one example.  Housing is another.  Granted it is nice to have an intermediary to deal with if something goes wrong, but it would also be nice if I could prove I owned things without a middleman.  Maybe 10-20 years from now we'll be able to truly own our assets.",

If this takes off it will open up a trillion dollar market in my opinion Well BlackRock is the biggets investment company on the planet as far as i know of and the assets that they have under management are worth more than 10 trillion $ which is just a crazy high amount of money and wealth. Therefore a statement of the CEO of that company that is positive about cryptos is always a good thing in my opinion.I am not sure though if it would really work out to tokenize everything. I think it is pretty hard to do for example with real estate. I mean as a owner of a house, you also have duties like to pay a share of the necessary repairs and stuff like that. All of that needs to be considered.",

If this takes off it will open up a trillion dollar market in my opinion As we concentrate on the advantage of tokenization of most securities and assets, we shouldn't forget it so many aspects that may also have a negative impact on the entire market, as we know that the entire cryptocurrency stock markets are an interconnected chain that works together as the failure of one side can affect all others that is why the altcoins market have a hard great impact on Bitcoin market. So as we expect the market to open up through tokenization we should be prepared ahead for any of its disadvantages or shortcomings.",
