      "body": "I saw download when I clicked on the OP link. I hope that is not those Nigerian download link that will be redirecting people to ads? I remember I have encountered things like this on (Nigeria) musics and movies sites before I joined Bitcointalk. I noticed the YouTube video is not available on the site yet. I wish I can watch it on YouTube or YT Music but I did not see the official music or video yet.I do not download musics and videos for the sites I do not trust, for the safety of my device. I will not download or listen to the music until I see it on YouTube or YT Music as usual.This will definitely let more Nigerians to know about bitcoin and some people may invest. Although, bitcoin is no more new in Nigeria, but the people in cities and towns are the ones that know much about bitcoin. This music should be able to find its way to the village and more people can know more about bitcoin. Although, I expect more people from cities and towns to know about bitcoin through the music, and also encouraging them to invest.",

But it is a good thing if our musicians they are talking about Bitcoin it means that they are giving more awareness of bitcoin for people know the word bitcoin and further to know more about it. The truth be say Nigeria youth are very aware of bitcoin and they have engaged themselves into it so much because they know say their is good benefit in investing bitcoin.",

Do you know that majority of Nigeria celebrity are crypto investors, just watch what will happen after this new song those popular singers released about BTC and, it will give other singers mind to come out boldly to join them to spread the good news about BTC in the country in a way it will attract other people to know BTC.The reason why many celebrities like BTC than fiat money this days is because, BTC is very easy for them to hold and move around the whole world without the fear of EFCC because, there are some amount of money that will enter your  bank account that will make people to call you for questioning which such thing can never happen to BTC.",

Minus celeb dem sef we get so many people wey dey into crypto yet e just like say nothing come out, just imaging say we no get bitcoin enthusiasts for our country, this how come we take dey become one of the nations wey dey adopt bitcoin or other crypto. I believe say ones the government remove this restriction, Nigeria go be like El Salvador, many transaction would be done using bitcoin and e go still help increase our international tourism rate, meaning we go get many outsiders wey go come for tourism for we country.",
