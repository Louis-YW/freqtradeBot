  "content": "It is said that fork tokens of ethereum will be released after the merge.On forks of btc; bch and btg; some exchanges send bch and btgs to hodlers of btc. and some exchanges did not distribute these tokens because of they didnt support forks;I don't know what happens to those who keep it in the cold wallet.In this merge period, if we hold ethereum on myetherwallet or ledger; can we claim possible ethereum fork tokens to addresses?Poloniex made an announcement 2 weeks ago, we will distribute all fork tokens.I did not come across the announcement about possible fork tokens in binance or other exchange. Which exchanges will support fork tokens?Where do you think we should hodl ethereums? Which one would be more logical on this merge period?",

I mean it wouldn't take that long before you can withdraw the new ETH after the merge and you wouldn't have to worry about the claiming of potential fork token. Convenient yet not too risky.",

If you are just planning to sell it then yeah you must get it as soon as possible I think it will not matter, there are some coins that are cheap price when it is now listed on an exchange and there are some also that pumping immediately after its being listed on an exchange.",

Maybe they are still trusted because how can the new owner recover what he spent on acquiring the exchange, if he will operate the exchange poorly?",

They were so so so terrible that I believed they wouldn't really be living right now and would already be closed. I saw on this topic that they still exists, I checked them and see that they are still trying to do something. I have to say they are just too far gone from their top spot once upon a time and they do not even deserve to make a comeback.So, I am going to just let them go away themselves. I agree with the Binance answer, I am keeping every dime I have on Binance and when I have to withdraw I just do that, nothing more to it.
