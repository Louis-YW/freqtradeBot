This thread will serve good for gamblers who wish to know the injury update of footballers of different clubs in different leagues.When you know the injury status of the players, you will make a wiser bet.Feel free to drop any confirmed or speculated injury of players and we will discuss about them.Last week the people of Senegal were sad and Africans were sad as their best player who is the runner up of 2022 Ballon d'Or was injured. Does Mane still has the chance to represent?Maddison who was named in the England team was seen substituted in the first half of the Westham vs Liecester because of injury.",

Left one week later for Mane recovery from his injury for the first match against with Netherland, although he has possibility keep injury I think left two match later against host national team Qatar and Ecuador opportunity for Mane get recovery.Talking about football injured most sadness with Germany football player Marco Reus, he was absent again after injury and become third time missing at World Cup, last time on 2014 he missed World Cup and continue when edition on 2018. Seems he not lucky for participating on World Cup.",

Sadio Mane has been one of my favorites from an overall performance and affluence in the Liverpool team up  to his team spot for his country, Senegal. It's sad learning about his injury, he will recover fast, because he got to feature for the Senegalese team. I wonder if  that of Madison really affects the world cup team, England. They are looking for ways to assemble the perfect team because so many players have impressed in their various teams so far and are hoping to have a world cup shot with any injured players position right now.I wish them speedy recovery and great  fitness. Otherwise, the world cup won't be cohesively interesting as it should be.",

However it doesn't seem like this has affected them in a bad way at all. Because they have been doing amazing in the Serie A for many weeks.

But there was a statement from Bayern Munich that I read from a blog. Bayern Munich was cautioning Senegal about the dangers of including injured many in their WC squad. They were suggesting that Mane should be rested in order to be fit to return to the club by January. After reading that article, I felt that Bayern Munich was being selfish and self-centered. They don't care about the feelings of the whole country and that of their star play Mane.",

That's why I prefer to check the main line up before the match happen than looking for injured players.One of the reason why someone will play sports betting is because they can apply their knowledge to win the game so it is unlikely that they will bet randomly but if they do, then there is a better way of doing it and that is by playing in casino games. Anything can happen in a game but it will be better if no players were injured at all because it can affect their careers badly.Maybe there are reasons if a player isn't allowed to play even if he isn't injured but I don't think it is one of the manager's strategy. Does he think that the opposing team is weak enough and there is no need for a more stronger player to play? I think we shouldn't underestimate our foe's because many have fail because of it.Quote from: FanEagle on November 13, 2022, 08:17:23 PMThis topic should be kept alive for all the big name injuries after the world cup as well.

From the news circulating, Germany will not be supported by some of their players who are injured and the possibility of recovering in the near future is very small, so I will not bet on Germany. I will be eyeing Brazil and England national teams, they are at full strength to play in the world cup.",

We all saw how important these two players were in the last WC, but it is unfortunate that both of them will not play this world cup. Pogba would have played assuming he heard to the advice that was given him that month he left Manchester United. He was aware as far back as then that he will need surgery, but he delayed it which later became a wrong timing for him. For Kante, let us be hopeful that he will resume with Graham Potter next year.",
