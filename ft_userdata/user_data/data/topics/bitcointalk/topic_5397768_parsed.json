  "content": "PROS AND CONS OF CRRYPTOGAMBLING.I know that one of the greatest questions that crosses our mind is “is gambling worth it?” .Yes, I know that many times it seems almost impossible to win though at the same time it’s the easiest way of doubling up your money.Let’s talk about the pros:It is decentralized:  (without having one inside zone of command). No one can take your Bitcoins yonder from you or freeze your 'crypto account' due to the sheer of a inside legal/law-based validity in the system. You own your money and your transactions are safe.It is secure: Your payment information cannot be stolen yonder from you. Bitcoin transactions do not require any personal data to be submitted, protecting you from identity theft. And there can be no chargebacks - once sent, Bitcoins transactions are unchangeable. This ways the transaction cannot be reversed or reverted from the way it was recorded in Bitcoin's public ledger, which makes for fewer risks for people who sells.It is private: Since no personal information is tying to your Bitcoin wallet, people do not know who (bought something for money) what. At the same time it is clear/open and honest, meaning that anyone can find information on addresses and their balances in a public ledger.It is fast: It does not matter where you move (from one place to another) your coins to: be it an international move (from one place to another) or a local pizza (instance of ownership something for money). With Bitcoin any. With CoinsPaid's crypto-processing abilities, crypto casino deposits the move (from one place to another) is tropical to immediate.Bitcoin has (had) low transaction fees: Since there are no (people or businesses who buy goods to sell to stores, not you) in a decentralized network, no one will tuition you for anything. More so , the way the technology is set up there might be fees for faster processing of transactions or (changing from one form, state, or state of mind to another) of bitcoins into fiat currency. Although, most wallets will requite you the option to (adjust/change to fit new conditions) your legation in favour of a quick crypto move (from one place to another) or a low commission.It is not subject to inflation: The number of Bitcoins to overly be issued is limited to about  21 million and Bitcoin volume growth is (expected), so they cannot be out like fiat types of money and poured into the (process of people making, selling, and ownership things) at random.It is not unchangingly taxed:  The tax regulation for digital valuable things has come a long way as Bitcoin and altcoins have been recognized by some states as property, store of value, or plane currency. If you are planning to gamble in Bitcoin, make sure you know what your local tax law says on your winnings or from betting with crypto. But for most countries Bitcoin remains mostly uncontrolled.In summary, from a player's point of view, Bitcoin is the perfect 'gaming coin'. Players love Bitcoin considering it offers unnamed upper speed transactions for deposits and withdrawals, which do not go through a decentralized financial system. In, most Bitcoin games are 'Provably Fair'.Let’s talk about the cons:Ofcourse, there is a fly in any honey pot. Playing at an online crypto casino has some disadvantages that are worth thinking about, too.Firstly, crypto-gambling is never a stable source of profit because anything can happen(loss) .",

That is actually a cons of gambling in general, being it fiat or crypto and physical or virtual.I think a disadvantage of gambling with cryptocurrency is the volatility of the currencies, what means your bankroll will be fluctuating all the time, and depending the market's conditions (like right now), your funds will be constantly going down in value. Maybe you have just deposit 1000$ in bitcoin or altcoins in a casino, but when you start playing, after few minutes, the total value has already dropped to 900$ due to a crash in crypto prices.That is in fact the only cons specifical of gambling with cryptocurrency I can think about... Another common cons are also found in fiat gambling as well.",

Gambling will always be bad for those who are playing it in a wrong way or perspective. However, if you do set your limits from gambling, be it crypto or not, it will not result into a lot of consequences. Crypto gambling is for those who want to have fun and be entertained, but if you take crypto gambling like a quick rich scheme, you will always result into failure. And may only be the reason for future life's misery if you can't control yourself anymore.",

For me, crypto is something that is highly valued, and something that many can't get. Because of this, I was a little skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy the experience of gambling with it. I was afraid that because of this value attached, I would not enjoy my gambling experience.I guess it's just the difference between putting your money into something that has no value to you and buying something that has real value.",
