  "content": "I see people (mostly new speculators) panic, with the sudden drop in the Bitcoin price ...and all of that started with the FTX Exchange problems, but I want to remind people that we have faced much bigger problems before...and that we will go through this bump ...like we did with all the previous things that we faced before. Examples :~ Mt Gox~ Silkroad~ ICO Scams~ China banning Bitcoin mining~ Social media platforms banning Crypto advertising~ Several Fork Wars (Craig Wright / Roger Ver.....) ~ Famous people bashing Bitcoin on Social media ~ Several failed Ponzi Schemes that used Bitcoin as a payment system (Bitconnect)~ BitLicense ~ Bitfinex got hacked~ Bitfines bank accounts were shut down~ Binance was hacked~ Bittrex scammed its users by shutting accounts of thousands of users.Feel free to add more examples of things that happened that would have ended any other project, but where Bitcoin survived. We are still going strong, no matter how many challenges are thrown in our path. Just Hodl on Bitcoin warriors .... and stay positive, things will turn around again.  Ps : Edited to add examples provided by users.",

So why should we fear when the price drops from $20k to $16k? Whether you are new or old, remember that bitcoins do not depend on any exchange or any country, only they depend on bitcoin, if they crash bitcoin will always be there but if bitcoin crash all will die together. Exchanges like Mt.gox or FTX crashing isn't necessarily a bad thing, because like all shitcoins, the bad stuff needs to be removed as soon as possible, keeping only the best. If we want the market to grow further, just keep the best.",

People who panic will likely buy back higher.Sounds like really nice and cheap Bitcoin there! But honestly, I would not be betting on us reaching 10k again. If anything I would say we have reached the point where the latest FUD has done the most damage to the price of BTC. So sure you can wait for the 10k and hopefully, you will get it but I am not going to risk it and just buy in and wait for BTC to normalize the normal price levels again. Volatility used to be very common but the more people adopt Bitcoin, the less common it becomes. A dip like this is not going to be happening every other week. I say buy while you can...",

      "body": "To be fair, the recent price dip isn't just because of one exchange. It's a compounding effect involving a declining worldwide economy, i.e a global recession. War which has fuelled fear, but also dwindled resources for the every day person. Recovering from a global pandemic which pretty much stopped the world at one point. So, while the word on everyone's mouth right now is Ftx, and how that's made Bitcoin drop further, Bitcoin was already struggling at that point (like pretty much every investment during this time), and the reasons are pretty much easy to identify. Plus, we're now going into the Christmas period which historically people are shorter of cash, and therefore less investment is pumped into things like Bitcoin. So, some people might think that the investors are losing faith because of these compounding events, but in reality things are currently tight because of those events, and after we've recovered from them, Bitcoin will likely see a recovery from there. So, while I do get your point about one exchange being irrelevant, the compounding effect can't be underestimated, and technically we're in unprecedented times due to it. That doesn't mean Bitcoin's going to fail, but I think it's important to establish this isn't just about one exchange.",

Yes, I agree with you... but FTX was a trigger event for the latest BIG drop in the price. So I am focusing on that event as a major indicator for the panic selling that is going on. Exchanges that are hacked or those who go bankrupt, always get a lot of attention from the media, because the media just love bad news....and when it is Bitcoin bad news... they scramble to report about it.  I would say that the other things that you mentioned, just put a brake on the growth and adoption ... it did not cause a panic sell, like we saw with this exchange nonsense.    (I think too many people rely too much on centralized exchanges, so this might be a good warning for many of them)",

You are correct. In fact, if you see the prices currently, bitcoin increased by 5% today when more bad news related to FTX is coming. Any sharp decline or rise in crypto prices is always combination of different factors. Multiple factors combined will have an overall effect. Some news will be positive and some news will be negative but the momentum of the price is set based on which side has more weight.Long term investors like me who are investing in bitcoin because they believe in blockchain and affected very less by these type of incidents. If you are holding for long duration, you can never be in loss. The people who loose all their money are those who are looking for get rich quick schemes in the field of crypto. Like , after this incidence of exchange going bankrupt, Binance owner warned investors not to trade FTT. But , if you go on binance and see volumes, people are still playing with this coin hoping for miracles.",

So lucky I witnessed this dip this year. While I'd probably agree that users that have been around longer, have built up more resilience, and faith. I don't think that's because they've already experienced worse dips. I mean, the current situation we find ourselves in is the worst we've been in. I'm not talking solely the price, but the current situation we find ourselves in the world. I said it months back, but I truly believe this will be the worst recession that most of us have witnessed, if not the worst all of us have witnessed. The great depression is probably going to be the only one that's even comparable. It could potentially take a decade to actually recover from the recession. Now, I don't think it'll take Bitcoin a decade to recover, but the former suggests the new sort of territory we're in, and older users aren't going to be accustomed to that either.",

These are centralized services, and when they are hacked or if they scam people, that has nothing to do with the security of Bitcoin. On the contrary, it shows precisely why Bitcoin security is important, why storing your own coins in a non-custodial wallet is important. As for ponzis and ICOs, they also have little to do with Bitcoin, so the pain for losing money in them shouldn't be translated into hate for Bitcoin. Regulations and bans are different in this regard, but they also affect only some people and regions, not Bitcoin as such, so they are highly unlikely to bring its death.",
