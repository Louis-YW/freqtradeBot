  "content": "Another exchange hits rock bottom. How many more will become big and then end up crashing taking investors funds with them?FTX has filed for Chapter 11 proceedings today after the company once worth $32 billion has fallen from grace in to collapse. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned from his role but will remain in an advisory position in order to assist the \"orderly transition\". The SEC looks to investigate whether Sam Bankman-Fried mishandled or misappropriated customer funds. Things will get more messy before the full facts are revealed.The PR fallout from this will be highly negative with those new to crypto or just starting to take an interest being the first to change their minds and think crypto is (stereotypically) either unsafe or used for scams.",

      "body": "By the number of companies connected with them you can easily see how much money they were wasting. You could come to them and say hey' I have a new defi project I want to sell you a stake in my business and you'd get it either in the form of their worthless token or a stable coin that they bought with clients money. Poor people were depositing their bitcoin there and playing around with positive balance on exchange not knowing that their BTC is long gone because the company barely held anything. You gave them real money and you were getting an IOU and the money was gone into another branch, shell company, investment, sent to Alameda to be leveraged there. I feel sad that this is impacting bitcoin and some idiot journalists will now say \"a bitcoin company went bankrupt, people wanted bitcoin and they got scammed\" while it had nothing to do with bitcoin. Bitcoin should be out of this shitstorm as Sam and his company never wanted anything good for BTC. All they wanted to do was pushing defi and their fractional reserve token into the mainstream. This is going to come to light eventually but I can bet you they were spending some of those \"lost\" billions on lobbying and bribing in Washington and that's why they're insolvent now.",

They will try to give these reasons to ban cryptos and bring stringent legislation against Cryptos as well. It's so surprising that exchanges keep the backup assets in assets other than the original assets. All of this also promoting monopoly in the market which is very bad too.",

So they will stay stubborn and keep their cryptocurrency in exchanges.",

Gox also was even has worst experience than this current exchange outcomes.People and friends are giving advice to leave crypto as a result of these recent outcomes bin the past days. Its also a pity for those who have both retirement plans and long term saving stored up in FTX, at least they should have had the chance to stop withdrawal but they didn't why? In the history of crypto it will be a sad day to recall. CZ doesn't know he has killed a lot of people, sent million's and billion's of people also to be depressed",

CZ is currently cited as one of the main actors in FTX's collapse, but either way it would be wild to call it having that much power to bring down its other rivals.Whatever the case, have the principle that nothing is truly secure in crypto especially about centralized exchanges. So I really don't think much of anything that might have created new drama for crypto, in fact we still want to maintain optimism on bitcoin rather than overthinking CZ and his decisions.",

This is not even counting individual partners and individual fund holders in any of the FTX platforms and those platforms that are heavily invested in FTX.Needless to say, this will cause a massive domino effect that would see the entire crypto industry losing trust and confidence among individuals, institutions, and governments.

Having said that, Binance allege there was $8 billion of investor funds misappropriated from FTX therefore like any venture firm should avoid getting involved.
