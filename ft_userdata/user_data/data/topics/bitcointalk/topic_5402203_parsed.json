  "content": "We heard, in recent months, about exchanges flagging user funds coming or outgoing to services using CoinJoin. We heard about people having to post detailed personal information about the source of funds. There were also other events suggesting that Bitcoin surveillance is becoming an issue and that people withdrawing coins to \"unhosted wallets\", as they call them, are targeted by the compliance system. This article provides a good overview of some of the relevant events and how they influence Bitcoin's fungibility: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-needs-better-privacy-for-fungibilityThis article instead provides a review of existing privacy-focused projects https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/list-of-bitcoin-privacy-proposalsThe thing is that there already are some good enough solutions but too few people use them, so they stand out from the rest of the transactions. People need to become more privacy-oriented.",

Increasing bitcoin privacy is one solution.No, it's not, at least that's my opinion. You don't give a solution to such political problem by improving privacy. Bitcoin's privacy isn't hurting its fungibility, centralized exchanges do. Not using those who treat it as non-fungible is a solution. Don't comply with their rules, and \"taint coins\" becomes a matter of the past. It's a nonsense either; a direct surveillant attack to you, along with KYC. As a quote goes,Quote from: http://www.wearedecentralised.co.uk/When centralised oppression fails, we will decentralise. And so we do.",

People need to become more privacy-oriented.  Privacy is very important and helpful, but as people are getting to know about bitcoin, the more you will see more people that will not go for privacy or anonymity. I too will recommend people to be private but they have a lot to avoid, example are traders, it will be difficult for day traders and those that trade frequently not to use centralized exchanges, but for people that wants to hold or be using noncustododial wallet, privacy is very possible.It is becoming a time some people will have to buy items online with bitcoin in a way privacy may not be possible. That is why it is very good for some people to make certain part of their bitcoin transactions and holding not to link to anything centralized like exchanges or shopping in a way your main holdings that is meant to be private can not be linked to your real identity. Privacy is possible, but it requires people to have knowledge about it with the use of Tor, VPN (Tor is better) with mixers, decentralized exchanges and noncustododial wallet and if need be to use bitcoin to shop or for anything centralized like exchanges, it so good to make sure you have a good way your privacy life is not linked to the other one you used for centralized services.",

People need to become more privacy-oriented.  I am interested to know why some people just never care.  I am too tired of the 'nothing to hide' argument and need a real reason someone should not worry about being spied on.  Because at the end of the day, most of us are looking for freedoms and democracy and it makes no sense then to accept surveillance.  To me there is a clear, distinctive line between freedom and surveillance.  When surveillance begins, freedom starts to end.  That is how I perceive it.One thing I have to mention.  Too few people use these good solutions because they require some level of knowledge to begin with.  Binance requires required before implementing mandatory KYC just an account registration and you could move money around already.  And there is password recovery, there is a supposed reimbursement in case the exchange gets hacked, there is customer support.  Bisq puts all the responsibility in your hands.  You have to do and know much more about Bitcoin to use Bisq than you need to know to buy Bitcoin off Binance.  You can not quickly, easily do Fiat to Bitcoin and backwards exchanges on Bisq as easily as you can with Binance.Besides gaming and a very small list of other reasons.  Why are people generally choosing Windows over Linux?  Popularity and easy to use.  This is why it took me many years before fully moving over to Linux as well.  I was just lazy and thought I would rather spend my time learning something other than how to use a Terminal and all of that.Quote from: DaveF on June 11, 2022, 04:52:43 PMMight take some work but through exchanges that require no more then an email address and so on you can make it just about impossible to trace.I agree that privacy means a lot of different things to different people.  But this particular part of your post, I would argue it is very hard nowadays to create an account that is impossible to trace on exchanges.  Maybe instant exchanges that require no JavaScript and allow Tor usage.  There is or was at least one on KYCNotMe allowing this.  But just requiring an e-mail or not allowing Tor can make it so easy to backtrace an user if there is interest from an authority.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Actual BTC goes to their hot wallets/cold wallets.So, the process is like the banking system, both of them show digits on the balance tab, but do not give you the control of original funds.Privacy and anonymity on the exchange are zero, they can ask for your KYC anytime and they can freeze your funds if they want. It is not a rare case that exchanges get attacked by hacker and loses both funds and sensitive data of their users. So when you use the exchange you can't expect privacy/anonymity at all.Now come about hardware wallets or software wallets, In here privacy will depend upon your experience, if you know how to keep yourself untraceable and how to secure your data then these are 100% anonymous and secured. You must have to know what you are doing and how to keep yourself untraceable.",

Ditto with any kind of bearer certificate of a specific unspent output (although the latter is more complex).As long as you are using a means that results in transactions being public, I don't think it is possible to ensure that your transaction will be anonymous. To even attempt anonymity, you will need to rely on others, both in their previous behavior, but also their behavior in the future.",

Does privacy bring food to the table?Some could say that they aren't criminals and it means that the government cannot come after them, why the need for privacy. Many people do not understand the importance of privacy and some who understands don't know how to go about it. How private can one be, when your data in with the government in one way or the other. So many has given their privacy to social media. So if you remember that you have made some privacy mistakes in the past, maybe there is no need protecting an already exposed privacy.",

One day someone may decide to send dark sats to casual people automatically placing them on a list. Someone may target specifically some high profile individuals. Anyone can get some dark bitcoin and find themselves under surveillance. The issue extends also to hedge funds. This, in turn, hurts fungibility.So to me there're two solutions. KYC applied to everyone isn't a good solution because it becomes like Orwell so this one is out. The other one would be to increase awareness of privacy oriented tools and make people use them. Every wallet should have some built in privacy solution. The question is which one is best because they aren't all so efficient.",

It is a crime in many jurisdictions with varying definitions. It is usually a key operation of organized crime. You're right about concealing the origin of money, but you're also wrong since not all of them mixing their money because they got it from illicit activities.",

They take the risk of getting bad bitcoin too. If you make deals in dollars you don't care if this dollar was used to by a drug dealer. You just take it. With bitcoin you need to guard yourself and coinjoin lets you take precautions against unnecessary investigation.

People need to become more privacy-oriented.  I am interested to know why some people just never care.  I am too tired of the 'nothing to hide' argument and need a real reason someone should not worry about being spied on.  Because at the end of the day, most of us are looking for freedoms and democracy and it makes no sense then to accept surveillance.  To me there is a clear, distinctive line between freedom and surveillance.  When surveillance begins, freedom starts to end.  That is how I perceive it.I understand what you mean and I partially agree with that, I say partially because things in this world changed a lot in the last centuries, today's definition of freedom is different compared to 200 years ago. If people would behave in a better way we wouldn't need surveillance, but there are too many criminals and crazy people out there so yes, personally I'm fine sacrificing part of my privacy in exchange of more security, it doesn't matter if it's about online or real life surveillance.",
