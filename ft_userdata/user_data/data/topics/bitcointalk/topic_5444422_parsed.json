      "body": "I think it's quite interesting that USDC is de-pegging considering this was recently said to be the most likely contender for a CBDC that would be adopted by the U.S. Could you imagine the uproar when everyone's dollar is worth less in a practical sense? For example when someone goes to the store and pick up an item worth $5, and then have to pay +10% for it because the CBDC is de-pegged...On topic though. It's not surprising that USDC is de-pegging due to the recent news that a lot of Circle's reserves were held with Silvergate. It's interesting that DAI is de-pegging concurrently with USDC though considering they aren't correlated at all.Edit - Circle also had USDC at the recently failed Silicon Valley Bank as well.Right now, USDC is unpegged by over 10%. DAI is also un-pegging due to including USDC within its collateral reserve.",

Terra was built to fail...I do not believe that DAI was built to fail, and while I do not believe in the values of USDC, I also do not believe that was built to fail. I do however, believe that USDC have been very irresponsible in their management (evident of their losses in Silvergate) and therefor may fail (or at least be hindered) due to this reason. My guess is that they will be bailed out though and all will be fine. This could be an opportunity for the fed to step in and take a piece of the USDC empire, pre-CBDC.",

If you're going to try and be a moderator, at least do it right Okay thank you for all corrections just as I have already apologized at first place. Since you said they can be classified as altcoin then that section would be more preferable. I am not being a mod or admin but we should try to help ourselves apparently, they've been trying their best to make sure everything is placed at the right place, we helping ourselves will also reduce the stress from them.Thank you mate.",

According to the information I got, 25% of the USDC supply is held by SVB, and if they fail to resolve the issue they are facing now, the USDC will definitely depreciate in the coming week.",

There's currently no suitable platform for CBDC that would satisfy any regulators and it certainly won't be done with any stablecoin in their current form. And CBDC isn't going to be upegged from the fiat value. It literally will be the fiat value.",
