  "content": "Hello all,So I am in the middle of designing a software-wallet and wanted to get some feedback and ideas.My intent is to build and release via Google Play, Microsoft Store and Apple Store as that seems to be the only way people are able to install software on their devices today. Side-loading is an option, but most people won't be familiar with the concept. It will be offered for free but ask for donation in order to maintain and develop further functionality. To start, I plan to support Bitcoin and Ethereum only. I intend it to be BIP-32 with the BIP-44 deviration path.I intend the wallet to be able to import 12 to 24 word, Mnemonic strings (as well as the optional Passphrase) from other types of wallets. So the software-wallet will support \"Hidden Wallets\" as well as Accounts (the default is 20 accounts, each containing 20 addresses).It will be closed source. If the wallet is storing the Master Private Key that is derived from the Mnemonic string and Passphrase, I don't want others to be able to look at the code and see how and what encryption was used, how the Master Private Key is saved after encryption.I have devised a way to make notes for each Private Key/Public Key/Address in such a way that each Address can be named and have notes (via editable text area) tagged to it. Again, the Address Name and Notes will be encrypted when saved, then decrypted when the User starts up the app. The Name and Notes will NOT be saved with the Master Private Key - they would be saved separately and in a different location. The only way to connect the Name and Notes to an Address would be to use the deviration path indices. I would like to know: what you think makes a good software-wallet?what makes a bad software-wallet?what am I forgetting?what am I over looking?",

Why shouldn't people see the code and verify its security in your software?Quotewhat you think makes a good software-wallet?Apart from being open source it has to offer a feature that the existing wallets don't. Something that people need too. You can start a topic asking people what features they are missing in wallets they use.",

Although, a big, yellow, sparkling warning is needed here. This should be usable by only people who know what they're doing. Someone who doesn't, even if he visits the proper documentation, is like a kid that plays with matches: He might have himself burned. There are countless of cases wherein the user just messed up with scripts and make their money non-spendable. Script is essentially a scripting language; not everybody knows to write the syntax correctly.",

Then intent is to build for the layman, those that do not have a deep understanding of crypto, those that just want a wallet, that don't have the time or care to understand all the details of crypto.Thx for commenting.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 26, 2022, 01:18:08 PMIf your encryption security is partially based on obfuscation of the source code, i'd be very skeptical with encryption implementation on your wallet.I'll address this later.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 26, 2022, 01:18:08 PMYou forget to mention who's the audience target of your wallet software.

Building a website for User Manual, email contact and downloading the apps for the various platforms. I am still up in the air about how I will support different platforms and devices. Still doing some research into libraries and frameworks. So far (don't laugh too hard), C#/.NET 6 is the leading choice as it will fit into later projects that could spin-off from this.  Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 26, 2022, 01:45:34 PMNo ability to generate its own seed phrase?Yes it will follow BIP-44/BIP-32. The functionality will allow for importing wallets as well as creating new wallets. I will implement a random mnemonic generator. I guess the question is, should I allow the User to pick the number of words? 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 or maybe just give the option of a randomly generated mnemonic of 12 or 24 words?Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 26, 2022, 01:45:34 PMQuote from: DevJames on August 26, 2022, 03:44:55 AMIt will be closed source.

What if the User doesn't implement a passphrase? Or wants to set up a hidden wallet? Should I password protect the execution of the app. Make it so a User has to input a password to start up the app on thier own device (that's already password/biometric protected)? And then make them input a passphrase to login into a certain wallet account? To me, that's not very User friendly.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 26, 2022, 01:45:34 PMGood wallets are open-source, bad wallets are not.  Trust is a major issue in the crypto world, as it should be.  The only way to gain the trust of the community is to be as transparent as possible with your code.I'll address this later.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on August 26, 2022, 01:45:34 PMAs for features to add, one of my biggest pet-peeves about Electrum (the primary light client I use) is it's privacy issues.  To resolve them I have to run my own SPV server and connect all my devices to that server.  If I could connect Electrum directly to my instance of bitcoin core that would resolve a lot of those issues.  There are other light clients out there that do that, and I think it's starting to become a more common feature.  That's one suggestion.  Otherwise I don't see many improvements that can be made to Electrum, for example.This is a good suggestion. I was thinking that if I received enough in donations (with any luck), I would run a node and the wallet would default to my node(s). Would that raise many concerns? Adding the functionality so a Power User could connect to their own instance of the blockchain would be a good option.Thx for commenting.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 26, 2022, 05:14:15 PMAllows coin control.Allows connection to personal Bitcoin node or SPV server.Works as an HD walletCoin Control....yes, thank-youConnecting to your own node...please see aboveYes, following the BIP-32/BIP-44 would make this a HD Wallet.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on August 26, 2022, 05:14:15 PMQuote from: DevJames on August 26, 2022, 03:44:55 AMwhat am I forgetting?You forget that we already have lots of software wallets, some of which work years now perfectly.

Off the top of my head, the example you provided would be better implemented as a smart contract. Though I must admit, I haven't gotten far into smart contract implementation on Bitcoin network as I have for Ethereum. This is becoming a wall of text and it's getting late for me. When I can jump back on, I'll make another post expressing my concerns about the project being open-source. Thanks for your feedback.",
