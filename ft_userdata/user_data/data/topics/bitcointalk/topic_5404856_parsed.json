      "body": "Yes it is worthless because no sane person will buy them. What you're talking about is actually a scam scheme. Since you won't be able to exchange them in established exchanges, the most common tactic is they will ask you to do it in their malicious website where you'll be requested to connect your wallet/approve stuff when it would actually steal your coins. Do not engage!",

Like the above said it is most likely a scam scheme I also have airdrops on my wallet both ETH and BSC chain and all of them are worthless. Just ignore them and your wallet is safe. I suggest you read this \"[Scam Alert] Beware of Airdrops that will drain tokens out of your address.\"",
