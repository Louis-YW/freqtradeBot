Every mining software will work on any algo.  You can use the old and faster Gminer with only 0.65% fee, or you can mine Vertcoin with the spminer without any limits. This is \"The Pill\" for LHR cards that unlock the card for all random access memory algos.But you need a newer driver.Similar effect as the pill for gtx 1080/1080ti cards GDDR5 memory. You run it in the background, and the LHR cards get a boost in the hashrate.",

I guess its not an Software that comes from somewhere , and i am also not an pro coder but if there is at least one miner software that have it,It will be an easy way for an developer to cut down the whole code til you find the pieces that you need .And then you just have to modify it and get it into your code right , but that is just a guessing from me.",

Especially since we are talking monetary value - and the ease at which dev's can slip a piece of code to mine small bits is a reality unfortunately, and the average miners understanding of coding is probably on par with the layman.So, when new versions of everything are flying around, everyone will be more cautious if the source is not well established and in long term use. I asked a question when the pheonixminer thread was updated, but was still suspicious of it even though the poster replied right after. But pheonixminer having its own history, was also a big red flag. @sp_ how can we trust? Does this unlocker have a fee for use? Cheers,HomerEdit: browsing at your TBM.

The program starts a mining thread in with very low priority to a pool to trigger the LHR and unlock it, but when you start another mining program,  the new program will take over all of the resources, and no hashrate is lost. You might call it a fee, but it is only \"fee mining\" if you don't mine with another program.Quote from: HomerPepsi on May 14, 2022, 05:04:40 AMEdit: browsing at your TBM.
