      "body": "The original Manhole Covers (1) are funded with a complimentary .01 BTC, (2) showcase an engraved copper plate on the reverse side, and (3) are finished with an \"antique bronze\" weatherproof powder coat. These painted Manhole Covers are unfunded with no reverse plate, and they are each uniquely hand-painted. I think that sums up the difference between the original version and this new limited edition version. And as for the value, I feel highly confident that these hand-painted pieces will hold their values well into the future, just like our original 2017 Manhole Covers. Regards,Chris@TBPCo.PS — No, minerjones. You may not have my wooden column. I love it too much.",
