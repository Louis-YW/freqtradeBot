Bitcoin doesn't have any centralized company that will give fixed salary to every developers or contributors who work for Bitcoin development, they're just volunteers who doesn't get paid with any money. If you're talking about this forum, it doesn't really give a huge impact to Bitcoin development, it's mostly for discussion about Bitcoin. There's a moderators and staff get paid each month by theymos, but it's must be answered by moderators and staff. If I'm become moderators, I would work for full time in this forum.",

      "body": "A lot people are working on Bitcoin full time, but most of them no longer visit this forum. While those who are here helping out with technical questions, in my view, do so for more knowledge. However, from the look of people's activity here, it's certain that many members of this forum have got different purposes, work, business and Target on Bitcoin or outside Bitcoin. Therefore, those that work full time in Bitcoin only depend on Bitcoin market to earn. While others diversify their investments. Quote from: silbertlee on December 10, 2022, 01:28:32 AM Many people will also say: You bought Bitcoin, put it there, forget about it, you don’t need to work. It sounds ridiculous.This advice made the early adopters so much profits that's why they keep telling people to follow same hodl method.",

Yes you are right. Sometimes it is not easy to understand what OP wanted to say, and most often it is found among new users.If OP's question would sound like this: Would you work for bitcoin full time? I would most likely say no. Because due to the volatility and instability of prices at this stage in history, bitcoin this creates some problems. Of course, I'm exaggerating, but it may turn out that by the time you get to the grocery store, your wallet will become 2 times poorer.  So far, traditional money is indispensable, that is, work paid for by fiat. It doesn't matter if it's full time or part time.",

That's what makes this forum unique, many highly ranked members have the integrity to keep the forum growing and thriving until now. Taking care of the forum should be the responsibility of all of us, because this forum has provided a lot of information and knowledge that we don't get at school.QuoteSo I feel like they're all doing bitcoin full time. In fact, working in the decentralized financial field is a new form of work, which may be fully reflected in various DAO organizations in the future and will be rewarded accordingly. Many people will also say: You bought Bitcoin, put it there, forget about it, you don’t need to work. It sounds ridiculous. The bitcoin talk space is not a company, so it cannot be said to be a part-time job, while the correlation of full-time work in Bitcoin has no translatable meaning, many people spend time on forums in different ways, maximizing time to engage in ongoing discussions and keep to keep the forum working as it should.There is no limit, no one is supervising and full control is in each individual, these are the advantages of bitcoin in terms of investment. While working in a decentralized financial company, it will only make people centralized in their system, so there is no freedom whatsoever and we will continue to be controlled according to the rules they make.Isn't this boring!!!",

It sounds ridiculous.If you consider like signature campaigns by those legendaries, (I'm not there yet), it's not like they spend a lot of time here. Perhaps maybe 2-3 hours a day max I reckon to do their post, maybe answer some DM's and then look around the community and see how is everything is doing.But if you are talking about individuals who do trade and yeah maybe it's considered a job, then probably they spend a lot of time on it. Because in trading you need to be in front of your computer to see how the price is per hour or per time frame.",
