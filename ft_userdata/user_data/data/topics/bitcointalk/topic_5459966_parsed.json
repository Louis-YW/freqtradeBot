  "content": "This thread is dedicated to the price evolution of the three biggest realmente decentralized altcoins without any premine: Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), and Monero (XMR).They have in common that no (substantial) premine was created at the start, and that they have independent blockchains with independent genesis blocks (in contrast to forkcoins like BCH). Thus, I think it makes sense to group them together. They're all part of the Top 30 altcoins in lists like Coingecko or Coinmarketcap, and the next coins with these characteristics (not premined, no fork) are only close to position 100.How did the price of these coins in the last weeks? Let's recap.Dogecoin (launched in 2014) is the most well known memecoin. It's known as a very volatile coin, very prone to react to tweets of Elon Musk, but in 2023, its price has almost not changed: on January 1 and July 16 the price hovered around 7 cents. In-between, there were several spikes, the biggest probably in April when it almost reached 10 cents. But in general we can see that Doge failed to join Bitcoin in its initial bullish steps after the late-2022 dump. I'm a bit less bullish about Doge than about the other two coins of the group, because it lacks a bit of a long term use case. It may be however a good risky investment: if it's really integrated into Twitter then it could jump up quickly again.Litecoin (launched in 2011) is \"silver to BTC's gold\". It has got privacy features last year with MWEB, although these are optional. It's used quite a lot as a transactional/payment coin and has also its own NFT system based on Ordinals. Its price evolved positively in 2023: from 70 $ on January 1 to 94 $ on July 16, with a spike up to $115 in early July. The recent volatility may be caused by speculation on the aftermath of the next halving which will probably take place on August 2. My personal opinion on LTC is positive, I believe for the amount of activity it registers (about half as many transactions as Bitcoin per month) it is undervalued, and it may preserve its position of a major decentralized coin in Bitcoin's tradition with a strong blockchain and high security.Monero (launched in 2014) is probably the most well known privacy coin and employs a ring signature system to achieve fungibility. Its price evolution was slightly bullish in 2023, having traded at 147 $ at January 1 and at 165 $ in the last 24 hours. This doesn't look very impressive, but Monero has managed to keep its price close to 0.005 BTC since 2020, with some spikes in the middle, the last of them having occurred in late January. I think it's difficult another coin can challenge this position as this moment; its major contender Dash has probably weaker privacy and has also lost ground in the last years, and other competitors like Grin or Zcash are even less well known. So basically I expect Monero to follow Bitcoin's steps in terms of price: bullish when the BTC and general crypto market is bullish, and bearish when Bitcoin loses value.As centralized coins have lost a bit of market cap in the last months, all three coins were able to at least preserve their market cap rank, with LTC and XMR having improved a bit.Do you agree or disagree with these opinions? Do you have a favourite of these three coins? All opinions are welcome",

Doge is the most successful Meme coins in the space and being championed by Elon Musk, Litecoin is what Silver is to Bitcoin and as long as there is demand for Bitcoin, Litecoin will continue to shine, Monero is an OG privacy coin and the one that truly stands out from other Privacy coins being a true  and complete dark transaction. Anyone that do not wants to take huge risk can buy into this 3 coins they will surely come good",

So for me, I am really expecting dogecoin will stay the same as Bitcoin.Even though there are already a lot of meme coins out there, Dogecoin is still the number 1 meme coin by market cap.Another thing to compare is to check the chart of DOGEBTC because if you notice, on every bull run, we also see dogecoin follow Bitcoin's price.So for me, Dogecoin is also a big alternative to Bitcoin if they are looking good ROI on every bull run.",

Their experience in the last two years would be painful if they did not cut loss soon enough. I am doubtful that they did cut loss with Dogecoin and most of them will hold Dogecoin, stacked more coins all the down of price in a long bear market.I agree with you that Dogecoin has very strong resistance and selling pressure will be very huge which will need very big demand, buy up, forced liquidation to break $0.7 all time high. It will be impossible in 2023 but in next two years, with a bull run it will be more possible. I am more keen on forced liquidations will help Dogecoin to break $0.7 cap.",

It's too dependant on Musk's tweets/actions. My stance for now is, as I don't believe it will really get major adoption inside the Twitter universe: Let it sleep a bit, once people forgot about Musk it may become again a good investment option. (And the project should really think about updating its code to a \"modern\" codebase with Segwit/Taproot.)Quote from: adaseb on July 18, 2023, 05:02:24 AMAnother issue is the massive miner supply. There is still a huge amount of DOGE released daily that its capping the max price of Doge. Its not possible for it to sustain $1 or $5 long term due to massive miner dumping Doge as soon as their blocks mature.I believe this is actually a good thing, there's a \"roof\" created by the miners which decreases volatility at least a little bit. Not good for traders and bagholders, but better for the long-term viability. The issue with $1 or $5 is that this \"looks\" like it was still a low price, but it would be an enormous increase  (a ~x15 to ~x75) from the current value. Its large supply distorts expectations a bit, as people have a tendency to associate the value with its price per unit (coin) and not so much with market cap. So I think unfortunately it won't go to such a market cap value sustainably, taking into account the current state of the project (old codebase, Musk bagholders ..)Quote from: tokeweed on July 18, 2023, 12:51:17 PMAs for LTC, held some before but never really cared about it.  Didn't buy the silver to BTC's gold argument.  I thought and still think it's dumb.I think the \"silver to BTC's gold\" argument could make sense if LTC continues to experiment with features which are too controversial to add to BTC, like it did with MWEB. Maybe there's a possibility something like Simplicity could added to LTC (a language supporting more expressive smart contracts); that's a feature I'm pretty eager about for BTC but it may make sense to add it first to LTC. Basically, \"silver to BTC's gold\" would then mean: a bit more experimental and volatile and thus less valuable, but nevertheless a solid asset/currency.",

Let's have a simple example:A car's unique selling proposition is to bring you faster from point A to B than on foot. If a car is as slow as going on foot, what's the point in buying one?Cryptocurrencies were developed because they allow decentralized monetary systems, and decentralization is their USP. Why should I buy a cryptocurrency if it's as centralized as PayPal is?(Of course this is an oversimplification. But even if you can \"stake\" a centralized cryptocurrency and thus \"participate\" - PayPal-like services could also offer you interest and the outcome would be almost the same one.)

But if decentralization is absent, then the strongest advantage of cryptocurrencies is simply not present. There are other advantages of cryptos, for example the ease to launch tokens on an established crypto platform without having to think about server security. I'm actually strongly supporting things like utility tokens. But the platform's decentralization continues to be the strongest USP for me. For example, what if a centralized project just gets bankrupt like Terra/Luna? That wouldn't happen to a decentralized currency.",

      "body": "The Litecoin halving, probably on August 2, is an event some are likely looking at to trade. Either because they think the price will rise due to the decreased supply, or because they expect volatility near the date.I am generally a Litecoin supporter, and I also own a few, because I think it's currently the strongest and most solid decentralized alt-chain. However, I don't really have big expectations regarding this halving, so what I write here may not be what some may expect Generally, Litecoin seems to react only in a weak fashion to halvings. Let's look at the LTC/BTC price over the years (LTC/BTC instead of LTC/USD, so the data isn't \"contamined\" by BTC price volatility):Source: Yahoo FinanceThe red dots are approximately the halving dates.- In 2015, there was a big jump in price in the first half of the year: LTC/BTC went from 0.006 up to 0.018 - a x3! But after having reached this high in late June, it went all downhill. The halving was in August, and is barely (or not at all) visible in price.- In 2019, LTC pumped hard again in the first months, this time from 0.008 BTC to 0.019. But again: The peak was well before the halving, at the end of March, and then LTC/BTC entered a bear market which lasted until 2022!The absolute ATH of LTC/BTC wasn't in any way related to any halving: it occurred in early 2018, when it went to 0.023 BTC.I have to admit that I've used Litecoin as an example to counter the Stock to flow theory (I don't think that this theory works, even if it may have some correlation to BTC price between 2012 and 2018 or so). This does not mean that I'm bearish about LTC. LTC has recovered from the 2022 low pretty well and is looking good for the rest of the year in my opinion. But I don't think the halving has any importance for its success. This may be caused by the fact that miners are only a small part of sellers already, so demand plays a much bigger role than supply - just like it occurred to BTC.",

The higher the market cap and above all the trading volume, the lower the incidence of halvings, because miners' importance as sellers shrinks if these indicators go up. (There's one exception: the first halving of a coin pumped to a high market cap).Actually I believe the only halving which had incidence in BTC due to the reduced supply was the 2012 halving. Its consequence was that home mining became increasingly unprofitable, and thus people had to buy coins. In later halvings, miners were a seller group increasingly shrinking in importance, and it was already an \"buy the rumors sell the news\" event, like in 2016 when there was a pre-halving pump and a later dump. The 2017 and 2021 bull runs in my opinions had completely different triggers, they were demand driven; halving could have helped still in 2017 but not by much.LTC is, if I'm not wrong, in terms of miner importance as sellers, already past Bitcoin in 2012. I believe thus that the supply reduction won't have incidence on price, maybe the halving can help a little bit due to the psychological boost. But as I wrote before, looking at LTC's history, its price is driven by other factors.In contrast, in the case of a low cap coin where miners are the primary seller group, however, a halving can reduce the seller side supply significantly and thus push the price - but only if demand is constant or rising. Low cap coins normally are very volatile, so that depending on market direction, halving sometimes doesn't even help against a general dump.@bittraffic: Why the nationality of the LTC holders is important for you?",
