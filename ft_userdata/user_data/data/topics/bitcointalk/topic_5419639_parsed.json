I do get the idea; sportsbetting and watching the game on on live but if it is not directly for this section, things won't work out as planned even if the motive is good.Also many gamblers,nowadays, are just into online gambling. I think it is only on sports and esports betting wherein people are note solely for the profit from which team they brt for, but also for personal enjoyment. If OP made bet on that game, attaching his/her bet with those pictures he captured would more make this topic lively and more relevant. But I do like the idea still of actually watching the game than just making online bets and waiting for the result. Would try this one as well since I am into sports gambling.",

I want to watch the match live from the stadium of one of my favorite teams, it would be an unfulfilled dream without good financial support. No rant, this is just a wish. LOL",

The first one here is a Soldier Field in Chicago.  This was back in I want to say 2009 when Tom Brady and the Patriots were facing off against my Bears.  Brady lit it up in the epic snow game.  The picture doesn't do all the snow and how crazy it was justice.  Brady lit Gronk up this evening, and I believe Gronk had two TDs ( I also think it was his rookie season).  The other photo is of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers stadium in Tampa from a couple years ago.",

We are at the stadium and who goes with the stadium with a piece of paper with them? But, it would be hassle free if we can just follow what the OP has done but it will only be hard to do if you are alone and you only carry one cellphone with you.If someone just grabs the pic of other users, I think it can be the same as plagiarism and plagiarism is a serious offense in the forum but why will they do that?
