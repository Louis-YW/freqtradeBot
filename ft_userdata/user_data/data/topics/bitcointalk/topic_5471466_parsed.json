  "content": "VOC Colonizer Token ‚öìÔ∏èüá≥üá±The VOC Colonizer Token is a community token that aims to revive the history of the VOC (Dutch East India Company) and colonize the cryptospace, propelling our wealth to unprecedented heights. The creator of the token grew tired of losing funds in various crypto projects and devised an innovative solution to overcome the challenges faced by many crypto tokens.Contract BSC: 0xf86b9dd76Cc6ab6Becfef564346245836bEdF978Website: https://VOCColonizer.comCommunity: https://t.me/VOC_ColonizerToken¬† The majority of crypto projects on the Binance Smart Chain often suffer a swift demise due to a lack of volume. This is primarily because the volume relies solely on investors and hype. Investors quickly sell off their tokens, depleting the liquidity pool, resulting in the project's failure and developers abandoning it, leaving investors in a state of financial loss.¬†The VOC Colonizer Token aims to transport users back in time to the era of the VOC, once the world's largest company. Through trade, the VOC amassed immense wealth and dominated the world's seas. The VOC is back with a mission: to colonize the cryptospace. The token will address the identified problems by functioning as a community-driven token. Taxes levied on token transactions will contribute to building capital. This capital will be used for farming reliable cryptocurrency pairs at high interest rates. The interest earned will be used to buy back and burn the token, making it stronger with every transaction. Token holders with more than 5000 $VOC will receive dividends in the form of BUSD, providing an incentive to hold $VOC and participate in the project's journey towards wealth.¬†¬†Tokenomics- Name: VOC Colonizer Token - Symbol: VOC- Total Supply: 10,000,000Taxation: 10/10- Purchase Tax: 10%- 1% Liquidity Pool- 2% BUSD rewards- 5% Community assets - 2% Marketing- Sale Tax: 10%- 1% Liquidity Pool- 2% BUSD rewards- 5% Community assets - 2% MarketingDistribution:- 70% Presale- 20% Liquidity Pool- 10% TeamThe VOC Colonizer Token implemented a 1-year LP (liquidity pool) lock to enhance the token's stability and prevent sudden price fluctuations.
