I thought it was okay, and I don't see the problem here.What do you mean? In your logic, is it my account or what? Like, both registered in 2023 and have few posts, so it's two mine accs? Maybe all accounts that registered in 2023 have a few posts are mine? Nice allegations. Remember to take your meds.I am entirely okay with hearing \"NO\" and not getting the loan, even without arguments, but are you wasting your time inventing crazy theories just to increase your post count? Or are you just desperate for attention?Quote from: HedgeFx on November 02, 2023, 09:12:15 AMYes, is the same idiot .He is only a troll, no address posted.Quote from: Timelord2067 on November 02, 2023, 09:02:23 AMQuote from: makingmoney479 on November 01, 2023, 10:48:45 PMLOAN AMOUNT: 100 USDTREASON: I lost a lot of money gambling last week(a few oversized bets), and I need to pay my bills till my next salary(1000usdt 9 of November)REPAYMENT: 115 USDTREPAYMENT DATE: 10/11/23 or earlierCOLLAT: Stake account, platinum 1, weekly, monthly will be big, since I lost a lot last weekYour loan application looks a whole lot like this one:Quote from: hedgeprx on October 29, 2023, 05:04:32 AMLOAN AMOUNT: 0.031 BTC/ $1650REASON: PERSONALREPAYMENT: 0.035 BTCREPAYMENT DATE: 08/11/23COLLAT: 1150 USDT Right down to \"collat\" in the title and application...Not to mention your Date Registered:    2023-06-21, 22:50:54 with just four posts in that time...Just like hedgeprx Date Registered:    2023-07-02, 19:34:31 and just two posts this week.I am not trolling.

For some people losing 100-200$ is a lot. Of course already knew already how worthless they are, just wanted to point out the real numbers, and not whatever OP said in the other post.",
