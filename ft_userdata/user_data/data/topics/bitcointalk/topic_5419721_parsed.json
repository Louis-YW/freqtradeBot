I would like also to call that as a place to gambling. The cycle is someone was minting NFT then sell it on opensea and finally they are betting on their luck. NFT was actually just a worthless assets if that doesn't have utility even having utility didn't mean if it was a good NFT. There are so many scammers who were using NFT as a way to scamming people too.

The whole art work integrated into crypto world through NFTs is a shady practice which doesn't make sense from the artistic point of view. Why would anyone buy an 'original' virtual art piece which can be simply copied and perfectly reproduced just by clicking print screen button on any keyboard or smartphone? NFTs are great as practical and working items inside virtual gaming universes, but as flat virtual art pieces they are just a tool for wealthy individuals launder money.",

The existence of gaming NFT gives opportunity to vulture for creating many scam attempts by rug pulling those players that promised to have huge ROI. Those play2earn or anything related to earning by holding NFT are now scam and garbage.

Doing research first before you invest can protect you from getting into this kind of trap, so do this always. Many NFTs can stay in the market though because it is being backed up by many investors and they already started to create real usage, if you are lucky enough to get an opportunity to own them, grab it.",

Play2earn like sites are garbage and scammers. NFT needs to be originality, not staked in games. If no one is trying to strive for improvement, this market will only stay at its current state: scam and blind trust in ideas that has no foundation or plans at all. It is sad that in order for people to understand this, something have to go wrong first. On the one hand, I do still believe that NFTs will be used for many different applications in the future.

Not really a good choice when investing in crypto...Agreed, it is impossible to know the true percentage of NFTs which are scams and the art which will never recover the value at which it was sold, but it should be incredibly close to 100%, besides while at some point I tried to see the value that something like this could have for true artists, the more I think about it the less it makes sense, since a truly talented artist could always create a valuable piece of physical art they can sell based on their digital art without the need for NFTs and still make money this way.",

NFT must have demand to get value. No demand meant no value for NFT. So many NFT like land was actually bullshit. The price of virtual land has been going down so hard.
