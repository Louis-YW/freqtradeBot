  "content": "Rethereum: The Ethereum Restart ProjectRethereum is a new blockchain project that aims to revive the original vision of Ethereum as a global, decentralized platform for money and new kinds of applications. Rethereum is based on a modified version of the Ethereum Go client, which is a fork of the official 1.11.6 release. This was the final release to support Proof-of-Work.Rethereum is not just another Ethereum clone. It has several unique features that make it stand out from the crowd. Here are some of them:ETHash-B3: Rethereum uses a new Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm that replaces the hash functions with BLAKE3 This allowed for a natural progression of the chain from CPU mining to GPU mining, as well as improved security and performance.RTH: Rethereum has its own native currency, RTH, which is used to pay for transactions and smart contracts on the network. RTH has a fixed supply schedule that starts with 4 RTH per block and gradually decreases to 1 RTH per block after 9 years. The total supply up to 9 years will be 124,438,360 RTH, plus block fees and uncle rewards.Compatibility: Rethereum is fully compatible with the Ethereum protocol, which means that it can run any Ethereum smart contract or decentralized application (dapp) without any modification. Rethereum also supports the BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) token standard, which allows for interoperability with other blockchain platforms.Innovation: Rethereum is not afraid to experiment with new ideas and features that can improve the user experience and functionality of the network. For example, Rethereum has plans to move the reward model to a 2.1% inflation target in the future, which could provide more stability and sustainability for the network.https://rethereum.org/https://explorer.rethereum.org/poolshttps://miningpoolstats.stream/rethereumRethereum (RTH) GPU Mining https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtR6fvaavB4&ab_channel=HashOnTubeRethereum Whitepaperhttps://github.com/Rethereum-blockchain/whitepaper/blob/master/Rethereum_Whitepaper.pdf",

It was just just a question, as less information about this new ethash3b.Cheers, I keep what I mine so maybe in the future will be a nice surprise.Just please assess the risks. Ethereum has many forks, and all of its forks are useless. Even the original Ethereum Classic coin does not show great success.The new coin does not have much chance of becoming the new Ethereum, so it is better to sell some of the coins to pay for mining costs.",
