Â both are based on the oversimplification of a complex world. it's like tossing a coin once, seeing it come up heads and expecting it to always be heads. The world is too complex to be predicted from just one fractal or calculated out of 1 parameter. I know that our brains are so built that they try hard in total chaos to try desperately to find some patterns, but believe me. Even if you find a pattern with N=10 (the number of repetitions of the pattern in history), it doesn't mean that there is some magical force that creates these patterns. It can still be a total accident, just as it is a total accident to land heads 10x when you blow the coin 3 times before each flip. Which doesn't make it a scientific fact that blowing a coin 3x always makes it heads. @ImThour you create the pattern at N=0, because it hasn't repeated itself even once. Your wishful thinking is counting on it to happen again because it has already happened once but N=0 here.",

There were many predictions made in the past and none to my knowledge went correct. Bitcoin price will skyrocket in the coming years or a bull cycle will happen in 2024 or 2025 is something we all know and wait for. But people are curious about how much the new ATH of bitcoin will reach, that's what we care about. I'm not very good at technical analysis either, but I believe bitcoin's ATH will be very high, probably equal to the OP's number or more. I believe the upcoming bull season is a super cycle and we will hit ATH beyond our imagination. The reason I set that expectation is because I think that is also the time when the world economy enters a period of recovery and development after the economic crisis.",

I can't exactly predict the price of Bitcoin for 2025 but I expect that it will be high considering as it will be a year after the halving event. But according to  coincodex, Bitcoin should rise to 175,683 which is a bit in line with with @ImThour has said but I'm quite sceptic for the month of November tho.

I'm pretty positive about the price of Bitcoin and whatever events take place the Bitcoin's price will be over $120k to $150k during the time that you have predicted.

Okay, I'm not implying the opposite; it's very probable that it'll surpass $100,000 at some point in the distant future. However, coming up with such a bold prediction, which is almost two and a half years away from now, is quite pointless and doubtful to happen. On what data is it based, and how possibly could someone predict such a thing when we're even clueless on how the market progresses till the end of the year, which is less than four months away? On the one hand, I believe that the OP is deliberately overexaggerating, but on the other hand, his prediction shouldn't fall far from what he's anticipating.",

If Bitcoin manages to reach that high in this cycle, we will definitely see it going around $500k by the next cycle but we need a lot more demand and people and institutions buying Bitcoin heavily so that it can go up in price, while in reality, there are generally more selling than buying once the price goes a bit up.I'm pretty sure that most of the retail investors will simply sell their coins when it hits a new all-time high due to lack of patience, they wouldn't wait and expect the price to go higher, and when there is mass selling, though there are those buying them, the price will tend to drop aggressively.",
