The silver coin is dedicated to the Act of Independence of Lithuania and its 20 signatories. Each digital token features one of the signatories and belongs to one of the six signatory categories (priests, presidents, diplomats, industrialists, academics, municipal servants) with 4,000 tokens allotted to each category.When purchasing LBCoin, buyers get six randomly selected digital tokens. Having collected six digital tokens from six different categories, they will be able to exchange them for a silver collector coin. Digital tokens can also be stored in a dedicated wallet on the LBCoin e-shop, sent as a gift, swapped with other collectors, or transferred to a NEM wallet.The physical silver collector coin, which is being sold on Coins for us bears an unconventional denomination of €19.18 to commemorate the year of the Act of Independence (1918 February 16).
