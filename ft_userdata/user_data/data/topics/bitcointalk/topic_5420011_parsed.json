      "body": "One day in the redBitcoin is deadErm...It's made a nice pattern on the daily for people trading it, sadly it has a bearish bias (though we can go up from here and can't go much further below the wick we just made - without breaking out over the next few days). It also looks like something that could break upwards given time. We've had 2 or 3 days of turmoil and no big  flash crashes for major coins (from what I've seen) so I don't think we're doing too badly. If we were at a time when lots of dumb money was here, we'd have crashed hard a few days ago. Next stop looks like it's either 16k or 20k, if we hit below 16k, the big money has won, we'll crash further and the exchanges/whales will be able to onload lots of crypto and sell their cash reserves - so it could go either way from here realistically. Basic technical analysis says we could also hit 10k if we break out of here (I'd expect $14 to be the point people think we need a bounce though if it isn't anywhere from $14-16k). I had an arrow that says we could go to $4k - I deleted that one though, it's unlikely but not impossible",

Or it is that CZ really knows how to manipulate the market and go within on his favor. Don't be surprised with such moves in the market that makes bitcoin decrease in a day and you think that it's all a crash. It's moving from that range and it's not an unusual thing that it goes back a few thousands after it has made $21k. Now, we just have to wait for it again to get back there and try to break $22k.",

The market has survived such situations in the past and bounced back, so FUD is not a thing.  The FTX dispute is similar to the luna crash which brought bitcoin to 20k, today bitcoin is staggering around 18k. Bitcoin will not crash, I believe, below 15k like Arthur Hayes predicts in his recent tweet. Its a sharp moment to take the risk, investors may be waiting for bitcoin to plunge again. And they'll proceed to buy at a cheaper rate.",

      "body": "It's not crashing due to the real value being lower than 20k, but because of lack of liquidity. One exchange had problems and people decided to bail, sell coins they had there and move out. They thought that if the exchange doesn't have their bitcoins maybe it's going to at least have fiat and stable coins. The exchanges are linked so liquidations on one usually lead to same liquidations by bots and leveraged traders on other exchanges.

The price have reached a bottom close to $17k. Anyhow the recovery will happen reaching close around $20k. This is completely a bull trap, and now it's time to have patience. Only then it is possible to be successful as the drama between exchanges continues.",

Won't you kill yourself?  That being said, this is a normal day in terms of Bitcoin volatility. 10% in 24 hours is nothing. In fact, look at it as a blessing to buy coins at discount for future profits. $16K. $10K whatever, Bring it on, I will gladly accumulate what I can with a big smile.",

Bitcoin really crashed today and it looks like it is an opportunity for buyers to  get some holdings from the market and keep buying tokens that they like this because the market will not remain like this forever. We need to see beyond what we have now and take a look at the future because the market is not going to be like this forever.

There's many shitcoins already dead and dump, but Bitcoin will stand and wouldn't become dead coin, it has been proven for 13 years until now. The reason is because most investors who leave their coins on FTX want to move their coins, but they can't since the fees is really high. This make short panic and people lose their confidence to FTX and they also scared if the other centralized exchange did same to them in the future.This is why anyone should hold their coins on hardware wallet.",

Although bitcoin's journey to date has spawned several ATH peaks, I don't even think there's any connection at all in the case of FTX and Binance. Right now it's true that bitcoin is experiencing a correction, but that doesn't mean it will return to the red price or crash as they say.",

However, in this kind of situation, it's better to buy, as e are in the $17,600 range.I do agree that there is nothing to worry, we have been in this kind of situation on the Terra Luna crash and we did bouce back although it take months, but still recovery is there for us.",
