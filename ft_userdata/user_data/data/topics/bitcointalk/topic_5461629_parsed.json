Please share your opinion. Pardon me if I may have gone far on my words, I just felt to share this.",

Please share your opinion. Pardon me if I may have gone far on my words, I just felt to share this. I learnt this narrative was just rumours that never happened.  I am yet to see it in a literature or history book. I know the story is popular on social media but no one can point to any legally recognised news media that published this incident. Personally, I don't see this approach as effective because if it were, the various military coups would have produced corruption free leadership because military coups are carried out on the basis of corruption and injustice. What we need more as a people is issue base politics; we have to continue preaching the need to do things right and just maybe one day it will happen. Rwanda today is making progress because the people realised that doing things right is the key... other African countries can borrow a clue from Rwanda like Zambia is already doing.",
