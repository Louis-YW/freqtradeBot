I'm curious if anyone in our community has actually achieved profitability through gambling. If yes, we can calculate that how much percentage of us are profitable.I know most of the people pay to win and deposit to recover previous losses.write in this format:Code:Context:[color=green]YES[/color] [color=red]NO[/color]Discussion continues from here, Original thread is locked now.",

      "body": "Let me be the first to vote, and my vote is \"NO.\" I've already clicked on the poll too.By the way, I'm a bit confused about the format. Is it green for all the text of my reply when my answer is \"YES\" and red if \"NO\"?I might edit my post later, but just to clarify, my answer is no. I'm not ashamed because, like many others, I believe most of us aren't really profitable in gambling. We're still here because we enjoy it and remain optimistic that one day we'll turn a profit.I usually bet on sports and they say it's a skilled based game and we can be profitable, but not in my case yet.",

I remember one gambler though, he won a grand jackpot in a casino, however, he said that even though he won, he is still in the negative as he has been gambling since the mid 90's.So overall, I don't think that someone will be in the positive if you have been playing for so long.",

And probably the question is why are people still gambling and making casino owners rich but continuing to play? I guess gambling will be part of the culture or it could be innate to some individuals and then casino's playing with our psychology. So definitely it will be negative for us, but most likely we will continue to gamble, whether for fun and entertainment purposes. We might win some money if we get lucky, but it doesn't come very often. So if we win, then just enjoy it. Maybe buy somethings for you or for your love one and then live to play another day.",

Anyway, I vote on the pull but even at that,  my vote may not reflect the actual reality and may be different from the speculation of others here also.",

They should play only for entertainment and nothing more, because if they are lucky there will definitely be a win even though it's not much hahaha. what do you think?",

Maybe someday I will be.It's difficult to find luck in casino games with the house edge against you and sometimes it becomes exaggerated and winning becomes impossible especially for original games with high-risk bets as the choice of option to play. I always play high risk because I want that one hit jackpot but it's too elusive and sometimes when it gives that high multi-win I am deep in my wallet. Like for example I am in 520x loss and it will only give 300x. That's high multi but it won't cover all the losses that I got upon starting to play. There are times that I feel like it was on the seed that I pick or it is just bad luck that I got ever since I became a VIP.",

Exactly my friend, it is a true fact as you said that there is absolutely no certainty in gambling especially for the results at the end of the session, it always and greatly depends on how lucky you are at that time, so what reason do you bring that makes you act aggressively and out of control just for the sake of winning? obviously it's the wrong way and your mindset is not reasonable, very far from what should be done properly. There are some people who say that they can succeed in gambling, which is a very ridiculous statement. It's like they are gambling addicts or potential gambling addicts who have such statements, the initial cause is because they are too serious in seeing the winnings and opportunities that exist in gambling so they put very high hopes and expectations for things that are actually uncertain and fortunately.Yes, it is usually the beginners who are prone to making many mistakes and making wrong decisions, it is because they include you in bringing the wrong mindset when you first come to gambling, maybe you think that you will be able to get money very easily just for gambling, but now you know the real facts, and thank goodness if you have realized and corrected all your mistakes. So the point is especially for beginners do not let you bring the wrong mindset in gambling, it is dangerous.",

Whether it be no or yes, it's really pretty close anyway and you'd still be at a loss even if it was really even. In the first place I probably would've stopped gambling, or have at the very least minimized it if I actually won big in gambling in the past. A lot of stuff I want to improve on, most of which needs money. In the first place though, I think most gamblers lose out when gambling. Just the existence of house edge puts most of us in the loss after all, what more with more cases of us actually lose instead of winning anything big.",

But you know that it is actually a small trigger that can make us addicted to gambling if we are not careful in using gambling.Many people are so carried away by gambling that they will continue to return to gambling even though they have experienced a lot of losses.We must not experience as many losses as they do, so we must really take care of ourselves while gambling.It is normal when we know that many people have been gambling for a long time and have experienced a lot of losses because, in gambling, it is difficult for us to win.If we don't want to lose a lot, we can manage our gambling time and really limit the money we spend on gambling.
