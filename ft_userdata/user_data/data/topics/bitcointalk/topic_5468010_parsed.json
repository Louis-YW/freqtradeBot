Does day trading seem more of a gamble compared to a straight-up coin flipCoin flip has a defined winning chance rate while day trading has a dynamic winning chance rate depending on how good you are on trading. So I say trading is more on gambling if you don’t know what you are doing such us newbies buying bunch of random shitcoins without doing research first.On trading, you have a chance to improve your winning probability while gambling is purely relying on luck since you can’t improve the outcome no matter how good you are.",

Does day trading seem more of a gamble compared to a straight-up coin flipDay trading is different from gambling but it can be gambling for those that did not understand how it works. Even in day trading, people can lose more just like in gambling because they are not getting it. If it is learned and not using more than the amount you can afford to lose and not using leverage, you will make money from trading if you learn about when to open a position. Sine when I have been trading and gambling, I lost huge amount in both, but when I know more about trading, I gain in it than gambling.",

If the answer is no then you can't really equate that to day trading where charting skill is quite vital.I get where you're coming from though. Day traders get it wrong or just gets lucky most of the time so that's where it's compared to gambling.",

Does day trading seem more of a gamble compared to a straight-up coin flipCoin flip might be simple but it is still a gambling activity where one cannot mitigate risk except to manage the bankroll.  While trading might be a complex activity, but risk management has a huge effect in mitigating risk to a minimum.  It is that trading needs a lot of patience and research to master.  So I say no, trading does not seem more of a gamble compared to a  straight-up coin flip.Quote from: bettercrypto on September 25, 2023, 10:13:33 AMQuote from: fingnome on September 25, 2023, 08:43:05 AMLost in the whirlwind world of day trading?

      "body": "Day trading is risky and has a limited daily income for individual traders, some can earn $40 a day and others above it. Though it's not guaranteed, because of losses. But, it has a way of getting it work for the traders unlike flip coins. No strategy can determine the wining side of the coin, it's all luck. Day trading, because people lose a lot like in gambling, isn't a game. And because we win cryptocurrency in gambling doesn't make it a trading activity. They are both different methods of participating in gambling and trading. Participating with caution, is the only similarity between them. The 50/50 chances in coin flip, doesn't reduce the high risk of losing too. Personally, I prefer flip coins to day trading, because no skill is required to flip coins and win money. Yet the slim earning opportunity the both activities provide still looks like a 50/50 choice.",

Although they both carry an inherent risk, you're better off risking your money trading blind than gambling because you can still get out in a loss in trading unlike gambling where you won't get your money back if you lose (which is the likely scenario most of the time).",
