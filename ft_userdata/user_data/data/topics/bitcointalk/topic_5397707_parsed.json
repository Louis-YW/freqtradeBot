In his official telegram channel, he wrote that Coinbase will follow something similar to what Binance did when they restricted Russian wallets with over $10 worth of cryptos. He says that in case of Coinbase, the limit will be restricted access to wallets of Russian citizens whose balances are above 10,000 EUR. He says that the ability to top up the account is already restricted, and that the blocking of accounts will occur on May 31. Actions are explained by the approved package of EU and Switzerland's sanctions from April 10.What do you think of such actions? Is it the problem of centralization or the strength of consolidated institutional response to you?",

For anyone that wants to have his own control, the person should use a noncustododial wallet, not custodial wallet or exchange account which can be be freezed.",

Coinbase operates as a centralized exchange, and this action by them is not really surprising especially if they are pressed to do such actions. The question is, where will the money go after they're frozen? Well perhaps it'll remain in Coinbase's possession, but it could still be seized or surrendered to relevant governments after all. This is why you don't keep money on exchanges. Things like this randomly happens and when it's time to get your money, you will get nothing because your account is already frozen due to reasons beyond your control.",

I don't see Russia on their \"available countries\" page: https://www.coinbase.com/placesThat's a very good point, actually. It seems they don't provide access to Russia as a country. However, there have been news that they blocked 25 thousand addresses related to Russia on March 8.So I guess it means that there are at least some Russians using Coinbase anyway, and they will be affected by this restriction. I'm not sure if these are people residing in Russia and using VPNs or Russian citizens residing in other countries, though.Quote from: mindrust on May 08, 2022, 07:40:43 AMThat's theft.If anybody thinks this is fine just because they only seized the Russian money, think again.

That's not how I understood the news. Given that there was a comparison with Binance, I figured it would be done similarly. On Binance, if I understand correctly, the exchange warned people that new restrictions will be imposed and allowed getting all the money out of the exchange (at least allowed a time window for that). I'd expect Coinbase to address it in a similar fashion, saying that the restrictions are being put in place and that they have time till a certain day to withdraw their money.I should also add that these are not frivolous actions of exchanges, they are only following international sanctions.",

This is only a matter of time when countries after countries are implementing on sanctions to Russia. And knowing Coinbase, definitely, it will follow what they are supposed to do, follow the government regulations where they are based at. So if you are a Russian, definitely, you should know that by now and before this implementation, you already know where to store your funds.",

      "body": "While Coinbase hasn't yet issued an official statement on this, it is not unlikely that this will happen. Binance has already implemented this \"following the EU's fifth package of restrictive measures against Russia.\"[1] So if this restriction is indeed in line with the latest package of sanctions, it's probably just a matter of time before Coinbase will finally implement it.This is obviously a direct effect of centralization. This is not a show of strength of united institutions. After all, these are not unilateral initiatives. Instead, these are steps in compliance with legal pressure. Lest we forget, both Binance and Coinbase did not heed Ukraine's earlier call to ban Russian accounts. These latest developments are clearly born out of government demands.
