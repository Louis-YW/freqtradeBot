  "content": "A Political System of Administration simply means the field of work in which an individual or a group of individuals manages one or more systems with the goal of ensuring that the systems are running efficiently and effectively.In order to attain this, a very sound and technical knowledge is one of the key element required.  The Political System of Administration in Nigeria is not only faced with the problems of Bribery,  Corruption and Embezzlement alone but it is mostly affected by lack of Managerial Skills and of course lack of Willingness.Nigeria requires a governance structure that will improve voter education and leadership competency, as opposed to the current system, which relies on empty promises, bribery, voter intimidation, and violence to secure votes.The issue of governance is at the heart of Nigeria's Political systemic failure. The true Culture of Democracy are being submerged because of greed and unwillingness to demonstrate the Spirit of intellectualism and problem-solving capabilities. The fact remains that there are no hidden factors leading to development of First World Countries (Developed Countries) except for of course the lack of Managerial Skills and Expertise on Political System Of Administration bedeviling the Nigerian State.According to Jason Brennan, he believes that specific expertise is required to tackle socio-economic issues, so political power should be apportioned based on expert knowledge. Brennan suggests that, Nigeria lacks a system of governance in which leadership is based on capability. By implication, the argument that the failure of governance in Nigeria is the result of incompetent leadership; seems possible. One of the most reliable Solution to the backdrop of Nigeria's Political System Of Administration is that a Criteria for acquiring Political Positions should be based on the level of Educational attainment in the field of Politics and Administration for any Candidate as a prerequisite for a Politician to occupy a certain Position. And also the eligibility to vote should be accorded to individuals who satisfy certain educational criteria.The Constitution must ensure that only citizens who can formulate policies and make informed decisions in the public’s best interest can run for public office.The benefits of adopting such methods are that many Citizens would desire to be educated in preparation for Leadership. Political leaders will be held more accountable if the people is better informed. Civic education, Political Science, Public Administration e.t.c, on the other hand, are the type of education that is required to dramatically alter Nigeria's government landscape. As Rotimi Fawole notes, the bar should be higher for those aspiring to executive or legislative office “to improve the ideas that are put forward and the intellectual rigor applied to the discussions that underpin our statehood.”Nigeria is facing governance issues as a result of two decades of a failed democratic endeavor, as this article acknowledges. Governing these difficulties necessitates for Knowledgeable leaders and an equally well-informed electorate. The implementation of a Viable Political System of governance within the Nigerian context must be incremental, bearing in mind that Nigeria’s democracy is still evolving.",

Then they can take over the free people of their country because they have received the strength... they can buy guns.All those wonderful humanitarian goals are simply a way for the leaders to make money, and assure themselves a place of wealth in the nation.Slavery just doesn't stop in Africa.",
