  "content": "Can you split your secret (You own Bitcoin, your 24 words, passphrase, and hidden locations) in such a way, that nobody knows your secret, but they will still tell you, if you forget?Sounds impossible?▼ Find out below how to do it ▼You would like to self-custody your Bitcoin.Why?❶ No bankruptcy risk: You want to avoid losing your life savings to a bankruptcy like FTX or Blockfi❷ Less risk of being robbed: Having your name, your address, your passport and your wealth in a centralized data base is risky. The database could be hacked, and you and your family could be robbed.Your task:❶ Don't forget / lose your seed words❷ Prevent others from gaining access to your seed words.Best case: You have my seed words stored in multiple safe locationsYour building blocks:❶ people (family, friends)❷ stuff (paper, metal plates, Tails OS, USB, Veracrypt, HW-Wallet)❸ locations❶ Variant I (the stupid plan)  ➀ setup:    ⓐ your house -> here you store your HW-Wallet    ⓑ your brain -> here you store the PIN for your HW-Wallet  ➁ access:    ⓐ You need your brain (PIN) AND your house AND your HW-Wallet to access your Bitcoin  ➂ how to lose your Bitcoin?    ⓐ HW-Wallet broken    ⓑ lose access to your house    ⓒ forget your PIN    ▶ main weakness: You lose your Bitcoin, when you forget your PIN or your HW-Wallet breaks, both of wich is likely to happen someday into the future.  ④ how to get robbed?    ⓐ robbers enters your house while you are inside and threatens violence  ⑤ additional advise:    ⓐ don't use Ledger + Ledgerlive (combination of shipping data and XPUB in a centralized data base), better use Sparrow Wallet (plus I like Coldcard)    ⓑ encrypt your hard drives (with e.g. Veracrypt)    ⓒ use Linux instead of Windows and TOR instead of clearnet for better privacy    ⓓ don't ship the HW-Wallet to your own home address❷ Variant II (the minimal plan)  ➀ setup:    ⓐ your house       ->

of paper) AND house AND paper  ➂ how to lose your Bitcoin?    ⓐ lose access to your house    ⓑ HW-Wallet and Paper are broken    ⓒ forget PIN AND location of paper    ▶ main weakness: losing access to your house (surprising divorce, covid quarantine camp, internment camp)  ④ how to get robbed?    ⓐ robbers enters your house while you are inside and threatens violence    ⓑ burglar finds paper (unlikely)  ⑤ additional advice:    ⓐ write 24 seed words with pencil on paper, surround paper with transparent duct tape, hide paper well    ⓑ instead of using your house, you can use 4 other locations (work office, garden house, relative's house, friend's house)      split your seed words via XOR into two parts (2x), make 2 copies each (2x2=4) and then hide them well❸ Variant III (the brain plan)  ➀ setup:    ⓐ your house       -> HW-Wallet      -> hidden paper with 24 seed words    ⓑ your brain      -> PIN for your HW-Wallet      -> location of hidden paper      -> 24 seed

I like the split 24 words plus passphrase, because the passphrase is not recognizable to be part of a Bitcoin wallet and therefore requires less hiding.A multisig alone also does not solve the inheritance problem. If you hide all pieces of your multisig well, your heirs can't access your bitcoin. If you share the pieces among them, they know you have Bitcoin and additionally could take your money against your wishes.\"❺ Variant V (surprised heirs)\" makes it possible to hide your secret from others while also greatly reducing the risk losing your wallet in case of brain damage / memory loss.",

The more complex you make it, your security actually goes down as a result, due to the fact you'll start forgetting your own process eventually. Simply letting someone know that you trust, that if memory loss occurs they can remind you or show you what you had. However, that really is down to who you trust. I do feel most people have someone they can trust though. Usually, for a lot of people it's a partner. The only issue with that is your trusting someone who's close enough to you, and could potentially be a part of the accident that might cause memory loss. There's a reason why the royals around the world fly their children separate to their parents, same as driving to various locations. You probably need two people you can trust to be quite confident that if you did lose your memory for whatever reason, they'd be able to help. However, the more people you trust, the more risk involved.",

Variants III to VI use the brain for memorizing the seed words.Quote from: Plaguedeath on March 02, 2023, 11:59:25 AMIt looks really complicated and brain wallet isn't safe because there's a risk where your might suffer brain injury when you're accidentally crash during driving or getting older. Here's the statistic where brain injury has higher chance could happen. You can teach your kids or someone you loved to access your wallet, but if the steps are really complicated, they might also forgot it due to multiple reasons of human error.I am aware I can forget the seed words. Therefore in each variant II to VI the seed words are written down and hidden.If you forget your seed words and the location of the written down seed words you can still ask your friend to give you back the USB stick with the manual. Unlock the USB stick and learn that you own Bitcoin and the location of the 24 words.If you die, your wife will probably worry about money. She will probably check the banking folder. For your funeral she will also check the government documents folder. So she knows that the USB is encrypted with Veracrypt and she knows the password. Since your dad, your brother and your best friend learn you died, they will give the encrypted USB sticks to your wife. So now she has the password and the USB sticks. After decryption she will find one document. She will read the document and learn (i) you own Bitcoin (ii) Bitcoin is valuable (iii) you can sell Bitcoin (iv) you need 24 words + passphrase to use your bitcoin and (v) the location of the words in our house.I think a reasonably intelligent person is able to install veracrypt and enter a password to unlock the USB. I also think having 24 words plus passphrase makes it reasonably easy to control the Bitcoin wallet.",

Other people already know you do \"something with Bitcoin\". A guy, who saves into Bitcoin, would combine the XOR-seeds or 24 words + passphrase less than once a year, since he mostly only accumulates into a watch only wallet.A multisig setup (at least 2 of 3, better 3 of 5) requires at least 3 locations, which can hold a hardware wallet plus 24 seed words on paper. Sounds difficult to hide. Many people don't control so many locations well enough. Hiding 24 words on paper is much easier (small, not metal). Hiding a passphrase is even easier, since nobody even knows the passphrase belongs to a wallet.Let's say you own 20 books at the doctor's office you work at. Book 4 on page 263 has a passphrase. You have some written note books from the years 2013-2023. In the note book from 2015 on page 22.11.2015 there is a passphrase. A passphrase doesn't even have to be locked or hidden. It is just a paper among papers, a note among notes.Let's say you have 500 pictures of your kids. One of the digital pictures has a hidden stenographic message. You have 10 photo books. the photos have descriptions. One of the descriptions contains your paraphrase. Between the pictures and the book there are some seed words.Words can be hidden anywhere. Hardwarewallets and laptops not.I still keep an open mind about multisig. Maybe I miss some information. But with my current knowledge and my low frequency sending of funds, I prefer 24W+25th word or seed splitting with XOR.",

However, it will be poorly resistant to theft, since an attacker only has to recover one of your several back ups in order to access your wallet.Conversely, a system which requires access to (a) AND (b) AND (c) is very resistant to theft, but poorly resistant to loss. You can make it more resistant to loss by having two or even three copies of each part, but then that becomes more and more inconvenient to find different secure places to store 6 or even 9 separate pieces of your back up.A few general comments about your various proposals: First, your memory is never safe and never reliable, for the reasons in my post Plaguedeath has quoted above. You should never rely on memorizing your seed phrase. Secondly, any system where all your back ups are stored in the same location as your wallets themselves (such as having both your hardware device and your paper back ups all stored in your house) is very poorly resistant to loss, since a single accident, natural event, fire, etc., can destroy both. You need offsite back up.",
