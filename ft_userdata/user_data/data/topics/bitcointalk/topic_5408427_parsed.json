      "body": "Not everything is profitable, investing in memes is very risky, most of them are scam projects, you should be careful. You are lucky that you were able to make a profit investing in those anonymous coins. If you still want to invest in memecoins, you may do so as long as you invest only in projects such as doge or shiba, I think these projects still have the potential to rise in the future, I guess both won't stop at today's prices. For other memes it just bumps and dumps and will disappear after that, you should be careful.",

Good to those that have made money on these times and that's all you need to do.Even with the popularity of meme coins, it's not just started from 1. There were already many of them but because of the hype that has started from Doge to Shiba and with the help of Elon.Many of them came out from nowhere.",

      "body": "What you need to know about meme coins is that they are very volatile, in fact I think they are more so than other altcoins. however, you are lucky to invest when the price is going up, but what if it goes down, then your opinion will definitely be different.other than that, I understand what you mean that 1 coin meme can be very valuable. however, not all meme coins will be like that. maybe, the meme coin that you are investing in is currently high, but sometimes there are too many meme coins that also become a rug pull. where they sometimes deliberately increase the price of the coin to attract investors, then dump the price in a short time. however, do your research before investing, not assuming that all meme coins will be very high in the future.",

The best gains are made when your meme coin is ranked #800 or somewhere around thereIf you like gambling, then you can try your luck in meme coins. But one thing we all need to understand that meme coins are no good. A short term gambling is ok but never keep your money for long term in any meme coins. They don't have any use case or any specific usage, also they are super bad for long term investment. It's 100s of meme coins now, it will be 1000 in no time. Most of the ponzi scheme owners are trying their luck in crypto market and that's why you will always see newer cpins introducing in the market.",

It was all fun up to the DOGE but after that they started coming one by one and flooded the whole market. Literally now they are having mergers with metaverse too and thus following the path of getting NFT’s of their own meme coin. Whats all this going on! It really sucks and making the crypto look like a joke. This is getting horrible day by day with meme coins and its way confusing over the period of time because we can’t really rely on one ( though its funny investing in them)",

Not bad !  Go on as long as you invested with money that you can afford to lose, and you fully understand how the market reacts to trending types of coins, they are the type of coins that now they are pumping but after a few weeks people began to dump them because of loss of support, just be sure you follow trend coins that you're investing and see the best time to dump them for profit, what's trending now, will be replaced by a new one.",

Getting pair to promote NFTs were not a new thing in the crypto. There are some celebrities who have been doing it as well but again it's about how to comply with the regulation. It's too risky for her to release his token and maybe SEC will be charging him as well for issuing the security token to the market. It's better if she will not be doing it or she will face various problems. You're lucky enough to get profit from meme token but this will not always happen. Stay away to take the risk by used meme token as investment.",

So good for you that you didn't miss the opportunity from it, but be careful and don't be greedy to prevent doing mistake decisions because you know I've been there on what you're doing and i end up nothing afterwards in just one mistake. .
