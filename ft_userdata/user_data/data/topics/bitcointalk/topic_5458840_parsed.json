  "content": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is gradually solidifying its status as a go-to Bitcoin mining destination in the Middle East. The country has established itself as a pro-Web3 destination for crypto-focused companies with over 30 free trade zones and a growing contribution to the Bitcoin mining hash rate.The UAE’s mining journey began with Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital partnering with Zero Two — the digital asset arm of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund — in May. The joint venture established two mining sites with a combined 250-megawatt (MW) capacity in Abu Dhabi.Abu Dhabi has become a hub for all kinds of crypto mining activity in the UAE due to its energy efficiency and status as the center of trade in the country.According to data from Hashrate Index, UAE’s combined Bitcoin mining capacity is likely around 400 MW — or 4% of Bitcon’s global hash rate. While the likes of the United States, China, Russia and Kazakhstan are the top four countries with the largest share of Bitcoin’s global hash rate, the UAE could gradually climb the ladder due to its available resources. As a global player in the energy market, the UAE has shifted its focus from its oil and gas reserves toward solar and nuclear energy. Historically, the country’s electricity was generated by natural gas, but in the recent past, shares of nuclear and solar are growing rapidly.UAE’s electricity demands fluctuate significantly between the hottest and coolest months, leading to a heavy loss of generated electricity. For example, in 2021, the UAE’s combined power and desalination plants wasted 20 terawatt hours, equal to approximately $600 million. This gap and wastage of electricity could be filled by Bitcoin miners.With Bitcoin mining focused on using clean energy sources, the UAE could see a significant chunk of its energy coming from nuclear and renewable sources in the next decade. Thus, the surplus from these sources could be utilized by miners in the country. Among other advantages for miners is the country's zero-tax policy.This means Bitcoin miners can register in one of the country’s over 30 free trade zones and avoid corporate tax, value-added tax and import duties — a significant advantage over operating in Western countries.NEWS SOURCE HERE",

Let's just hope that they will gonna become crypto-friendly forever because that kind of nation can support the whole crypto miners all around the world with only itself. After the miners are always banished from other countries that they thought they gonna be their home, they can put their trust in UAE because this is a country where they don't just quickly change their minds after they made such huge decisions as this one.",

Hongkong has recently started attracting large investors and founders. Singapore has been doing it for quite sometime now. What I find interesting with this news is the UAE might become the only friendly country for the Bitcoin miners in the whole of middle east. I don't think they would banish the miners later on because they are a very ambitious country otherwise why would they open Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) before announcing this news. They have a complete strategy in place and abundant of green energy for the miners.",

      "body": "UAE has long been on the limelight to being a Crypto friendly nation. They are strategically positioned to take charge of the Crypto market by preparing a framework for the Crypto community. The UAE saw the future of Crypto currency and were quick to swing in the same direction with it by creating an enabling ecosystem for easy adaptability.With this development and based on the research findings of MOProgress, UAE would be the next destination of miners citing the enabling ecosystem and environment created by the government and in return, revenue would definitely be generated by the government from the miners that would want to establish their mining farm there.",

Hope they won't be backing out and make this move to get crypto demand going...This is Big Big NEWs!!",

      "body": "This is a major finding that demonstrates how the Bitcoin mining industry is changing on a worldwide scale. On the one hand, it is wonderful that the UAE is working to promote itself as a pro-Web3 centre. However, the idea that the UAE might use its unused electricity for Bitcoin mining poses some important concerns. Why isnt the excess energy being used more effectively to satisfy the requirements of the population in the UAE or, at the absolute least, to lower the price of power if there is a surplus that is being wasted?Although it is admirable that the UAE is embracing nuclear and renewable energy sources for Bitcoin mining, I have my doubts about the long-term effects on the environment. It is no secret that mining Bitcoin does not entirely reduce its environmental impact, especially when using renewable resources. Watching the UAE handle this will be intriguing.Additionally, the UAE's zero-tax regime undoubtedly provides Bitcoin miners with a favourable business climate, but what about the local economy? Is this strategy long-term viable and advantageous, or does it run the danger of upsetting the UAE's economic balance?",

In sports, Saudi Arabia is now competing with most top European leagues for players. They have attracted some of the best players and coaches that the kingdom is now a major threat. In education, they have some of the best universities in their educational-free zone. Many top-class universities have their campuses in UAE and they have been striving well. If they have cheap and constant electricity and the government is willing to make the Emirates a mining hub by enacting friendly laws, then many miners and Bitcoin enthusiasts will be willing to give the kingdom a try. The Emirate has Islam as a state religion but these laws have been made flexible to attract investors and businesses. So with some Western nations becoming hostile to the crypto world, UAE can be the growing paradise for miners and others.",

Even after the ban, it is said that tgere are so many farms in china just approved by the government alone. All in all mining is a tough business and nobody should aim at making a ton of money from it, there isnt any room for growth there. You can get more machines or you can upgrade it but that is tge extend of what you can do, which means that its a limited business idea and shouldnt be considering UAE to do much with this neither, it would be a small deal and wouldnt make too many changes.",
