Can your car engine run when you turn it off?Okay, I'll try without the sarcasm: What are you trying to accomplish? And why do you need to run a full node 24/7 if you don't want your computer to be on?",

That is possible only if it's fully running.Since you cannot do that, then it means that you cannot properly run a bitcoin node.Now, if you only want to do tests now and then, you can start it 1h before your tests, leave it catch up and play with it.If you want to only use it for your wallet, please read my previous post.Or, maybe you tell what you want to achieve (it was requested by others too, but you seem to ignore that), in order to get better advises, exactly for your use case.",

However, you will have to download the previous blocks when you connect to other nodes before you will be able to validate new transactions because you will be behind current block.Running a full node might not give you the maximum privacy you want but it is far better than using an SPV wallet, so I wouldn't advice you to settle for less if you have a PC that has the capacity to run a full node.",

I thought there's a way like Sleep mode or anything else to make my computer silent and consuming less resources but running the full node in the same time. Thanks for your answers!",
