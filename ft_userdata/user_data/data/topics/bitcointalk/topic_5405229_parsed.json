For some projects it is to enhance more features to the new contract, for some it is to protect the project (if dev notice any vulnerability). while some its to enable the contract to perform more functions (especially gaming platforms). And yes some projects do this to scam bounty participants, they send v1, create v2 and ask users to swap 10% monthly.",

They want quick money even it does not help them richer.Last two years, things are changing with DeFi and decentralized exchanges, so some of bounty hunders can create trading pairs on Pancakeswap, add community liquidity there. They dump their tokens received from bounty on DEX while public sale is still going. That is very harmful for projects and they change smart contract.Bounty hunters have their responsibility there too but projects should plan to distribute bounty reward only after their public sale is finished.",

You don't need to worry about such things because this kind of matter is for the team only. Just follow their instructions on how you will gonna withdraw your rewards and I'm sure most of them won't let their bounty participants down after all they are one of the main keys to why their project has earned popularity.",

But in some cases, some projects change their smart contract to speed up transactions and fees. It is very important that we are also updated with the team/developers especially if we are holding coins. Some participants had missed the updates and it confuse them which lead them not able to trade or sell. And for sure they will explain their reason why conducting such changes and to help understand every holder and every investor.",

Actually you can just ask this to the token developer directly through the available media, although asking in this forum will not be wrong, but the answers you will receive will definitely vary greatly.So try to ask the token developer in question for a very specific answer to this.",

Then they built their own blockchain (like an EOS) or went to other ecosystems or developed smart contracts for the tasks of the project.

And talking about smart-contract changes, it's usually the developers who change their smart contracts because they find loopholes that might be very dangerous if the current contact continues to be used. one more thing, if the developer changes their smart-contract, it will affect you, as far as I know, if they change the smart-contract, they will tell their token holders to swap tokens from the old contract to the new one.",

The first and most severe one for me is that there was a major bug in the first smart contract code. In that case you have to halt the blockchain or remove the liquidity from the token until you have a fix for the bug and then the old tokens can be swapped for the new ones.Another reason is that the project is building it's own chain but is not finished with it yet. Then you get a ERC-20 or BSC token and once the own chain is done you can swap to the new native tokens. Radix did it that way for example.",

This is why we should always take profit with our bounty reward since not all can sustain their momentum in long term. If you see a project change into another contract better to analyze it, and know if its still worth it to hold that token.",

THese days investors become even smarter than before by filtering the garbage project. There are so many successful IDO recently, poeople are still looking for the new projects that can give them all huge return. This can't be done through investing in the existing token. The new projects are much more preferable to all of investors for now. I think that some legit projects were changing smartcontract for ugent reasons",
