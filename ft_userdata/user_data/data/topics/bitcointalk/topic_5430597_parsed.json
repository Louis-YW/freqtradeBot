Ever since the growth of some decentralized exchanges, some scammers have taken scamming to the next level since tokens can be minted by anyone on dex chains (pancake chain particularly) and traders can buy and sell without any limitations. However, it has increased the rate of fake smart contracts, which may result in buying fake tokens that you may not be able to sell back, steal or sweep wallets with good tokens or coins.What this website does is scam people further, they claim to help you recover lost coins from scammers by scamming people more by requesting the victim's private keys with an assurance of an 85% rate of getting their money back.Name of website:Code:Returnyourcrypto.comEmail:Code:support@returnyourcrypto.comName of Telegram user:Code:https://t.me/R_Y_CryptoAdditional Info:Quote from: https://www.whois.com/whois/returnyourcrypto.comDomain InformationDomain:returnyourcrypto.comRegistrar:NameSilo, LLCRegistered On:2022-12-05Expires On:2023-12-05Updated On:2022-12-05Status:clientTransferProhibitedName Servers:ns1.hostsilo.comns2.hostsilo.com",
