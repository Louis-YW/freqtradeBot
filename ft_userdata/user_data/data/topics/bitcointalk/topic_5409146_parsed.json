      "body": "Thanks guys.Let me clarify a bit: the reason I started this topic is because a couple days ago I requested a withdrawal from one crypto sportsbook to another one. In the cashier section of the other one (named Justbet.cx) they have a list of cryptocurrencies and I selected Tether and got this address (the one I mentioned in the OP).So I withdrew my USDT balance in the other book to this address. Then it lasted a couple hours and I still did not get the funds credited on Justbet and I asked the other book what is wrong and they said the transaction failed. Now, after doing some research it's starting to look like the Tether-address I got fom the cashier in Justbet was in fact a Bitcoin address. Which is ofcourse a horrible mistake of them and now because of this my funds are stuck in the air somewhere.But some things confuse me. I went into the Justbet livechat and their Bitcoin specialist that I got connected to kept saying that it really is a Tether address. So either they have no clue what they are talking about or it is in fact an address that can receive both Bitcoin and USDT? I did not know that was possible but looking at what bitmover said in the post above this, there are addresses that can receive both?And one more question: as you guys said the address I posted is a completely empty address with no transactions visible. Should it not show at least a failed transaction if USDT is sent to a Bitcoin address? Or does a failed transaction equal no transaction and therefore it shows zero transactions?",

But if that is the case, they should have had a disclaimer listing that the sender has to use the omni wallet too. And this disclaimer wasn't there so even in this case it's still sloppy.",

And they on their turn have an external provider doing the transfers for them.Please don't question Wintomato's trustability since I have a long history with them and they never did anything bad for me and processed numerous deposits and withdrawals already. But those were always with Bitcoin and this one was the first one with USDT. So I find it hard to believe that they really did not send anything out.But then again, if they send USDT to a Bitcoin address, shouldn't they get a warning that it's an invalid address?And on the receiving side of the transfer is the online bookmaker Justbet.cx, also no question about their trustability and I also have a long positive history with them.It's a deposit into my account there. I just opened the cashier, selected Tether and copied the address and entered into the Wintomato withdrawal screen.This is wintomato USDT deposit screen. I entered a random Btc address just for testinghttps://wintomato.com/en/billing/withdrawThis failed the captcha with the BTC address. So maybe you didn't send anything at all (there is a chance)They support only TRON and ETH chains (which is disabled now). It is impossible they could have sent USDT in the bitcoin chain to justbet.cx.You most likely sent in TRON chain to justbet (which can't receive it)I took a look at justbet.cx and they don't mention USDT support in their website (btc, ltc, etc and bch)https://www.justbet.co/bitcoin-sportsbookQuote from: MegaAkker on August 09, 2022, 06:51:01 AMI'm very confused.....some people in this topic say that since nothing is visible on that address, they are 100% certain nothing was ever sent.And now you are totally on the other side of the spectrum, saying funds are lost forever.

This is why it might be lost.QuoteAnd still I am confused because there are also people here who say Bitcoin addresses can receive USDT payments.There is nothing to be confused here. Bitcoin address can receive OMNI layer USDT tokens.Bitcoin addresses cannot receive TRC-20 USDT tokens or any other type of USDT token.Quote from: MegaAkker on August 09, 2022, 08:44:15 AMOnly this time it's going wrong, because it's the first time I use USDT. And if funds can be salvaged, they will still be salvaged because both parties (sender and intended receiver) can be trusted completely and will collaborate if I give them instructions.  That is not the issue. So you think something can be salvaged? How?You need to try to discover where did your coins go (if they did go at all). I believe wintomato did not sent anything.You need to contact wintomato support to see if they did send anything at all. Then, if they did send, you need to look for blockchain confirmation.If you see a blcokchain confirmation, you might need to contact justbet support to try to recover the private key of the lost funds. It is very unllikely that third party will try to recover private key of funds sent to wrong addresses, because it is a security risk for them and the fault is on you (who sent coins to the wrong address). this is why it is much easier to recover funds that you sent to a wallet you control the private keys.This is a copy-paste of justbet.cx terms (https://www.justbet.co/bitcoin-sportsbook):QuoteIMPORTANT!Every Bitcoin transaction uses a unique address. We strongly recommend copying and pasting Bitcoin addresses (use the copy/paste icon in the Cashier). Do not try typing an address by hand. If you make a mistake with the address, it is possible to send the Bitcoin to the wrong receiver and the funds may be lost....Be sure to double-check the address where you are sending or receiving your Bitcoin. If you send to the wrong receiver, there’s usually no way to retrieve the funds, unless the other party agrees to send them back to you.",
