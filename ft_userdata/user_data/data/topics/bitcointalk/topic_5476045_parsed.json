Why people using that slowpoke (BTC)?Quote from: Ultegra134 on November 29, 2023, 07:04:52 AMJust be a little patient, and if it actually works, it should get through within the day or tomorrow.Just be a little patient? MUAHAHAHAHA      Holders of our BSV never experience such a problem as waiting for somethingQuote from: Zaguru12 on November 29, 2023, 06:56:37 AMThere is nothing that can be done Thank God people are starting to understand how flawed that slowpoke called BTC is.It's time for this dinosaur called BTC to go to the history museum. Quote from: Ultegra134 on November 29, 2023, 10:40:35 AMI don't understand though, you're in a forum named after Bitcoin, do you actually believe that people are going to accept your opinion regarding a Bitcoin fork?We don't need to do anything for acceptance. BTC will bury itself due to slow transactions and lack of meaningful implementationsQuote from: Lucius on November 29, 2023, 11:03:14 AM...who uses every opportunity to promote something that sinks deeper every day.Lucius, do me a favor - find a jobQuote from: Lucius on November 29, 2023, 11:03:14 AM...something that sinks deeper every day. Yes, I see that BTC sinks deeper every day. Soon you will all choke from the complaints of the newbies of unconfirmed transactions.Quote from: Lucius on November 29, 2023, 11:03:14 AMIf he waited 3 weeks, maybe he should wait another 3 daysAnd then let's wait another three weeks?      What a shame. And this is the future of your BTC?Quote from: Lucius on November 29, 2023, 11:03:14 AMbut if he has $20 to pay for accelerationBTC - is real shame.     Quote from: Ultegra134 on November 29, 2023, 10:40:35 AMHowever, how is your reply anywhere helpful to the OP? BSV has high throughput and ultra-low fees. With BSV no one will pay anything extra to advance the transaction",

      "body": "BSV is now an outdated crypto with only followers like you who are faithful to faketoshi. BSV was not created to help gain financial freedom nor was it meant to become a payment processor. It was only a fork that made everyone clear how much faketoshi had been spewing lies. None of us here believe in your perspective as you have been known as a troll and being active suddenly does not change anything. Considering BSV does not hold the market cap as it used to be then, how come you feel network congestion is affecting your transaction fee or speed? Currently, Bitcoin is facing the issue because of BRC-20 tokens. Whereas BSV does not have such features or development to date as it is still a fork without anything as development after the fork.",

With BSV no one will pay anything extra to advance the transactionYou're replying in a thread where someone is requesting help. You decide to troll the affected user and provide zero feedback that can be of any use to a newbie. I'm asking you how you're contributing to the conversation, but instead, you're replying with gibberish, and now you're doing the exact same thing on a new thread, which is self-moderated, so you're able to delete any opinion different from yours.I don't care what you think; I'm not going to even try changing your opinion; it's yours, and you can do whatever you want with it. Going around the forum, quoting other users on new threads, and trolling newbies with your nonsense goes beyond boundaries and is leaning towards trolling and harassment behavior that doesn't belong in the forum.",

And from Op's two images I was trying to understand the language from the image until I read the comment make by @Bureau. And for the Op to give Bitcoin a horse and the so called of BSV with the expensive car means he is mocking the coin BSV and why I am saying this because everyone knows that Bitcoin is king of cryptocurrency and no coin can overcome it in any time soon. And if the op want to promote his coins, it is good, and nobody will stop him but not to comparing itself to Bitcoin. As it is he has already demoted itself. Op there are different ways to promote your project.",

      "body": "Keep bragging about BSV, I don't care about BSV and whatever technology it offers. The market reality is that there are a lot of new altcoin projects about network development and speed and also a lot of things that bitcoin doesn't have in scalability for example, even better than BSV, but what is the fact? Bitcoin is the king of kings and there is no match, because bitcoin is no longer a transaction tool but is a store of value and with its decentralized nature makes bitcoin very valuable even institutions hunt it for trading. Then what does BSV offer? Meanwhile if you look at the speed we can choose other alternatives for transactions if that's what you value as the future.",

BTW, you and your BSV are not on the top 100 as per Coingecko and that is why I said earlier you guys are outdated. Outdated doesn't mean in technical terms or trading terms that you were birth from Bitcoin and therefore you are young. With repeated trolling by you, it is assured you and Faketoshi would diminish from the market cap list.LOL! EVEN GRAMMARLY UNDERSTANDS FAKETOSHI",
