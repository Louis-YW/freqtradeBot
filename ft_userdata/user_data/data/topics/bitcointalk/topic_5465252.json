  "content": "What happened:  asked to verify with selfie holding ID over help chat upon withdrawal request, given immediately and told not to reply they will contact me after review. 2 months later still just being told it's being reviewed.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3492459Reference Link: Amount Scammed:  $7400 USDPayment Method:  BitcoinProof of Payment: https://ibb.co/FYTsxbsPM/Chat Logs: https://ibb.co/56pTPKfhttps://ibb.co/bmcf8fK2 months on:https://ibb.co/G2FPqbtAdditional Notes:  have had these replies weekly saying just wait we will review. No other kind of answers.(Below is original post before knowing format and editing)Sad I have to make this thread almost 2 weeks after I verified as I know other people who withdraw weekly with no issues.I had a withdrawal denied and was told to talk to the chat, who then asked for verification holding ID which was provided immediately.In response I was told it will be looked at by the team and there is no time period for this, and I do not need to ask any more questions (lol).https://yourimageshare.com/ib/TMOLrZ97r0https://yourimageshare.com/ib/wVcLkcu4jmObviously this sets off alarm bells and here I am almost 2 weeks later getting the same response of please be patient, or just telling me good luck. Ive looked on the forum and see this has been brought up before, with one user saying he got his payment 4 months later which is insane.I have a friend who has withdrawn from them 20+ times without issues, yet my account was restricted from betting and withdrawing after 3. I'm holding out that they will actually come through but everything I hear back from the chat is grim. Be patient, don't ask, there is no time frame...",

Small withdraw getting process, the big withdraw getting hold/blocked with some stupid situation like (KYC) or somethings. There also have some case while the casino buy some times by contacting provider, etc for not process the withdraw (accusing the provider)The provider came to bitcointalk, clarification the bet is legit & fight againts the accusion from casino. In the end, the provider end-contract with the casino and tell to the people that the casino is not trustyworth due of the situation.",

Their live support is very... useless.

Waiting for 3 months to have one's KYC verified? KYC verification can take 5 minutes or just a few days, not months. What are they trying to verify in order to need that much time?
