I can see a significant changes in the low value of post today, so this is a helpful tool. Why would theymos remove it? I think it will stay forever here. Finally something that will prevent posting nonsense.",

Finally something that will prevent posting nonsense.I don't see it as a helpful tool but instead a mindblowing game, I almost throw away my keyboard because I cannot get even 3 coins on this game to prevent not being a spammer. As I see, every one of us has this warning [This user is a suspected spammer!]Theymos would you please lower the requirements? Even collecting 5 coins is very tough.",

Will the game stay forever on the forum?Inside the Brief Life and Untimely Death of Flappy Bird[/rl][img width=200]https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gamelife/2014/02/title-660x440.jpg[/ig]This was a great experience. I definitely forgot how hard and great this game was. I couldn't collect more than 2 coins on my first 10-15 attempt and then I collected like 10+ coins   However the game won't probably stay as it is just an April fools joke. There were other great April fools additions to the forum in the recent years and none of them stayed. I don't expect this one to become an exception. This is a bitcoin forum in the end, not an arcade machine. If you want to play flappy bird, you can do it on everywhere.https://www.google.com/search?q=play+flappy+birdSee? There are many websites have this game. Nobody cares if google/apple banned it on their platforms.",

The author removed it from Google and Apple stores.He probably means that Google and Apple App Stores have banned copycat look-alikes of Flappy Bird. They were pretty infamous for that.PS. *phew!* 13 coins captcha solved.",
