  "content": "QuoteTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday that growing consumer spending, industrial output, credit quality and other economic indicators don’t suggest the economy is in a recession, although she acknowledged that “way too high” inflation is straining the system.“This is not an economy that is in recession,” Yellen told moderator Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Businesses and consumers are seeing the economy slow after a rapid growth spurt last year, which brought the labor market back to life after the COVID-19 pandemic, the secretary said. But this transitional slowdown is “necessary and appropriate” given the rapid changes.“You don’t see any of the signs. Now, a recession is a broad-based contraction that affects many sectors of the economy. We just don’t have that,” Yellen said, but she acknowledged the impacts of uncommonly high inflation numbers. She said she expects federal government policies aimed at controlling inflation to be successful, putting downward pressure on record gas prices, rising food costs and other economic problem areas for everyday Americans, with help from the Biden administration. “We’ve cut the deficit by a record one and a half trillion dollars this year … We’ve seen gas prices just in recent weeks come down by about 50 cents and there should be more in the pipeline. And hopefully we will pass a bill that will lower prescription drug costs and maintain current levels of health care costs.”https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/3572111-yellen-says-economy-shows-no-signs-of-recession/....No signs of recession. And they... cut the deficit, by a record half trillion dollars. How long will it take these claims to be validated or disproven I wonder. Weeks or months. The clock is ticking. While these articles are printed on the internet. It would seem that TV news follows a completely different format in terms of what they publish. Sometimes, I catch a glimpse of what is being said on televised news. And it is like a completely different world from the articles published on the internet. The content is completely different Has anyone had this experience? Would be curious to know what the public thinks about claims of there being no recession. Certainly prices are rising significantly more than they did during the 2008 economic crisis. Is there anyone who will remember this, though.",

And it is like a completely different world from the articles published on the internet. The content is completely different Has anyone had this experience? Well, news releases and written articles are a bit different. Writers these days do no write original content as much as they used to, and many of the released articles are quotes from government officials which would most likely be optimistic. News casters more often speak on pertinent issues and share their own original thoughts (could be biased of course).",

This isn't bad news, because the inflation will be put under control and the global fuel prices might decrease a little bit. Every crisis can be an opportunity and another good thing is that the global financial system might be returning back to normal, by increasing the interest rates and reducing the quantitative easing.The \"We’ve cut the deficit by a record one and a half trillion dollars this year\" statement got me laughing. The Democrats simply don't know when to stop lying. Obviously there's isn't a clear line between facts and fantasies in the US Democratic party.",

The ones handing people's money will tell as long as they can that there's no recession and there will not be recession. Why that? Because they want people stay calm, go to their jobs, use their fiat. If there would be panic, the things would get much worse than \"just\" recession.I do like to watch re-runs of the old Dante's Peak movie, I like how they show there how authorities tend to react in case of emergencies (no matter they're natural or financial).",

Imagine admitting that the country is in dire situation, that would have caused mass panic which would lead to some other problem that could rise. Aside from that, most goverment tend to think that if the majority still could afford some bread for their mouth that means things are 'okay'Quote from: The Pharmacist on July 26, 2022, 12:19:55 PM but personally it really doesn't feel like a recession to me--definitely not like 2011-13 or whenever the last really bad one was.  Remember those days?Its more like we are on the verge of recession but not really recession as of now.

      "body": "depends on what metrics are used to prove/disprove a recession is or isnt occurringif its simply to say that spending has not decreased. then yea it hasnt. more money is flowing.. but thats because things cost more. obviouslythings cost more EG buying a loaf of bread may change from $1.50 to $2 a loaf would show as a 'spending increase of 33%' at a bakers, looks good right a bakers anual report shows a 33% more cashflow or a 33% increase per transaction.. ..however peoples incomes have not also increased by 33% and so they are not going to be buying as many physical loaves of bread. or the bakers are going to make less bread or make smaller loaves to compensate the loss of produce sold on their side due to less bulk being sold. however continually raising the price might look like more spending is occuring due to each years accounting shows the average transaction value has increased by 33%thus it might look like more money is shifting around the economy. but less produce is being moved around. causing less labour and equipment to be used. thus less employment. also instead of people having disposible income to put into a savings account which is a good economy of not spending.. having a situation where people are having to not just spend the disposible income but also dip into their previous savings and become less wealthy just to stay afloat is not a healthy economy. i can easily double someones salary. and see him spend that money and say there is no recession.. but if im also his landlord and local grocery store owner where i have tripled his rent and tripled his foodbill.he is going to become homelesss soon due to not being able to afford the rent, and starve due to getting less food for his value. yet on the balance sheets the money flowing around the neighbourhood shows that more money is flowing. even if people are becoming starved/homeless, due to les product/service used for that money",

They're now doing away with the established definition that recession means having negative GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. Such definition can't support their denial anymore. In roughly just a week, there were already 41 attempts to edit the definition of recession.
