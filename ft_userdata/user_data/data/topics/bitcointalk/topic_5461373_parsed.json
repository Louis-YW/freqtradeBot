  "content": "Listen up. I messed up. Seriously. My negligence ended up costing me $165k in Ethereum, and a bit of MATIC. Here's what happened.Earlier today, I had a significant deposit of ETH enter my digital wallet. Barely 8 minutes later, it was gone. The transaction ID? 0x094f01f9174845200e6324bf18a242e0b19ce7f058a4cb928144d22df8313bcc. Destination? A new wallet, 0x4b9e0ddabad6dff604db3d827f5fa7e1c6952aa8.I know what you're thinking. \"Should've used a hard wallet.\" And you're correct. I have a Ledger, and it was sitting unused while my ETH was taken. Worth noting, I had about $7k in my wallet all day, untouched. But as soon as the large deposit came in, it was swiped. Clearly, it was a targeted operation.I'm not avoiding blame here. I failed. Despite being cautious, I wasn't vigilant enough. I'm reeling from it.So, here's my request: If anyone knows advanced methods to trace this wallet or the transaction, beyond just setting alerts, I'd be grateful for the help. I'm clinging to the slim hope that I might retrieve my lost funds.To everyone else: learn from my mistake. If you've got substantial crypto, move it to your hard wallet immediately. Don't let overconfidence or negligence jeopardize your assets. It can happen to anyone, myself being a stark case in point.TL;DR: I lost $165k in ETH from my wallet moments after it was deposited. It went to a new wallet (0x4b9e0ddabad6dff604db3d827f5fa7e1c6952aa8). I didn't use my Ledger, and that's a decision I'm paying for dearly. If you can help trace the transaction or the wallet, please share your advice. Keep your crypto assets secure, folks. It's a hard lesson I've learned firsthand.",

I would reformat my device, wipe everything, and seriously consider my online actions and personal security. You need to ask yourself what you did to get infected, how, and where. You must have downloaded something, clicked on some malware links, or given permissions to dubious software. Regarding the transaction and tracking it. You can hope the scammer makes a mistake and sends it to a CEX with a KYCed account. But even if they do, you'll have to file a police report with local authorities who will have to start an investigation. The exchange won't lock or freeze anyone's coins without proof and the involvement of a government agency.",

Don't let overconfidence or negligence jeopardize your assets. It can happen to anyone, myself being a stark case in point.I'm sorry for your lose. Losing that kind of money in a blink of an eye is not something one pray or hopes happens to them. If I may ask, have you ever done anything that you feel might be the cause of you losing your funds? Like how well do you secure your wallet and what other things do you use your system that has your wallet for? I know alot of people might not want to use their system that has that amount of money to do any other thing as it will reduce the security of their coin... So I'm asking if perhaps you normalize downloading files from unknown source and also the type of Os you're operating. I'm asking since you made of of others learning from your mistake, providing this information might help others avoid making the same mistake as you did.As concerning the tracking I'm afraid I don't have that much knowledge to track a transaction deep down the Blockchain but I do hope you get the necessary help needed to help you recover your funds or give you a tip that'll help you.",

Hackers are perfect in some ways. If an exchange is used and the person have scam tactics, it is possible that everything about the person is fake, like fake KYC. To know if the person sent it to an exchange, I think there are wallet explorer that can do that? Chain analytic organizations can also help him out, even beyond sending the money to an exchange.",

Regarding your plight, you need to talk to a cybersecurity company for this kind of thing, also you should probably file a police report about the theft so at the least you know that you've taken some measure to catch the thief. Cybersecurity companies wouldn't magically return the stolen crypto though, most like they will find out who's the person through the investigation that they're going to conduct.",

This is indeed a big lesson for all of us and its a reference for those who do not want to use hardware wallets and check their machine regularly for malware like all the others here your chances is for the hackers to move the wallet to a centralized exchange to trace the identity of the hackers.Can you give us more details so people here will learn how scammers work, OP is right that this is a targeted operation how did the malware land it seems he is tracing the wallet for a big amount to come, and when it did it triggered the malware to hack the wallet.",

Tracking your coin can be a bit possible with the idea of Pmalek, but unfortunately those Ethereum are still sitting in that new wallet, and if the hacker decides never to send out those coins hastily, I don't think there's any other possible way you can easily gain back your asset. Perhaps the hacker can also decide not to send those out at once to any exchange. Still, as others are deliberating on the matter, I am also shocked that the $7k you talked about was untouched, even after the ETH was pulled off, which makes me think you have someone around you who knew you had more than just $7k and that you will still deposit it in that wallet.",
