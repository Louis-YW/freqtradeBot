We cant say for sure if AI could be the next, well its usable but a lot attempt to replicate a related AI project just to earn in crypto but thats something isnt gonna work organically.",

What do you think?Privacy is not a hype. It was never a hype. Privacy is a big concern and the entire existence of cryptocurrency is probably based on privacy. Otherwise why do you think that human population suddenly want to have a separate and parallel current system to exist? Hype is a different thing. Hype is created by clever marketing people where as privacy is a concerned that is created by human need. In New year anything could become a hype. But I am sure the existence of that hype will be shortened. I don't think NFT will come back in a new avatar. People are really pissed about these nonsense. Personally I feel that it is high time for the cryptocurrency issues to look for utilities. I hope it become a trend in the crypto market in 2024.",

The hype of Inscription tokens are going high and I checked some coins raised 200x in one day. Security is main thing which is reason of chosing btc also but hence btc transaction also need privacy so I think security related project can be successful. This will happen only when people understand the purpose of creation of btc and Blockchain based token system.",

My friend mined Monero two years ago and transferred it from the pool to his wallet. The wallet is not active (it was created on a local PC only for withdrawing coins from the exchange, the seed phrase was stored separately). A couple of months ago, when he wanted to sell his coins, he discovered that his wallet was empty. Someone a year and a half ago simply stole all the coins in one transaction. At about 3 am, i.e. direct access to the PC is excluded and at that time he himself could not withdraw the coins and forget. And the coins cannot be tracked",

There's no way to track the transfers that you've done there and that's why the government is even afraid of it and they implement delistings from exchanges for it.",

Direct interference is almost 100% excluded: no one had access to his PC and there are no people around him who understand cryptocurrencies. The only thing I can assume is that the seed phrase was stolen during the installation of the wallet by some type of Trojan or the version of the wallet was compromised.

AI will be integrated in another areas of the market. We'll have AI been integrated in defi platforms and other areas that'll make the hype around AI to reach it's highest potential. I also think meme coin will be among the most hyped sectors in the coming bull market.Layer 2 is also another sector that I think will get a lot of hype I have seen some project already launching and they'll be among some of the highest gainers in the 2025 bull market. My strategy for the market is to invest in multiple areas of the market with new narratives due to not been sure which area is going to come out the winner. I won't invest much though but just put small amount of money into them and wait, something like $200 each.",
