  "content": "First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the participation of all institutions/organisations in helping our brothers and sisters stranded in several parts of Indonesia who are known as Rohingya.We who are engaged in the field of health in the area where Rohingya brothers are stranded feel quite helped by the goodwill of various friends from various organisations who have provided assistance to them as done by lizarder [BITCOIN ADOPTION THROUGH SOCIAL VALUE, THANKS SATOSHI (SN) and Duelbits(Hhampuz)]and his organisation friends in distributing some basic food aid to them.As volunteer health workers, we were quite tired of working in providing health services because before they were stranded, we had just served as volunteers at the Regional Sports Week event. But all of that is a form of responsibility that we must do sincerely.We were not alone. We were also with the local government in charge of the health sector.The following is the chronology of what happened that I must convey even though it is a little late considering the busy work that I have.1. They arrived by boat around 9pm on 26 December 2022 in the seaside waters of Ujong Pie Village, Muara Tiga, Aceh.2. We got the report and about 30 minutes thanks to the help of the army and police including the local village government, the Rohingya were successfully evacuated to the emergency shelter with several transport trucks and ambulances available.We transported them in 8 waves.Wave 1= 30 peopleWave 2= 30 peopleWave 3= 30 peopleWave 4= 30 peopleWave 5= 20 peopleWave 6= 25 peopleWave 7= 1 person by ambulance due to illnessWave 8= 8 people by ambulance also due to illness.3. Rohingya refugees were placed for accommodation in several school rooms after we helped them with first aid such as the installation of IV fluids, oxygen and medicines because their condition looked weak because they had been on the boat for too long. 4. The initial number of Rohingya refugees according to our treatment records was 174 people consisting of 90 men, 84 women. The total also includes children.As of yesterday, all survived in good health and the number is still intact.In other locations, we received news that their numbers have increased.For those in our location, they have been moved to another location closer to the city and it is a special and very suitable place because it was once used as an orphanage.With the assets that I have been saving, I have been giving a little help to the children from the income that I get from my activities in the crypto space although not as much as the help from other friends.Until now, we health volunteers are still on duty at the evacuation site to ensure their health is okay before there is an updated decision from the government about their fate.May God reward all of us who have helped save our fellow human beings.",
