Between mining and staking, which one would be a better option?It is better if your choice is Bitcoin.With Bitcoin, let's get started by considering two options: Investing and Mining.Mining is not as simple as you think and it requires inputs like ASICs, cheap enough electricity power source, location for your farm, human resources to config and observe ASIC operations as well as for maintenance. You should have technical knowledge to self-solve technical problems to save your time. And some other things like deep budget to survive through mining capitulation when market is very bad.Investing is most easily thing to do. Just buy bitcoin and store it in non-custodial (self-custodial) wallet. Hold and wait it till days you can take profit.",

You really can't stake Bitcoin unless you plan to use rBTC or other. If you want to mine Bitcoin you will need an Asic miner, but before looking for an Asic miner it is better to check out your cost of electricity per month, no cheap electricity? No good reason to buy an Asic miner and start mining, Asic miners takes up to 3500 watts and that's a lot. Spend more time on how much you paying for the electricity bill, if it's cheap then buy an Asic miner, if it's not, it's better to DCA into Bitcoin.Find a good mining calculator online, go to whattomine.com",

If you want to do that, you would have to give up custody of your coins to a third party and trust them to return it to you after the lock period with some interest. That is a risk I would not advice anyone to take.I can interpret your question as Bitcoin mining or investing; and it all depends on your capital. Investing does not have a barrier to entry, you can start with as low as $50 or $100 and buy at different times when you have more available cash. But with mining you need to have enough to purchase your equipment and gear and also afford electricity to keep it running constantly to be profitable.If you don't have a deep pocket or cheap electricity, investing is your best bet.",

Bitcoin is a proof of work and that is why it is needed to be mined. Those are just like deposit and interest accounts which they require bitcoin as the actual deposit.As for other cryptos, ETH was once a Pow and then shifted to Pos. If I am to choose and have money, I will choose to mine because it is a satisfying feeling that I help confirm transaction and contributes to the network.But then, it is the opposite so the best for me is just to keep on buying bitcoin and hold it.",

Between mining and staking, which one would be a better option?Neither one nor the other.Holding is the right solution. I am not imposing this on you, but only expressing my position on this. Of course, in order to hold, you need to invest in it (simply, buy it).Mining is almost impossible for ordinary people due to the need for large capacities. And when you stake, you lose control of your crypto.Of course, I am saying all this in the context of bitcoin and not other cryptocurrencies.",

When you stake your coin, it does not belong to you anymore until it is returned to you with a little interest. Staking keeps your bitcoin at the security and the watch of another.This should make us understand the essence of not your keys, Not your coins slogan that is being preached here.

I don't believe in this because it will be handed over to a third party to get the specified interest. This is also the same risky, don't control your money on another party, even though it's trusted.As many have suggested, why not buy directly in bitcoin and then hold? This is a simple way and you have control over the purchased asset.Don't make your investment complicated, holding BTC is the best way it's also quite good for the long term.",

You'll have to invest a lot of money at first, but you'll be getting very little each month, less than 1% of your investment. Are you ready to endure something like that? If we're talking mining versus staking the main difference is bitcoin can only be mined, so by choosing staking you're choosing to invest in altcoins, not bitcoin. I wouldn't recommend that to a new user. First and foremost, get bitcoin. Think about altcoins once you own the best cryptocurrency out there. Why buy something that can be deemed a security when you can own a commodity?",

As people have already told you, you need to make significant investments in hardware to even begin mining. And you need a place to put it together and cool it down. Not to mention the electricity costs and whether or not it's even worth it in your place of living, depending on how expensive electricity is in your country.Ever since Electrum switched to PoS, the altcoin mining is a big desert. There aren't that may good options. Staking altcoins means giving them to someone else, hoping they wont lose them because of their risky business ventures. Looking at what happened with several staking platforms recently, forget about it.Take that money you wanted to invest in mining or staking and buy bitcoin with it. Put it in a good hardware wallet and leave the coins there long-term.",
