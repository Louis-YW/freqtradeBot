  "content": "Have You ever been confused about how to explain Bitcoin to other people, even to partners or family, even to spouse. So, this thread is especially for you who are confused about explaining what Bitcoin is to their Relatives, spouse and family. This thread will give you a framework and a grid that explains Bitcoin easily so they understand what Bitcoin is.Well, the problem now is that many people don't understand about Bitcoin and they get the wrong understanding. Many people don't even know, don't understand, and fail to understand Bitcoin. Even many people think that Bitcoin is ponzi, criminal currency, and others. I tihnk Bitcoin is not a business, not a Ponzi because it doesn't promise any returns. While many people just play Bitcoin or trade Bitcoin and don't understand what the real essence of Bitcoin is.So, why do we need to explain Bitcoin to our spouse and family? Because financial decisions as much as possible are joint decisions if we have a partner. Especially when it comes to so many percent of our assets. Well, because we also want them to be able to survive the Financial Apocalypse caused by the collapse of Fiat currencies. So, let's start. How to explain Bitcoin to your Relatives and family, even to spouse. A tips for you who want to explain about Bitcoin to their spouse, family or parents. Stay away from technical jargon as much as possible. Stay away from discussing technical matters about Blockchain, Smart contracts, and others. So, for people who are just getting acquainted with Bitcoin for the first time, they only need to know the basics. Summary of the Steps : -The first step keyword is the “Difference between Money and Currency”.-The second step keyword is “Issue or problem of our Fiat currency”.-The third step keyword is “Change in Global reserve currency”. -The fourth step keyword is “Bitcoin versus currency”. -The fifth step keyword is “why not gold?”.So, let's help them find out why do we have to have Bitcoin. So, let's start with the first step.BTC - We begin to explain what money is. Start explaining that money is not like the paper money we hold now. The money is not the balance in our account, not dollars, not yuan, not rupiah. It is currency, not money. Currency in English . So, you can start with an open question, like if you know what money is, what's the difference between money and currency. Well, that currency is currency or also called Fiat money. So, let's ask again. Do you know what Fiat currency is backed up with? Well, if you answer gold. That is wrong. Because Fiat currency is not backed up with gold. So, let's try to check how much gold reserves and how much money is in circulation. We think that paper money is money because our government and our Central Bank say it is money.Even though this is just currency. Well, this is different from the paper money that people had before 1971. What happened in 1971? Prior to 1971, this dollar was backed up by gold. Even the American government at that time guaranteed that every dollar was backed up and could be exchanged for gold. It's even in the mold. Well, in 1971 the president of America was Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard and made the dollar a Fiat currency.Currency that is not backed up by anything, only based on trust, wind, and trust. Why did President Nixon take the dollar off the gold standard? Because the gold reserves in the US central bank are not enough if the owner of the money asks for the gold back. America is already printing too much money. Then what to do with other countries' currencies? So the problem is, other countries already save a lot of dollars instead of gold. Its original purpose was to facilitate international trade and to store the gold in the vaults of the American Central Bank. Because America has a framework monetary system , and the dollar was previously considered the Global Reserve currency. The Central Bank of America is not a state institution, but a private institution with a national brand. This is not a conspiracy theory, but these are historical facts that we can find the information on Google. So, now you know the difference between currency and money.So basically, the keyword in the first step is the “Difference between money and currency”. So we can ask an open question about that. Well, if you have the next question, here. Then what's the problem with Fiat currency? BTC - So, let's go to the second step. Namely explain the problem Fiat currency. Well, this Fiat currency has a problem. We know that this Fiat currency keeps decreasing in value, right? Try to remember. In the past, how much pocket money did you have when you were in elementary school and what could you buy? Now, the amount of money, What does it mean? Well, this means that Fiat currency continues to decline in value.If economists say, inflation. Even Warren Buffet wrote that inflation is actually a hidden tax. We don't need to do anything with our money, just save it, the value decreases. Well, this is an example of inflation, Venezuela used to be a rich country. In fact, all the needs of the people were borne by the state before. Because they are the main exporters of oil. So, back to the dollar. The dollar has already made many countries use dollars, all countries around the world will suffer if America and its currency collapse. In this second step, the keyword is “Problem with our fiat currency”. The question is, when that happens, what will you do? So if there is a question,  that's far away, it's not going to happen.BTC - Now, we can go to the third step. We explain about the changing world order. So that we have a wider time frame, we will briefly tell you about the changing world order, changes in the Global World Reserve over the last 500 years. And if there is a change in world order, it is most likely that it will occur in our generation. How come?, because there is a cycle changing World order. That is the change in the World order or in quotation marks, the rulers of the world once every 100 years.So if the World order changes, of course the reserve currency will also change. In the past, for example, when Spain was in power, we used Spanish silver money.For your information, Spain used to rule 2/3 of the world. How strong Spain was at that time. Even the Netherlands is a Spanish colony. Now, when the Dutch kingdom came to power, we used the guilder currency. When the British ruled, we used the pound sterling currency. So when America is in power now, after becoming the winner of the 2nd world war. We use dollars. But this cycle will change and it's getting close.Because there is a cycle of changes in the global reserve currency once every 100 years. Now every time the World order changes, maybe there will be Chaos. So, where does 100 years come from? The benchmark is from 1938. Since the dollar was established as an international currency through the Bretton woods agreement. Where the 44 countries gathered in Bretton Woods to choose the Dollar as international money because at that time it was still backed up by gold. So, every time the world order changes, the rulers change, maybe there will be chaos. There will be financial ruin caused by changing the Global reserve currency too. This means that the paper money that we held at that time became worthless. Well, that's why we need a financial ark.The third step keyword is the “Change in the global reserve currency”. So, if there is a response, what kind of boat is it, it's just getting ridiculous. BTC - Well, our fourth step is just explaining why Bitcoin solves the Fiat problem. Well, the ark of financial ruin is Bitcoin. Why Bitcoins? Because it is different from Fiat currency, which is Limited. Limited Bitcoin supply. Only 21 million wrote and can not be made anymore. Unlike the Fiat currency, which increases its supply every year, the new Bitcoin supply is reduced by 50% every 4 years to a maximum of 21 million coins.Well, it's different from the Fiat currency system, where the payment network system is expensive and long. Bitcoin has a payment system protocol called blockchain. Transfer fees to all parts of the world are fast, easy and cheap without a third party. Imagine if we use Swift, use Paypal, use Western Union. It's expensive and can take days if we send it between countries.Unlike Fiat currency which is only limited to certain jurisdictions and geographies, Bitcoin could be taken anywhere. Fiat money cannot be carried across countries in large amounts. Well, the good news of bitcoin is portable money. This is different from Fiat currency , which means that when there may be chaos, we can carry our Bitcoins everywhere. Unlike Fiat currency, which has a limited market in one country, Bitcoin has a global market and can be traded all over the world. Fiat currency is only limited to certain regions. For example, in Japan, we use Yen. In Singapore we use Singapore dollars.So it only applies in that territory. Now it's different from Fiat currency which is controlled by a centralized server, which is a bank. The Bitcoin protocol is secured by tens of thousands of computers spread all over the world, which we call nodes. So killing Bitcoins is nearly impossible because the data is on tens of thousands of computers around the world. Unlike Fiat currency, when a country collapses, the currency is not valid because the fiat currency is issued by a country's central bank. Bitcoin when a country collapses, an empire collapses, we can move elsewhere with all of our Bitcoins and start a new life without having to start over.Bitcoin is different from Fiat currency, which the value is very dependent on the policies of the leader, where we know that sometimes it may be unwise, even corrupt. For example, as happened in Turkiye. Its currency fell because Erdogan failed to control inflation. Or in other countries such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina, and many more. Failure to control inflation can cause the currency to become hyper-inflation and economic chaos like in Indonesia in 1998.In the fourth step, the key word is “Bitcoin versus currency”. BTC - So, if you have received a question “why don't we just buy gold?”.So, We must proceed to the fifth step. On, why Bitcoin not only solved the Fiat problem, it also solved the gold problem. So, for thousands of years , gold has been considered as money. Gold is considered as real money because gold is difficult to mine and is considered a precious metal whose value is timeless. That's why every dollar before 1971 was backed up by gold. So, we call this gold hard-money because it is difficult to produce gold. Maybe not even. And can only be mined from the bowels of the earth. So, we discussed this before , after 1971 President Nixon announced that the dollar was no longer backed by gold. Everything becomes paper whose value is only based on our trust in the American government. The dollar is a fiat currency that is bound to collapse. Now all countries are subject to the standard dollar because they have already been tricked by America and are afraid of its military hegemony. We call Fiat currency dollars as easy money. So, there was hard money, gold. There is easy money; Fiat Dollars , because they are easily printed through monetary policy and debt securities issued by the government. That's why we need Ultra Hard money, which is Bitcoin.Why not gold? Well, gold has several weaknesses even though it is also considered as hard money. So, earlier there was Easy money and Hard Money. The Weaknesses of Gold;- Gold is not portable. Gold is difficult to carry across jurisdictions because there are import duties in each country. Even gold is not easy to carry across islands, especially since the amount is large. Why Bitcoin?, because of its digital form can be stored easily and sent easily. - The second weakness of gold is that the maximum supply for gold is not known. Bitcoin maximum supply amount is absolutely certain and can not be added again. Well, maybe 5 years later a gold mine is suddenly found which automatically increases its supply and reduces the hardness money in “quotation marks”. - The third weakness, gold is just hard money but doesn't have monetary technology. The dollar alone had the monetary technology of its time. Through printing press technology or printing machines that did not exist hundreds of years ago. Well, Bitcoin has technology. That is the protocol or what we usually call the Blockchain. With Blockchain, we can send Bitcoin to each other without the need for third party assistance such as banks or fintech. - The fourth weakness of gold is that the buying and selling price of gold has a fairly large spread and it varies between gold traders. The buying and selling price of Bitcoin even if there is a minimum spread and can be executed instantly. - The fifth weakness, we can't tell the difference between real and fake gold levels. Bitcoin as long as we can send it to our own wallet, it can't be counterfeited. Well, in the fifth step, the key word is “why not gold”. Okay, so let's recap the gist, guys.-The first step keyword is the “Difference between Money and Currency”. So we tell about this.-The second step keyword is “Issue or problem of our Fiat currency”. So, we can give an open question regarding the problem of our fiat currency. -The third step keyword is “Change in Global reserve currency”. -The fourth step keyword is “Bitcoin versus currency”. -The fifth step keyword is “why not gold?”.That's all. No need for weird jargon like talking about; Ledger, hardware wallet, blockchain, and so on. The point is that those who don't understand Bitcoin get the essence first, get the why first. After the why clicks with them, it's easier to guide them to the next step, which is “Buying Bitcoin\". Note : Remember, if you want to change people's minds, don't use too much technical jargon. Don't use too much data. We want them to understand, not to make us look smart.I deliberately made a post on the bitcoin discussion to receive suggestions and input, maybe there is something I need to add regarding the topic that I created. And hopefully if there is an error please give feedback.Sources : - https://medium.com/the-ascent/warren-buffetts-recent-explanation-of-how-money-now-works-is-the-most-important-in-history-2e45461a5969- https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/currency_12770.htm- https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/gold-standard.asp",

Not to mention they can decide for themselves whether they should do it or not. If you read the gist of what OP is talking about, you can actually use that as a start of the dialogue with your family members. Also a big bonus to you is that when you do this and they are independent on the decision, and if they fail, you are not liable because you've just given them the necessary information and let them form their own decisions whether they should do it or not.",

So as much as possible we have to introduce Bitcoin in a language they already understand and give examples of things that they can understand, for example we can give an understanding that Bitcoin is the same as gold. With this they will understand more easily, even though it is different from gold, but the more they know bitcoin, the more they will understand what bitcoin is according to their knowledge.",

It is your failed attempt if you plan your introduction with 5 steps but they give up after 2 steps.I agree with you, OP is taking too long a step to introduce Bitcoin to people, instead of being a smart way, it is a complicated way. Based on my personal experience, to introduce and explain the existing system in Bitcoin to the people closest to me. I just made a simple comparison between FIAT, Gold and Bitcoin.Which is where both FIAT or Gold has an unlimited supply and this is what will cause inflation and is not an appropriate instrument for the purpose of storing value. Unlike Bitcoin which has a definite maximum supply of 21,000,000 pieces. But, even though the OP made the steps too long, we should appreciate the ideas that came out of his mind, the steps above are indeed not a smart way, they are more towards complex and when people really listen to OP explanation, then that person will understand much more than just use simple methods.",

      "body": "I haven’t had much luck advising family & friends to invest in bitcoin. They’re all too risk averse (bitcoin isn’t a risk imo but they think it is). They all believe FUD from mainstream media, these are the kind of people who follow all the rules & believe everything their government tells them.I think the best way to try to convince friends & family is simply to just give them a paper wallet with some bitcoin in it. They might then be intrigued to educate themselves, even if it’s just to convert the bitcoin to fiat. I don’t think telling them to buy initially is the best way. People are too ignorant & stuck in their own ways.",

      "body": "OP, you did the best thing to introduce your relatives to bitcoin and with the long discussion,if I was among one of them,I might not have the patient to listen to all your points because everything will be strange and boring to me. You should explain in a very simple way and also tell them more about the risk in it and how to invest in long term for them to make their decision if it is cool with them to invest on. If you keep telling people about only the advantages of bitcoin without the risks involved,it means that you are not doing it the right way and they will blame you,if bitcoin price goes below the amount that they bought. Don't think that you are trying to help them without telling them the whole truth of bitcoin movement",
