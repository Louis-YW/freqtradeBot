  "content": "QuotePresident-Elect Bola Tinubu mentioned in his manifesto that he has plans aimed at encouraging the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in Nigeria's finance and banking sector. The policy is intended to promote the prudent use of these technologies to improve identity management, revenue collection, and the use of crypto assets As part of the policy, the government will establish an advisory committee to review the existing regulatory environment governing blockchain technology and virtual asset services. The committee will be tasked with suggesting changes to create a more efficient and business-friendly regulatory framework, where necessary. The government hopes that this will help to attract more investment in the sector and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the government plans to encourage the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the use of the country's digital currency, the E-Naira. This move is part of a broader effort to promote financial inclusion and create a more accessible and efficient payment system in the country. He also believes that the policy will help to position the country as a leader in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, creating new opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs in the sector.See excerpts \"We will reform government policy to encourage the prudent use of blockchain technology in finance and banking, identity management, revenue collection, and the use of crypto assets. As part of our reforms, we will establish an advisory committee to review the existing regulatory environment governing blockchain technology and virtual asset services and, where necessary, suggest changes create a more efficient and business-friendly regulatory framework. We will also encourage the CBN to expand the use of our digital currency, the Enaira.\"What this means:The policy of encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, as outlined in the excerpt, is related to the new Nigerian regulation on digital assets, which was introduced by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2021. The new regulation provides a framework for the regulation of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies andother digital tokens, in Nigeria. The regulation requires digital assets to be registered with the SEC and mandates that all digital asset offerings and investments must comply with SEC regulations.The manifesto suggests a review of the existing SEC regulation on digital assets will be conducted with a view to making it more business-friendly.For more details read; https://nairametrics.com/2023/03/03/tinubus-plan-for-blockchain-and-enaira-is-appealing-despite-lacking-details/Una sorry for the lengthy thread but I been wan put as much details as possible so discussion go flow properly. So from my understanding this na wetin Tinubu talk for him acceptance speech as INEC been declare am President elect but I guess none of us hear am as we no watch the acceptance speech due to the fact he wasn't majority of us candidate. Make we leave the election matters aside and try discuss wetin him talk here. You feel say this na another bobo juice talk or tinubu truely mean am say him administration go look positive towards Bitcoin and cryptocurency in general?Bare in mind say tinubu been dun talk this thing before when him dey campaign, you fit read am here Tinubu to youths: We will encourage use of blockchain technology in crypto assets so from wetin you think, you feel him government go dey friendly assuming he stays as our president or you feel this na another bobo juice talk to appeal the youths and nothing come out?",

Even though, the man is willing to do it for the growth of the youths, I don't think the cambers in the Aso Rock  will allow him to make it legal because, they will feel it will affect their corruptions business in Nigeria.",

Another thing be say when government (not peculiar to Nigeria alone) they talk about blockchain technology use, na mostly about CBDC development and other centralized use of the blockchain technology wey no they too favor us as bitcoiners.",

You know this politicians can say anything to make sure they get the support of the youths to get in office. Shall him dun enter na, make we dey watch to see how the thing go play out.

If him no mean am there was no need for him taking about it during his acceptance speech since him dun already enter the office na abi you dey think say dem script am like this so news media go carry am and him go win more favor in the eyes of the tech bros in Nigeria as anything wey positive towards blockchain development entirely in the country dey positive towards technology development as well.",

How many industries does he has that employ the youth if not to use dem to agaiinst #Endsars Nigerian Youths protesters and for POLITICAL thugs. Tinubu might be gud base on scholars speculation but the guy is too old now to vocalize for Nigerians again. Well let us see what he can do for the country. Me is I still believe that the cabals wey dey with Buhari go still dey with Tinubu to do di same things. As it is now no Nigerian has faith, hope, respect for INEC. Di political apathy in Nigeria is going to be 80%.  Tinubu's plan to blockchain is very far from his tenure in government.",
