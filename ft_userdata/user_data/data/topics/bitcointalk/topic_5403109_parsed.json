  "content": "Shiba Inu Could Reach $5 By 2050, Predicts Analytics Firm Forecast and analytics platform Telegaon which uses AI-powered technical analysis, similar to Gov Capital and Wallet Investor has painted a rosy picture for long-term holders of Shiba Inu. The analytics firm has predicted that Shiba Inu could reach $5 by the year 2050. Telegaon has predicted that Shiba Inu will reach a minimum of $5.42 and a maximum price of $9.61 in 2050. The firm claims that SHIB’s average trading price in 2050 could be around $7.89.For SHIB to reach $5, the token needs to spike 26,000,000% from its current price. SHIB has spiked 42,000,000% from its inception in August 2020 up until today. According to Telegaon, SHIB could breach the $1 milestone by 2040 and touch a minimum price of $1.13. Their prediction also states that SHIB’s maximum price could reach $4.15 in 2040 and its average trading price could be around $2.76.Telegaon also projected that SHIB will cross the $0.001 mark by the end of 2030. Also, SHIB could breach the ‘1 Cent’ milestone anywhere between 2030 to 2040, predicts Telegaon.If the predictions from Telegaon turn out to be accurate in 2040 and 2050, current SHIB holders might earn generational wealth. However, 28 years is a long shot from today, and a majority of current holders might sell their holdings by then.

To go to 5$ per Shiba Inu would mean that it would have to do a x641000. This would also mean that the market cap of Shiba Inu would then have a market cap of almost 3 quadrillion USD. That is more than the total networh of the whole planet combined. So it should be pretty obvious that this prediction and therefore also that whole analytics firm is a total joke and can not be taken serious.",

Looking 5 years and 10 years from now, shiba is a meme and I wonder if it will survive this bear season? I know it's the 2nd meme after doge and it's listed on major exchanges and has a large community. But that doesn't mean it will grow and survive because without any utility it is merely a tool for the sharks to hype and take profits. When a new bull cycle comes, maybe the shark will create a new meme to get investors' attention instead of using Shiba again, the meme has increased many times.",

What is your comment after reading this article  I have severe doubts Shiba Inu is going to survive for 28 years and make it to 2050, however even if Shiba Inu made it that far those predictions do not make a lot of sense unless they took into account several periods of hyperinflation all over the world.In that case a price of that magnitude may make some sense, however under that scenario which includes such a high hyperinflation each bitcoin will be worth trillions of dollars, so I do not see the need to bother with Shiba Inu at all.",

Although at first it becomes a very valuable investment with the developed technology. Did they also predict the opposite of that?
