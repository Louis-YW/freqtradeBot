  "content": "Hello, everybody I have some questions.  I want to connect bitcoind to a local network that hard-forked Bitcoin.All peer's Bitcoin-related ports are blocked from external access. (e.g. 8333, 8332)Is there a good way to run the node in this state?ps) The ElectrumX server is configured and it is accessible and nomp (node-open-mining-portal) is also accessibleThanks to all",

Since you mentioned \"hard forked of Bitcoin\" are you planning to fork Bitcoin and create an altcoin or do you just want your node accessible to the local network?If you want to access your node locally and bitcoind to accept JSON-RPC commands locally then you will need to configure your Bitcoin.conf file.Sample bitcoin configCode:server=1daemon=1txindex=1disablewallet=1rpcuser=***rpcpassword=***rpcbind=0.0.0.0rpcport=8332rpcallowip=192.168.230.0/255.255.255.0Read more from this link below to configure the network.- https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/blob/master/share/examples/bitcoin.confIf this is for educational purposes better enable testnet.",

This may include VPN access, SSH keys, or other authentication methods depending on the network setup.Without that infos you shouldn't get your hopes up too high as things like the standard ports (8333) are blocked for a reason.",

Or,  if you can become a node operator within the private blockchain network, you may have the ability to participate in the consensus process and mine blocks.",
