A newbie is wondering some stuff   I am follow an account on Instagram that shows how much bitcoin and some other cryptocurrency´s are worth every 24 hours. and something I have noticed is almost every time bitcoin goes up many other also go up.And when bitcoin goes down many other also go down, of course this don´t apply everyday and all currency´s. I upload a picture of two days how it shows ( https://imgur.com/YYJRX7F this is two different days and it looks like this)My real question maybe is. If cryptocurrency´s follow each other. whats the difference if you invest in BTC or ETH or USDT for example. If you invest in all three $1000 each. How will it look at each invest after example 12 months? I understand its impossible to predict something like this, but some guideline.If they follow each other very often with +/- then the profit/loss should not be a huge difference?Are cryptocurrency holding each other hand in hand in someway or are they independent. It seems that they share something with each other that I don´t know anything about.I am far away from an expert on this but I am sure many on this forum is and gladly hear what you guys & girls thinks about it.Wish you the the best.Best regards CC!",

But some are not really that parasitic as they somewhat benefit Bitcoin, but Bitcoin can exist without them.They are like blood sucking little creatures. You eat, they eat too. You starve they starve. The solution is to carefully and gently detached the parasites from the host then they starve and die",

If you take a look at how the market behaved in the past, I believe you can learn a thing or two about the altcoin movement when Bitcoin is pumping and then went sideways. As others have mentioned, if you choose a more volatile alts with low supply, for example, you'll get a higher return compared to if you buy BTC. For example, some meme coins only have 1000 supply and it is priced at $1 each, so going from $1 to $10 is giving you a better return compared to BTC going from $40k to $60k if you buy it at $30k. But the risk is probably not worth it most of the time. I'd rather keep buying BTC and just use a disposable income if I want to speculate on some alts. CMIIW.",

So it's not a matter of debate whether the altcoins follow bitcoin or not. Personally I would say the entire altcoin market is heavily dependent of bitcoin. And very closely mimics its trajectory. But there are some obvious exceptions.  Earlier the impact was 100% but now it has reduced to some extent after the introduction of the stablecoins.",

I understand its impossible to predict something like this, but some guideline.If they follow each other very often with +/- then the profit/loss should not be a huge difference?There is a difference if you’re looking into long term holding or investment. With bitcoin there is a guarantee that you wouldn’t be scared of holding on to coin that could dump from anytime. So the risky of holding to bitcoin is much less than those Alticoins. Alticoins do not have a long term value, we could argue that for ETH and the stablecoins but they also have same issues. Stable coins like USDT could come behind bitcoin for stability but they can also be deppeged just like what was experienced by the USDC coin this year. The profit level due differs sometimes because some of these Alticoins tend pump to a high level if the team’s handling the project decide to create a FOMO scenario but they don’t last long because some are most tricks to lure people into investing in them and then the whales dump it by taking off there funds. Social media hype or a certain transition just like the ETH moving to POS could create a panic in the market and therefore causes its price to rise beyond bitcoin percentage rise but they all comes back to followin bitcoin. So there’s a difference, in fact I personally don’t see investing in other Alticoins as a diversification of portfolio since the risk of losing is higher in them than bitcoin. So rather stick to a coin that guarantees you a value anytime",

I know you must be wondering why bitcoin stands to be head over other Crypto currencies in the world and why is the other Crypto market dependent on bitcoin.At first, you should know that bitcoin is the first Crypto currency to be developed and it has no central authority over it. Hence it is a decentralized blockchain. Bitcoin so far since inception have been termed and tagged a digital gold which no other coin has succeed to have achieved.The maximum supply of bitcoin gives it a good spot to be in the limelight and for everyone to see.Lastly,  the demand for bitcoin surpasses every other  coin so far and running into millions on daily basis much better that other Crypto. You could imagine if these people tell their experience on good fate about bitcoin tell me why wouldn't there be a surge in price and holders vice versa as the case maybe. All these contributes to the ups and downs of the bitcoin market which also affects other Crypto market as well.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency, and its price movements often have a significant impact on the prices of other cryptocurrencies. This is because many investors and traders use Bitcoin as a benchmark for the overall health of the cryptocurrency market, and also because Bitcoin is often the first point of entry for individuals who are new to cryptocurrencies.When Bitcoin experiences a significant price increase or decrease, it can cause other cryptocurrencies to follow suit, either because investors are looking to diversify their portfolios or because they believe that the price movements of other cryptocurrencies will mirror those of Bitcoin.However, it is important to note that not all cryptocurrencies are affected equally by Bitcoin's price movements. Some cryptocurrencies have unique features and use cases that make them less reliant on Bitcoin's performance, while others may be more closely tied to Bitcoin due to similarities in their underlying technology or market positioning.Ultimately, while Bitcoin does have a significant impact on the broader cryptocurrency market, it is only one of many factors that can affect the prices of cryptocurrencies. Other factors, such as regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment, can also play a role in determining the performance of individual cryptocurrencies.",

USDT is a stable coin and the price is supposedly pegged to the US dollar so even if there is an increase or decrease in bitcoin price, it doesn’t affect the value of USDT. As for your other question, if at the end of the 12 month duration, the price of bitcoin is high then the price of eth as well as other altcoins will also rise, even more exponentially than bitcoin, and vice versa.",

You cannot hold bitcoin and want to diversify in altcoins. It is the same risk and even worse risk.If you invest in bitcoin or altcoin then diversify to gold, Real Estate etc.Again, Op I do not think you want to invest in a stable altcoin (USDT).
