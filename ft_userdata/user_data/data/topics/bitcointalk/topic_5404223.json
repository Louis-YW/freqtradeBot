  "content": "Why did cryptocurrencies become so valuable for the iGaming market?Cryptocurrencies are increasing their influence in the financial world, and blockchain technology has been adopted in many sectors beyond finance.iGaming is taking the world by storm and continues to expand as new operators enter new markets, and new technology is constantly in development. As expected, cryptocurrencies have found their way to the online gambling world. At first, a limited number of online casinos and sports betting operators offered the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, as a payment method alongside more traditional payment options. Now, more and more operators offer a variety of cryptocurrencies to make deposits and withdrawals. This opens up plenty of opportunities, and you can fulfill many of these with Crypto Snack.Cryptocurrencies are moving from niche to mainstream and have become a payment option for many online businesses and platforms. As mentioned, several online casinos and betting sites have adopted crypto money as a payment method. What exactly makes depositing and withdrawing with cryptocurrencies attractive to players?Increased level of excitement:Playing with cryptocurrencies can bring additional excitement to your game. Not only because it's something different but also because it can add a degree of volatility. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and can quickly increase or decrease in value compared to traditional currencies. When crypto is up, and you decide to cash out, you make more than if you had played with traditional currencies. Although you're playing for fun, the chance for more significant rewards is where the excitement lies.Bigger rewards:As a player, you can benefit from exclusive deals and rewards when depositing crypto money. And talking of rewards, Crypto SNACK tokens can take your betting to the next level.As a player, wich other benefits would you add to the list?Learn more about the Snack Token on https://www.cryptosnacks.org",

      "body": "The popularity of the cryptocurrencies within this market certainly comes from the fact that they can be easier to handle than FIAT money, this is a consequence of the self-custody that is possible with Bitcoin and altcoins. This way, one does not need to have a bank as trusted party to deposit or withdraw the money. Anyone can transfer their earnings to a wallet and exchange it for FIAT later, with less concerns to get the bank account frozen or the tagged for what a bank could believe to be \"suspicious activities\".In the end, it is about removing third parties which may not be 100% okey with such services.",

I have seen USDT and some other stable coins option on the crypto iGaming platforms that I have visited before. The best time to use unstable coins like bitcoin is a time like this if you are not withdrawing as fast as possible and if you did not lose the coin to gambling, because your bitcoin can increase in price if compared to fiat.",

The only reason that excites me to gamble using crypto is the privacy it can gives me and I can play whenever I want compared to fiat that needs bank account which usually undergo further audit on all of my transaction. Excitement towards privacy using crypto in gambling contradicts the idea of KYC in the platform unless you are using unregulated and non-KYC required gambling website.Quote from: Eternad on June 27, 2022, 12:34:25 PMNo one wants to gamble using a volatile asset because that gives more risk of losing. Again this contradicts of what you earlier said. If this one of everyone's reason then why everyone is using a non-stable crypto which is bitcoin which is obviously volatile.Actually every services offered or paid using crypto always has excitement and risks towards volatility. Imagine you only send $100 worth of bitcoin you played and lost quarter of it, then you take a rest for a while then bitcoin value increase, now it feels like you didnt played and lost since the value increased  almost the same as the one you previously deposited.What people likes crypto as funds used to deposit it it doesnt have limitations over any country,can send anytime, lesser fees (sometimes), and privacy (sometimes too).",

Like it was already mentioned, OP is wrong about excitement being the driving factor here. He's right about the popularity of cryptocurrencies in the gambling market. This is becoming a huge industry, but manly due to anonymity, the ability to circumvent local laws. Also, people can earn crypto outside of their job and it never goes through their bank account which for many people is a big deal. The spouse doesn't know that you're gambling, the tax office or your employer don't know either. If you win money it's yours to keep.",

Playing on casino with Doge while its value was less than a cent was already exciting but the time when Elon pumped, the more exciting it was to play and investors realized also its getting good to hold the coin. Therefore there's reality to the level of excitement, we play with it while its value increase.",

You are the agent or a promoter of the site, so you supposed know what to do to review a site. And why cryptocurrencies are valuable is just like a rhetorical question which I have already placed it at the way. Although you tried by explaining the bolded question on the OP. But not really answered. Because the answer to that question is unlimited and infinite. Simply put. Cryptocurrencies are valuable by almost all the online casinos are because cryptocurrencies are digital currencies which is very easy and stressed full to use with transactions. And before any online casino is lunched it should understand the kyc system for easy access, communication and all of them all the traffic free transactions in your company, that can promote and give good reputation to your company.",

Maybe futures trading is what you are describing for such statement.It is your view and belief but the excitement we are talking here is that the crypto you are using in gambling is surprisingly increase its value in the market so  like me? I remember Using dogecoin back in 2018  till 2020 and when i stopped playing in that certain site i almost forgot my funds that is in Doge but last year? when Dogecoin reached the top? then i look deep for my funds and luckily ? the value really increased by multiple value so that i know that volatility really helps us gambling in crypto.",

These gambling sites can then ask kyc's where a user must submit some documents to get approved.I don't think cryptos are so valuable for them since there are still other payment methods which are more prioritized but the reason why they adopted it is due to the trend. Dunno whats that snack token your talking about but is it similar to sites that have their own token like what we see on betfury and owlgames? It isn't bad to have one though and they can still accept other cryptos along with that.",
