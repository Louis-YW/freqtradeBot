  "content": "I was going through some furniture stuff online when I came across another hardest and most expensive wood in the world. The \"African blackwood\" costs around Â£8,000 per kilogram, or Â£7,000 per log, or more than seven lakh rupees. Blackwood can be found in Nigeria and other African countries. African blackwood is commonly known to be one of the most valuable materials used in the production of musical instruments.This wood takes about 50 years to be ready, but it is very expensive if it is finally ready after those years.Â If the arboriculturist of Nigeria can discover this tree and cultivate it, it could be another good source of income for the nation. Someone who can discover this tree and plant it could also be making a future investment for his or her children.
