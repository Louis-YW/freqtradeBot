  "content": "True Ownership for Players Gaming3 EcosystemDeveloping a gaming ecosystem through innovative Web3 experiences, quality gameplay, high-end design, purposeful storytelling and financial incentives. All backed by a strong and sustainable play and own model. Incubated by Ubisoft and developed on Unreal Engine 5.Manor and NFTs have been part of our lives for a long time, and they could become huge if treated and developed in the right way. While we were trying to explain how this exciting world works to our friends and family, we realized that it was simply too hard to understand for many people.When looking for ways to break down the barriers and make things simpler for the masses, we found that gamification is the best way to explain complex topics that are hard to understand to everyone.This is especially true when talking to those who might not have the technical knowledge to understand how things really work. This was one of the main drivers for creating Manor Land. As a result, we have turned investment-based activities into a gamified online application, offering individuals the opportunity to not only take part in the industry but also have fun.Our biggest objective was to create a fully decentralized game capable of running on its own.Manor apps have become increasingly popular over the past year and a half, particularly in the past six months. There have been hundreds, if not more, Manor enterprises gaining traction. The past few months have shown a trend away from the novelty projects that were not able to bring any real value because they were unsustainable in the long run. Because of this, we think that a decentralized gaming economy is an ideal way to bring together the blockchain/crypto/DAO industry and gamers who want free access to the industry without corporate intervention.We believe that if we want to see higher retail adoption, it is pivotal to start with an easy-to-use approach. Rather than creating complex functionality or AAA games, we think that the answer lies in simplicity.That is what makes Manor Land truly unique. Instead of creating a sophisticated game for power users, we have decided to build a game that is easy to play, relaxing, and educational. Manor Land is intended to help users understand the basics of Manor, NFTs, play-to-earn, and the crypto industry in general.Our long-term goal is to transform Manor Land into a hub of gamified applications, covering all the niches in the crypto and blockchain industry.All the links you will find > https://linktr.ee/manorland",
