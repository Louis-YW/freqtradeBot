If not, then I suggest you take a look and read it from there.Basing on your conversation, the live support is polite enough to turn down your request and it is backed up with enough reason such as the company policy. It really is included in most casino websites that whenever they deem necessary to ask for KYC, they have the right to do so because they stated it in the terms to be agreed upon and you happen to agree with it. Unless you didn't really take your time to read, then it's your fault. I don't see any unprofessionalism in the chat screenshot provided. It just seems that you don't totally understand the policy they laid before you to react such. You also accused them of \"scamming\" with no enough proof, just basing on your mere observations that could be wrong because of misinterpretation.",
