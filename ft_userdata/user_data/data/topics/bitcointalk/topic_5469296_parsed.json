  "content": "I own Venture Capital Report (VCR) 2001 issue very rare magazine. CGC Comics stated verbally only it's value is £35,000.00. Student.co.uk investment pitch is inside. The Website for Students were asking investors to send their application form via Royal Mail to buy Stocks and Shares in their company. Very cutting edge back in 2001. Also 50 pages with other company pitches, such as Internet based   shopping delivery company and a Restaurant Chain establishing itself on the capital and nation wide, were asking investors to invest via mail order back in 2001. It's a relic magazine, very valuable and has interest from PWCC Auction House to sell it, along with my other items. I live in the UK, also would prefer to sell remotely from home as opposed to sending off item consigning. DM Me to discuss. Pictures? https://ibb.co/HNpKpcBhttps://ibb.co/DbtB6R5https://ibb.co/ysksVdmPlease ask for more photos to be posted online. Thanks.(Some photos were taken on my low resolution mobile home and others on my laptop.)The original newspaper cutting from the Financial Times Newspaper shows THE VCR advertisement from 2001. I will find it again and attempt to include the newspaper cutting with VCR magazine.https://ibb.co/Lr8mQRLhttps://ibb.co/zZn53L5https://ibb.co/Hgny8Vyhttps://ibb.co/vQF2Y5hhttps://ibb.co/LPyP5Lzhttps://ibb.co/fMw6kPShttps://ibb.co/kQqHL6whttps://ibb.co/d4T79Cshttps://ibb.co/HFnFLjrhttps://ibb.co/q5VgSTwhttps://ibb.co/YB4HyZTMagazine Valuation Emails:https://ibb.co/4KddPQHhttps://ibb.co/ySLBcbjhttps://ibb.co/D797T3QNew Magazine Valuation/Discussion Emails:https://imageupload.io/Pi0otvBCUjmZLX9https://imageupload.io/xtZAEjgdzhHWyhShttps://imageupload.io/PJZr4CCvkbJ524D",
