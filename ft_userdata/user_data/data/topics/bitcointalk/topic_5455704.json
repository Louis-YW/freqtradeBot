This means that  two of your keys will be required  to sign transaction. (Any of them alone will not capable to do that) One  of that key may belong to open sorce software wallet (say Sparrow or Electrum or any  of your choice)  the other one to Ledger nano s.The probability to break multisig wallet is equal to   P=  ∏i=1...n(pi)  where pi is the such probability for each individual item from the quorum  set of n items, so if one of pi=0 then P=0. That said, the large the quorum the better but I think 2 of 2 will be enough in your case.  Further, move you stash from Ledger Nano S to created multisig wallet.And then, after the purchasing of open source air-gapped HW  create multisig wallet using your new HW  (instead of  Ledger Nano S )and move your stash from old multisig to new one.",

So, since average Joe is such a stupid, he came up with an idea to offer them Recover service. I don't wanna sound offensive but absolutely every person who uses or will use Ledger Recover service, is and will be a very dumb person who somehow got some money.To be honest, I'm really interested in how this Ledger Recover service goes, if Ledger sees good success by running this service, then my perception about humanity will change and if Ledger goes bankrupt, I'll remain positive and hopeful. If Ledger doesn't go bankrupt but will still remain top in this business, then I'll be more sure that average Joe is stupid and they'll believe what you want them to believe.",

I personally don't feel unsafe and still use my Nano S together with a Trezor but for different purposes. I understand why the announcement of Ledger's seed sharing scheme left such a sour taste in everyone's mouth. At least they were \"kind enough\" to tell us what they are planning. The reactions would have been five times worse if they just implemented this in the background without telling anyone. If there is a way to send keys from a secure element chip over the internet (when we were told it can't be done), how can we possibly trust everything else we supposedly know? And even if there is trust, how can we know that the implementation is bulletproof and won't result in a serious breech in the future? Even if it's the safest thing on the world, why would I want to have that on my hardware wallet? It's an endless loop of questions people have started asking because they can't believe what is happening.",
