  "content": "I know this is a service but due to its nature I am bound to get more responses here.I need to buy two different bundles of ebooks, one with a cost of 31.99 dollars and the other one with a cost of 20.64 dollars, for a grand total of 52.63 dollars.For the service I offer 15 additional dollars over the costs of the ebooks, this should be a simple trade, you receive the BTC on your wallet and I receive a total of 14 ebooks and 3 images on my email.All the ebooks are about the same topic, music.Currently the ebooks are on sale for 5 more days, so I would like to close the deal during that time.Rules:Quote from: South ParkNo newbies or new accounts.No users without experience on trades regarding PP.Red trusted users or with flags regarding scamming please do not apply.I would prefer to deal with a trusted member to avoid complications.My decision is final, if I select another member over you there is no point on having hard feelings, there are many opportunities on this forum, no point getting mad over it. Â Update: Closing the thread due to the lack of interest and the sale ending soon.",
