      "body": "I did not scam him, originally I was talking with this user to buy some nexon accounts, some of the ones mentioned in the chat from my previous scam report however after being scammed of that $32 btc I decided to google the usernames of everyone I was in a chat with and found a scam report made against someone using his telegram username:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406290.0I told him about that and that I don't feel comfortable so I asked if we could use an escrow, which he agreed to. I msgd a few users but some responded that they don't escrow digital goods / accounts, I then asked him if he knew about localcryptos so maybe we could work something out using their escrow system but he said he was not familiar with it so I did no pursue that any further.As I told him in our chat, someone else had also responded to my request for nexon accounts and I did not find any scam requests against them so I bought some accounts from them instead.This morning after explaining that, he started calling me a scammer. Despite that I have told him and I will stick to my word, if someone trustworthy is willing to act as a middleman I will purchase any accounts he has at the agreed price and cover the middleman fees.Edit:His username: https://imgur.com/PkdnVPiChat History: imgur.com/a/IwekhLGResponse to my escrow request from minerjones: https://imgur.com/KcjPSjoProof I bought the nexon accounts from someone else: https://mempool.space/tx/5ecda5246261abbbdaaf6ebd9ce642c9b718071acea8739c477cde2e834815e7                                                    https://imgur.com/2rpsOYQ Quote from: hopenotlate on December 13, 2022, 11:53:10 AMQuote from: Alvalo on December 13, 2022, 11:47:23 AMhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2826071Please avoid this person he is scammer for sure changing terms of deal after accounts already made.

      "body": "This is not a classical scam in the sense that payment was made but the accounts weren't delivered. However, the chat logs show that Mario tells Alvarez that he has got the money, and Alvarez can start creating the accounts. I have no idea what kind of accounts they are talking about or how much the \"creation\" process costs. So there is an interest to buy and Mario told Alvarez to do the necessary work. Once that work was done, they couldn't agree on who should go first. This is something that should have been discussed at the beginning before the other person was instructed to create the accounts. You are both at fault for not doing that. The way I see it, there is still interest from the buyer to purchase the accounts as long as they can find a middleman. Besides minerjones, who else did you contact to act as a middleman? I can understand that it's hard to find someone willing to accept a file with the login details or whatever the seller is willing to send. I wouldn't want to either. Nor would I want to verify if those accounts are legit or not. But you have to try. Open a thread in the services section and ask if someone trusted-enough would want to act as a middleman (official escrow or not).- Mario is at fault for telling Alvarez to create the accounts.- No scam happened because the parties didn't agree to how the deal would go down. If it was agreed that Mario needed to pay first, but then he changed his mind, I would consider Mario to be at fault here. Right now, you are both at fault for not agreeing the terms properly.- I understand that Mario is reluctant to send the money because there is no proof the ordered accounts were created. One way to solve the issue is to do the deal in batches of 5 accounts maybe. Have the buyer pay for 5 accounts and the seller to send 5 accounts, or have the seller send 5 first and then get paid for those 5. And then you do the same with the next batch of 5.Even if you find a middleman, do you want that person to verify the authenticity of the accounts?",

      "body": "I wouldn't open the images and talking to much here because it's really wasting my time. What can we expect from newbie users who trade with a newbie that doesn't have any reputation? both of them can create new account and just start scam with the another way. Digital account trade is quite tricky and hard to prove which one is the scammer too, this is why most of users doesn't want to become escrow in this kind transaction.",

It is the op that created an accusation against me without providing any evidence and the user that responded replied as if it were true without asking him to provide any despite doing so on other threads where users don't provide proof.pmalek's solution is so simple that I can't believe neither I nor the seller thought of it but we've agreed to do the trade in batches of 5 with me going first.",

      "body": "So we attempted the first trade this morning. I don't have screenshots this time as he deleted the chat before I could export it but in the end he delivered a file with 5 accounts, the 1st one on the list worked and the others were bad. When I told him so, chat was deleted and his username is gone from my chat list.  After checking yahoo I can see that the emails are real and the passwords provided work but the nexon accounts for 4 of them haven't been created which is what I'm paying for.After doing all the work to continually hound me to go through with the purchase and making a post here I honestly wasn't expecting that he'd still attempt a scam , especially for only $3.5, but I haven't lost too much since it was only $3.50 plus I can use the yahoos he did send to create some accounts myself.Transaction hash:https://mempool.space/tx/0fe287055ab6efeafb4bd1ac0d38e20a0ca0544d6079d4a8bb319b4a953ad275",
