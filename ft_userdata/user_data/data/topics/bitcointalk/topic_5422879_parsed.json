We kind of got used to some more added time previously due to VAR but there has been even longer added time during this world cup. It is supposed to be to avoid teams time wasting like if they are winning 1-0 late in the game, delaying restarts by taking long. It punishes that but itâ€™s kind of weird seeing 100 minutes or more for a game that is supposed to be 90. One thing is for sure, we will see lots of late drama in the tournament, teams have to fully concentrate for longer.",
