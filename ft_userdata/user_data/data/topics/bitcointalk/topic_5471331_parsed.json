  "content": "In order to advance science, scientists must think critically about everything that is being claimed, and scientists must evaluate all the evidence to determine which claims are supported and which claims are not supported. Many people have ideas including some very good ideas, but most ideas do not work, so one will need to test those ideas to determine which ideas are supported by evidence and which ones fail for one reason or another. The cryptocurrency community could benefit a lot from a scientific mindset.No. A scientific mindset will not necessarily make you rich nor will a scientific mindset necessarily prevent you from losing money (Did you believe that a scientific mindset was magic? Oh wait. You don't care much about science, so you won't do that). But a scientific mindset will make you less susceptible to scams. Let us go over the steps of the scientific method and apply these steps to cryptocurrency technologies.1. The first step in the scientific method is to make an observation. In the cryptocurrency sector, you may observe that many people are making a lot of money through cryptocurrency and that a lot of people are claiming that blockchain technologies will revolutionize stuff. Oh wait. That was about 2019 or whatever year. Now we are all talking about AI and about how AI will revolutionize stuff (or just @#$% everything up). You may also observe that Bitcoin uses a lot of energy.To make a good observation, you should probably do some background reading (including reading the Bitcoin whitepaper and other papers).2. After making an observation, one should ask a question. You may ask yourself why Bitcoin needs to use all of that energy and whether there is anything that should be done about this.3. After you ask a question, you should for a hypothesis that you believe is testable. For example, you may hypothesize that there is no way for Bitcoin mining to be used to solve a scientific problem while establishing decentralized consensus.4. After you form a hypothesis, you need to figure out how to test your hypothesis to see whether it is legitimate or not. If you find that you are unable to test your hypothesis, then you cannot claim that your hypothesis is correct. If you are too lazy, busy, or dumb to test your hypothesis, then maybe you should either form an easier hypothesis or accept that you are more likely to fall into a scam. If you hypothesize that there is no way for Bitcoin mining to be used to solve a scientific problem while establishing decentralized consensus, then to test this hypothesis, you will need to form a mathematical proof that this is impossible. Or at the very least, you will need to get a whole bunch of people to spend millions of dollars to find such a scientific problem (or maybe such a scientific problem already exists but the cryptocurrency community is too demented to realize this). If those resources come up empty, then those resources were probably just squandered. But if you have evidence that those resources were not squandered, then you can say that smart people have tried to solve a scientific problem while establishing decentralized consensus, but they could not do so. This does not mean that cryptocurrency mining cannot be used to establish decentralized consensus while solving a scientific problem, but it should at least tell you that you may want to give up trying to use cryptocurrency mining to solve an important scientific problem. In science, there are unsolved problems, and you may just need to accept this and quit trying if the cost is too much. But the cryptocurrency sector due to their low level of intelligence has not really tried to use cryptocurrency mining to solve an important scientific problem.The entire cryptocurrency community has an anti-scientific mindset. For example, the entire Bitcoin community automatically rejects the idea that cryptocurrencies should have mining algorithms that are designed to advance science without any reason whatsoever. But they are unaware that since Bitcoin has an anti-scientific mining algorithm, Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) have attracted an anti-scientific community that is highly susceptible to scams and bubbles. The entire cryptocurrency community would be much less hateworthy if it was not so attracted to scammery and was smart enough to like science.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

      "body": "arwin100-A lot of scams are obvious to reasonably intelligent people. But some things are not obviously scams, and some things require a scientific mindset to see if they are worth investing in. Scammers try their best to make it non-obvious that what they have to offer is a scam (ahem 90% of all college degrees). If scammery were so obvious, then FTX would not have existed at all and all of you chlurmcklets would not have worshipped at the feet of Sam Bankman Fried. But you did. And if something is not even worth your time to research, then it is not worth investing in. I do not know why anyone would want to invest in any cryptocurrency whatsoever without understanding even the basics of Bitcoin to the point where they realize that Bitcoin's mining algorithm was not designed to advance science but it is a quite difficult task to come up with a scientific mining algorithm that establishes decentralized consensus.If people keep on denying the need to have a scientific mindset, they will continue to fall into scams and invest in garbage.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

But it is not good enough.\"There is no contradictory link between Bitcoin and artificial intelligence, the two can be a revolutionary technology.\"-Right now, AI is kind of a fad just like blockchain was. But right now, AI has some legitimacy to it even though it has been hyped to death, but I cannot say the same thing about public blockchains.\"There are no direct links between Bitcoin and fraud. It is true that there is some connection between cryptocurrencies and fraud, but with a little observation, you will find a big difference between Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\"-I agree that Bitcoin is different than most of the other cryptocurrrencies and that Bitcoin is a legitimate cryptocurrency that was constructed through a lot of good research while many other cryptocurrencies are mostly copies of Bitcoin with little innovation. The chlurmcks who value other cryptocurrencies need a scientific mindset too, so there is no contradiction there. But cryptocurrency technologies need to be associated with scientific advancement instead of science denial and scams. If Bitcoin was devoid of scammery, we would not have boards on this site about reputation now would we? And are you suggesting that the Bitcoin community should be less scientifically minded? Because why would you do that? That does not help anyone. The Bitcoin community is already full of science deniers as it is, so they need more respect for science so that they don't fall into scam after scam and have weird cult-like ideas. There are plenty of Bitcoiners who have quite irrational ideas, and they need a more scientific mindset so that they can replace those ideas with more realistic ideas.",

Most Bitcoiners and crypto chlurmcks make terrible decisions because they refuse to investigate anything at all but instead judge something without even giving 3 seconds of their time to think about it.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.I understand what you are saying. The point here is about avoiding a fraud scheme. A rational mindset and research must be carried out in detail and continuously. Like the case of FTX, if it wasn't for thoroughness, FTX might still be standing today, but there was someone who was thorough and revealed the scheme that FTX had problems and ended up being a scam.We often find fraudulent schemes in crypto and outside of crypto, and no matter how rational someone is, they will always be deceived because they are lured by the amount of money generated or promised in the scheme. The point is that this can be avoided with a rational mindset and not being easily attracted to placing money in things that have the potential to be a scam, the control is within oneself and perhaps even the advice of an expert will not work on people who are lured in by scams.",

Having a scientific mind doesn't automatically mean you're scam-proof. Scammers are sneaky and can manipulate anyone's emotions and trust. It's not just about IQ or being super smart. Common sense is something natural that we just have to work on. Knowing what feels off and trusting your gut instincts can save you from falling into scams, no matter how scientifically inclined you are. And yes, scams don't discriminate based on someone's mindset. Even if a scammer has a scientific mindset, it can lead to total chaos. But in the end, it all boils down to common sense. Staying aware, being cautious, and recognizing the warning signs are universal defenses against scams. So, whether you're a science pro or not, being street smart can keep you safe. A scientific mindset would help but we shouldnt stop there. Wehve to keep our eyes open, be skeptical when something seems fishy and trust our instincts.",

Even those who understand security will be too paranoid about all kinds of security that they think is lacking. Being smart is relative and does not guarantee one is free from fraud.Those who don't have the title of smart even tend to be safer, because they ignore what they don't need and don't over-act on something they think is out of line.
