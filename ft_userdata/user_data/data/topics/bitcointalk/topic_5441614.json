I think buying your own solar panels and have them top up a battery during the day and them charge your devices over night should help with your problems. Browsing and posting on the forum does not use much battery and you should be able to get multiple days out of 1 charge if you do not use it for any thing else.",

It does no necessarily mean that you must be online everyday to follow up or to learn about bitcoin. You can still learn offline if you do not mind.

Any investment, not only limited to Bitcoin, has carry some risk even it's very low. Bitcoin is considered as a high risk investment because no one can control it, available to trade for 24/7, etc the good thing is, there's no manipulation. So if you think Bitcoin has no risk and you will always make profit everyday, you're wrong, it's what's ponzi scheme offer where they promise fake 1% return per day.You only need to learn about the difference between Bitcoin and fiat with bank, non custodial wallet and how to use an exchange to start your journey.",

If the reason why you can't do that is a lack of money, then there is no other option other than to look for jobs and save some money so that you can have access to electricity on your own. It is surprising that there is still a place not covered by electricity, considering that you have access to a phone.As for your investment question, a lack of internet access is not really what you should focus on right now. Try to search and research if trading Bitcoin is allowed in your area, if there is any P2P market, and so on. This will help you can decide how you will buy your first coins. Don't try to hurry and buy from some random guy on the internet just because they offer cheap prices, there are tons of scammers online. No need to rush, especially if you don't have the means to do so.",

If we rarely use it and only use it to charge the phone and use it for emergencies, it can be used for 5 days before bringing it to the market to charge. If solar panels are expensive, OP can also think of a electric battery solution.",

It doesn't need to be this way, you have a life and need to live a little in real life away from your screen! In the case of your power management you could consider getting a powerbank as a temporary solution or go the solar way if resources allow.

It's no requirement that you need to be always online unless you are comfortable with it and like I said a few lines above, invest in some backup power.. A powerbank for a start say 10000mah power bank.

Keep some money in order for you to buy some solar panels. You said that you don't have electricity right? At least save some money for that so that you will not get tired of going there just to charge your phone. I guess that's the first step for you to be more online in the forum. I will not suggesting this one, but I'm thinking that you might want to find a new home where there's electricity or at least you will have more access to your daily necessities such as water, food, electricity etc.Quote from: rachael9385 on February 28, 2023, 09:31:09 PMI managed to post this thread because I traveled, we normally use canoe ðŸ›¶ to go to the market or travelingEver since I join this forum I have learned a lot about bitcoin and how people become rich through bitcoin investment, I am very much interested in bitcoin investment and I am willing to invest no the risk. You're only looking at the positive side of investing.Take note that in investing, there are investors who are becoming rich, but at the same time, there are people who are becoming poor because of investing in Cryptocurrency. You said that you learned a lot about Bitcoin already. Why don't you just buy Bitcoin, store it on a hardware wallet and just keep it. You said that you are only using phone to access the forum right so I assume that you don't have any computer at all. I don't know if there are some trusted mobile wallets right now where you can just store it there. Maybe Trustwallet can be a good temporary storage of your coins. What more do you want? You want to learn more? Just browse this forum or try researching or watching videos on Youtube. I'm thinking you don't have the buying power to buy Bitcoin am I right?",

It may be true, but it would take patience how to understand the market to take advantage of this technology.He should read more why some people are getting rich. It also depends on the entry and exit points of the user.I hope he won't start investing on tokens that are promising high returns. As a beginner, he should stick with btc for now.And learn how the market is performing so he knows what kind of strategy he can apply to get those profits.",

Don't let the richest people get through Bitcoin be the only major reason why you choose to learn about it. First, try to fall in love with technology cause it's easy to break some walls for something man love. I said this because the hard time during the Bitcoin journey would be a step to thrive from your view. Second, learn the basic fundamental aspect of Bitcoin, its historical price, things that influence its price, and how to secure your wallet/investment.",

It's a necessity in our modern society now and honestly, I find it hard to survive my everyday life with out internet connection and electricity. It's part of my life that I find hard to give up. I think it is both necessity is more important than buying bitcoin at the moment, There are still time to buy some bitcoin. It is never too late to buy some as we are not on a bull market. Also remember that not all people here get rich by their bitcoin investment, It's a common misconception that newbies have commonly.",
