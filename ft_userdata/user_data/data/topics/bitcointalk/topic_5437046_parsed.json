She did not think of the consequences if she lost part or all the money. That is not a small amount of money at all and I see this as an act of indiscipline. People can still be thinking to gamble with their own money or parents money in a way that nothing like jail term or prison will be involved, unlike using public money for it. I am not saying it is good to gamble with parent's money, all are bad and only little amount should be used on gambling. Gambling should be for working class people and the working class should spend less than 5% of his or her income on gambling.",

Any gambler that goes to the extent of using another people's funds at his/her disposal to gamble needs help because such person has lost control of his gambling behavior. Gambling addicts just like other forms of addiction don't consider the consequences of thier actions because they are just concerned about satisfying a burning and uncontrollable desire in them. She would have to pay back her debt an sent to a gambling rehabs for the treatment his addiction.",

It is a very bad to gamble with people's funds entrusted to you,this means that you are heartless because gambling will definitely make you lose the money, it is better you invest the money into a business that can generate daily or weekly income.The Lady should be ashamed of herself to do such thing and should face the consequences, so that next time she wouldn't just throw away people's funds just like that without reasoning.

Poor girl, how come she becomes that kind of addiction? Though she gets proper punishment, but we hope that her study will not stop, it could be more ruin her life more when it comes to that point.",

If addiction strikes, for sure that the person that's been striken by it will definitely do anything to keep his/her gambling needs.I saw news and situations like a treasurer gambled with the company's fund and it wasn't caught until the company sees the sudden reduction of their funds and it's no longer tallied.On this student, it's sad that she embezzled the money and she did while she's at that shoe of studying because it's alarming on how much more she can do when she gets older.",

I'm guessing she spent vast chunks of the money she stole on these lotteries so was definitely not getting value for money. It's a very sad story when the person involved is relatively young and probably did not understand the consequences of what they were doing, however they should face the criminal consequences or there is no point in having laws. You have to wonder if she was just being extra greedy or had other financial pressures when she wanted to stay in the medical field which must have sky high costs to fund higher education.",

She had so many opportunities to stop, considering that even after gambling she won 5 times albeit with a profit loss, but at some point in that gambling spree she must've had a net profit, but no, she kept going. I am really hoping that apart from incarceration she should be getting, they also give her mental help and intervention because when all of this is said and done she may go back to her old ways.",

But it actually never stops there for some individuals because when the whole mess is cleared up, some still go as far creating another mess again all in the name of being an addict. I can remember when i was faced with such gambling addiction too, it was the period of my life i wouldn't like to be remembering because i was deep into and it almost made me useless in life but i thank God i came out this act. And the only way to come out of this act is actually in the will power of the individual, you have to discipline yourself thoroughly and have a strict principle you will never go against, setting your gambling limit according to the funds you have only then can you be free. As for the lady i think should be forced to pay off the money then after that a detention in prison might serve her well.",

Well, this is still gambling and probably she is with someone doing this thing. Using others money for your gambling activities is not good at all, avoid this at all cost and stay responsible. She placed expensive bets, because she was trying to maximize the odds at her favour per ticket. The game she played is named LotofÃ¡cil (easy lotto).It's possible to bet between 15 and 20 numbers per ticket (the more numbers you pick, the more expensive it's going to be the ticket). Most expensive ticket, containing 20 numbers, costs about 7750$.If you match 11 numbers per ticket, you already guarantee a 1$ prize. 12 numbers give 2$, 13 numbers give 5$ and then for 14 and 15 numbers matched the prize isn't fixed, but its average is 272$ per 14 numbers matched and 160.000$ per 15 numbers matched (jackpot).There are many sites on the internet teaching how to win on this lottery, as if it were possible to make it in a safe way. I guess the student must have had access to such websites and thought she could make it work. Winning chance playing with 20 numbers (7750$ ticket):11 numbers matched: 1 chance in 2,6 (prize 1$)12 numbers matched: 1 chance in 3,9 (prize 2$)13 numbers matched: 1 chance in 4,2 (prize 5$)14 numbers matched: 1 chance in 17 (prize 272$)15 numbers matched: 1 chance in 211 (prize 160.000$)Quote from: goaldigger on January 27, 2023, 09:53:15 PMImagine a student being exposed into gambling, I donâ€™t know her exact age but the lottery should assess that girl first before allowing here to place a bet, this is very unfortunate to ruin her own reputation and her future.
