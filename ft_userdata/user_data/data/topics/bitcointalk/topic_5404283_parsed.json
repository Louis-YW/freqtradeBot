  "content": "I know most of you are down during this bear market, your portfolio but also mentally, but I believe that even in times like these, it is important to adapt.Last year, like many of you, I had faded the meme coin explosion during the bull market.After these last 2 months of just terrible market conditions, I couldn't take it anymore and looked in these meme coins to understand how they work.In short, it's all hype and thin air, absolutely, but the huge advantage is that they do not depend on Bitcoin, but their community.Coins like Shib, Safemoon & BabyDoge that went to billions, others to hundreds of millions in market cap, 18 year old kids made millions out of it, but why?The reason Doge, Shib, BabyDoge more have done so well is because of 3 things:- Funny meme that can unite people (everyone loves cute dogs)- A strong community with a common goal (For Doge it was to mock Bitcoin and beat it, for Shib it was to Beat Doge, BabyDoge was to become Doge’s son)- High Viral potential, the memes and stickers carried this on every social mediaThis is all what meme coins are about, and i think that Panda Elon combines all the quality I've mentioned above:- Combines the biggest meme in China (Panda Biao Qing) + Crypto’s biggest personality (Elon Musk)- Chinese, Vietnamese and English community united to accomplish one goal: Becoming the first Panda to reach $1 Billion Market cap- High viral potential with the meme being extremely famous in China and the stickers are just hilarious: https://t.me/addstickers/PandaElonTheir marketing is also a lot different than most meme coins, instead of just focusing on Telegram call channels, Twitter, Coingecko and Coinmarketcap listings they will also use neglected areas such as Reddit, TikTok, YouTube but also Weibo & Wechat for the Asian Side, but mainly using their community to gain free exposure with the virality of the meme.To build a strong community, they are currently doing a $5000 + Whitelist spots Giveaway to the best members of their Army group, I’ll put the links below.Also something very smart that they have done, they are giving away a $1000 Bonus to anyone that can get Panda Elon viral on any social media.The presale will be on the 2nd of July with a small Hardcap of 100 BNB, I believe that anyone who enters it will make a lot of money, but it’s going to be a gas war.I genuinely think that Panda Elon can go very far, their unique meme with its viral potential added to their international communities make it a no brainer for me.This of course is not financial advise, but please do not be lazy and check the links below and see for yourself how far this can go:Site: https://pandaelon.com/TG: https://t.me/PandaElon$5000 + WL Army group: https://t.me/PandaelonarmyPresale link: https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x1Cfc251457A4f07d21f605EAAb0c883110b9AB2d?chain=BSC",

So I'm also interested in checking the telegram group you linked. but looking at the new community around 2000 members. and I'm not interested in joining yet. However, the potential of meme coins cannot be underestimated. but the main strength of the meme coin is its promotion and marketing. because no matter how solid the community is, if the team is not good at promoting and building hype then I've recently seen a lot of meme coins run aground in the middle of the road. But because panda Elon is still new. So I think it's worth continuing to review. because if the team is good at creating hype and the community is solid. then it is possible that this meme coin will fly. but if the team is not good at creating and building hype then this will end up like any other meme coin that is born and blown by the wind for a moment and thrown to the ground.",
