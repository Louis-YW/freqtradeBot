Say, you have 100 posts and 70 activities now and tomorrow is a new activity period. If you post one single time tomorrow, you will get 14 activity points after that one single post. I think this is what happened with you.",

I think this is what happened with you.is it normal ?  that the activity changes from 70 to 84 in one step , I thought it works like this: assume today is 70 activity and I posted one reply to today then the activity will increase by one means now it becomes 71. But, it changed two time from 70<->84,  84<->70 and now it is 84, I will check tomorrow that it become 70 this time or not.",

This thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1689727.0 explains everything about your uncertainty and you should read it thoroughly as future reference in case you encounter this kind of issue in the future. ***Quote from Lauda PostHow is forum activity calculated?Activity is calculated with the following formula: Code:activity = min(time * 14, posts)Activity is increased by posting and is updated every hour; however, the updated number of activity points will be reflected at your profile at the end of the current activity period. As a note, in case you have latent activity points from earlier periods (meaning activity periods where you didn't post daily: in this case, the days when you did not post become latent activity points), these ones will be updated on your profile after 1 hour. You can gain a maximum of 14 activity points every 2 weeks.",

      "body": "Op, as long as you have enough post when the new activity circle comes all you have to do is to make a single post and you'll receive your complete 14 activities for that period. My guess is that you thought the activity will be added with your new posts made in that current activity cycle but that's not the way it works.",
