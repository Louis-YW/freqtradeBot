This is being professionally produced and accuracy is paramount. One episode is solely dedicated to this forum and the script is mostly done.However, where things get blurry is the very early history of this forum. We can see Satoshi's posts, but were they actually made here? Or were those posts imported from elsewhere like SourceForge? The piece in question has to do with this forum's domain name only being registered in 2011. But again I might be lacking historical context.I'm not here to stir pots, just really need some OGs help to get this episode done!If anyone can shed some light on this for me I'd appreciate it. Thank you.",

Or were those posts imported from elsewhere like SourceForge?As far as I know, Satoshi's posts were imported from SourceForge, which also includes the first four threads of some tests and some administrative notes. And since Satoshi was last seen active on December 13, 2010, it is clear that he never made a single post when bitcointalk.org was launched in July 2011.Quote from: Quickseller on June 26, 2019, 07:39:11 AMTopic 3 was deleted years ago, and it is unknown what happened to it. Topics 1 and 2 were satoshi doing some tests, and topic 4 was some administrative notes left by satoshi.See below for PDFs of the first topics:topic 1topic 2topic 4As an FYI, there are links to the above topics in the link you referenced.

I've reported it for moved, but let's see if the moderators agree with me.Then than that, your idea might be very interesting to follow and hope your project is really as accurate as expected. Before to the bitcointalk.org forum, Satoshi often posted on the original bitcoin.org forum as you can find here. There are at least 255 Satoshi made there, you can found them from the following url which has been archived. @nutildah has also told you.https://web.archive.org/web/20091215005450/http://www.bitcoin.org:80/smf/",

This should be a good thread for cataloging shills paid by Craig Wright to lie about Bitcoin's history and people who've been bamboozled by them.For example: one of his lies is the claim that there was some different forum that this one copied from.  How fucking absurd.The truth is that some people-- particular some developers-- were uncomfortable with Theymos' almost-anything-goes moderation resulting in a lot of discussion of illegal-sounding activities on Bitcoin.org that they didn't want to be associated with, so the domain name of the forum was changed.  It was the same forum all the way through, and you can see that the content was all the same through the name change by looking at the wayback machine.  A few moments googling will turn up this post I made back in 2019 about the history of the move: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5203621.0In more recent years, the well known fraudster Craig Wright ran into problems with the fact that Satoshi's writing contradicts his claims so he started paying people to say that Satoshi never posted here, implying that anything inconvenient said by Satoshi was fake.  Most people don't care about the history so it's cheap for people to trash it and replace it with distorted fiction.  Fuck that.",

Arguably 1-2 of the top 10 posters of all time are trolls, another is a bot -- they probably wouldn't have made it this long under more stern moderating conditions. But its a small price to pay for the wealth of ideas that transpired here during the last 12 years.Quote from: gmaxwell on April 07, 2023, 10:42:15 PMIn more recent years, the well known fraudster Craig Wright ran into problems with the fact that Satoshi's writing contradicts his claims so he started paying people to say that Satoshi never posted here, implying that anything inconvenient said by Satoshi was fake.Its possible to use the Wayback Machine to verify that the satoshi posts count has been the same since he left in 2010.You can also see a lot of his posts via the web archive as well -- none of them have been altered:https://web.archive.org/web/20110528035755/http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3;sa=showPostsI wouldn't be surprised if there was an archive of his every post on forum.bitcoin.org somewhere (other than here).",

Thank you.It would be an amazing experience as a documentary video on bitcointalk will be quite useful for numerous users. I would undoubtedly be one of those who eagerly watch the documentary on the day it's released. This forum is worthy of such an episode because it's the finest platform for countless users who were introduced to the world of cryptocurrencies through it.Undoubtedly, Satoshi was an active member of this forum and he contributed many posts during its early days. He was one of the first ten users of this forum. Beware of those who spread false rumors that Satoshi was not a part of this forum. There have been many individuals have attempted to twist the truth by sharing fake news.",
