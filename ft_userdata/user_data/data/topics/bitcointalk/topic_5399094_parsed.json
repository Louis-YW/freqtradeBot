  "content": "Friends, hello everyone!It's my second topic on this forum. As such, I couldn't miss the opportunity to give my opinion on the new games in the metaverse.After a long time of searching. I came across a game called \"CRYPTOPOLIS\".What caught my attention right from the start is the fact that it is a SIMS and HABBO HOTEL type game.I've been following this project since October 2021, and I can immediately point out positive points that other projects usually don't have:- Developers show their face and invite investors to visit their facilities;- The team behind the game has more than 30 people working full time on the game;- Every week we have a summary of the game's progress and future new implementations;- bi-weekly AMAs;Cryptopolis game features:- Free 2 play & Earn game (players can start playing without investing anything!);- All NFT's are useful in the game (Already available for purchase on Binance NFT marketplace);- Social Game;- Around 15 Minigames are planned. 4 of them are already completed (Chess, Red light green light, Snooker and Tower run);Closed alpha of the game is already scheduled for June 2022. It is still possible to enter the closed alpha for those who enter until the end of May.Game Ambassador will be announced this May. The team also met with META in California to formalize a future partnership.There's so much to convey that it's best to write your questions here or check out the Cryptopolis website. You can search for the project on the coin market cap or on social media. By the way, I would suggest that you join the telegram to keep up with the latest news.",
