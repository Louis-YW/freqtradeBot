  "content": "Hey everyoneI’m considering starting SPREADBTC.ORG, a space designed to help get Bitcoin into as many hands as possible. The idea is to build an open, transparent, and collaborative platform for people who already know the basics of Bitcoin but want to focus on pushing adoption further. This means:    Forums where we can share strategies on introducing Bitcoin to new communities, businesses, or regions.    Community Proposals, where we can pitch initiatives or projects that could benefit from extra support or funding—possibly from “whales” who’d like to help.    Transparency in all decisions, especially around financial backing, so everyone understands each step we take.I’ve already made some progress on how this could look, but these are just the basics. If you like the concept, I can share more details about the idea and the roadmap I have in mind.Would SPREADBTC.ORG be helpful? If you’re down to help or have suggestions, I’d love to hear them. Thanks for reading, and I’m excited to see what y'all think!",

Social place?Will it just show information or have responsiveness with user actions?We need more info, to understand your idea, so I suggest that you construct your initial post better, using details, pictures, links or anything that will help us understand.",

I want it to function like an organization, where everyone moves together, analyzing the best ways to spread Bitcoin globally. It should be interactive and responsive, a place where people can post ideas, work on projects together, and discuss ways to push adoption further, like helping businesses accept BTC, launching local initiatives, or increasing awareness in new ways.If “whales” or larger contributors decide to get involved, I want everything to be transparent so everyone sees exactly how support or funding is used.

Will this be an online platform only or will it have a physical presence anywhere? Bitcoin awareness and helping businesses to use Bitcoin might require some offline tasks. There are some organization that promotes Bitcoin awareness in schools, communities and business areas and they achieve it by organizing physical events.  Promoting Bitcoin voluntarily is a selfless effort, wishing you the best.",

Thanks for reading, and I’m excited to see what y'all think!Whatever means to spread the awareness of bitcoin for adoption would be a welcome then Op, hope you know it doesn't make sense convincing anyone just to invest on bitcoin neither does it seem advisable to fund beginner investors on their decision of investing on bitcoin because they won't appreciate it to see the treasure of in a long term with the minimum amount deposited on their wallets while expecting them to hold and accumulating to increase their portfolios.Also, bitcoin is not a physical commodity that may require any of Adverts as marketing strategies. Also being aware about the threats to when you posses you are a bitcoin holder?I am just little biased of this thought then I would like to ask why don't you recommend any of those interested enthusiasts here to bitcointalk platform instead of creating another? Maybe more investing experts here as usual would afford to impact them better and save you the expenses as request of fund raising on your so personal bitcoin awareness project platform.Just thinking how better it could serve and not mean to kick against your opinion.",
