I EAS WAITING FOR FTX price to ho down below 10 dollars and than it suddenly started Crash and that was very dangerous and also if made very big impact in Crypto market. I wanted to buy FTX token's cause it was promotion in IPL, cricketer Wolrd cup and many other places. And that's why I thought that it might be biggest crypto in next bull run. But thanks God I was saved from this crash and all my savings that were saved. My question that if someone lost Their crypto in FTX?",

The news felt like it was going really fast at the time I caught it (CZ's binance tweet about selling FTT) I don't think it was easy to withdraw your funds within enough time unless you were there around the time just before withdrawals were suspended (I think there was about 2-12 hours of constant speculation and rapid news changing - some news agencies were trying to push out articles every 10 minutes at a similar pace to what we've seen for potential escalation in wars).There will be people who lost money due to:Having funds on ftxHaving anything related to ftx (such as ftt)Having other cryptos, there was too much news to read at once but I heard something happened to Solana around that time",

LedgerX, Blockfolio, Voyager, Bitvo Exchange, Liquid Global and Storybook Brawl are collapsed [1]. Gladly I'm not the one who suffer losses since I always hold my Bitcoin on my non custodial wallet. However after FTX collapse, many people still leave their coins on centralized exchange especially Binance because they think Binance would never collapse, but we will see it later lol.[1] https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange/recent_investments",

Trust is something that we should not just give to someone - just like SBF - just because he is good in using the media and advertising to his own advantage. Sam had been playing like he owed nobody any accountability and transparency all the while pretending like he is the role model of the industry. Now, if you lost money in FTX - like if you bought the FTX token - then just pretend like it is a big tuition fee for your crypto schooling - we all mostly got victimized by scams and frauds in the past so this can just be one of them.

This will not happen if you keep your money in cold wallets, first and foremost, by keeping your mental state in check.It would be appropriate to ask Sam where a significant amount of money went after the secret transfer to Alameda Research, which this scammer denies, and return some of the amounts to customers.

There you go, many people have actually invested on a project or trusted exchanges just because of there promotions. This act has hooked many into investing lots into shit coins. Let be known that some of these brands or celebrities that do this promotion are not aware or even have an iota of what they promotes.Just recently After the Ronaldo's promotion of Binance (not saying it was bad though) some new investors see Binance as immune to attacks and some trust it as there wallets. It is a continuous warning by crypto expert to do your research before taking any move.",

Which means just your trading funds were lost as a result of liquidation, if not risking much to trading, the amount lost would be little during FTX implosion, even if having money there (never leave the amount you can not afford to lose on exchanges). But we are still good to know that when it is not our key, it is not our coin.Some people on this forum could be lucky if they have read what OmegaStarScream posted about this before the collapse began like 2 days after.

His arrest will somehow make people who lost to FTX collapse a bit happy that he is not walking around freely after causing people much pain.But his arrest may never bring back the money lost. Lifetime savings were lost, hundreds and thousands of dollars were lost. I even heard (but I do not know how true it is) that million of dollars were lost. I am referring the lost per a single person. Prevention is always better.",

And one thing you should know is - once there is a case of insolvency the team will immediately stop withdrawal even before the news gets too many people, so during this confused state, the only thing investors want to do is get their money out but such access will be automatically denied.To avoid such unexpected loss, don't leave too much on the exchange even if you are an active trader.",

That's because of blind trust, they are comfortable because of the price of the token and how the admins address and motivate their users to continue trusting the platform, always give a benefit of the doubt when your funds are in a place that you have no control of, it becomes too late for others because they failed to see the warning sign, so far this is the biggest fiasco in Cryptocurrency this year and it will continue to have a chilling effect until 2023, even Binance is not safe many still thinks that, because they are the leader nothing could go wrong but we never know.",
