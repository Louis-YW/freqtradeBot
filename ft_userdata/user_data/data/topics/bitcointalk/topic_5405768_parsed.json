They did fail at social Responsibility and had bad money laundering policies as well. The suspension is in effect immediately as well. You would still be able to access the account and withdraw any money left in there as well, therefore I highly advise people to look at their accounts and close them after withdrawing and look for other options as well.",

But it also nice to hear that customers can withdraw their funds without restrictions, that means there would be no loss of funds. But I hope there is no political undertone for this suspension because recently the British government have been clamping down on the activities of gambling companies. They have blamed them for the increase in gambling addiction in the UK. When government fail in their function, they tend to play the blame game. My heart goes to the management and staff of Bet-at-home, I pray the suspension would soon be lifted.",

The UK gambling commission seems to be very active and keen on social responsibility and anti-money laundering procedures of the casinos in the country, and it is commendable. Sometime this year as well, a gambling company with the name 888 UK Ltd, that manage over 50 gambling websites were  fined £9.4 million  for the same failed social responsibility and anti-money laundering procedures. It is a pointer to other casinos in the UK to ensure they don't breach as well.",

The thing is those smart contract is centralized and there's a pool where someone have control over it, it just a trap to say decentralized casino.Anything that fully 100% decentralized is a non-profit project, they're not expecting to earn huge money like centralized services.",

People that are using the site can be able to access their fund at any time according to the news, the betting site will have to follow the gambling authority instruction which is 'they have to make customers funds available for the respective customers' at any time during the suspension.Secondly is that any customers that is active or not active on the site will not be able bet, that alone should let them know that something is wrong, what will finally happen is that they will find out that the betting site is suspended. If the betting site follow the right way, they would have also messaged their customers to convincingly tell them what is going on, why to be patient and how they are working to solve the issue between them and the regulatory body.The suspension may even be shown even to every person that access the site, especially if the site have a message or notification page that customers can easily see and check.",

In the first place--and please anybody correct me if I'm wrong--the gambling platform does not support crypto. So this decision by the UKGC is based on something else. As pointed out by the news, while the particular grounds for the suspicion weren't provided, they were basically about social responsibility and AML procedures. And it seems Bet-at-home isn't really more of a victim of a tight gambling regulation. For the past 12 months, it has been in trouble with laws of different countries. The platform also faced legal problems in Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany.[1] [1] https://www.casino.org/news/online-gambling-site-bet-at-home-loses-uk-license-over-rule-violations/",

Areas of particular concern that led to the suspension decision were alleged failings in social responsibility and anti-money laundering procedures.The suspension is in accordance with section 118(2) of the Act, and comes into effect immediately.The Commission said: “We have made it clear to the operator that during the course of the suspension, we expect it to focus on treating consumers fairly and keeping them fully informed of any developments which impact them.”The decision to suspend the licence will not prevent Bet-at-home customers from accessing their accounts or withdrawing the available balance, the Commission confirmed.In a statement on its website, Bet-at-home said: “Dear players, our operations in the UK have been suspended by the UK Gambling Commission until further notice. You are not able to register, bet, play or deposit with us at the moment.”Reading this I think the suspension may not stay long before the whole imbroglio is resolved. If the gambling site has breached the welfare packages and social responsibilities as enshrined in their terms and conditions of contract in letters of the agreement then they can find ways to put their records straight again with their host and the suspension could be lifted.",

So this is a wake up call for every casinos that are taking advantage of their gambler's funds, and not be able to promote social responsibility.
