And yeah, with lots of fixed bugs this includes lightning, hardware wallets connection, binaries, etc. I see there is some important updates for hardware wallets like Trezor and ledger, and they even added warning for everyone who is still using ledger HW.1 devices, they should migrate asap if they want to continue using them with Electrum wallet.My habit is to usually wait few days after release of newest Electrum update, just in case there are some unexpected bugs and problems found.",

I don't think the hacker was able to exploit electrum because he was using the previous version of electrum. There is nothing mentioned on the electrum site that Electrum 4.3.2 is vulnerable. What do you say? Is upgrading to the new version is a must",

The hack everybody is talking about is more likely due of some malware installed on his computer than any problem of the older Electrum. If Electrum itself would be affected we would have been hearing already of much more hacks...",

There also haven't been any vulnerabilities or major issues with that version that I am aware off. When I upgraded to ver. 4.2.2., I noticed quite an improvement when signing transactions with my Ledger compared to older versions. When I was doing consolidations, for example, it would take a long time to sign with all the private keys. That has greatly improved thankfully.",
