Regulations are actually inevitable and there is nothing we can do about it besides agreeing and following them, giving up services they rule, or finding gaps (cheating them) and consequently facing the consequences for these acts. That is how things work since the arising of the human organized society.",

Btc in 2009 and BTC now are a bit different because now we have people from all works of life as part of the technology and everyone is trying to make it more suitable for them.Besides, for btc to achieve global recognition and worldwide acceptance, certain things will change or will be introduced and I guess government control is one of them.

And to be more precise, the current system is falling apart, which means that everyone now wants to snatch a piece of influence for themselves. This is very clearly seen in the example of different markets, for example, the cryptocurrency market. The EC, represented by certain countries, also understand this and probably also one of them is trying to keep their own or take away someone else's. As for us, we don’t really have a choice, but I know for sure that this time needs to be experienced or even survived. It is difficult to say what will happen in the end, but I know for sure that it will not be like before and it is likely that the world will be divided into zones of influence and each such zone will have its own rules of the game.",

Step 1: Person A sets up a simple clothing shop company  ( company x )Step 2: Person B becomes a shareholder in company x with person AStep 3: Person B gives money to his people to buy clothing from company x Step 4: His people buy clothing and the shop is mega profitable even if it does not sell anything of use and most of the time it has 1-2 clients. Step 5: When it's time to collect dividends , person B gets clean money. He was a great investor,he made a great \"business decision\" .That is why we see so many shops in malls, center of the city with zero clients in them ,that pay big rent or buys the building with very few or zero clients. Always wondered how this shops survive that's how I know this,took me a while to figure it out.Other ways they do it is via foundations, associations and auction housing ( they buy junk paintings etc ) ...If people study business ,they will understand this also...",
