That chance is lower with time and nowadays your chance is 0.Quote from: https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/731872416629202945Quote from: gmaxwell on March 11, 2015, 09:59:57 PMThis isn't true.  Transactions can happily be sent, relayed, and mined with no fee at all in Bitcoin core, if they have enough priority.Fortunately if you know how mempools work, you can broadcast your transactions with a cheap fee rate at 1 satoshi/ vbyte when mempools are nearly empty.Use Native Segwit address type (bech32) starts with bc1q to have smaller transaction size and enjoy lower transaction fee.https://mempool.space/https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24hMake sure to avoid wasting BTC for too high fees – step by step guide (Electrum)Mempool empty!

With using segwit inputs, you actually decrease the virtual size of your transaction, not the size. This post has been edited. Thanks o_e_l_e_o for the correction.",

Witness data is counted as one quarter the size of regular data.The calculation is defined in BIP 141. To calculate the transaction weight, you take the base size of the transaction without the witness data, multiply it by 3, and then add the total size of the transaction with the witness data included. This means that the witness data is only counted once, while non-witness data is counted four times. This gives you the transaction weight in weight units, which you divide by 4 to get the virtual size in vbytes.In effect, this means that for non-witness data there is a 1-to-1 correlation between bytes and vbytes, while for witness data, it is 1 byte to 0.25 vbytes.",

All of them worth above 120 BTC except the two: 0.2 and 0.005 BTC. Thanks.Right. In December 2018, there were 68 non-coinbase transactions with zero fee.Take note that it's almost impossible that you can make a transaction with zero fee. If you set the fee to zero, your transaction won't be broadcasted to the network at all. As mentioned by BlackBoss_ above, the minimum fee rate you can use is 1 sat/vbyte. Those transactions that are made with zero fee are probably made by the miners/mining pools and they included their own transactions.",

The first are transactions with 20-30 inputs. Each of those inputs come from the same address, are in the region of 6.3 BTC, and are all outputs from coinbase transactions. These transactions are a mining pool consolidating their block rewards in to one or two addresses. The second are transactions with 1 input and 3,000 outputs. The inputs to these transactions are consolidated outputs from the transactions just described above. These transactions are mining pools paying out earnings to all the individual miners mining on their pool.So yes, the majority of zero fee transactions are mining pools directly mining their own transactions.",
