  "content": "I have a strange situation maybe someone here can help me out with... or at least tell me it's a non-fixable issue.Being super excited about Taproot, I created a Taproot account from my existing Trezor wallet/device.  Since I don't use my Trezor day-to-day, just for cold storage, I added it as a watch-only wallet to BlueWallet (as I did with my primary SegWit account) to generate receive addresses on the go while preventing the ability to send -- without extra steps.Then off I went, generating receive address on BlueWallet and sending satoshi into it for storage.  Life was good.Fast forward to last month, when I booted up my Trezor to do an update check and overall review. I almost cr@ped myself when I saw my Taproot account was empty on the Trezor.  After doing a ton of research and asking around to my Bitcoin techie network, I came across some strange info -- the BlueWallet \"taproot\" account appears to be using the derivation M/44' ... not M/86' as one would expect for a Taproot wallet.What in the world did I do wrong, and how to I recover these 'missing' satoshi that I believe are still tied to my private key but not visible in Trezor nor sendable in BlueWallet?Notes:BlueWallet shows a balance & no sent tx - I don't think the bitcoin was 'stolen' in any way Recieve addresses start with \"1\" on the BlueWallet 'taproot' wallet I importedTried using Coinomi with custom derivation paths to no avail.  My Segwit satoshi were found but not these 'taproot' satoshiAny/all advice or guidance on getting access to my taproot satoshi is greatly appreciated.  Not sure where else I can turn for help.Thanks",

This means that the wallet you created on bluewallet wasn't taproot at all. A taproot address starts with bc1p.How did you create your watch-only wallet on bluewallet? You probably imported a xpub.",
