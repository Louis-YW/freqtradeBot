I want to run a bounty campaign with your project. Let me know if you're interested. I've preached a lot of bounty campaigns before. According to everyone, my medium of promotion is different, but everyone likes it. Also ask me any questions if you want to do more about a bounty campaign.My Contract Telegram: https://t.me/samil507[...]Ahmim and his alt, Crypto Dotar was previously exposed for managing scam bounty campaigns in the past.[2]Other than the plagiarized whitepaper, I found extreme similarities of their web design with a project called Tetrix Token[2]Some screenshot for easy view: It'll be quite hard to read through their WP, thanks to the strategic decision to put black-over black of the texts over their logo. I've tried to highlight it to boost visibility. Hope that helps.[1] [2]",

I would advise anyone dealing to be very much careful with them.I found and would like to think that this is the MO of the projects that the group --or perhaps it's a single entity, one person with his alts, behind the bounty team--  managed, no team details, questionable whitepaper. They most likely hired the BM and not the well known campaign and/or bounty managers for this very reason, because they know the BM wouldn't care to do a research before accepting the job.",

We should team up next time instead of getting in each other's way.  It's worth mentioning that they have edited the images by altering certain facial features to make it harder to detect. This clearly indicates their intention to deceive potential investors and is a characteristic feature of a typical scam project.",

[...]And here I am, not even realizing that there is a team section. I must have confused myself and looking at the Tetrix's website --the team button was just a placeholder for their case-- instead of MetaSystem's in between archiving pages, screenshots, and writing the thread... or maybe I'm getting rusty at this, LOL.Nonetheless, good job for you both, I really appreciate both of your help and contribution.Quote from: albon on June 13, 2023, 08:36:18 PM[...]Now a plagiarized Whitepaper and fake team, the result is that it's a scam project of the first degree, I hope bounty hunters stop promoting it.I don't think they even wandering around this board and thus, this thread might go unnoticed. I think I can write an open invitation to ahmim/Dotar/Bountyes on their group, inviting them and effectively informing each of their participants about the current situation, but I am very well aware that they can simply delete my chat and the attempt become useless. I am mulling over raising a flag type-1 against them --was asking the same for other people's opinion about it on the reputation board-- as that'll be quite effective to warn newbies and it can't be deleted by them, but if I have to be honest, I think a flag is quite a drastic and incorrect step for the very reason I said on the said thread,Quote from: holydarkness on June 13, 2023, 06:21:21 PM[...] In one side, I think they're not the owner the project, thus they're not directly scamming anyone and no one is --directly-- at a risk of losing money by dealing with them, nor there is a casual or written contract being breached, so none of the three types of the flags matched their case here. But, I'd like to think there is a fine line between naive due to the lack of experience and couldn't-care-less-as-long-as-I-get-paid in accepting to manage bounties. I guess I have to take this with me to The Dreaming.",
