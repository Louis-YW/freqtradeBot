Note that even if your transaction is broadcasted to the network, you can't get confirmation soon with the fee rate of only 1 sat/vbyte and there's big probability that it will remain unconfirmed and will be dropped from the mempool after 14 days. You need to pay more fee.",

If you want to make a transaction, you have to sign it and broadcast it. You do not even need to click on preview, you can click on send directly.On the history tab, right click on the local transaction and cancel it. Make another transaction using a better fee rate. You can use https://mempool.space to set the fee rate (sat/vbytes) to be used.",

That's why OP's transaction can't exist in the mempool.The purge-limit is much higher than I expected, considering that 6 sat/vbyte is currently enough for a fast confirmation.",

Can anyone help me what this is about?  Thanks It'll show \"Unconfirmed\" if it's unconfirmed, \"Local\" means that it's only saved in your wallet, your selected server dropped it from their mempool.Even if it's \"local\", Electrum will allow you to perform RBF if you've set that transaction as replaceable.So, you have two choices:1. You can Right-click on it and check if there's an \"Increase fee\" option.If there is, use that to set a higher fee rate.2. There's another option for local transaction which is \"Remove\",that will enable you delete that local transaction from your history to spend its input(s) to another transaction.Use this if you want to change the recipient's address.",

I just checked RBF strategies and there is no \"Preserve payment\" option. The options are as follows.decrease change, or add new inputs, or decrease any outputsdecrease change, or decrease any outputsdecrease paymentWhatever strategy has been used by OP, it should allow decreasing the payment amount. In the case of using the first option, the payment is decreased if there is no change and there is no extra UTXO.In the case of using the second option, the payment is decreased if there is no change. In the case of using the third option, the payment is decreased even if there's a change or there is extra UTXO. Correct me if I am wrong, please.",
