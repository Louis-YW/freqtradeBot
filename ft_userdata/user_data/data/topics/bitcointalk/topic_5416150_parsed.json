It will become more ingrained in our lives in the coming days. I hope it can reach every country and people and increase its potential.though it will take more time from now , yet indeed that there is nothing to give up because in the end? bitcoin will be our technological currency to support and use.",

I'm guessing you were excited because you were surprised to see something that you believe in so close to you with people around you still believing in it. As bitcoin gains more mainstream adoption and recognition this sort of things are what we regularly expect to see.Please try to visit the shop and give us an update, let us know if they both buy and sell, or just involved in selling to people who want to buy.",

What seemed impossible but now it is becoming a reality, with the current rapid growth rate I believe by the next bull season maybe 2025 we will see more countries, more stores will accept bitcoin. It can be said that the growth rate of bitcoin so far is unstoppable. Honestly, for those who invest in bitcoin for the first time, seeing this scene will be very emotional and happy, I used to be the same.",

Perhaps, we can see a of establishments offering this kind of service knowing that more countries are legalizing this one thinking that it was safe already. Bitcoin ATMs, and OTC transactions, and it was been growing globally which is an indication that adoption keeps on growing. Have to expect more stores open for this and of course, this is even more interesting for those who are new to crypto.",

I wonder if the image was captured recently, 'coz if it is, that would be amazing. In my area, there were small businesses who started accepting ethereum, and Bitcoin, as an alternative mode of payment but unfortunately, little by little, those businesses eventually stopped, probably because they cannot take the loss that much especially now that the prices of raw materials for their business, increases, and the market values of most cryptos are still down (in comparison with their market price last year), which makes it more sad. Hopefully, more people would engage adapting cryptocurrencies to show support for its continuous growth towards future",

But benefit of the doubt, don't know if the OP is the same reddit user who posted this.In any case, I believe we will see more of this advertisement as bitcoin is getting popular.Before, there were so many negative rants towards bitcoin, why many establishments were not promoting it.But when more and more influential people are getting into crypto like Elon, or country like El Salvador making it legal tender,people slowly tone down their negative criticisms towards btc, instead, they are trying to check out this market already.",

So don't expect anything less than more recognition, because no other assets is as great as btc, it is making life easy for many through different means. More business are accepting btc daily because they have realised how fast growing and evolving the tech is. It is inevitable.",

A store that has that banner that they're selling bitcoin probably have a bitcoin ATM or the owner of that store is also an holder that sells bitcoin. Adoption is increasing year by year and it may decrease a little bit but that's not a lot. Whatever is the situation of the market, you'll see more stores posting that banner that they are either accepting it or selling it.",

We're talking about a payment that's worth more today than it was 2 or 3 years ago and more than it was worth in its old all time high, so there's literally only one year in its 12 year existence when it was worth more than it is today and you're saying it's incredible that people believe in something like that? Bitcoin is great and it's real value is much higher than what the inflated and reprinted fiat money makes you think it is. If we take the famous fiat standard, $100 in 2022 is worth much less than the same $100 in 2017. Since bitcoin was worth 20k in 2017 and is now worth more than 20k and the purchasing power of the dollar has fallen, it's better to hold bitcoin than fiat, especially that this is going to continue. 5 Years from now bitcoin is still going to be worth more than 20k and dollar's purchasing power will be at least 20% lower. If you don't believe me, take an average new car's price in 2017 and now and you'll see that the same brand and model now costs at least 10% more, but if that value was, let's say, 0.5BTC in 2017, it's now still 0.5 BTC, or less, even though bitcoin is in a bear market and dollar went up.",
