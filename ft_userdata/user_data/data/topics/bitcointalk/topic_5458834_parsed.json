  "content": "In the world today, many people prefer to keep their money in their house save because of the perceived fraud by our traditional banking system that has decided to rip the populace off their hard-earned money without remorse, through different unexplainable charges, this has changed the mindset of the un-banked because of the complaints coming from the individuals involved in that process, this individual, both the ones that are already banked and the unbanked are looking for alternative other alternative means that they will use to safeguard their wealth. Financial institutions put up these outrageous charges and unacceptable taxing methods and lend individual money to other people without their consent and unknowingly to them, in return give them interest below what is expected yearly, taking back the interest through taxation and so making their money always depreciate in their bank account.I want to categorically tell this set of people that Bitcoin is the way forward for you, bitcoin works for everyone, and the system was designed in a way that every interested person can participate.Bitcoin allows you to be your bank and be in charge of your money with no interference from anyone. Participation is dependent on your interest, not your identity, that's to say that everyone can be involved without their identity known. Note that blockchain technology guarantees your Bitcoin security, so don't be afraid just give it a trial but with a little money I believe you won't regret it.",

If you do not spend it, someone can know and invite thieves to steal your money. If thieves do not steal the money, the banks are still robbing you by decreasing the value of your money during inflation in a way that what you can use it to buy today, you can no more use it to buy the same amount of thing next year.See what that happened in the El Salvador, that IMF and US government did not like. Bitcoin is now available to the unbank people in El Salvador and their economy has not collapsed but life made easier for the El Salvadorans.But one problem is bitcoin can not help the unbank people in countries that do not adopt bitcoin like El Salvador and also in countries that prefer to spend fiat. Most people prefer to spend fiat and use bitcoin for investment. Another thing is that people that know how bitcoin works will have bank account because bitcoin is not for illiterates but for people that are literates and able operate phones and computers.",

Because regulations on cryptocurrency centralized exchanges are easier than on banks. So risk with centralized exchange will be bigger.If they do this, stay with banks is safer.Reminder.If they choose Bitcoin, they must use non custodial wallets.",

It's like a tight rope dance where we balance between the convenience of banking and the drawbacks of hidden charges, low interest, and perceived unconsented lending. However, Bitcoin as a solution might be too hasty a conclusion. The animated excitement around it is understandable, but let's hold our horses and don our skeptical glasses for a moment.Bitcoin's transaction fees have been soaring, which makes it less than ideal for small transactions. While it is touted as a democratic system, remember that it consumes considerable energy, indirectly contributing to climate change. Further, its volatility can be a deal-breaker for people looking for stable investments. Yes, Bitcoin does offer control over your money, but it also shifts the onus of security entirely onto you, which may not suit everyone.Before investing, be informed about its pros and cons.
