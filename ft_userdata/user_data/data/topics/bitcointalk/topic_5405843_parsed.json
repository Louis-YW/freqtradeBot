Though I don't think it's wrong,  I'm guessing those hormones are something natural, not just in gambling, you can probably get it as well from playing different types of games. I reckon the bad thing here is an excess or letting yourself be swept away by those? In simple terms it's like the feeling of thrill and such. To the point where if you feel it even by a small amount, you just get swept by it immediately.",

The players always lose money in the long term but the trick is making them feel good about it so they will always come back and lose more. You make them feel good by offering free stuff like snacks and drinks and good looking hostesses.",

But that's not entirely true because their odds will remain the same and even their chances of losing could be bigger, especially if they use more money in each bet.Unfortunately, people don't use gambling as a tool for fun, thus triggering them to keep playing while hoping for a win. And this will make them addicted in the future, especially if they can't stop gambling for a while and switch to other activities. The desire to win itself will be great when you can win a few spins and instead of stopping your gambling, you are triggered to play gambling again.",

Gambling gives you an adrenaline rush and winning or losing gives you emotions. Maybe you get them by watching Netflix but if gambling is such a big industry it is precisely because of that, an entertainment that causes a strong emotional impact. Look at the importance gambling has had in the history of bitcoin, or the importance it has in this forum, it is an activity that cannot be understood only as an attempt to make money.",

That is part of it I guess, there is no entertainment if you don't spend money. And casino's are the perfect example of it. You play let's say in a land base casino, the moment you step it, adrenaline is already rushing, you see lots of people playing winning big and then some live bands performing, drinks everywhere. And so you are suckered into that energy, you lost control of everything, endorphins shoot up in your body and you are 'high' and wanted to gamble your money.",

It could be, I admit that when I'm alone to be honest, I'm depressed but not often, tired easily because of a lack of adrenaline hormone in the body. according to my personal doctor I must doing a physical exercise to balance the adrenaline hormone, but the most effective way I think is to take medicine or by gambling. Actually there are others, watching horror movies but not fun or doing extreme activities but it's dangerous for our bodies, gambling will increase adrenaline and endorphins at the same time. With a little money is better but remember that excess adrenaline will make you mentally like an insane person and become addicts irresponsible.",
