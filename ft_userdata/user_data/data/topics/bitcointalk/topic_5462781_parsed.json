(as confirmed Hopenotlate https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460565.msg62673669#msg62673669)Repayement was done regularly and other 550 loand taken was repaid too.But on 08/08 Timelord2067 left me another warning trust , in wich he claims \"Another overdue loan ($115 repayment was due on 2023-08-05) \" . Overdue What? No loan was overdue since there was an agreement (and 450 was repaid in andvance, but he didn't wrote this) Dear Timelord: why you don't wrote in your feedback that loan was repaid in advance??? I'm really bored with this user, and I hope other users realize that Timelord is carrying out a shameful smear campaign against me.",

I think it's not ethical. Maybe you would have waited on @hopenotlate to see if he'd raise a tag against @HedgeFx or create a thread for his loan default.

But however haven explained it here I think he would remove it and let you be. Sometimes I can sense is very frustrating seeing a feedback that you didn't deserved being displayed on your profile or status which is very annoying. The thing is, you did well by regularly communicating with your lender so I don't see any reason you should be tagged and part of the loan has been remitted to the lender.",

First of all, there's this gem (I don't really understand what its in reference to but I know marlboroza retired as a non-scammer):Timelord took money to remove support for red flagDamn I miss marlboroza.Then there's this one:User: Timelord Feedback on our profile.No trust left whatsoever for the OP. Doesn't mean they're not a scammer necessarily, but the thread is interesting because it shows how Timelord has been engaging in this kind of vindictive, stalker-ish behavior for over 6 years now... Just hounding certain accounts that he's convinced have committed wrongdoing (often despite a lack of clear evidence).A bit more recently, although OP was banned there's no concrete evidence they were a scammer:Wrongful accusation by Timelord. Did Yahoo put him in DT?Perhaps my favorite quote from that thread is this one:Quote from: hilariousandco on October 30, 2019, 06:43:27 PMPerfect example of why timelord shouldn't be on DT and nobody should pay attention to his ratings.Its almost 4 years old but it demonstrates that people don't change.",
