It discourages people from starting to use crypto. What is your opinion about this practice ? Of course, who wouldn't want to get charge for just letting your coins stay in their exchange.But it just put a emphasize to our old adage here, \"Not your keys, not your coins\". So it's better to just withdraw your crypto to any exchange, regardless if you are very active (just leave enough for trading purpose), or not that active. Because there are possibility that exchanges can be hacked, or they will simply freeze your accounts for no reasons at all. And then there are exchanges that exit scams too. Or worst this, way back in 2018  QuadrigaCX: $190 million locked after founder died in December 2018.",

It discourages people from starting to use crypto. What is your opinion about this practice ? I don't believe it is necessary to use a crypto exchange before adopting Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, which is why it is critical to have adequate knowledge about the entire thing; there are crypto exchanges that do not require KYC before starting trading with them, so why not buy your crypto/Bitcoin from them and then send it to your personal wallets if you don't want to use local P2P transactions?People must understand the importance of privacy and should avoid such exchanges because they will discourage people who are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency from adopting it.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on November 06, 2022, 06:53:10 AMI personally think that more exchanges should adopt this as long as users don't get charged when they have nothing on their accounts because it seems like something that would encourage users from keeping their funds in exchanges.This policy should instead discourage users from using such exchanges and encourage them to move all of their coins to personal wallets.",

They don't just care about the number of people who DO call but the amount that CAN call.Kind of like the FAA requires 1 flight attendant per 50 SEATS on an aircraft, not per 50 passengers. Have 210 seats, you need 5 flight attendants, does not matter if you only sold 9 tickets for the flight and only 8 of them showed up you have 5 attendants working. So if other places are billing the exchange like that then they are just passing the costs along, and probably adding a lot for even more profit. -Dave",

I take the point regarding customer service, but no customer service provider anywhere is charging $10 per month per account, so obviously most of the charge is just pure profiteering by the exchange as you rightly point out.Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 06, 2022, 12:41:57 PMUnfortunately I don't expect many CEX users opt for DEX, not yet.

Already DEXs win hands down on security of your coins, on security of your data, on privacy and not selling your information, on fees, on not being hacked, on not scamming their users, on not being fractional reserve, on not freezing accounts or seizing coins, speed of setting up an account, not requiring KYC, the list goes on. The only thing CEXs have going for them is the speed of individual trades, but continue to alienate users and that one metric becomes less and less important.",
