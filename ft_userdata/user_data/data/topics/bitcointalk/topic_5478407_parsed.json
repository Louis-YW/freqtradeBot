Because if you look at developments over time, it is currently very adequate to move little by little towards digital. So if there are many young people in America who are pro towards the crypto system, in my opinion that is a good thing. Moreover, coupled with a banking system that does not satisfy the public, crypto is definitely a path chosen by many young people and people in America.",

Now that someone’s vouching to be the vouce of the crypto industry from inside the government offices, you can bet your sweet bippy we’d have no trouble financing this guy’s canpaign, especially since much hate has been thrown towards this industry that we having someone be the voice of reason that will be heard and listened to by the people inside and outside the crypto industry is very necessary.Hope we get more out of this deal. I’m rooting for his success, and although I couldn’t really donate right now I’ll do my part in making people see what crypto could do to people, at least from where I live.",
