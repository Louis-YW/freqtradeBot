If all DEXs starts enforcing KYC, it might be a good time to learn how to interact with smart contracts directly hehehehe.New European Union rules that let tax authorities share data on individuals' crypto holdings were formally adopted by the bloc's finance ministers on Tuesday. The document will now be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force 20 days later.The rules were proposed last year in a bid to block assets from being stashed overseas using crypto and had unanimous support from EU member states despite discussions mostly taking place largely behind closed doors.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/10/17/eu-formally-agrees-on-new-crypto-tax-data-sharing-rules/",

Patchy regulation and high energy usage have also prevented the spread of crypto as a means of payment.\"",

Expensive purchases are always controlled by the tax authorities, and in Europe this system works perfectly. After such a purchase, tax inspectors will send many questions about income. Well, with a house, I think it’s even more difficult if you use an escrow account in a bank.",

Whales can also do that if they want, however, because they trade with size, they might really want to have KYC and start a relationship with an exchange or a bank because these are they only places that can provide them with the liquidity that the need.On small minnows, we do not trade with size which makes us less in need of large liquidity pools. We can also use DeFi to our advantage to have more anonymity in our transactions and trades.DeFi also reduces the government's capability to impose KYC and other strict regulations on you because decentralized financial networks make them lose control of financial infrastructures if more people use them. On bitcoin, it has a different roadmap. There might never be any DeFi infrastructure created on bitcoin.",

      "body": "@zasad@. This is certainly because the biggest DEXs in the cryptospace does not want to be cracked down by the government or go through a compliance nightmare similar to Binance and other CEXs.Similar to imposing these new rules on data sharing while everyone is distracted in Europe, the American government is also imposing new rules on mixers to make it easier to crackdown. The Biden administration is set Thursday to designate international “mixers,” cryptocurrency exchanges that provide customers anonymity, as money-laundering hubs that threaten national security. The designation, a form of sanction, will require special reporting for any financial transactions.Source https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-hamas-war-biden/card/u-s-cites-hamas-in-broad-sanctions-against-foreign-crypto-mixers-i44QIsVOEPpkWf3ewqNTAlso, there are speculations on social media on what might be the definition of mixing under these new rules. Some have mentioned that it might include also the use of DeFi.If this becomes an adopted rule internationally, this will be a crackdown on all of us.In the course of compliance with special measure one, covered financial institutions may be required to submit reports and retain records containing certain unique identifiers108 and other personal information109 of a party, or parties, to a CVC mixing-exposed transaction.Based on a recent report, this could affect more than 300 million users of unhosted CVC wallets insofar as a user’s personal information may be reported if their wallet is deemed by a covered financial institution to be involved in a covered transaction. Because there is no restriction on the number of wallets an individual may have, this number may overestimate the number of unique individuals whose personal information may be required. To the extent that previously reported estimates regarding the distribution of CVC mixer users by type—privacy-oriented versus abusers of anonymity—are usable for inference, special measure one could require the reporting of personal information in connection with up to approximately 66 (87) percent of CVC mixer deposits in the absence of any other identifiable connection to high risk (illicit) activity.Source https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/federal_register_notices/2023-10-19/FinCEN_311MixingNPRM_FINAL.pdf",
