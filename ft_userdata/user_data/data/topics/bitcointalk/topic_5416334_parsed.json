  "content": "We have two options in NE Ohio - Fixed rate of $ .065 per KW and unlimited. Fixed rate can be locked in for 3 years. I believe it will be around $ 160/month I am inquiring on the term for unlimited and believe it is one year.Unlimited rate is $ 119. Has anyone dealt with unlimited rates?Wouldn't it make sense to go with unlimited for a year then for with a fixed rate ( Might have to find other supplier ? )Thanks,Ronald",

Surcharges, fees, resource recovery assessments and so on.If you can get .065 for 3 years it's a fairly good deal, but if they can still mess with the price it's not that good anymore and the other options may be better.-Dave",

I mean how many miners you can able to run at $119 unlimited rates?One s19/pro can consume around $160 every month for a $0.065 rate so if choose the unlimited rate you can save more but the problem is if your miner can run stable.Both of them have pros and cons it's your choice if you know that your miner can run stable then choose unlimited but if not I guess fixed rate would be your last choice.",

I'm leaning towards the fixed rate plan for 3 years as I don't see how they can deliver unlimited electricity for that rate. If so, I'll leave the heat on with the windows open this winter....... I'll update what I find in the fine print once it arrives.Thanks,Ronald",

If you know it's legit then it's a good offer but I'm curious about how they generate power and why they offer unlimited power without minimum wattage or how many miners they are allowed to run at $119/month.The fixed rate is a fair price and it is I think safe than the unlimited offer.",

The question you need to ask would be, what is the wire/breaker they are going to feed into your place? a 10 amp set up? then ya maybe, you will be capped by the main breaker at 2.2kwh which is a max of 1,584kwh a month, which is $102.96 at 0.065$ per KwH, so ya a good deal for them, 20 amp? a good deal for you, of course, Â all of that only holds true after having read the contract.Also, this contract might be for home use only, hardly good for 2-3 miners, the numbers don't line up here, \"the devil's in the detail\".",
