Learn from established members, the more you read their posts the more you know better. Use bitcoin on wallets like Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Trezor and the ones you have interest in. The experience you have about the wallets will help you. But what that matters most is for you to learn from what established members that are receiving merit are posting.",

      "body": "If I can deduce from your post, what i understand is the fact that you are looking for a way to grow in ranks. Having made up to 30 post and still lack merits. First I sniped into your post history and saw that you’re mostly active in the bitcoin discussion board and, the politics and society board. The former board actually gains attention but that if you engage or create meaningful threads and not making repeated threads, as for the latter it doesn’t get much attention by merit source because most of the topics there are off bitcoin related and some merit source deem it not worthy for merit. To add to what Charles-Tim has said I would just advise you to post less and gain more knowledge about the forum and bitcoin itself. Once you acquire this little knowledge you can be able to make contributions by either helping people with there questions or create threads that is beneficial to the forum. Been eager to grow in ranks only gets you to break some forum rules that could possibly get you banned, be calm and learn",

Forcing yourself to rank up for that you must me keen of making post instead of reading others that is probably where you are doing wrong.",

Why is that so? This community is so rich with discussions about Bitcoin and Altcoin and if you want to grow then you have to explore other boards as well.Just be yourself, don't put to much pressure on yourself, and as I have said, it's better if you will go around and play with this community first. Just continue to accumulate knowledge here. You may want to to bookmark topics that are interesting to you and then comeback to read it.And if there is something not clear to you, then ask, simply as that.",

As a newbie remove the mindset of ranking up at a blink of an eye, one of the things should do is to study and follow the higher members footsteps, You can also search for forum rules to know more about guidelines as regards on how you can make a quality post.",

I  can see from your post that you are putting some effort to make meaningful posts. I checked through your post history and I just gave you your first merit. You need to be dedicated to learning from others on the forum and do your research. Merit shouldn't be your target but how to learn and contribute meaningfully to the forum. This is because you will get enough merit if your post answers a question, add value or bring something new to the forum. Don't restrict yourself to one or two boards, because with a dedication to learning you can contribute to more boards. You have come to a school, so learning is the first and last rule.",
