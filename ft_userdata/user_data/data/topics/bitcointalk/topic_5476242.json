      "body": "Is there any particular reason why you promote this company? I have nothing against them and it's a great product, but there are many other options that allow you to do the same thing. Maybe newbies would like to know all of them? Choose what is convenient for you, for example there are plays that you can etch by scratching your seed. There are plates that you stamp with special tools, even reusable ones like keystone where you can rearrange the letters into different words when you decide to make a new wallet. Never used these things myself, to me these are all gadgets and rather than a steel plate or a drum for $100 I'd prefer to buy a hardware wallet.",

      "body": "Metal Bitcoin Storage ReviewsMetal Bitcoin Seed Storage Stress Test (Round III), with CryptoSteelCryptosteel Capsule reviewQuoteCryptosteel Capsule:Claims to be extremely durable - fireproof up to 1400C/2500F. Shockproof. Waterproof. Stainless.This was pretty easy to assemble other than the final retention pin, though unlike pretty much every other style of device it's fairly annoying to read back due to the orientation and spacing of the tiles. I also noted that it comes with a very large assortment of tiles, which makes it more versatile for potential use cases.Performed admirably - I didn't even have any trouble reopening the capsule by hand.No acid entered the capsule. Even if it had, I doubt any data loss would have occurred.This was an interesting result. I gave it a 50/50 chance of bending and it held up pretty well to several tons of pressure, but eventually gave in a bit to my 20 ton press. The reason the result is interesting is that I didn't anticipate the consequences of bending the tube. Obviously the data inside is still intact, but how are we going to read it? Because the end of the rod is permanently affixed to the screw-on cap, it's now impossible to unscrew the device.I don't have the tools on hand to attempt opening the device, but I expect you'd want to somehow cut through the tube just below where the threads of the cap end. But that's not all! Because there is only a retention clip on the opposite end of the rod, you'd then have to be extremely careful while pulling the rod out of the tube to ensure that the tiles don't fall off, causing data loss. Because this is clearly a suboptimal Schrödinger's cat type of situation with the potential for data loss, I feel the need to deduct a few points.",

You can use a hardware wallet and still engrave your seed phrase on a steel if you prefer this method to writing it down on paper.",

If you don't know, rust (oxide) forms when it comes into contact with oxygen (the oil will prevent this from happening).",

Seems like a lot could go wrong here:1) You accidentally spelled one or more words wrong while sliding in the discs2) You accidentally assemble one or more words in the wrong order.3) While retrieving your seed phrase, you accidentally allow all the letters to slide out all at once into one big pile, making it impossible to reassemble your words. Which would be extremely easy to do.In either of these scenarios (especially 2 or 3) you are screwed as it would be impossible to put your seed phrase back together, which is the same as losing it.It would make more sense to have each word on one disc, with a number on the disc indicating the order of the word, so in case the discs get mixed up you will always have the correct order of the words.

That is the inherent problem when working with a large number of physical pieces of something very small.While handling them one or more could roll away somewhere, with or without you being aware of it, and become lost forever. Little objects have a tendency to do that. So you thought you had them all stacked and stored together, but one day when you go to retrieve your seed, you discover that one or more are actually missing.To me it would be a lot safer to use a single or double steel plate with your words stamped on them. Simply punch the letters onto the plate.",

I won't say that it's totally useless but if someone unfortunately losses or or two letters out of the thing or makes that mistakes during saving of the seed phrase on it then the person most probably will end up losing his wallet. I believe that this thing can be a good alternative for the ones who are scared of natural disasters or living things that can harm the seed phrases, but we can better make a sealed steal box and save inscribe our seed phrase on a steel or copper sheet and then save that cooper sheet inside that box.

Meanse if we keep some plates wrongly so this can make issue. So we should store like this but important thing is that we should write seed phrase on a diary on a piece of paper. And this should be stored at most safer place.Second one member also showed that this stainless steel can be melt at certain level of temperature. Or can be bend with heavy weight. So this should be safe at that place where the fire chances are zero. By the way thanks for sharing and other members who just shared their thoughts regarding this topic and increase my knowledge.",

Do not lose your seed phrase and if you have good opsec you should always know where you kept it. Take note that you should have more than one backup of your seed phrase and if you ever lose one backup, consider it that the wallet has been compromised and you should sweep your funds immediately into another wallet.",

Offline seed storage media like this provide strong security and are recommended over storing online. The steel in question is not only for Bitcoin, users who store other coins such as Ethereum can also arrange each letter according to their seed phrase.OP can correct me if I'm wrong.For the OP, has this steel gone through a testing process such as how long is it fire resistant in the event of a fire? How heavy would it be if there was a flood? Can it be carried away by the strong current of the flood?",
