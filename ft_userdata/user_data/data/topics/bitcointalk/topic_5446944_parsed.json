No changes have been made, local Bitcoin node is running as always.Last time I ran this successfully was not too long ago, either - a month or two ago, tops.I think this may have something to do with those image files filling up the blockchain recently?Armory version 0.96.3.99-beta-1c7f3e91dfHere is the log:Code:Log file opened at 16:01:23.000: C:\\Coins\\Armory/dbLog.txt-INFO  - 16:01:23.000: (..\\main.cpp:32) Running on 8 threads-INFO  - 16:01:23.000: (..\\main.cpp:33) Ram usage level: 50-INFO  - 16:01:23.000: (..\\BlockUtils.cpp:915) blkfile dir: C:\\Coins\\Bitcoin\\blocks-INFO  - 16:01:23.000: (..\\BlockUtils.cpp:916) lmdb dir: C:\\Coins\\Armory\\databases-INFO  - 16:01:23.000: (..\\lmdb_wrapper.cpp:388) Opening databases...-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (c:\\users\\goat\\code\\armory3\\cppforswig\\BDM_Server.h:263) Listening on port 58804-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (..\\BitcoinP2P.cpp:947) Connected to Bitcoin node-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (..\\nodeRPC.cpp:57) RPC connection established-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (..\\BlockDataManagerConfig.cpp:895) waiting on node sync: 0.999999%-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (..\\nodeRPC.cpp:346) Node is ready-INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (..\\BlockUtils.cpp:1108) Executing: doInitialSyncOnLoad-ERROR - 16:01:25.062: (..\\BDM_Server.cpp:1327) Accept failed with error number: 10038-ERROR - 16:01:25.062: (..\\BDM_Server.cpp:1328) error message is: Unknown error",

And IIRC the old version cannot sign the transactions created by newer versions unfortunately.Do you happen to remember which port ArmoryDB is listening on?The tx signing message format was extended in 0.96 to support nested segwit scripts. This means, if you are trying to spend coins from a nested segwit script, Armory versions prior to 0.96 will not be able to sign the transaction. My recommendation is for you to update anyways, seeing your online version is already of the 0.96 family.QuoteDo you happen to remember which port ArmoryDB is listening on?You are letting ArmoryQt automate your DB process, so it randomizes the port used. As you can see in your logs, this time around it was:Code: -INFO  - 16:01:23.062: (c:\\users\\goat\\code\\armory3\\cppforswig\\BDM_Server.h:263) Listening on port 58804 10038 is a Windows socket error code. It happens in either of 2 cases: the client is trying to connect to this port but there is no service running behind it (meaning the server never started or crashed), or the server is trying to listen on this port, but some other process already bound it.",
