I am globaly satisfied of the hashrate marketplace, I am a little disappointed about Nicehash actualy. Doesn't your Easymining program only serve to artificially inflate the price of rented Eh/s? The hashrate used by Easymining is always rented well above the average price on your site. This increases the auction price no ? I mean if you rent hashrate to newbies, I agree that you need to take a fee, but to guarantee your Easyminers to have a constant hashrate, you place orders with super expensive price per Eh/s. Other thing, I bought some Easymining packs to discover what you are proposing. In my previous position I had to analyse the hashrate rental's market. I bought a lot of Easymining because of this.  The screen showing your luck, is wrong. Almost every time the screen will show you \"you submitted a share of x T difficulty, that's not possible.

      "body": "Živjo! The graphs that show the luck percentage are not necessary accepted shares. They are solutions that were on a way of being a correct solution.For example, 50% luck means that you \"solved\" 50% of the job. If the solution to the job equals to 10 zeroes (0000000000), that means that you got 5 of those right (000005ha72). But the required difficulty might need 7 zeroes (00000007sa). That is how a simple way of explaining how the graph displaying percentages is calculated.Quote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on January 23, 2023, 02:07:51 PMžívijo @Nicehash  I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you directly.I have rented a lot of hashrate from you.

Because:Probably not, but I don't think it's a fair way to measure the success of these solo runs, it's safe to assume that most people will lose money gambling for a solo block, just like how most people lose money gambling in casinos or buying lottery tickets, it's only a fraction of those people end up making a huge amount of money compared to what they spend.In the part you quoted, it doesn't mean that everyone has been joining the solo runs since 2015, someone might have joined in 2020, paid 0.001 BTC, and ended up with 0.1 BTC and that's it, someone else might have paid a total of 5 BTC and received nothing, this is how gambling simply works.Now with respect to buying ordinary state/country lottery tickets, solo mining is more fun, you have the numbers to watch, unlike the ordinary lottery where the fun only lasts for a few minutes during the draw, also, it's a lot more transparent,  a president of some country can't magically win the lottery.",
