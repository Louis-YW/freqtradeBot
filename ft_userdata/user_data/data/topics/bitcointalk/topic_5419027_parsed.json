      "body": "Quote from: shumansky on November 01, 2022, 07:54:03 AMFor further questions ask me on Telegram: @SumichrastYou started well, but wanted to end it with suspicion. Why anyone should contact you on telegram? This can later lead to manipulation. I will advice people not to contact you. This is a forum to learn and to help people, all that is pertaining to the bots can be discussed on this thread.OKX has a bot, but I have not even used it before, so this kind of topic is not for me. I do trading manually and I do not have to use both for DCA.I checked Pionex exchange, the exchange is having a total trading volume of over $500 million, ranked 108. It should be a good exchange. But I will like people that are using it to let other people know if it is a good and non shady exchange, or maybe otherwise.",
