  "content": "I used to own 4 Asic miners antminer s9 and at the beginning of this bear market I sold them all with other graphic cards I owned for Eth mining, right now I am set to buy an Antminer s19 pro with 100Tb hashing power from the same customer from China. The last price for this Asic is 2299$ and my question, is 2299$ a good price for 100 TB on Bitcoin network in this bear market? Is this a good buy? Do not worry about the source as I have been doing this business with this same man since 2018. All I want to know is per hashrate wise, is this good?",

It is more efficient and it would be better to be used to join a mining pool than less efficient electricity consuming old miners.Do calculation more on your electricity, it is very important. If the electricity you are using is expensive, you should not consider buying it. There will be more profit during bull market as you said you were mining before, it is worth buying.How I wish electricity is constant where I live, but not. This has been one of the miners I have in mind because it is better than the old miners that consume more electricity.",

I have good power bank too but with the power consumption of an s19 pro the bank up will only last me up to 4 hours.",

      "body": "The Antminer S19 Pro is a ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miner manufactured by Bitmain, a company that specializes in producing cryptocurrency mining equipment. It is designed to mine Bitcoin and other SHA-256 based cryptocurrencies.The Antminer S19 Pro has a hash rate of 110 TH/s, which means that it can perform 110 trillion hashes per second. It also has an energy efficiency of 34.5 J/TH, which is relatively low compared to other miners in its class.It has three fans to dissipate heat and its built-in web management portal allows for easy configuration and monitoring of the miner. It also supports the setting of the frequency and the voltage of the hash board and the power supply, which allows users to optimize their mining performance.The Antminer S19 Pro is considered as a high-performance miner that is capable of generating significant profits, but like any mining equipment, its profitability will depend on the current mining difficulty, network hash rate, electricity cost, and cryptocurrency prices.Overall, the Antminer S19 Pro is a powerful and efficient miner that is suitable for experienced miners who are looking to maximize their mining profits.",
