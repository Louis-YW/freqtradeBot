Merit if you earn it from your posts, it shows your posts have quality or good quality, not zero value posts.This topic does not belong to Bitcoin Discussion, please move it to Meta board.",

Most of the newbies aren't contributing anything to the forum, but they are making such posts to grab merits from reputed members so they could rank up in short span of time. I don't think that anything is wrong in ranking up, but when there is not much effort but use of AI and or rephrased content then that's the worst way of ranking up.There are some noteworthy newbies who have contributed good content to the forum and yes the generous members support those newbies to rank up as soon as possible because they know better the contribution of those newbies who could be valuable members of the forum in future. The forum and its reputed members have shown generosity towards newbies and are willing to give them merits if their posts are high quality and could help someone with the crypto-currencies and specifically Bitcoin.",

Personally, I have not seen any benefit, except for creating topics about newcomers in topics that should not contain such information.Who are you trying to fool, OP? Flashing new threads all over the forum don't make you an important person. Newbies are different. If you want an opinion on yourself, then a few more threads like this, and you'll be labeled a useless shitposter.",

It could also be their writing skills that explain a theoretical concept in layman's terms. Or maybe they build bitcoin projects that solves realistic problems experienced by the community, it could be simple building a bitcoin node, or bitcoin web application.You can also look at the posting history of accounts that have been nominated for the \"Discovery of the Year\" award in the Bitcointalk community awards. These accounts are typically nominated for their genuine interest in learning about Bitcoin and their contributions to the bitcoin community from the get-go until now!!- Results 2021 Bitcointalk Community Awards üèÜ- Results 2022 Bitcointalk Community Awards üèÜ",

However, on these topics, it seems that you are not interested in seeing the answers to the questions raised. No one is born knowing everything right away, we all start as newbies, but gradually gain experience. And it's rather strange if someone comes to the forum, actively communicates on it and at the same time does not gain experience and does not become more knowledgeable. Therefore, your topics in the complex look like some kind of incomprehensible provocation.If you are a newbie and want to achieve something, study the topic in which you want to develop, ask questions about this topic, study the answers, and in time you will be able to reach new horizons. And if you focus on learning what it's like to be a newbie, you'll still stay a newbie.",

It's very easy to figure out which category a particular user falls into by the way he communicates and discussed crypto-related issues. Your registration date from a few weeks ago shows that you are a forum newbie. Your post history shows that you are also inexperienced in crypto. Basically, you are a double newbie. I don't consider merit count as an indicator of someone's knowledge. It can be, but merits are also about how much the community or the people giving them like you. We have people on this forum who are knowledgeable but prone to quarrels. Many members of the community don't like them, have them on ignore, and don't merit their posts. However, that doesn't make them newbies or unknowledgeable individuals.",

I see that there are several Hero/Legendary users who make posts that have no value and seem mere formalities.
