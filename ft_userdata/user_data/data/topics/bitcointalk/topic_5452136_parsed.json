Don't equalize everyone as one and charge them equal. Is that even possible though? You can probably suggest or make some commits if you have some idea on how to do that. At the end of the day miners are driven by profit most of the time, that's just how the market works. If anything I believe the recent spike is just because people find a new toy and would probably stop dumping a lot of money just to print token when they realize the demand is not that high. The market will balance itself, even at the time of writing the fee is coming down gradually.",

If a miner can collect 1Btc in fees from a block, why would he opt to only collect 0.1 Btc in fees by selecting fees with a lower fee (in sats/vbyte) instead of the ones with a higher fee? If would make no economic sense for them... They invested a lot, they have ASIC's, they have mining rooms, they sometimes need to pay wages, rent and taxes... It's not that it's impossible for them to do this, it would just make little sense to do so (from their point of view)",

My simple question is that why the Miners increase the Mining fee and generalize it to everyone both who what to transfer small unit of bitcoin and those who want to transfer big unit are all the sharing the same transaction fees. Why?Actually, the miners have limited powers and they can not increase the fee. The fee is basically set the by the one who executes the transaction. As you know that due to Ordinals the Bitcoin blockchain is currently congested and there are many transactions in queue. In order to execute the transactions the user has to select very high fees.The block size of Bitcoin is limited to 1MB and because of that a miner can execute limited number of transactions in a block. The miners on other hand are dependent on the fee set by the one who executes the transaction and if the fee set is higher than others the miners would love to add that transaction into the next block. Miners are also adding the transactions in the blocks to earn money and the higher fee is a blessing for them.QuoteThe matter now is getting out of hand because people are getting starve because they can't collect their coins and sell it to feed. Miners should consider the category of transactions. Let the lower transaction should be charged less and the very big whale transactions should be done according to the unit. Don't equalize everyone as one and charge them equal. That is only possible is miners are willing to add the transactions with low fee into the next block which is unlikely to happen as miners prefer higher fees because their main goal is to generate as much revenue from mining operations as possible. That would be a great thing if miners give preference to the transactions with lower fees but unfortunately that's going to happen anytime.",

This is how the mining mechanism works. It all depends on the network, If there is a lot of traffic on the network, then most likely the fees will increase until it cools down and decreases again.Although I understand your point, I don't know if it's feasible to split transactions into categories to make it fair for all people but I feel like miners won't bother to mine transactions with low fees since they come with lower financial benefits for them. They'll just focus on higher fee transactions, and that's fair and more beneficials for them. For people who want to send transactions when Bitcoin's fees are high, they can exchange it for an altcoin like LTC, which has lower fees, and then send the transaction temporarily until Bitcoin fees stabilize and become low again.",
