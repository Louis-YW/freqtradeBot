Although this experience is one of the few and sorry for that guy that has to experience it but, I'm sure that many are learning from his experience.Maybe have a sequence and jumble the combination but I think that someone who doesn't have a strong memory might forget it. At least make a pattern that you are the only one that knows it.",

Although there are some exceptional situations when I can understand that someone has such a backup with them (for example, when moving), everything else is a completely unnecessary risk. Regarding the actions of the police, I know that it is legal for them to record the entire procedure, but how legal is it for such recordings to be published on social networks? Isn't there some kind of data protection, especially if you are not guilty of anything and just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time?The only thing that comes to mind is adding a passphrase to the seed, and in that case that data should be saved separately so that it cannot be exposed to this kind of situation.",

      "body": "Be honest if i imagine being in the same situation. so I'm also a little confused when it comes to finding solutions to the problem of storing seed phrases safely when we are in a situation where we have to carry them with us when traveling like moving or something like that.the solution I think of if I want to move house. and of course have to carry everything including a spare sheed phrase of my crypto wallet.maybe when I'm at home then it's safe when I write it on a piece of paper and keep it in a drawer with a sturdy lock.but when we will move and take it with us. then I will do the following steps.- take a book of novels / stories or similar thick reading books.- took the paper that had my wallet's seed phrase written on it.- I will start copying into the novel/thick reading book in the order of 1 word per sheet. It doesn't have to be the front page, we can start from the middle page. for example from page 20. if there are 12 seed phrases, then I will write 1 word on page 20, 1 word on page 22, 1 word on page 24, and so on until the 12 words have been copied at the novel/thick reading book.- after making sure you copied correctly. then burn the initial paper that contains our wallet's seed phrase.- and now we just need to keep the novel containing the seed phrase on the way safely. I'm pretty sure no one wants to open the page after page of the novel we brought. and if it opens it will certainly be cursory.second wayWe can save our wallet's seed phrase into a novel by bolding or underlining every word that matches our wallet's seed phrase. I don't recommend marking it with a highlighter because it's too obvious.that's the only solution i could think of. hopefully help in keeping our crypto wallet safe on the way.",

We ultimately need to be careful not to expose ourselves to an attack all in the process of trying to secure ourselves from one, having your seed phrase written all over you is pretty danger because the only security to it is when your clothes always remains on you, whereas there are several scenarios that could warrant that same clothe off the body maybe when swimming, or having a summer hangout, there is much to do when it comes to securing the seed phrase because it's our key that needed ultimate privacy and inscription on the body isn't the best method acceptable for me, there are other ways we can use a metallic iron sheet to inscribe the keys and have them locked on a personal vault.",

Is it a total bullshit or what? If something like this might work how can it be strongly improved?",
