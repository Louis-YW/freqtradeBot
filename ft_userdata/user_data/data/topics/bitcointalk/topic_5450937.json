      "body": "That's a very nice-looking site I must say. A few things I noticed though:As mentioned above, I'm also not sure if these numbers are real or if these are real data you're retrieving. If they are, then It doesn't look like the site is functional. For example, It says there are 138 Python jobs, but when browsing, you only get a few.You should also consider adding filters for salary, job position, full-time/part-time, skills required, etc. Tags are not enough. It's currently impossible to look for Python jobs that are part-time. Something else that would be nice to have, is alerts, to notify users via email or telegram whenever there's a new job offering that meets their skillset or preferences.I'm also curious, where are you retrieving this information from? directly from the source, or is it from some other sites like Indeed and Glassdoor?",

      "body": "Not sure about your question, but I will answer based on the two friends above   We are commenting on some more information about the job we are recruiting. I see that you have the information, but they do not have a common format, the jobs have many different tags, but I think each should have some general information such as specialization, working time, working form, salary,... I mean, the general information of a job should remain, after that, the tags will be used to add other information for use by search filters. Currently, you are only using tags, there is no common format, this will affect the choice of readers. I think you should consider this",

      "body": "It looks like most of your job listings are taken from Greenhouse. Are you using bots to grab the job listing from Greenhouse directly or use another aggregator to list them? Some listings also don't list any detailed requirements and only provide the company e-mail address to send an e-mail to, I guess you just grab them directly from the company itself?Btw, I tried to see if I can post a new job listing on your website. Does listing really cost $100 per job/30 days? I'm not sure how expensive/cheap that is compared to other platforms, but if it were me I'd look for a cheaper option first.",
