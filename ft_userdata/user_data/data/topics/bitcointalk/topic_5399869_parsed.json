  "content": "Hello there. I´m running a 741 I bought used off ebay, and ran it for a few months, since mid December 2021. Fan got busted, was replaced with another one one month later, not exactly the original and started to reboot when weather was too hot. I wasn´t aware of the log (newbie), but while I was working in the research, the right (second) PMU board lighted red LED and stopped working. I disassembled the whole thing, and took both the hashing board and the PMU to a technician. He identified a 6 pins integrated circuit in the PMU as the possible failure. Anyone could please led me to a place to buy this part? I´m in Venezuela, but have a US post address and can receive shipping no problem. This machines are one of my income means, hence my nick \"survivor\". I would greatly appreciate any help. There are some local companies that will fix parts like boards but I do prefer (our weather in the range of 23°C-32/34°Cis a little bit hot to do some overclocking unless you use liquid cooling) to get a new part to keep the device running as long as possible.Look forward to hear from you!",

That is indeed my idea, to get it new if possible. My friend is getting a magnifying glass large enough to check the IC part model number, as his USB microscope got busted. I will check ZeusBTC right away!Gracias amigo!",
