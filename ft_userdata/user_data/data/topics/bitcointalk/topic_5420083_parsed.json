  "content": "There is a new clipboard malware dubbed LAPLAS and it target cryptocurrency users.And it is being drop through what researchers called SmokeLoader, wherein the victims are being distributed through email campaigns vs via malicious documents such as Word/PDF documents. So that is the first red flag, if you see emails coming from unknown sources, delete it immediately.And the new Laplas clipper:QuoteClipper is a family of malicious programs that targets cryptocurrency users. This malware hijacks a cryptocurrency transaction by swapping a victim’s wallet address with the wallet address owned by TAs. When a user tries to make a payment from their cryptocurrency account, it redirects the transaction to TAs account instead of their original recipient. Clipper malware performs this swap by monitoring the clipboard of the victim’s system, where copied data is stored. Whenever the user copies data, the clipper verifies if the clipboard data contains any cryptocurrency wallet addresses. If found, the malware replaces it with the TAs wallet address, resulting in the victim’s financial loss.Laplas is new clipper malware that generates a wallet address similar to the victim’s wallet address. The victim will not notice the difference in the address, which significantly increases the chances of successful clipper activity.and the target cryptos are:And what makes it dangerous is that this Clipboard malware has the capability to used pre or post fix, so it's really hard for us if we are not going to double or triple check the address that we are going to send our cryptos.https://blog.cyble.com/2022/11/02/new-laplas-clipper-distributed-by-smokeloader/",

Deletion alone achieves nothing except freeing up storage space in case it is limited to a very small amount of data that can be stored on e-mail.QuoteLaplas is new clipper malware that generates a wallet address similar to the victim’s wallet address. The victim will not notice the difference in the address, which significantly increases the chances of successful clipper activity.This is nothing new, because even before such programs had the function of generating a coin address as similar as possible to deceive those who check only the beginning or end of the address. I always check the coin address using the hardware wallet, and for each larger amount I do it several times before I click on the final send button.",

      "body": "I read about it a few days ago, and commented on it on my local board. In a fashion similar to other types of malware, Laplas Clipper can also be hired by other thugs to use it, paying a certain fee for the time they plan on using it. As suggested, the concept of \"new\" here doesn’t apply to the malware type itself. I figure it’s more in line with expressing the fact that it’s a new kid on the block (as in \"another one\"), albeit not unique.The articles depicts that the similar type of address is generated by the malware through a call to a server (GetAddress()), though it does not depict just how close the address can get to be. The software description on figure 3 indicates that the user can choose to match the prefix or postfix of the original address, yet it does not indicate how many characters it can match. Figure 9 provides an example where the first four characters of the address are matched (not that difficult, since it was a bc1 type address, as well as the last three. Aside from that, nothing looks remotely similar, so it doesn’t seem better than other instances we might haver read about. As marketing tends to do, this case might oversell expectations to the potential customer of the malware software: \"It will generate a similar address and the person will not notice the difference!\" (they state on figure 3). Obviously another danger lurking around though.",

But regardless, it should be taken seriously, either what device's OS the anyone is using.Windows, Android and iOS are not immune, all have weaknesses, and scammers who make malware have also targeted what devices they want to attack. Usually, Windows users often become victims of some malware that will attack the system as described by the OP, namely Laplasp malware, new clipboard malware, and some malware that can infect files so they can be locked. Therefore, to avoid and prevent malware or viruses from infecting you, use an antivirus as initial protection so you don't get infected.",
