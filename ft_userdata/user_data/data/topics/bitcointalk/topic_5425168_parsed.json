  "content": "Ok...  November wasn't really that great for BTC.  To recap, it was doing great the first couple of days and looked like it was finally starting to break out and trend up higher until the FTX fiasco spoiled the party.  But then around November 22, the market seemed not to care anymore and started going up again.The chart below doesn't really look all that good but if you have been following the price action everyday it feels like there aren't a whole lot of sellers left.  So hence the poll.",

      "body": "From technical point of view there is nothing bullish in current price action. We just broke 18k support and can't get above it for last 23 days consolidating in death zone. Only the fact that we are very oversold, 1 year in extreame fear, and survived many bancrupties without leaving \"dead zone\" to the sounth makes me feal that there is not much space to go lower. Monthly RSI was never lower in history of BTC. Its possible its not the bottom. Its possible we will dump to 15k, 12k maybe lower. But it does not change the fact that its cheap now, and its good time to start to accumulate. At current price its like 20% short opportunity or 5x long. Answer is simple.",

And it's better that we don't put too much high expectation, so that it won't be a disappointment in the end.So most likely we might see $10k-$13k as the bottom in this bear cycle.",

Heck, we might hear another exchanges just collapsing on the pressures of the bear market 2023. And so as much as we wanted to think that we have hit the bottom already, we might see the worst next year, just saying.",

      "body": "I have chosen no.That's why I believe we won't see a lower BTC price than in November when the market is volatile enough that BTC hits the $15400 price point. maybe that's the lowest price for november or this year. we must be optimistic that the price will soar when the market has strong support. fud news and so on does pose a formidable shadowy threat to holders but if they are able to hold their own under these circumstances then they will manage to see even higher prices next year.maybe the selling action if seen from the chart will continue but it won't be too strong even when we enter the end of this year's holidays. the big whales coming in this month I'm sure they will continue to improve their portfolio before the big pumps come along. we should be able to see this situation as a moment to make an entry.",

And we still have the war in the background that has really affected everyone. So I guess the worst has yet to come not just for crypto, but for the rest of financial market next year.",

      "body": "I voted yes because the bitcoin fundamentals are unchanged and on-chain data looks good. The problem with relying on this data is that we're seeing only half of the big picture. Bitcoin can be hit from the inside or the outside and it's been hit from the outside most of this year with chain data looking strong at 30k, then at 20k and again at 18-19k. Now at 16k it's pretty much the same - miners are mining, holders are holding, transactions are going through. The problem is that the holders and buyers cannot handle the volume that these big investment funds were bringing. We're talking about companies and investment funds that were slowly buying bitcoin in 2020 after the covid crash and dumped it all at once in June and then again in November. People like us here can be bullish and say that we're buying because we understand bitcoin and how cheap it is, but how much can we buy? 1k? 10k? These people are dumping 10 million all at once, even at a loss, because they want to balance and close their books for the year. Bitcoin isn't crashing because it's weak and people lost trust but because scammers are getting flushed out. At some point we'll run out of them and I feel like the time is now.",

Anyone investing in Bitcoin now, should be ready to leave their investment for a long time. It could be 4 to 5 years. With what I am seeing in the chart, bitcoin could go below $10k before 2024 bull run. Though I am seeing from the yearly time frame, someone on the monthly time frame could be seeing another thing, but in the end, I am not seeing any green in this chart. This is a hard time for bitcoin, and I see harder time coming.Many weeks hands would be laid off and bitcoin is actually in there verge of restarting and making new millionaires.",

But those past historical logs can tell us something though for the future, it might be right or wrong, really up to us how to interpret this data.As for the data being shown by the OP, it seems very negative to me, that's why I voted for no as well.I'm thinking that since next year will still be bearish, so meaning there is a chance that the price will still plummet and dive. Just a matter what will be the price range, it could be $10k as the worst drop price.",

For me I do think they may start quantitative of easing (QE) maybe do lower 50 basis points(bps) this December, and that would a kinda ease much pressure a bit on the price of Bitcoin.",

But currently BTC again struggling under the 17k USD mark. According to me, let's not break our hopes. Lets all pray that BTC anyhow touch the 20k usd mark by the end of this month.
