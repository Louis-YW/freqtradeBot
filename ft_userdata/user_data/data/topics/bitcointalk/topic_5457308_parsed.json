With reason fear of that happening, i tried to dig into the bitcoin price history data at CMC, after i got the data, i found that there was some missing data there.I would say this weeks rice is actually based on the hype from the numerous institutions applying or go into bitcoin  ETFs and also the news about some countries creating their own exchanges. But this shouldn’t be a thing of worry because this and so much hype is definitely going to suffice before the the halving. But based on bitcoin past history’s, this current situations are just creating FOMO. After the hype us died down bitcoin will go back to normal. But my advice is do not wait until any moment or anticipate any lows, just buy when you have funds for it and probably use the DCA method when doing so.

Any reasonable investor should get into the market now and holding for a long time would definitely yield positive results.Compared to the last all time high, the current price is just a mere tip of an iceberg.",

We can say that the price will be $40,000 $50,000 dollars, but the price will not increase more than that. The same thing, if you buy $30,000 immediately after halving and sell after a year has passed, the possibility that you will sell at levels close to 100,000 dollars seems very likely. Choosing the perfect timing is stupidity for those who want long-term trading, and it is a matter of preference for short-term investment if you have another investment with a good return.Investment is related to planning and economic thinking more than luck.",

With BTC halving the block reward and supply is reduced, and because BTC is the most useful crypto, the chances of demand increasing is always high, so the price is expected to increase. But like i said, it may or may not happen, and nobody should buy BTC solely because the halving is near, but because they believe in BTC.",

The current price still makes sense to buy, considering the price of Bitcoin can increase from this year until after the halving. So you should take this opportunity to buy more Bitcoins.But if you are short minded to take the opportunity to buy low and sell high, that's also okay because it all depends on what you want.

I'd say invest no matter what price it is as long as it is below the previous ATH, and should also be an amount you can endure seeing whenever there would be a dump in the market. The market price won't continuously and consistently increase therefore we should always expect for a dump to happeb randomly or anytime. Waiting for its price to go down that much might either be a waste of time or the best thing to do. The market is unpredictable and waiting for its lowest might make you left with nothing if incase a sudden pump occurs.",
