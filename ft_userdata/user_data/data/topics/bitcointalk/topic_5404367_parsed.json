What is the safe procedure with mobile wallet users.Warning, this may be a little advanced for newbies, especially if not tech savvy!For you have a computer or laptop? Or do you have somebody in your family who can help? Do you have 2 USB sticks (you can do also with one and some patience)? Or can you borrow one for a 30-60 minutes job?Get Tails OS onto an USB stick, boot from that (with no internet at all), run Electrum from there. Create a new wallet.Write the seed (or the first address' private key) down to paper.You need in Electrum to see addresses: View->Addresses. Copy/paste the first address from the wallet into a new file into second USB (or you can write to another piece of paper).Make sure you've written everything correctly, optionally you can do it by trying to recover to a new wallet and see if the (first) address is matching.Tip: make sure you write different 1, I, l since it's a common mistake.Now make multiple copies of that seed or private key (copy by hand, not xerox!) and keep them safe in multiple safe locations. Maybe laminate them.Reboot the computer/laptop into the original PC, you can clean the USB stick (GParted for Linux or Macrorit Partition Expert Free Edition for Windows should be fit for the job) and format like new (keep in mind that if you started Tails without persistence - the default mode - then you don't have anything important on that USB).Now you can send your coins from Android to the newly created address.That address never touched the internet and should be safe.You can look on https://mempool.space how much money you have on that address.You basically made yourself safely a paper wallet.

I put all my crypto wallets under Knox secured folder and the good thing about this is if someone tries to root and hack your Knox secure folder it will automatically stop running and all files and wallets under the secured folder you can no longer access all data.It means Knox automatically locks your data to prevent unauthorized access. If you are using a different phone model and you want to use your phone as your hardware wallet then you can do that too you can use your phone as your cold storage and never connect it to the internet. You can still sign a transaction with your offline wallet(Cold storage) from your phone through QR code scanning. You just need an extra device for generating a unsign transaction either a laptop or phone with a watch-only wallet and can able to scan QR codes. So all of your raw unsigned/signed transactions are transferred through your camera and from generated QR codes.",

Your worry is valid because there are malware that really attacks you with copy pasting of addresses and the hackers address will replace yours. First, don't save your private keys/seeds on your mobile device. Keep it simple in a written form and keep that in a place that's safe and only you know it at least.Second, a mobile wallet is what you'll use since you don't have much option. Research on what's the most recommended one, if you're for a multi currency wallet, there are plenty of them but make sure that they provide private keys for their users.Lastly, as what I've said in the first sentence. Be vigilant and don't send quickly, before you send a transaction, check it as many times as you can if the address you'll be sending it out is correct.",

I would tell you that before spending a penny more on \"investments\" you should do a lot of research and not put money into something because you've seen the Youtuber of the moment, but as impulsive as I think you are I doubt you'll listen to me. Having funds that you're afraid to lose on an Android mobile is just one more disaster out of everything you've been doing lately. Stop, reflect and try to do things right from now on.",

There maybe malware clipboard if we are clicking copying and then pasting and this means that the private keys copied and pasted may be different.Aditionaly, saving our private keys online is not safe enough. Not only about malware but also hack probability. Commonly, an app or certain platform has print options in their platform or wallet.

Of course, the level of security is lower for a hot wallet compared to a cold wallet. But for the meantime, while you have yet to secure yourself a hardware wallet, it's best to take note of that. Also, avoid saving vital information in your phone as you're probably connecting it online every now and then and undesirable entities could get access to those files. So instead of copy-pasting your private keys in your mobile device, it's best to just manually write it down on a piece of paper, make several copies, and keep them in different safe places.",
