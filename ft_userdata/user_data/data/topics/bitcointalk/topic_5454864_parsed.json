Down over 2 million dollars lifetime and lost 50,000 over the last two days.In the last few weeks, stake’s sports odds provider has been having technical issues where you would cashout a bet and during the cool down, the odds would change and the cashout would still be accepted as it benefits them. Clearly glitch and tech issue. This happened on 5 different occasions in a two day span and darko refunded the bets.Here’s the proof below.https://ibb.co/Jjb7Fd5https://ibb.co/YNSM8JWA few days ago, I had this happen again on 2 bets.sport:85967677 Odds changed on the e sports match (owed a lousy $500)I reported the issue instantly and ran into the luxury of speaking with Nikola from support- now Nikola has serious issues with me and is very racist and has personal issues with me. He immediately replied with this.https://ibb.co/x7Q2hVgI waited over 30 hours and didn’t hear back and he blocked my email from contacting support.Now when darko would review these bets, he would review them in minutes. As Nikola is racist and dislikes me, he decides to just screw me over.sport:85917917 odds changed again on cashout and here I am owed about 3.5k.I reached out to my VIP host Steve and he is absolutely useless and refuses to even send the bet to darko.I am 100% certain if darko reviewed the bets, he would see the issues and he would refund them.I am hoping someone from stake can help get these bets reviewed by the correct person.sport:86140232 Owed about 2k hereBottom line is, Nikola or support never updated me in regards to these issues and instead blocked me.https://ibb.co/LvyQmQ6Here are my statshttps://ibb.co/d67L6hm",
