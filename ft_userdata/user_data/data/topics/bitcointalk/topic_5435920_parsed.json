I don't know what you are talking about. For people that came in 2019 this is the first real bear market season. IMHO this is merely an accumulation phase and could be that there will be heavy volatility ahead where the bears and bulls fight. To me it seems we are at the point what would need an unseen devastating blow to make markets suffer more then they already have. And at this point only crash of the Binance, fatal flaw in ETH code, or rebirth of Satoshi could do it. It's very telling that market crash after FTX wasn't anything compared to mayhem that UST crash caused. It was just chosen to be the scapegoat for the whole bear market. It didn't seem to matter that when it happened we were already near the bottom.",

The bear market this days ain’t that painful like the years before 2020 because almost every investor have plans forehand to survive in the bear markets this days. Although I expect another bearish period before the 2024 halving which is predicted to be a cause for a bull run, your prediction of bitcoin hitting All time low is never going to happen. Because that is like saying bitcoin is go down to at least $10 worth. No matter any saga coming up I don’t think we will get to see that.",

It's a bit confusing you're just now talking about a bear market when Bitcoin is facing the largest rally for the last 3 months. Who knows which way it will go, but people who bought at 16k are almost 25% up on their investment if they were to cash out now, it's hard to find that sort of return in such a short time frame. It just depends if it holds steady, but we're generally seeing what might turn out to be a softer landing than expected for the economy and maybe it'll rebound faster than the so-called experts predicted. Bitcoin did very well in periods where borrowing costs were low, so if it can sustain while inflation drops back down and borrowing costs reduce then we might see another rally again.",

What makes you think this hasn't happened yet. We were supposed to stop at the last ath of 20k, but we went much lower to the 15k, which flushed out most people and made us go back to 2019 prices. Why do you think long time holders weren't hurt by this? We had a large move of coins held by over 5 years when FTX went bust. The data is available if you look for it. QuoteIt will get to a point where many will start losing hope on crypto, a more painful bottom will occur and holders will lose faith, the bear market will look like it will be here forever. IMO this took place at least twice in 2022. The first big wave was when we broke below 30k because of Luna. You can see that the volume back then was the highest since the time when we fell to 30k for the first time in May 2021. Each time there's big volume of sales you know there was a capitulation event taking place. QuoteWe are not at this point yet so do not get too confidence that a new all times low is no more possible, no one saw COV-19 coming in 2020 and anything can still happen between 2023- 2024. You remind me of the people who were calling for 1k Bitcoin from the beginning of the 2018 bear market and they were so sure that this 1k will come that they never bought bitcoin. We don't know what's going to happen but you're saying this like you're sure that bitcoin will go below 15k when you cannot possibly be sure of something like that. If you're sure, why don't you short bitcoin right now? It should be an easy trade for someone as confident as you.",

That's because, I was around in 2019 although much later but, this is definitely my first bear season.History has it that, 2017 was the year that came with the bears, ravaging the crypto space with investors having to lose faith but experience tells investors to stick around.Yeah, it's not funny I the bears and looking at the charts now to see some pumps, it's not enough to say we are done with the bears yet. We are still very much in the bears but, we just might have hit the ock bottom for the bearish season already.",

Opened peoples minds as to how economies and financial institutions might be structured differently. To elevate standard of living, granting consumers more options and opportunities in life. As well as boosting perception of what the term financial freedom could mean in the future.This could represent the evolution of humanity. In terms of our concepts and ideas about what is possible for us and how the world works adapting, progressing and evolving over time. While we might have bitcoin to represent certain ideology and ideas. We may not yet have reached the final form. If fiat currency is a horse driven wagon. Bitcoin might be the modern automobile. Could that be an accurate analogy? It is possible that as long as people support and believe in finding better ways to conduct business and better methods to live their lives, there will always be things like bitcoin being developed. It may simply be the natural evolution of things. While it may be discouraged. Stalled. Or perhaps even appear to be wiped out at times. There could always be someone who will find a way to invent a better mousetrap. At which time, people will have to decide whether they want to use the new and better way of doing things. Or revert to using past methods, which are not as good within a regressive trend.",
