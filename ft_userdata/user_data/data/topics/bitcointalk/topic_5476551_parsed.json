  "content": "I live to by the word's that says \"knowledge that can not be brought out to reality is a waste\".This has got me wondering because I know nothing about Bitcoin and all my focus about in the platform is how to make quality posts such as the such as those who are learned and had been here before me.I specifically made this thread because I am spending more of my times in this forum reading others posts and could feel how professional they are presented including the logic terms and I want to be like you all with the amiable qualities.Please I want to understand if the amiable professional members here in the forum do  practices or put in realities with what they preaches or talks about here? Or it is just some sorts of sugarcoated words that is to call for self attentions to building influential acknowledgements?Please I need a clearly because I already getting possesd of this facts as I am already forcing in to flow with some of the professional terminologies that I don't even know about the  qualities of its reality. But meanwhile... I am here to learn about Bitcoin and I want to be one of the strong Bitcoin earners (Bitcoin users) in matter of time. My strong Bitcoin earner as an individual is depended on my contentedness and don't mean about being on lines with those who has been trading on Bitcoin before me such as the Elon Musk and other top Bitcoin owners but yet, if there comes a privilege of being among those great investors of course I would even strive for an overtake.Please everyone at the endivoirs to extend their knowledges with me, please do share your positive energymatic vibes about Bitcoin with me for I am willing and flexible to learn passionately at what is to attain me profitable results.I already know that Bitcoin is potentialed to make one rich and that is why I am in for it.",

Trading is a short term focus while investing are long term (this is the most basic different between the two).",

Although, I'll mention that not everything someone says that he practices, some are expert predictions and evaluation which can be related to positive reality. Deep researches are made, quality materials are consulted, options are weighted before quality contributions are made. The good thing is that whatever you bring up in this forum, there are people who must've experience it or have some knowledge about it that will give you the direction you'll follow, more information will be available to you, both theoretically and practically. A lot of people have been here for years and have gathered enough experience about bitcoin that when they speak, its more like a prophesy, some people are so knowledgeable that you'll think they are Satoshi himself. I know they've gathered knowledge intentionally and that's what I want you to do.Do not believe everything you see though, do your researches and if you've counter suggestions or opinions, you can state it constructively so we can learn from you. Like they say, no one is a  pillar of knowledge, learning is a continue process, let's learn and grow together mate.",

Or it is just some sorts of sugarcoated words that is to call for self attentions to building influential acknowledgements?One thing you should know is that in forum like this, not all comment or things they preach is practiced, some ideas people always bring might be of help to some people present situation, and serves as a solution to there problem. It's more of question and answer. You shouldn't wait for people to practice what they said before you do. Sometimes you just need to take advantage of what people are preaching to achieve a better thing. Many people are good in advice, but find it difficult to do what they say. While some people follow the lead just to achieve merit. But one thing for sure, if they choose to sugarcoat what they say, and choose not do it, they will end up making mistakes. And perhaps I don't really think most people you see here sugarcoat what they say. %80 of what they said is true. That is to tell you that dey are talking out of experience. And those advice shouldn't be talking for granted.Quote from: AVE5 on December 04, 2023, 10:11:39 PMPlease I need a clearly because I already getting possesd of this facts as I am already forcing in to flow with some of the professional terminologies that I don't even know about the  qualities of its reality.

I think Crypto currency study is not a day lerning process. It will definitely take time to learn. Those people you see here were once a newbie and they partake in bitcoin activities here in this forum. If you really need to learn, you must read and contribute with the knowledge you have. No body here is an island of knowledge. The information you bring might be usefull to even people you think will not learn anything from you. Always do your best, destiny differs. you might be new here but how fast you grow is determined by you level of understanding and the meaningful contribution you bring. just relax and watch how the forum works.",

Nahh!Almost all the snr men you see in the forum are experienced individual in the bitcoin and crypto space and what you have here is individual that are sharing their wealth of experiences and also helping new persons that are trying to find their ground get the right information from the right source.The truth is that what keeps the forum active and very functional is the regular post you find here and coupled with the fact that quality post gets one to be merited, some persons might fabricate stuff just to him for merit but of what they posted is just theoretical and can't be applied in real life, it won't take time before someone refute it. It's good that you're are taking your time to read through the forum to enable you get he right information that will guide you in the forum and the total bitcoin space, know that topics regarding your security, scams and hacks are very important and you shouldn't joke with it.

      "body": "Op I can boost that many member here especially top members of this forum, are not just using sugarcoated words to deceive any, or make them sound like a professional, and even if some members are just liers  that shouldn't be your problem because, they will surly fish them out and give them a ban. But on a clear note you can actually tell if they are professional by the quality of terms used, except maybe in local board that we do try to make thing very simple and easily understood. Though it might be difficult to identity those who are actually saying the what they practice because, in this forum any useful personal info is not advised to be disclosed publicly, there was a time were I created a post announcing my first set of satoshi which I bought, and I posted prove to the public by screen shooting my transaction. But after posting that, I was advised to immediately remove it from my post, and I did as I was instructed. So if it weren't for scammers, hackers and robbers I don't think hiding of prove would be necessary. However, I don't think its necessary to doubt any one because most statement are in form of advise, and that might be what you need at that time.",
