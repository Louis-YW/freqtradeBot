Recently shiba played well but i think doge is best. I have huge memory with doge coin. And i am huge profited form doge coin. In 2017 when doge price was $0.0005 then i was bought $1300 doge coin and  i traded it after trading my fund were near about $5k. It was my biggest profit from crypto currency market. So i never forget doge coin. Doge coin gives me financial freedom. So i still love this meme coin.",

Doge coin is also the biggest meme coin right now. There's no meme coin that can stand a chance to beat doge coin even shiba inu with its product will never able to surpass doge coin. Doge coin will remain a meme coin forever while the rest was just stupid meme token which issued in the another blockchain. Doge coin has its own blockchain and i would like to call that as the best meme coin that doesn't rely with the centralization of another blockchain. Another token can collapse once its parent blockchain will be also dead. That's why i would like to take doge coin as the most valuable meme coin right now. I see no reason to call another meme token as a competitor for doge coin. The marketcap can be manipulated by the whale but its history will never able to be repeated by another meme token in the market",

It was one of the earliest coin coined as Meme coin as it was introduced to make people aware of cryptocurrency and mining. ShibaInu was it's mascot. Influenced by it, Shiba token came as a meme coin with controversial initial supply. A plethora of other tried to copy it, some a bit successful while most in vein. Pepe was the last meme token I missed that got a significant success and still holding. That's why I'm early into Pepemo. Hoping it would be to Pepe what babydoge is to dogecoin.",

It was the first meme project that was created and it also has the highest market cap of all meme coins. The next meme coin that was a success was Shiba Inu which came many years later and basically was just a copy of Dogecoin with a different name. This year we had Pepe which made quite a few early investors rich.We should not forget though that for every successful meme coin there are probably 10000 others that completely fail. So just stay away from shitcoins in general.",

Even the new one Pepe is just trying to repeat the success of Dogecoin even though it's just a meme coin. I would not trust any for a long-term asset. Better just play along, use them to milk some money, and then dump them away. Find a new one, buy it, sell it, and then leave it again. Don't ever fall in love with any of this, their market could easily fall any day or worse, any minute. At you sleep or while you are eating, they could be manipulated by whales and turn it to dust.",

And I also think that those three have high chances that they will also keep up during the bull run of Bitcoin. Apart from that, I think the Aidoge, and Caw look good and okay to hold until the bull run returns.. Anyway, this is just my observation.There is also the under of shiba inu, like Bonk, shibdao, because when the price value of Shib increases, the top coins under the network of Shib will also be pulled up for sure based on what I can see.",

And it has been like that for years until Elon Musk become the so called influencer and hype Doge. After that there are a lot of copycats including Shiba.But for now, I would say Pepe, it went viral and has huge followers and someone get rich instantly as the creator of this BRC-20 token. However, I think there could be more in the future, specially as we approach the bull run next year. Developers would fine another hype and creates meme coin for everyone to make money with.",

And about my profitable meme coin is $PEPE, I was lucky enough to know the existence of this token earlier, even though I was not an early adopter, but it managed to earn up to x5+ of my total investment in this token.
