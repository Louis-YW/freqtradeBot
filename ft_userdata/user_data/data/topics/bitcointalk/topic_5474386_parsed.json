If so, you can do CPFP.To do CPFP, you should spend the fund received in the unconfirmed transaction in a new transaction with a high fee. If the fee paid for the new transaction is high enough for both transactions, miners will include them in the same block. In the case your wallet doesn't allow you to spend unconfirmed coins, you should import your seed phrase/private key in a wallet which allow you to do so. A good option is electrum.",

Ask her to make a new transaction once again with enough fee if it was already rejected.If this transaction is broadcasted again then you will need to wait again for 2 weeks until the transaction is rejected again by the mempool because the fee used in this transaction is around 17sat/vB which is far from the current recommended fee by mempool.space.

It's sitting there in the mempool ~30MB from tip. The fee is worth ~$5-6 in fiat which is a lot of money for a moderate amount I'm trying to send.",

Some will run with the default of two weeks, some will run with higher limits, and some will run with virtually no limit at all. If you are still seeing your unconfirmed transaction on Electrum after several months, you can try swapping to different servers to see if you can find one which has already dropped it.Alternatively just make a full RBF replacement.",
