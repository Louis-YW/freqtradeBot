What is Snarkcoin trying to solve?With Snarkcoin, the goal is to create a better alternative to other crypto-currencies, like Dash and Bitcoin. To achieve this, Snarkcoin only has 10,500,000 coins that can ever be produced. That allows twice as much inflation resistance as Bitcoin. Snarkcoin also has some privacy features that Dash has.SpecificationsTotal supply: 10,500,000 SNARKBlock halving: Every 96,650 blocksMasternode amount: 1000 coinsMasternode confirmations: 15 blocksBlock target: 5 minutesTransaction confirmations: 7Coinbase maturity: 21Block reward: 50 SNARK / 49% Masternode | 49% PoW | 2% SuperblockTicker: SNARKAlgorithm: Proof of Work with Masternodes - Powered by X11Premine : 835000 SNARK / To compensate for the other 2 coins that failed / The rest will go to promotionsWebsitesMaintained by meWebsite: https://snarkco.inExplorer: NOT YETPool: ONLY SOLO FOR NOWSocial mediaFollow us!Discord: https://discord.gg/qjct8dQwtkTwitter: https://twitter.com/snarkcoin1Instagram: https://instagram.com/snarkcoinReddit: https://reddit.com/r/snarkcoinRepositoriesDon't forget to star!Snarkcoin Source Code: https://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoinSnarkcoin Wallets: https://github.com/snarkcoin/snarkcoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0Post-release goalsCoinMarketCap / CoinGecko listingGetting a strong communityThe maximum possible exchange listingsIf you have any questions, I will be at your disposal as soon as possible to answer each of them, under this topic, by email, on Twitter, or on Discord.Have a nice day BitcoinTalk community!",
