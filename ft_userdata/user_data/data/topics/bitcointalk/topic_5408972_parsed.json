It's better if you are using cardano's twitter for that. It will be more accurate rather than using news aggregator. As far i as i know if you will be rarely seeing this. Cardano will be very active to update the latest news on its social media. that will be more accurate rather than using an app. I don't think this kind of app available.",

There's many cases crypto holders get hacked after they installed unknown app, clicking random link and open a file from unknown person.Personally I prefer to follow their social media on Twitter, Discord and Telegram to know the news and rumors about the project.",

If you really want to have a notification for any news about it, other suggestions besides a specific app for the use case would be; Setting up a notification on their Twitter account, joining their Telegram announcement group, and last, you can subscribe to Reddit /r/cardano RSS.",

Coingecko and Coinmarketcap are two of the popular source of daily info about crypto and the market.",

You should join their official social media groups like Telegram and Twitter to get the latest updates.
