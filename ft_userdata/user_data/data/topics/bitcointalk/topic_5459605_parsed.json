Although it is not a guarantee, there is no guarantee that you will be able to profit continuously in day trading. so in my opinion long term holding is better",

Because they will surely suggest you a phishing or ponzi scheme site and you will lose your entire investment. So try to go yourself to find out the investment which fits you. I will obviously suggest none other than Bitcoin but it can't generate a specific amount of profit and you may lose too in short term. But in long term you will gain a huge return obviously. We are still in a bear market so maybe it can be last chance to grab Bitcoin in low price. But don't fall in a trap of any shit altcoins or ponzi site as someone can suggest you here or in your inbox.",

If you want $30 daily, you will get $10,950 in profit after 365 days.I can't say Bitcoin will make a new all time high but if you believe it will make it, you will get $10,950 profit from your $7000 capital after 365 days or longer. You need Bitcoin to rise 156% from today price to get $10,950 profit.",

So try to go yourself to find out the investment which fits you. yes if op is want to make $30 profit daily then It's the op's fault thinking. Because if he wants to do day trading then according to the trading skills he can earn $100+ profit in one day and can lose $500+ in one day it depends on his coin choice and right and wrong entries. So in my opinion it would be better for the op to pick potential coins and start holding and sell those coins when they are profitable rather than holding them for a certain period of time. This strategy works well if he is not interested in holding for the long term for long profit",

That's the best way to be promised a 150% annual return if you ask on a forum.The closest thing without being a scam would be to buy bitcoin, but if you don't sell. You couldn't sell $30 of bitcoin every day to spend it, you would have to keep the investment for years and hopefully you would get that return, although it might be a little less in the future.",

But if you want a daily profit of $30, it's difficult because investing in Bitcoin takes at least a few months. You can profit by trading but you must have the ability.I think it's better to buy Bitcoin regularly so you can collect more than just buy Bitcoin in one purchase. Better to wait for a few months so your profit can be bigger and not only $ 30 per day.But that's just a suggestion because it's hard to find a way to give you a $30 daily profit without skill. With that kind of money, I suggest investing in Bitcoin and leaving it in your wallet for a few months until the price increases significantly.",

That is, every day you will make a trade in bitcoins by understanding the market well and you will have a target when you will make a profit of 30 dollars in your trade, then you will sell the bitcoins that you bought. You can make multiple trades as per your daily time limit.  Since you have $7K there is no need to trade with $7K together. You invest $7K to $2K in Bitcoin and you hold this $2Kfor a long time.

      "body": "$30 doesn't sound like much but with only $7K you can't really invest it in some savings account to generate that kind of yield. We are talking about 100% compounded APR pretty much. You will find many tokens which pay that much in yield by providing liquidity however most likely the fiat value of those tokens will go down in the near future since they have a yield this high.There really isn't any guaranteed way. Sure you can buy bitcoin or ethereum and hope it doubles in 1 year however there is the chance that 1 year from now it can stay exactly the same or go down. There are risks in everything. My advice is just invest in bitcoin and dont look at the daily gains but in the gains long term.",

The price of Bitcoin is going to go up in coming years and if you invest in it now then your returns will be very high and you'll see exponential growth in assets value. The half that you have left for trading should be traded with a scalping strategy and you should only trade Bitcoin or some valuable to alternative coins which are known for their features and userbase.I would say that with such investing plan you'll have consistent income over a long period because if scalping is done in the proper way then sometimes getting $30 to $60 per day is possible. However, you should also keep in your mind that those $30 or higher revenues can't be generated everyday because crypto-market doesn't works in that way. I wont recommend you to lend money and earn interest from it because that thing is quite risky and if you lend money to someone who can't return it then you will end up losing your initial capital. Although, I don't recommend it but still lending is also an option to earn consistent income if things go in your favor, but trust me sometimes you'll end up losing a lot of money with such service.",

From how to ask in this community, I assume you are still just starting to invest in Cryptocurrency. Pay attention to coins that have strong fundamentals in order to maintain the value of the asset, I would advise you to keep Bitcoin for a long time to get profit in the future.Avoid types of investment that are at greater risk only to get a profit of $ 30 per day, start thinking more broadly by placing money in assets that have been proven to be able to survive in any conditions that occur in the market or outside the market caused by negative issues or government regulations.",

But based on your fund better trade with  Bitcoin only and I sure you have chance to earn $30 but can't guarantee in daily day. Its difficult how to be consistent for taking profit in cryptocurrency because when bad news come all our target losing, but in Bitcoin you have chance if can't earn profit with 30$ in daily day you still have chance to earn every two or three days later based on current bitcoin changed.But not recommended if you want trade with altcoin and earn consistent 30$ every day, I think its not good ideas when trading fund $7k and trade with altcoin for consistency profit 30$.",

You are really expecting to earn $900 per month by just investing $7,000? Not going to happen. There are no coins that you can invest in that will give you fixed amount of profit. I don't know why others are suggesting you to trade with that money. Even trading won't be giving you that $30 everyday. Wouldn't be surprised if you end up with a $30 loss after trading a day.

      "body": "Due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency, you can't be guaranteed of making such daily profits this is because the market is uncertain and at that, you will need to really get involved and apply some patience and just like must comment has already suggested,  you will have to look into investing in a more realistic asset like buying bitcoin and waiting for a few months to years to see the real impact.Note: it is not as if investing in Bitcoin won't give you that amount of profit, but for you to amass such profits in Bitcoin l, then you will need to wait for some time and continue holding it because Bitcoin is the only secured long-term investment.More also you may have suggestions like trading to give such $30 daily profits and even more than that, but you must also realize that you can lose all your money in the process since trading is high risk just like gambling,  and the other way to lose your money is through investment in a Ponzi because all of them promises 150% to 200% returned and all are plots just to deceive you into giving them your money and losing it without any excused 100% loses will be recorded.So you have to buy Bitcoin and hold for the long term instead of looking for a quick daily return that could possibly end you in a painful reality and $7k is quite a good amount to start with if you ask me all that you need this to be more active here in the forum and try as much as possible to build your knowledge around Bitcoin and its possibilities and risk involved.",

Then i would divide $7k into 7 equal parts and would use only one part for Trading --> that could generate me $30 dollars easily (note--It depends on the level of experience you have plus also which type of trading you are doing, like either it is spot or future). If you are doing future then risk is more but also the profit too. But if you are doing spot then you have to increase your investment from $1k to maybe $3k. And i suggest you to follow some mentor or buy some VIP signals if you are newbie otherwise i will suggest you to follow your own mind. You would, invest it in BTC for longer period of time, and wait for next bull run when the BTC will reach to its new heights of ATH. At that time you might have earned more than $30 dollars per day. Like if you bought BTC at current Price of around $30.3k which will be about 0.231BTC and when the all time high will be of $100k then your same $7k investment will bring you $16,100 dollar of profit. and if you divide that profit with the days of 18 months (540 days) then you are earning $30 dollars daily. You could increase your portfolio by doing DCA too.",
