That's 44% of all funded Bitcoin addresses, holding 2593.58118332BTC in total.I don't think the protocol needs to exclude those small Bitcoin owners. At current fees, their inputs are too small to send anyway.I'm more for education, like my \"consolidate small inputs\" topic. People should try to avoid receiving small amounts of Bitcoin. Whenever possible, use small change for something else. Be smart on manually using coin control. Wait for regular payments to reach a larger amounts (mining pools could educate their small miners on this). Or indeed, just use low-fee altcoins for some payments. But that's not the scaling solution Bitcoin needs.",

DAI (or any other coin) on Polygon network is a solid solution too IMO, for people searching for cheap transactions fees (even if sometimes it doesn't work as promised...)But I prefer to wait patiently for the right time to spend BTC, than to have to anticipate high fees weeks by holding any altcoin. Otherwise, for those looking for a privacy focused exchanger that allows you to swap BTC on-chain to LN, there is exch.cx which works well.",
