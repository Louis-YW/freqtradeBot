  "content": "I was just thinking about the situation of the country, how to survive and how I can expand my stream of income and a lot of ideas came into my head so I decided to make this thread... the aim of which is to share and also see opinion for the benefit of all. Well, I do not need to tell you all that maintaining one stream of income is not safe especially in a country like ours where people are under-employed and our currency is depreciating daily. Good enough, many of us in this forum are engaged in one thing or the other that generate income, leveraging the power of the internet. However, I feel many of us have not been able to also create physical businesses that will play complementary roles to this \"internet money\". So this thread have been created so we all can suggest and discuss different business ideas that those of us in this culture of internet can venture into, that will not stop our activities on the internet yet can enable us generate considerable income to complement what we are already doing.First business idea I find great is boutique business. Clothing is one thing that is booming and have high demand. If you open a boutique, you can create your mini office within the boutique and doing your internet stuffs while still monitoring the business. Another business idea that entered my mind was frozen foods. This is another line of business that is of high demand and the goods are not perishable as they remain frozen and preserved. With this, you can still run your package while observing your business. Let me stop here while others give their suggestions as well and as we continue the discussion, more ideas will come. WE MUST MAKE THIS MONEY.",

This is another line of business that is of high demand and the goods are not perishable as they remain frozen and preserved. With this, you can still run your package while observing your business.  This nah correct idea you bring here but comma dey dis business. Firstly, for this kind business to thrive, you go gats dey area where steady light dey show else you don run loss be that o. You know say the issue of light nah big one for naija. E get some areas wey never use eye see light and if you wan dey use Gen dey keep am cold, you no how much fuel dey cost. Abi you wan use gas cylinder dey do am? That no healthy na. Secondly, if you no dey area wey big men full, that business go choke. Why I tok so? With the way hunger don dey land, the average man go reason to fill him stomach before him go reason chicken or even fish as the case maybe. Frozen food business nah confam one but if the right tins no dey in place, nah better liability you dey bring give yourself because if means no dey to keep am cool, nah to sell below the price to avoid goods getting spoiled.",

Many bitcoiners are using their opportunity well by creating different investments in different locations in the country if you don't know,  just that they will not tell you that they are the owner of such companies for security reasons. Some of them are into gas and oil business which I know very wellQuoteWE MUST MAKE THIS MONEY. Not by mouth OP, but you need to work hard before you will be able to get such amount of money to establish those businesses you mentioned here because, they require a big capital to start a boutique business in my area. For you to get a shop here to start a boutique business you have to pay millions to get the shop, and you need huge amount of money to furniture the place before storing clothes to sell and it will cost you close to billionaire but you will surely recover from your expenditure when you establish the business.What is in my mind now, if I have the opportunity to get this money , I will go into exporter because there are some products in Nigeria you can export to other countries and start making millions monthly, and the new controller custom officer has came out public on human right and television to promised Nigeria youths to go into exporter that they will  do everything possible to encourage them.",

You coming up with this thread is a very good idea, as it gives room for people to discuss alternative source of income, which is very important in this our present hard economy wey we get for we country, and a wake up call for people not to put all eggs inside one basket (i.e rely on just only one source of income). Because on the contrary, that boutique na one better business to venture into, and likewise P.O.S and Barbing salon or Beauty shop na another good business wey if you go into it, at least you are rest assured to have enough time for yourself and forum to fit dey meet up your post count. Because from the little savings I have been able to generate from this forum, I have been able to use it open small P.O.S business & employed someone wey dey fetch me the least every day, and there is nothing as good as getting small small money every day.",

But then before deciding a business option to go for; there are underlying questions you need to answer that will help you reach a business idea destination quicker.1. What does your community lack? (Community here means what is unavailable in your immediate environment); If you solve this, you have an idea of what type of business to do or to start up.2. Are there willing buyers for what your community lack? Like, do people buy those products from else where ??3. How much will it cost you to make what your community lack available for purchase? Will it be small scale, medium scale or large scale? What will be your profit margin if you endeavor into the business Finding answers to the 3 questions above are very vital before you determine your business idea. For example; in my neighborhood; there is no football viewing center, you have to take bike worth 200 naira to the nearest viewing centers, and most times there are always no seat for clients; we have to watch while standing; with good capital; starting up a viewing center powered with solar; with cheap fees will mean i have an abundant of market to sell; with profit only realizable on a long term package.You can share your contributions too",

Yet also we must try to put eyes on businesses that can easily be licensed to avoid running into trouble when the business eventually picks up because the government will always come for you if you running an unlicensed business,  so you have to be prepared for that,  most people that are running a physical business are suffering from the over taxation and government interferences due to unlicensed operations.",

The major problem be say, make you get a steady stream of income way the money big for you to fit diversify to another source of revenue or business. Because starting a new business get ups and downs, you fit start a new business now then suddenly you don dey run into losses, so in a bid to still keep that new business going, one steady stream suppose dey by the corner to always stand as a leverage.Another matter be say, no be everybody Sabi the technique and ideas to run two business one time.

You for just carry this your topic as reply go this thread; Four Lucrative businesses you can start in Nigeria because as I read your thread I remember say we dun discuss something similar recently wey concern businesses wey person for do for the country. Me I no too believe physical business because I no too see money for the thing although e dey every presentable based on the country wey we dey wey people go like know wetin you dey do to get the kind money wey you dey spend especially when you dey loud in your spending and when you no fit show dem any better physical business, dem go automatically think say you be illegal person as a yahoo boy or other illegal business and e fit put you for trouble. Apart from this I no see any other reason to engage in physical business if you dey do online and e dey pay you, just for just invest more into other online business and secretly be making your money.QuoteFirst business idea I find great is boutique business. Clothing is one thing that is booming and have high demand. If you open a boutique, you can create your mini office within the boutique and doing your internet stuffs while still monitoring the business.Guess who your patronizers go dey mostly be, na yahoo boys because the average Nigerian no fit buy boutique cloths. Na only yahoo boys and some tech legit internet hustlers wey dey patronized boutique business because things too cost for dat side. Wetin you go see #20k for outside fit be #50k for boutique and this boys no dey price dem but just buy am and na wetin make boutique owners keep on increasing price. So although the business dey recreative but e go take time from you to run as you no need put person for the shop or dem go fall am for you. This days sales boy no dey trusted again as everybody dun open eye. Him fit dey your shop open e own so focusing on internet business is still the surest way of hustling provided say the hustle legit and you can defend where the money is coming from and also maintain low key life so people no go too dey shuku eye for your business.",

These are interesting choices I must say as both falls into the fundamental needs of every being clothes and food (as the case is for mainly frozen items).While  these might be great ideas with the continued trans in fashion and the way people have taken up fashion, emulating celebrities, brand preferences and portraying a niche, the available styles are never enough and still, there continue to evolve more.The challenge to this is, the cost of setting up which is relatively high and not very idea for a beginner with the hopes of selling quality stuffs.Humans can’t do without food, not even there domesticated animals, pets and all. You don’t feed your pet, you can be rest assured it’s going to go crazy and forget how to behave no matter the training. Food is a can’t do without and this makes its need very vital and a lucrative business.The challenge to the frozen business remains electricity supply. You need stable power to run this kind of business and that’s the one thing Nigeria can’t be so proud of.On the all, it’s a very good field if for an investment of you could afford.",

So this thread have been created so we all can suggest and discuss different business ideas that those of us in this culture of internet can venture into, that will not stop our activities on the internet yet can enable us generate considerable income to complement what we are already doing.First business idea I find great is boutique business. Clothing is one thing that is booming and have high demand. If you open a boutique, you can create your mini office within the boutique and doing your internet stuffs while still monitoring the business. Another business idea that entered my mind was frozen foods. This is another line of business that is of high demand and the goods are not perishable as they remain frozen and preserved. With this, you can still run your package while observing your business. Let me stop here while others give their suggestions as well and as we continue the discussion, more ideas will come. WE MUST MAKE THIS MONEY. Yes of a truth venturing into business dey good o but to me before one ventures into a business he/she should know things concerning the particular business because a lot of people just venture into business they have no idea about may be because their colleague are also doing same business. In as much as business is concerned, a business needs to be studied to know the scope of the business and other vital information regarding the business. It's very unfortunate that many a people starts business they don't have any idea on and employ someone to manage the business. Even if you employ someone that is competent but they may not be able to tell you everything concerning the business because what they tell you is what you gonna believe because you don't have the eye of that particular business. So in a nutshell I advise that businesses needs to be studied before anyone can venture into it.Moreover, if one wants to venture into business it is advisable to venture into businesses that are lucrative. For example businesses that can be affordable by the average man because those are the people that needs things almost on daily basis. A big man might buy things once in a while but the common man will keep patronizing you on daily basis. And daily patronage also leads to goods being sold out before the expiry unlike someone who makes sale on weekly or monthly basis you will find out some of the goods might expire even when it's not been sold out. Businesses such as provisions, clothings, building materials. This businesses are being required on daily basis, as people can't go a day without eaten foods, wearing clothes and even build houses. This businesses might not look lucrative but you need to understand that human must surely need these things everyday of their life and the more sales you make, the more your opportunity of expanding your business. And again to maintain a good business idea one needs to be discipline as you don't focus all your energy in one business so it is also advisable that one should be versatile due to unforseen circumstances as sometimes you might be finding it difficult in a particular business then you can use the other to sustain yourself and earn a living.",
