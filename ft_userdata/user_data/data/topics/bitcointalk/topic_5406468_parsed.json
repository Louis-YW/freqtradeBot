In overall it has high regulation and proliferation score, well financial services is obviously at the highest point.Türkiye in number 37, could be worse. There is no regulation yet but some bans on services. Still it has a big market and two giant trading companies, high public interest. That probably give more points. It may look different from the outside, I thought it was worse as I live there. I wouldn't call this government crypto-friendly at all though.",

Anyway this gives some insight that governments are adopting to the system and make the potential out of it.Probably the reason why Indonesia and other countries are not included in this list is because there is no data collected on these countries. Anyways, I am quite surprised why El Salvador is only at rank 35, right next to my country Philippines. El Salvador has already accepted bitcoin as a legal tender yet it is only ranked at 35. Philippines hasn't implemented any regulations on cryptocurrency but there is also no limit or restrictions made on it which is why most Filipino are able to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrency so freely.",

The sovereignty of the USD as world one of the leading currencies for international trade should be demolished because of the misuse of the USA money printing machine.",

But if we should speak in terms of reality, i did tell you that Nigerian government banning crypto transactions in Nigeria was a blessing in disguise  for crypto adoption in the country, a lot of people didn't know what crypto was until the ban, the ban was indirectly a form of marketing for crypto, i am tell you this from my experience, i currently have some new crypto buddies who said, they never knew what Bitcoin or crypto was, though they have been hearing the name, they said they decided to really know what crypto was after the ban was announce, and today, they are almost pro crypto traders and investors.",

El Salvador makes a good regulations with regards to Bitcoin adoption, its just that this topic tackles every field starting from the regulations up to the adoption of people and using it from day to day basis. The countries on a top list are very friendly since many establishments acknowledge Cryptocurrency and in El Salvador, they are just starting with this one.

The research obviously had some other criteria than that Bitcoin is legal tender in a country as an important feature when it comes to the status of a crypto-friendly country. Obviously, more focus is being devoted to the overall status according to crypto laws and adaptation, probably also security when it comes to investing.There is no data for my country at all, although in any case it could be considered quite crypto-friendly considering the number of physical crypto exchanges without KYC for amounts up to even 2000 EUR per transaction, 0% tax if you sell crypto 2 years after purchase and the fact that you can buy almost anything you can imagine with Bitcoin (online).",
