  "content": "Lately, after the painful demise of http://preev.com, I saw a lot of discussion on BitcoinTalk mentioning https://100bit.co.in. This is primarily why I am creating this thread. 100 Bitcoin currently works as a simple BTC/Sats to FIAT converter and provides Bitcoin price on current date for 10 years (including current year). Following currencies are supported...Australian Dollar - AUDCanadian Dollar- CADChinese Yuan- CNYEuro - EURGreat Britain Pound- GBPIndian Rupee - INRJapanese Yen - JPYSouth Korean Won - KRWRussian Ruble - RUBUnited States Dollar - USDIf any of you have some feature in mind, that you would like to see on 100 Bitcoin, please do mention it below. Feel free to wear our signature to promote this free service on BitcoinTalk.

IMO it'd be better if there are different button to show those information/feature. I agree with you on that one. However, if you try clicking on the left or right side of the \"Bitcoin price on this day\" box, it will also work. Clicking over or below the box doesn't work however. 100bit.co.in and preev.net are two identical sites design-wise. Both show the same BTC values at the same time because both fetch their data from CoinGecko. 100bit has that historical price reference, but everything else is about the same.
