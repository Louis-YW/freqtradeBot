You wont be poor if you have invested on the money you can afford to lose.You wont be poor as long you dont realize those losses on your portfolioYou wont be poor as long you dont panic sell.On the time that you had decided on making up some investment towards this market then you should make yourself that embrace on things that might encounter along the way specially with volatility.There's no way that we could really be able to know on what would be ahead.If ever Bitcoin would crash today then i would definitely be finding some sources for me to accumulate more.As long the demand and interest is intact on bitcoin then chances or tendency for some recovery is really that likely.So better buy on the bottom as always.",

Going all in is not advisable at all regardless of your reason, because for me its greed and being greedy can’t help you that much. If Bitcoin crashes today, many will surely happen but you can save yourself if you’ll do something now to assess your exposure with Bitcoin, just take the risk you can afford.",

This is an almost impossible hypothesis, and there is no point in raising topics that include almost impossible scenarios. Do you have a clear vision of how this could happen today, tomorrow, or at any time?Comparison between Bitcoin as a project and the project in which someone you know invested in is not permissible.When you lose in any project, this means that you have often been subjected to a process of fraud in one way or another. Bitcoin is a working base for all these projects, and the collapse of Bitcoin necessarily means the collapse of those projects.",

If an investor carefully understands the risks associated with his investment and invests accordingly without the requirement to go all in on a single asset and investing your total or more than total portfolio, then there is zero chance that an investor will feel bad for their investments. And the type of crash you expect from btc is not possible now because times were different when only the retail money controlled btc but now, big giants have betted their money on crypto so that crash is not an easy task to take place.",

So I ask again if bitcoin crashed today what will be your description rich or poor? If crypto crashed, I would focus more on physical assets.Or perhaps try to expand my digital finance game.People are always searching for the next bitcoin. Wanting to be an early adopter on the next big thing. While those who lived in past eras might only have one big opportunity available to them in their lives. Today modern people are lucky enough to have access to multiple opportunities during their lives. We simply do not try as hard to make the most of them. While a big crash could be a negative event. Hopefully, it might also have some positive effect. There would be an upside to it which could be difficult to quantify. Hopefully, everyone is diversifying between digital and hard assets. While digital assets are very convenient in terms of them being electronic, there have been many attempts to destroy the internet over the years. DNS servers have been mass DDOS'ed. There have been attempts to sever portions of the internet backbone. It is known that nuclear warheads detonated over the surface of the earth can produce an EMP effect, which would neutralize electronic devices. There certainly is no shortage of scenarios for digital assets being lost. In which case, hard assets that are physical must be a necessity to any investment strategy.Whatever happens I'll always treasure that I was lucky enough to see and be a part of bitcoin's golden age.",

Define rich or poor based on what you think.If bitcoin will crash today, to the point that no value, then we will just return to our usual daily life activity during the time crypto wasn't even born yet. If we are currently holding bitcoins then suddenly being no value, no choice but to accept that it's a financial loss and try our best to move on with that situation.But don't worry, if bitcoin will really crashes, don't expect that it will happen overnight. You can still prepare for that possible scenario. Although for me, I don't see Bitcoin being crashed at this point even we count for several decades.",
