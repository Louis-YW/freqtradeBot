      "body": "Yes lately there are many of these reports coming out. Oil is down and it seemed that inflation has peaked. So most likely the fed won't hike so much. Hence why yields went down and why stock recovered with crypto. Most likely fed won't raise rates in 2023, maybe cut them. So risk on assets like bitcoin are rallying. However...Today we got about half a million new jobs added in the US market. This doesn't look good for inflation. There is a shortage of workers and as a result many businesses will need to increase prices and it will lead to inflation going up. So who knows if their prediction will become true.",

I think the process of normalizing. I believe that it's price currently Is quiet different from initial state of bearish market season.

To speculate that BTC had already touched the bottom was already a good reason to buy. All the more with the news like Blackrock teaming up with Coinbase which is a huge announcement so I'm not surprised people are bullish after seeing price start pumping as well.We may think it's too early for this pump because halving is too far. It won't be a bad decision to buy though while its price hasn't go $40k.",

So everyone making their own predictions.I guess Bitcoins are still struggling in this price set, so who the hell said that the bear market is over now. I mean yeah Bitcoins have shown some positive attitude, but still that’s not sufficient. I guess bear market will stay for 2-5 weeks more and then we can see Bitcoins crossing 30k usd mark.Nevertheless let’s hope for the best and see if the predictions coming true or not.",

This is why some plan bulls fail, that means it has been over powered by the bear. In this present market condition we are, you will understand that bull was defeated by bear.Immediately after the effect or when the Russian and Ukraine  war started, bitcoin dumped and there was supposed to be bull run that period but it was defeated. That led us to US inflation effect and that caused the bear bear we witnessed. So, he might be correct that we are now in the bull but the certainly is not strong, any big fundamentals can make the bull not to hold. So, we should all expect massive bull in the next halving, every other things happening before then should be market plays.Quote from: GeorgeJohn on August 06, 2022, 05:15:44 AMSecondly i dont believe in a negative prediction of cryptocurrency.I don't understand you well here. Why don't you believe in the negative prediction of cryptocurrencies. We all have been here for a while and we know that whatever goes up, must surely come down. Both bear and bull are characters of crypto, so if you only believe positive and disregard negative, that means you are deceiving yourself or trying to deceive others.",

Many crypto watchers see it as a boost to this industry and the market reacted to it a few days ago as soon as that was announced. Nonetheless, to say the truth and far from the recent fundamentals, Bitcoin has proved from past records that it's stoic. It has continued to rise from ashes each time it went down and I don't see it behave any different now.",

Lol that is just peanuts to the real bull run that we are going to see in 2024-25.And obviously they have their narrative behind on why they are betting \"big\" on bitcoin and ethereum and they call it bull run. They are hedge fund institutions to they have clients that have invested millions on both of this coins. So they need to hype it in public, let the client knows that they are somewhat bullish and maybe silently trying to get more investments from them, win-win situation.",
