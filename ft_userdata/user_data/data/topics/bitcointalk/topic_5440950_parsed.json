  "content": "A new info stealer dubbed as \"Stealc\" has been discovered, which is similar to Vidar and Raccoon malware.It usually targets web browsers, browser extensions for cryptocurrency wallets, desktop cryptocurrency wallets and information from additional applications, including email client and messenger software. So for us crypto enthusiasts, we have another malware threat.Mode of infection:Quote1. YouTube videos on stolen accounts describing how to install a cracked software for free and providing a link (hxxps://rcc-software[.]com/services);2.  From the link provided in the YouTube video, the victim can access a “cracked software catalogue” website;3.  The payload embeds Stealc infostealer. The user downloads it, decompresses the archive using the password 55555 and executes the file “setup.exe” 4. (hxxps://streetlifegaming[.]com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pass_55555_Setup.rar);    Stealc communicates to its C2 on 37.220.87[.]65 (https://tria.ge/230212-pkc69adh37).Here are the list of targeted desktop crypto wallets:Here are the targeted browser extensions:Again, be vigilant, no to software cracks or anything to download in the internet specially if you are using your personal laptop for your crypto activity specially if you have installed desktop wallet on your machine.https://blog.sekoia.io/stealc-a-copycat-of-vidar-and-raccoon-infostealers-gaining-in-popularity-part-1/#h-annex-1-stealc-capabilities",

      "body": "This kind of hack is when you are careful about the files you download on the internet because most of the time they hide it inside the files and that's why when you start to install it luckily your windows built-in protection will block it. But sometimes they managed to pass those securities and they still managed to infiltrate your computer and stole some informant info regarding your bank accounts and crypto keys. Now that these kinds of malware are spreading, it's better for you to not use your computer for random browsing and you need to be extra careful when opening emails that lead you to download strange files.",

Most of this malicious software is made for wiNd0ws OS, so best protection is not with installing bunch of antivirus programs, but it is in switching to good Linux OS.All bitcoin wallets work perfectly fine on Linux, and you don't have to pay anything to someone who is spying and monitoring you 24/7.I am recommending Fedora or Debian, but newbies can also try Linux Mint or Zorin OS, if they want gradual transition.",

I just used it for my crypto related activity for 2 years now.Quote from: NotATether on February 23, 2023, 10:47:07 AM99% of the time you can only get cracked software through torrents, not by downloading them from shady sites.

I remember in 2018 wherein there is a huge spike in youtube accounts for this same purposes and probably it is continuing up to this day.",

Viruses and other garbage are almost always present in.exe files or password-protected archives.In my opinion, everything that is offered on the net for free, except for programs for Linux systems, may be associated with one form of espionage or another, a virus, or anything else that can harm the user.It's time to get used to the fact that the Internet is a business; if you are not ready to pay for good software, then you will download freebies and then pay from other resources, one way or another.Free cheese, only available in a mousetrap.With all hands on deck for learning Linux, many simply cannot look towards any Windows systems, no matter how convenient they are.",

      "body": "Thanks for the warning, honestly it is near impossible not to get viruses or malware on your PC unless you don't try out new things and you only visit the same websites every day, as an everyday PC user you will have to be scanning for threats every day, this is the only way to be sure that your PC is safe. This can be a headache because you will need a few threat scanners on your PC, from antivirus to malware detecting software, followed by Spyware and others, this is why I don't do anything crypto on my PC, I can do research on projects using my PC or connect metamask for little transactions, especially testnet, and thats all.My crypto wallet stays off the PC, and more importantly, offline.",
