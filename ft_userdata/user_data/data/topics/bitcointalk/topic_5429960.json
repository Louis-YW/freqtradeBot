If there are no problems, then there will be no @bitcointalk messages.I don't use social media. If you think that some social media functionality would be useful (such as pointing to interesting posts), feel free to do it yourself. If it's an interesting project, I might be willing to create APIs to help you. But since I don't use these sites, I don't even know what people would want.Bitcointalk Halving Party - Discord serverBitcointalk.org YouTube channel?TheBitcoinTalkShow - 5 feb - Bitcointalk was hacked",

I share the same kindred spirit with you on this. For me the most active SM is telegram in relation to cryptos, that's if that counts for anything at all because we've a lot of scammers on it. I've a Reddit, Twitter and Discord accounts but I can't remember the last time I got on them. It doesn't even seem like I miss anything not frequenting them because I get enough tutorials here.",

      "body": "I raised the question: what was the advantage of Bitcointalk, having an account on one of these social networks?Honestly, I don't see any advantage.Perhaps a Twitter could serve to communicate some offline moment, as it happened. But that was when the forum was much smaller. At the moment it is in a very large dimension, that the probability of this happening is very small. Of course it can happen, as it sometimes happens to large companies, but it is unlikely and this extra communication would be of little relevance.We can say that this forum is also a social network, so it's not worth being in the \"rivals\".",

Because you are trying to tell us that, such is there and should go there and see and when we go there and see them and if they are working, what do you think the person will do? Be a passerby? When serious discussions going on there? It is not possible.Quote from: BlackBoss_ on January 01, 2023, 09:09:27 AMNewbies who love Twitter and want to find forum Twitter, I listed it here.When I joined forum, no similar list and I had to search to make this list.Hayppy New Year Why newbies? Newbies that have not even understand the forum well, should go and use social media? What a thought.When you come here, you didn't make a good search so you end up with Spamming.

Forum is indeed a social media too because exchanging information. The only difference between forum and social was the way you interact on someone. Forum is topic basis which user attract to engage base on topics listed while social media mainly focus on personal things to engage interaction.Imho Social media is just the evolved form of the forum. Some forum already catching up the feature of social media like reddit. Bitcointalk is really the best social media for Bitcoin discussion if you want to see a more serious discussion and less troll/scammers that randomly posting on some post or comment. Twitter is garbage in terms of crypto discussion.",
