There’s that thought when your child is viewed by the public and there is that feeling when there are pedophiles out there. I do not like to spend too much time on social media because of the health of my eyes. Not just funny videos there are how to videos, news around a certain neighborhood, and even challenges. In all, TikTok is a good form of short-term entertainment but not for kids.",

However, on the other hand, TikTok can also be a source of entertainment, education, and creativity for users who use it with intention and purpose.",
