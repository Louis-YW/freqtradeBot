  "content": "The products which were bought at the same price in the last four-five years now have to be bought at two to three times more. Now what is the real reason, what should we do at this moment. The real reason for this is the effect of inflation which causes the price of everything to rise. This inflationary effect increases the prices of our daily necessities. Due to which the value of our money is constantly decreasing every year. As a result, it is almost impossible to buy and drink a cup of tea from outside.In such a situation we have to invest. Money should never be left in the bank.Money should be used in such a way that your money pays for itself. How scared we are to talk about investing. I keep thinking about where to invest and my money will run out. Many people have questions about where to invest and get safe and good returns.Investors have two concepts of risk and return. Risk is when you invest money without understanding. And return is something where you invest money, even if it is a small amount, money will come to you. There are three types of investments. LOW RISK-LOW RETURN : Like fixed deposit there is no chance of losing your money. Since it is low risk and low return investment, 5%-10% return will be available and not more than that. But in case of fixed deposit, you have to keep money in such a bank, of course the bank is approved by the government.MEDIUM RISK-MEDIUM RETURN : Gold is an asset whose price increases and decreases very quickly. It is Medium Risk and Medium Return. Gold can be invested in. If you don't identify the gold properly then you can get cheated, there is fear of theft, robbery, loss. Then there is real estate investment. Real state and gold investment are quite similar, here you have to buy property and sell it when the price goes down and you have to wait 2-5 years to get good returns. real  estate invest  is a very safe investment, its returns will come to you. But in the case of real state business, one thing should be kept in mind. You must pay attention to whether the land or property you buy has been sold more than once and whether its documents are correct.HIGH RISK-HIGH RETURN : example, the stock market invests in many big companies like Facebook, Cocacola, we buy the shares of these companies and they use that money in their business. If they make a profit there, the share price goes up and if they don't make a profit, the share price goes down. And this is how the stock market process works. Stork market business is High risk-High return profit business. In the stock market, you can become rich very quickly and you can become poor very quickly. If you have proper knowledge about stock market then you can invest this stock market money.The next place to invest is Mutual fund. Mutual fund is the best place for those who do not understand the share market very well. Mutual Fund  does exactly the same thing as you buy shares with personal money and mutual fund does what we who put money in mutual fund do. They do market analysis with that money and buy those shares, that means they also invest money in different companies. That means even if you keep money in mutual funds, you will get returns because there are many experts controlled by them. But in various countries, especially in low quality countries, a kind of fraud circle takes money from many people in the name of mutual funds and disappears at some point. If you can keep money in reliable mutual funds then your returns will come.Now it comes to fixed deposit, real estate, stock market, mutual fund, gold investment, any subject we can proceed with the investment target.",

      "body": "What you are trying to say is the same as what you will get when you read about investing or ask someone how to invest my money, but you cannot apply these tips.A low-risk investment is good, but if the return is about 5% and inflation is about 20%, then you are losing your money, as inflation is growing faster than the growth of your assets.Gold is not an investment, but rather an investment and savings. The price of gold in the long term performs well against inflation, but we cannot consider gold and stocks as an investment or real estate due to the lack of connection between these assets with each other, and therefore diversifying investment in all of them is the best.You did not mention high-risk investments as Bitcoin, which is the basis of discussions in this forum.",

But in the case of real state business, one thing should be kept in mind. You must pay attention to whether the land or property you buy has been sold more than once and whether its documents are correct.Firstly, it's real estate, not state. Secondly, you're wrong about waiting 2-5 years. There are people who specialize in flipping and they often remodel and repaint a house in under a month and sell it right away with a profit. Waiting a few years isn't a problem for many people. The cost of maintaining the property over these years is. Imagine that you buy a house for a million USD and expect to sell it for 1.1m in a few years, but it costs you 10k a year to maintain it, so you're down 30k in 3 years, and then you have to pay taxes from whatever it is that you make. Your margin is small and if in those 3 years someone throws a brick through the window, or rats decide to move in, you'll have to deal with it and it's gonna cost you.

If you are an employee, your salary will decrease in terms of value, and in return expenses will increase, and then the money that you can invest will decrease. Less investment, less return, and with the increase in expenses, you may reach a stage where you need additional work or increase working hours. To find yourself at the same point that started because of inflation, this means that it is additional work and fewer hours of sleep, then a worse investment.Inflation is a dilemma and you need a lot of precautions to avoid it, and investment may be one of them, but focusing on low-risk investments is better, as you may need liquidity at any time.",

Some people are always chasing instant returns, thinking they can pick stocks which will double or triple over a few days and putting them into the high risk category - as they often do no research on the company which might be a dog. However strong and growing companies will be constantly reinvesting their profits every year to expand or paying that money out to the shareholders. If that money gets constantly directed to buy more shares and the profit of the company goes up each year, it becomes an exponential force on your invested money, that's the true magic.",

When the government estimate the budget that is capital and expenditure for the year, they need money to execute the budget but with inflation in the economy, the money required will not be enough to execute all of the budget and if it stops half way, it means some aspect of the economy will suffer. Also as an individual, your salary will no longer be okay to take care of your needs because the purchasing power of your money has been reduced by high cost of goods which makes your money not sufficient anymore but the solution is to diversify in investment so that you can have more hands to generate income from which will cushion the effect of the inflation for you",

I keep thinking about where to invest and my money will run out. Many people have questions about where to invest and get safe and good returns.These words are appropriate.However, basically someone making an investment also needs to do money management that is wise enough so that we can also spend it as well as possible. Indeed, investing will be more valuable and potential than just saving money in the bank, but on the other hand, make sure that we have divided our funds that will be used for investment. Don't let us use our daily money or sudden funds. Make sure we also still have enough cash in our account for our needs and also for some unforeseen needs. Because maybe it won't be easy for us if one day we need money immediately and it's difficult to withdraw our investment. So, there is still a need for wise money management.On the other hand, investing can be done in several ways, not just one thing, but choose the one that is truly valuable, low risk, and also has potential. Investing in property and gold might be one of the plans. And if you want something with higher returns but higher risks, you can enter stocks or Bitcoin, but still adhere to the principle of a wise investment. This will not guarantee our success but at least we try to invest in some things that are worth it.",

You're after all holding money with a third party, which is even worse than holding gold, or real estate. With these things you have full control, but with fiat money on a savings account, you can't withdraw whenever you want. You have a certain period during which the money must be frozen, or all the profit is lost. Then, when you finally get your money, you find out that you barely even got anything in return because usually this profit is only 1 or 2% above the inflation rate. I highly agree, besides if our bank deposit exceeds the insurance policy and the banks goes bankrupt, anything that exceeds the amount insured will automatically be lost.  So I never considered banks as an example of low-risk, low-return because there is almost no profit when we save money in banks prior to inflation.  Putting our money in the bank is like putting our money in a safe box but with a third party controlling it and we have to ask for permission if we wanted to withdraw it.If both of you read carefully what OP wrote, he emphasized \"never leave money in a bank\" and as I understand it, he meant non-bank investments like gold, real estate, and stocks...But I will partially agree with you two that we shouldn't put a lot of money in the bank because it will only wear down our wealth. But that doesn't mean we will invest and not have any savings, life is full of surprises, so always have a small savings for that. And not depositing money in the bank does not mean that the bank will be useless, if we need to borrow money for business or something else, the bank will be where we need to go because no one will lend us money except banks.",

However, it's not only the risks that should be known, there is the timetable and just how willing the investor is in risking their money for possible zero balance (which can happen in any of these types of investment). Also, I didnt see bitcoin in your example.",
