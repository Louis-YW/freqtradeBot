  "content": "Iâ€™m in serious pain as Iâ€™ve lost another friend to Sickle Cell ðŸ’”.Over the years, Iâ€™ve lost a quite a number of friends to sickle cell disease. Iâ€™ve witness scenarios where some of them battled with serious health breakdown and wish they were never born. This is so painful because they never signed up for this. Such has happened to them because of either ignorance, stubbornness or selfishness on their parents part. Ignorance in the sense that many parents know nothing about genotype and as such, get married to each other and just start producing children. Stubbornness/Selfishness in the sense that some of these parents know fully well that they ainâ€™t compatible, yet they go ahead to get married and produce children all in the name of love or with the religion mindset that a miracle will happen and the genotype of their children will miraculously change. I consider this an act of wickedness, cuz why will you decide to jeopardize the lives of your unborn kids when youâ€™re not compatible with your spouse all in the name of love? Love is not enough to get married and produce kids!Couples get married every week, which is why It is imperative for the government to take the issue of genotype matching seriously by first creating a wide range of awareness/orientation on Genotype matching and also implement laws that discourages consanguineous marriages so as to help protect individuals and future generations, foster genetic diversity and promote public health.This doesnâ€™t just end with the government, but also, religious leaders who join couples together, should do well in sensitizing couples and ensuring that they are a match before getting them wedded. Yes, itâ€™s true that this cannot be entirely handled cuz no one can control who has sex and who doesnâ€™t regardless they are married couples or not, but a wide range of awareness/orientation will go a long way in saving future generations.PLEASE, KNOW YOUR GENOTYPE TODAY!",

      "body": "This topic you brought here really makes sense OP, because this genotype of a thing has destroyed so many courtship and marriages in the country, because they didn't take their time to carry out their medical test to know their genotype before courtship or marriage. I respect some church for this aspect, because they will be the one to Carry out their medical test before they will allow you to process your wedding in that particular church, and this procedure really saved one of my Christian childhood friend from having sickle cell children from his girlfriend because two of them are SS,SS that made the church to advice them not to marry because of their future children will experience sickle cell. Please brothers and sisters we should not joke with genotype when we are about to settle down in marriage.",

      "body": "A good topic and good analysis indeed. Another point of consideration should be young girls going into man's house at tender age in the name of pregnancy may not even think of test or compatibility. This should also be addressed as people get impregnated and born the children, there is 50% tendency of getting a sickle cell anemia. In addition to what you said , illicit sex and unwanted pregnancy have to be controlled to avoid this problems",

      "body": "Many of our parents were never aware of their genotype and mostly just got married without considering it. As a result, many sickle cell children were given birth to and are suffering because of the ignorance of their parents. As a more educated and enlightened generation we did not need to make the same mistakes by not taking into cognizance our genotype whenever we decide to get married to someone new or someone we have been dating. Two people with incompatible genotype should not get married even though they are in love because they will end up suffering an innocent child and then creating problems and financial trouble for them self tomorrow in trying to take good care of the child.",

      "body": "Seriously, genotype awareness campaign need to be spread more, make em sink into peoples mind of the dangers it will cause to your unborn kids when them don't marry someone compatible with them. At times, em the sadden my heart sae many people no d take am serious or ask questions relating to that during courtship. Their only focus na to care, and love one another without the thought of asking their partner about their genotype. The only time wey dem go like ask na when them wan marry after years of courtship. By then, if them come find about genotype of each other and the result shows that they are not compatible, they go begin to the reason how to take the risk of marrying each other base on love and years spent on courtship. That made me to begin to the ask some questions, why can't they save themselves from the stress and dilemma of knowing their partner genotype status at the beginning of the courtship? What are they afraid of? Is it that they were blinded by love of not to ask because they both look health. As the matter be so, na during courtship na when someone supposed to know the genotype of the peso wey em wan marry. Make em no be when em ready to marry, when em go begin to the ask. Because na during that courtship of a thing, unwanted pregnancy go fit enter and that time em down on them sae they are not compatible, and them don bring sickle cell anemia pikin to the world to suffer.My advice be sae, make everyone d ask questions about the genotype of the person wey dem d date before it's too late",

      "body": "This has being a major problem to families that the father and the mother was ignorant of checking their genotype before settling down. Some people are still making this mistake by putting live first instead of a healthy family life. I know of a friend that was deeply in love with his girlfriend but along the line he broke up with her due to their genotype which will lead to a problem if they get married. We should think more of our future happiness and not only that of today. A healthy family is a wealthy family,prevent your children from premature death by marrying the right person with the perfect genotype. Our children are our happiness,SS do find it difficult to give birth to children the chance of surviving is 50-50.",

This na one important point, ignorance and some no even send. Those people wey dey do backyard runs wey go just dey sleep around at any hidden opportunity for dark places because dem want to prove smartness fall in this category as dem no even get time for protection both boy and the girl, as we know birds of same feathers dey fly together. So before you know am belle don enter and some don enter marriage like that even deir parents no go send to investigate certain stuff.Quote from: Framelover on July 09, 2023, 06:24:15 PMStubbornness/Selfishness in the sense that some of these parents know fully well that they ainâ€™t compatible, yet they go ahead to get married and produce children all in the name of love or with the religion mindset that a miracle will happen and the genotype of their children will miraculously change. This na another good point. Love with the hope say things like genotype go miraculous change based on the stories wey dem don hear. I no talk say miracle no dey because miracle no dey tire Jesus but we also need to help ourselves as human beings and if God add hand for us e go become grace.Really, na now some of us don begin know say those days wey dem go born pikin wetin few years of birth the pikin don die and dem born another one the same thing go happen dem go come say na mamiwater pikin, abiku, ogbanje etc, hmmm na genotype issue the thing go be oo. But I believe say the awareness don dey high now about the medical compatibility of spouces on like before because the rate of sickle cell (SS) people wey I dey see around don really reduce.",
