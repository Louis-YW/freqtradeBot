  "content": "BITCOIN IS DEAD!ExplanationThere is an energy and raw materials crisis all over the world (in connection with situation in UA). People in Europe are switching to coal. Ethereum swithing to a less energy-intensive model PoSBTC is doomed to extinction if it doesn't switch to PoS. But if BTC will be switch to PoS - then it will cease to be BTCThat's why BTC is dead. In the conditions of the world energy crisis, it is becoming more and more difficult to mine BTC (especcially on PoW model)Bitcoin and Its Failing Technology...On analyzing the history of Bitcoin, one can see a shift from currency to an asset exhibiting store-of-value properties. This transition has probably left the technology of Bitcoin to play catch-up. In a world as fast-paced as ours, Bitcoin's technology is running behind by at least five years.Energy efficiency and scalability are two of the most severe issues Bitcoin faces. If not addressed, these issues could very well dethrone Bitcoin.POW or Proof of Work is the core technology behind Bitcoin, and without delving deep into the technology, one can ascertain the fact that POW is not in the best interest of today's world. Recent studies show that energy consumption from Bitcoin mining around the world could equal the energy consumption of a whole country.Moreover, if Bitcoin is to fulfill its true goal and be the currency of the people, as it was supposed to, it has to be more scalable. And scalability is one of the reasons that has hindered the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin...https://toughnickel.com/personal-finance/5-Coins-that-can-be-Bitcoin-Killers",

      "body": "It seems that your claim and your explanation don't add up together. You're saying that Bitcoin is dead because of the energy crisis all over the world, and since Bitcoin's PoW is an energy-intensive model, it is bound to die or is already facing its demise. However, if we look at Bitcoin's difficulty chart, it is far from falling down, meaning people remain very much interested in mining despite your so-called energy crisis. So how are we going to interpret this? It would either be that Bitcoin has grown green just like what you claim with your BSV and therefore it doesn't care about the energy crisis, or that despite the ongoing energy crisis the interest to support Bitcoin remains very strong, and that despite the price falling to $20,000 it is still worth mining Bitcoin. So it's far from going dead, then.",

It's time for BTC to go to the museum. Everyone sees how BTC becomes heavy and clumsy.I don't know what you're pulling off and saying that kind of thing on Bitcoin. Because if I look at the chart you showed in the topic you made it is very far from what you say Bitcoin is dead. And then for me, your reason is superficial, the energy crisis is very irrelevant to the fall of bitcoin, to be honest.Or maybe you're just saying this so you can spread FUD against Bitcoin so that just in case its value drops, even more, you'll take advantage of the opportunity to buy bitcoin. And I don't think that style will work on this forum anymore.Anyway, it's your opinion and I respect that. Although the ones you mentioned are not good for bitcoin it's a shame.",

You are too pessimistic about other people's products, and too optimistic about your own product.If the energy crisis can't mine Bitcoins, and Bitcoins die, then what's the current 19 million Bitcoins in circulation for? Is the price of Bitcoin $20k today because it can still be mined?It should be the way you think, if Bitcoin can't be mined because of the energy crisis, Bitcoin will be increasingly difficult to obtain, then most likely the price of Bitcoin will be higher.
