How I wish that I also bought some back during the day it is so cheap.  But of course who knows what will be the future right.  I think those who bought probably didnt realize also that it will skyrocket later on.  So if you are a shitcoin risk taker then congrats on a life changing experience.",

Here Shiba Inu is a strong project and has considerable support many investors are also entering because Shiba Inu was able to attract attention when it first entered Binance. Now all investors have taken advantage of it and we come with high hopes that it will happen again. No one knows because investing in the long term can answer all of that.",

There's nothing wrong with risking as long as we know the consequences of it but we shouldn't always rely on Elon's statements because some investors already know what to avoid while others are just taking advantage of the coins that he hypes. If he influences a coin, it doesn't mean that it could strike a good price again. Things could never be the same again because most investors already know that Elon only benefits by manipulating meme coins.",

But not a few other meme tokens that make losses to the holder. Many take advantage of the existence of Shiba meme tokens by developing other meme tokens as a bridge for investors.There was nothing wrong with Shiba, but many fake Shiba appeared after that. If you check the Dex exchange, there are hundreds of meme tokens both associating their names with Shiba and those unrelated to Shiba.The $10 we spend on meme tokens isn't a huge amount. However, if we join 10 meme projects it will cost $100. So my advice, limit your sensations even if they are real.",

And this is the coin that forever altered our perception of meme coins. And I also agree with a point of yours; that is, you say it is really tough to achieve more than 1000% for Shiba Inu. I agree, but sometimes I think the market is in a slump, but the Shiba Inu still performs well; then, when the market recovers, is it possible to make more than 10x profit? I thought it was because of the strongest team behind Shiba Inu. Let's see what happens with this coin. I hope it will give us some profit. Despite the fact that we are not the first to have a Shiba Inu. But we only have some hope for it.",
