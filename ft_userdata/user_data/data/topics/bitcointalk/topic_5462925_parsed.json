However, it makes me believe that there are some coins that we think are trash, which is not the truth, and those coins also need to be hoarded because they may generate money that we don't expect.However, it surprises me when I see the money you mentioned, which gives me the idea of holding on to my valuable coins for a very long period of time. However, those who bought those coins have benefited from it because they have made a profit that they did not even think of.",

Events like this only bring some certain questions to my mind; How many of these people were patient to hold till the time it pumped to a significant amount, or the fear of losing caused them to sell so early. How do they take care of there holdings without losing it to scammers or losing the keys and yet to find it  Certainly this are not just question but also some recommendations as to we the future holders.",

At the same time, I was part-time working at a clothing apparel store co-owned by my mom and aunt from the United States. I didn’t even have a smartphone and was using only a keypad one. I’ve got zero knowledge and awareness about Bitcoin that time. I only knew how to play DOTA when I have free time in a gaming shop.God I know how this feels but it is what it is. Early adopters and testers are getting blessed and rewarded at the end.",

In 2009, this reward was worth almost nothing. That is, in fact, at that time it was the smallest airdrop, because the testers received almost nothing and it was more like a symbolic reward, how to say thank you.Another point. This was the first airdrop among cryptocurrencies (the rest of the altcoins started much later, which gave a huge head start to bitcoin) and if you rank \"The most generous airdrop in the crypto history\", then you need to compare the value of assets (altcoin, token, NFT, which you are talking about) over a period of about 14 years (2009-2023). Such a comparison is not entirely accurate in reality.",

      "body": "Truly Bitcoin is indeed a record holder.  In all ways, I can see the output to be far surpassing which no other coin or alt can be compared to.  For record purposes, Bitcoin has the best airdrop record of all time. There has never been a coin that grew in price the way Bitcoin did years back. Others did  airdropped at high price and gradually faded away but Bitcoin dropped low and grew up with time and today it has made a name for itself on the blockchain which no other can achieve. I was wondering if there are still holders who held since the very first day they received theirs till this very moment. Notwithstanding, when I looked at your upload, the year I saw took me back to when I was still very young then as  a student. Although I had internet knowledge but I never heard about Bitcoin then because if I had such knowledge then, hopefully I would have tapped into it as an early adopter. Possibly  if not as earlier as then, maybe as time went on then but it is still not too late I am here. I have learnt alot the time I have spent on blockchain and on this platform.Thanks for this article of yours. It reflects days of early beginnings.",

They wouldn't have been able to overcome several faith-shaking FUD. For those that kept the faith, their profit is a motivation for us to keep hodling. In the future, we might look back and say that the Bitcoins we are earning or buying currently are like airdrops because the price will be what most of us might not be able to afford.

There might be some coins that have such potential but why go for copycats when you already know the original?

HODL!!!Honestly this is a nice discovery, no wonder every other coin in cryptocurrency is regarded as a plagiarized copy of bitcoin, this include all memecoins, tokens, airdrops, everything all begins with bitcoin, maybe this will also help in understanding the reason why bitcoin is reagarded as the most acceptable digital currency and the king of cryptocurrencies, if bitcoin had only exist maybe there couldn't have been more of cryptocurrency scam we had with altcoins, bitcoin remains the only reliable cryptocurrency to be accepted as a legal means of making payments or a unit of store of value, i wonder how much those airdrops would have amount to worth today for it holders.",

You could literally skip a meal and get that. If you knew about bitcoin when it was sub $1 it was a strike of luck, like winning the lottery. All you had to do is get some from a faucet or ask someone to send it to you and forget about it. 10 years later you're a millionaire I'd say that one of the best if not the best widely available airdrop was BCH. Imagine that you were in bitcoin in 2010, 2011, or 2021, when you could buy 1 bitcoin for less than $5, so spending $500 would give you over 100 bitcoin. In 2018 that would give you 100 BCH for free that you'd be able to sell for $1k a piece, earning 100k for literally nothing, as a reward for holding your bitcoin.",

And i think those testers are the most luckiest people on the earth if they still have those BTC because that how they are valuable if they are forgotten or lost then they are waste i think. But, the amount of airdrop is a lot and if they have hold it as you said in the last that we should hodl. Then only we can become rich. Once i saw a picture on Tiktok video so i just cropped it by taking SS and here it is:This piece of photo also conveying the same message that if those who have hold the BTC from the early days to till now or for at least 5 years they must have become billionaire now. That's why i said they are the luckiest people on earth. I hope we come to get that chance but i don't know about technology at that time even there was no internet in my area at that time. I think at that time 2008 i might be in Kindergarten maybe or maybe just not started studies yet. I don't know exactly but there was no way that i could come to know about BTC at that time. But i am grateful that, i at least came to know about it in 2018 and then i joined this platform in 2021 and now i have more knowledge than before more BTC than before and they are keep adding and i wish that addition will never stop.
