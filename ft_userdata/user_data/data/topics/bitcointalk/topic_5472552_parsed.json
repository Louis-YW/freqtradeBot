Glad you tagged him a fudster The total supply of Bitcoin does not stop mass adoption because it has decimal meaning you can own fraction of it. When the demand is huge, it just means the price will rise and that will not hinder mass adoption. He obviously do not know that we have Sats to take care of his concern. For technical identification,  items and commodities can just be priced in Sats.",

Imagine what it is like to watch the price of bitcoin going up and up and you don’t have any. You are basically losing money for not investing in btc. They are just like how I described it. They are hemorrhaging money every minute and they gettin mad because other people driving lambos and flying jets while these poor cunts walk to their day job where they have been wage slaving since forever. Getting rich is very easy. You just have to want it. If you want it, go grab it and its yours. Most poor people refuse to get rich even if the opportunity was dangling right before their eyes. They see it but they don’t have the capacity to understand what they are seeing.",

I have a friend who did not want to invest in Bitcoin because he thought that he had to buy one Bitcoin or similar fiat money such as 1/2 Bitcoin or 1/4 Bitcoin only, and it is not possible to buy $5 in Bitcoin.If all people used Bitcoin, there would be enough for them because we would not reach the price 1 Bitcoin equals 1 dollar, or then 1 dollar would have no value. there is enough Bitcoin for the entire world's population for the next 100 years.",

It will make this discussion more interesting, it's complete lack of knowledge about Bitcoin that's why someone can say that the max supply of Bitcoin is very smaller compare to people living around the world today.There will come a time where the Sats of Bitcoin will be very valuable than what they are today, for those thinking that they are late to the game, they lack the knowledge is all, Bitcoin scarcity is just getting started, if you are smart you will start packing up what you can afford on your every paycheck per month. My advice is if such people aren't ready to learn you can't do a thing about it, leave them and let them Fud as this is all they are capable of at the moment, I know few people that started as a fudsters and in time they choose to do some research, today they already joined the train, they are no more fudsters but long term investors.",

Every single person in the world can have Bitcoin as long as they can afford to buy them because when someone doesn't have Bitcoin and wants to buy some, they will need to buy them at whatever price the people are selling them at the market.So, the supply is enough for everyone, and just because the supply is limited, it will support the increment of the price because those who have Bitcoins will surely start asking for higher prices if the demand keeps increasing, and since a single Bitcoin has 100 units in it, there will always be enough no matter how high its price gets.",
