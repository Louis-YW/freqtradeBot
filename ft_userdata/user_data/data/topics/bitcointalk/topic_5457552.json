  "content": "Maybe a good idea to start when in need for some help.Or maybe not, and we will find something else.Im not sure if this is the right section to place this. If not, please guide me and don´t be mad. I´m not that bad I need to combine the knowledge I gained during the years I was away with the knowledge I had when I was active on this and other forums. It's so overwhelming to think about what I could do, but I need to find a way to build it up gradually.It's quite overwhelming, and I believe I will find my business here with time, or perhaps someone will lend a helping hand. But standing still means moving backward, so I'll try to pursue the ideas that come to mind.Is it of interest for someone to advertise on a news website in a Western European country where almost everyone, at the very least, speaks English reasonably well?It is a site where \"traditional\" individuals are active. It's a reasonably popular news and opinion website where people who oppose globalization, the elimination of cash, and bank control tend to gather. It has been active since 2019.During the pandemic, we had a day with 100,000 visitors. Quite impressive for a small country.  However, those were exceptional times when everyone was indoors and wanted to know everything. The platform has now become a space for regular visitors, but it still maintains good traffic, and it continues to grow.Now, many advertisements that could be offered here are probably not the best fit for my website.However, for serious Bitcoin companies or crypto casinos (as there are gamblers in every target audience), it could be interesting, and I would prefer to advertise for your businesses rather than lining the pockets of Google Ads or other multinational corporations. I had Google Ads before, but I removed them quickly. I cannot look at myself in the mirror knowing that I'm helping those guys gain more and more power. (That's how I see it, please don't feel attacked if you have a different view. Everyone has their own truth, and I regularly reflect on whether my truths are still defensible). The same goes for regulated casinos that interfere with the gambling habits of individuals who find their relaxation in it.And I want to earn cryptos, no dollars/euros! No slave of the state like I have been, without realising it, the last 4 years. Or think about blogposting with backlinks. Knowing what our audience is...EDIT:Here are some of the stats. The stats come from Jetpack.The website opened the first of october 2019.https://ibb.co/C7y1zVthttps://ibb.co/09nskTZhttps://ibb.co/yRV5q2XSome stats are missing. I have switched to Google Analytics for a while.The extreme high numbers were during the corona-period.The website has 3k+ subscribers for push-notificationsWe have a newsletter with an email list.More info on request. No secrets.(I tried to post the images directly visisble, but I can´t get it done).The website is:commonsensetv.nlBut a partner will have access to all stats.",

I did this more or less, problem is it is still a mess :DThat´s also because every day being and reading here let´s me understand more about this forum and about how I should work and present myself on this forum.And, although I was in such a great ridiculous need: Opening with a post asking for a loan was probable the worst error. I thought: As long as I am honest and I can always prove what I say, there might be a chance. Instead of that, naturally, people start asking me a lot of questions and I am ending up writing almost a book about myself here. For interested people, here you can read more about what I am, what I do and what I want and offer:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457552.msg62460495#msg62460495https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457686.msg62466256#msg62466256https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457641.msg62464282#msg62464282Website stats:https://ibb.co/C7y1zVthttps://ibb.co/09nskTZhttps://ibb.co/yRV5q2XI´m not sure to lock this topic or leave it open?Some potential partners look here, some at other places.",

It's actually a smart move because some advertisers might want more info before they decide to reach out. One thing I noticed though is that you didn't mention the address of your site. It could be helpful to include that so people know exactly what your site is all about.Quote from: Freedom4All on June 29, 2023, 03:11:58 PMSome potential partners look here, some at other places.That's why it's always better to keep the discussion in one thread and not open multiple topics about the same thing.",
