For those that have teenage children here, how do you cope with them?  Let's learn. I remember one of the lessons when we were studying about child adolescents and one factor that it said was all about being curious. Yes, these teens are very curious in knowing things and that's where they get too aggressive in knowing more about things that they are interested in. You suggested the right thing about being more open to communication with her teen because if she's so open about it, whatever her teen is experiencing, it will be said. And that's how they get the attention of the young ones that have high spirits and seeking something new which might be one factor of their future careers or path they'd like to take.",

I don't know what country or culture are you from but I would also suggest her to consider giving some basic sexual education to the child, nothing explicit, just the basics so he can understand why he may be feeling what he is feeling towards girls of his age, how to handle it and how to avoid getting in trouble in the mid and long term.  Educating children is important.",

For those that have teenage children here, how do you cope with them?  Let's learn.  At this stage, it is very difficult to control most teenagers. They are now been influenced by many societal factors such as social media, peers, and other environmental factors. The best thing to do at this stage is to be friendly with them. This is the only way they can open up to you as a parent. Don't act like you didn't go through the same process. Almost every adult suffered from youthful exuberance, so we should treat them carefully. At this stage, they want independence and want to experiment with almost everything. If your try to be judgmental and authoritative, they will become secretive and stop seeking advice from you. This will make them start seeking advice from peers and the internet. In summary, every parent should be friendly to their children so that they will be free to share their fears, views, and experience with them.Children also learn a lot from their parents. If you want your teenager to behave well, the parent must be a good role model. If you don't want your child to keep late nights, you shouldn't also do that. Children learn more by example than by instruction. You should behave the way you want your children to act.",

      "body": "Youthful exuberance, most adults passed through this stage of life. So it is to be expected because it's a phase of life. The challenge here is how parents choose to handle it. Parents are naturally protective of their children and this is normal. But at a stage, the child feels that he or she is grown up and needs space to make their own decisions. Whereas the parent still sees them as the young child that needs guidance. Most times this leads to conflicts in the home. Parents should understand that at this stage, their children are trying to define their identities. This is the time that parents need to be more of a friend to the youth, mostly advising and directing them to make right decisions for them selves. Parents need to understand that after this stage, the youth will enter adulthood. So it is more of a transition period. Having this thoughts in mind will surely help parents to cope better at this stage of their children.",

This entails establishing clear rules and regulations but also expressing love and acceptance. Also, to foster an environment of trust and transparency.Also, harassment is a genuine problem for many teenagers, and it may have a major influence on their mental health. I wanted to discuss social media and technology. Teenagers are frequently overly attached to their electronics, and it can be difficult to manage time spent watching television with other activities. Setting time spent on social media or the internet, or encouraging them to take part in other activities such as sports,",

This behavior can manifest in different forms, such as high energy levels, risk-taking behavior, and also desire for independence. Nowadays, lack of limits imposed to teenagers and lack of respect displayed by teenagers is considered normal even from the biological perspective, since the science says their brains aren't totally developed yet, therefore they tend to have such noxious behaviors mentioned by you.However, why teenagers from previous generations weren't exactly like this? Responsabilities were taken since an early age, traditions were important, and what the elders had to say and advise mattered. Now these teenagers are writting the rules, as there wasn't anything to consider before their existence. They are the pinnacle of ethics, morals and everything they defend must be accepted by society.This phenomenon is more evident in the Western world, so no surprises why it's so decaying from a social and fraternal point of view. If you want to avoid this plague from falling over your heirs, make sure to educate themselves with timeless values, which transcend the trends of the modern era, and the barbarism of ancient times.",

Children are gift from God and we must make sure that they keep doing the right thing rather than seeing them do the wrong thing and hoping that they would change with time. We need to be polite with children and make them our friend so that we can easily correct them with simplicity not with too much of string hand. We need to understand them and why they are behaving in an immoral manner for proper corection.",
