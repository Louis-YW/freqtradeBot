I Know that most bitcoiners have met up to 3 bear market as they became bitcoiners in the ecosystem. I came to Know bitcoin fully in the bullish market which was  December 2021 and became interested in February 2022. As of then I didn't know what is bullish market and bearish market, this terms and others were helped by local chats. Rising & FallingEven human life is rising and falling  in nature, and this is equivalent to all living organisms and bitcoin is a \"Living Organism\" that grow from small (2009, $0.00) to high (2022 , $19079.00) level, this is the present price but it was higher in the late 2021 and early 2022.Therefore, how many bullish and bearish markets have you met as you become a bitcoiner?Let know the old and the new bitcoiners",

Because we are still new to crypto.But I really got into crypto in 2017, at that time Bitcoin was trending in the media, but a bull run with the highest price in 2018. After that, Bitcoin price dropped exactly as it is now, maybe we as crypto lovers become the subject of ridicule due to the losses we experienced, because we do not really understand the crypto market. However, we do not stop to continue to work, whether following the bounty program, trading and so on. In 2020 Bitcoin and the crypto market are trending again in the media, and become the subject of conversation among the public. And the bull run takes place in 2021 with a record high of +$68,700. That means, as long as I know crypto, especially Bitcoin, bullish and bearish have happened twice.In conclusion, the current state of the crypto market does not make me feel worried about holding Bitcoin. In fact I keep increasing the amount of Bitcoin even though the condition of the USD balance seems to be decreasing. I am optimistic that Bitcoin or the crypto market will head to the moon in 2024. But this is not advice for investment, just sharing experiences, maybe it can be knowledge about crypto for myself.",

Every market has highs and lows. Bitcoin had big bull market in 2013, 2017 and 2021, followed by bear markets, but they were not similar to each other. The 2021 market only increased the ATH by a factor of 3.5 - from 20k of 2017 to 69k of 2021. While the 2017 market increased the ATH from $1,200 to $20,000. So you can say that the relative growth rate is slowing down. It could be that the future cycles will be even less remarkable. Or maybe Bitcoin will even stop being so cyclic.",

Once I meet with Bitcoin the price was approx $3K, from there start bull, and went to $19K+ which was an ATH 2017 if I can recall correctly. So after that, I meet with bear again which was $3K again. Then start bull after a few years likely 2021 went 70K. Definitely, still, it's ATH for Bitcoin. As of now, we are in a bear market. Hope soon we will see another ATH based on past experience.",

It doesn't matter how big it is, but it's there.Bearish has discouraged me in the past as bitcoin was not yet a decade old at first, but now this perception has changed and I no longer worry about the future as bitcoin continues to grow and be adopted in different countries. Increasingly hospitable legality and the strength of a thriving community are some of the things that convinced me about bitcoin's future. So, no matter how bearish or bullish we are, that's only dynamics decorate the journey.",

      "body": "many people throw around \"bull\" and \"bear\" whenever there is a up or down movement. but a true bull market is when the price moves and stays above 20% of a previous low for 6 monthsfor instance the 2020 low was $4.8k (+20%=$5.7k) .. we are still way above the $5.7k of the previous lowa bear is when the price drops below a ATH by 20% and stays below that amount for over 6 monthsEG the last ATH was $70k(-20%=$56k) bitcoin stayed below $56k for more then 6 months so yes a bear market occurredas for now where 2022 low reached $17,600 (+20%=$21k)but we have not stayed above $21k for 6 months so its not a bull market. we are still in the bear of last year.. but.. still in bull of the last 2 yearsyep if you bought in 2020 low. you are bullish todayif you bought in 2021 you are bearish nowi got most of my haul in 2012.. so im always bullish on bitcoinbulls and bears are not changes daily. they are descriptors after assessing the last 6month+",

I had a good paying job but around that time there are noises that our projects are going on a downsized process. Nevertheless, our clients travel to our offices and assured that everything is going to be fine (our client is US based). So we will all feel good that we will still have projects when everyone around us is being laid-off. Alas, in 3 months time, we were all axe, Lol. So that is a bearish market in my life. Although after that, I was able to find a new job, and not just one, but I did have a side job as a freelancer and I'm getting a pay that even exceeds my daily 9-5 job, so it's bullish time for me.",

I can remember those days, because in the speculation threads were open stating that the price could go close to $8000. The real growth happened much higher reaching around $20k.",

But if you look at history, the previous cycles were similar. In the end, the conclusion one draws is that these are good times to buy or to accumulate more if you tend to make frequent purchases. Everyone likes the price to keep going up, but those who sell now are selling because they have done the wrong thing, because they have bought with money that they could have used for other things, or out of fear, which is the opposite of what they should do.",

I was more bullish than ever only to end up disappointed when the long bearish months and years followed. But I held on. I risked it all when I stuck with Bitcoin from $20,000 all the way to $3,000, although necessities also compelled me to convert a number of times along the way whether the price was high or low. Nevertheless, I remained a HODLer. So this current bear market is more or less nothing to me. Back in my earliest years with Bitcoin, $20,000 was only a wish. But it happened in 2017. Now, in 2022, it is something that a lot is worried about. That's what I call growth.",

At that time, my knowledge and experience were not what it is now and I was very disappointed to see bitcoin drop from $20k to $3k in 2018, it can be said that I almost completely lost faith in bitcoin. It was truly a complete and worst experience in a bear season.

I play between the two positions and make this both more interesting and difficult. But the point is not how much we encounter a bear market, but how much we learn that a bear market is a space given to anyone who wants to take a discount. That's all I thought.

But since I fully understand Bitcoin in the community, I think this is the longest bearish season I have ever experienced in the community that caused many bitcoiners packing, because they are used to month or few months dump before it will pump higher for those that invested during the dump season will have the opportunity to make a good income from their investments.",
