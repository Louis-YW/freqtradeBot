      "body": "True. Decisions should be made with all factors in mind. Just because the price seems bullish doesn't mean we should just make decisions without proper analysis. But for those planning or thinking of buying Bitcoin and holding it for a long time, I'd advise they buy it now. As you said, there's a possibility that there might be resistance at $41k - $42k (even though it's at $44k now), which means that could also be the lowest it would get, so it's better to just buy now instead of waiting and hoping for the price to drop because, in my opinion, it won't. I don't think the Bitcoin price will go below $40k  and this is me not being too optimistic. We're in a bull run that is heading towards events that would push the price up even further. The bitcoin spot ETF might have a positive effect on price but not as much as the next Bitcoin halving. So for now, I guess it's okay to apply caution, but we should also be ready to take some calculated risk. As long as you risk what you can afford to lose you'll be good",

      "body": "Because the price has risen quite high, usually there will be a correction afterwards but so far there has been no correction and the price is still consistently rising. In my opinion, the DCA method can be done because there is a possibility that Bitcoin will continue to rise until it approaches 50k.At times like this it is difficult to make choices, buy now afraid of a big correction, don't buy afraid of going up until it reaches a new ATH. Halvings and ETFs are big news that can affect market sentiment. However, we must be careful in making decisions and understand the risks we will face, DCA remains the best for now so that we do not miss this moment.",

It is better to be a low coiner than a no coiner.This is what im really trying to avoid on which you would really be having that kind of behavior that you do often do make out some checks when it comes to price on which we know that the market is volatile on the first place on which means that there's no way that you could really be able to know on where it would really be heading next. If you are really that seeing Bitcoins potential and possibility of those huge spike in price in the future then its not bad to make out some decision on making some investment into it but just like been said that even just holding your assets here on crypto space would really be a touch challenge.When it comes to technical approach in regarding on the price, it isnt something that could be precise most of the time. There would into those people who are really that relying with those analysis and there are ones who would be skeptical. It would be just entirely be depending on how you would really be dealing up into this market.We can make our own analysis and on how we do really be that handling ourselves into this market.",

This doesn't apply to us, but to others it might.There must be a balance between a long-term strategy and a Bitcoin portfolio owned, if only a few Bitcoins are held it will not be worth the wait.Because long-term, there is no exact time how many years it will take to reach the price target to be achieved. The best way to overcome this is with DCA, so that the Bitcoin portfolio will continue to grow, albeit gradually. and patience is certainly the main thing that needs to be trained, for me, it will not be a problem as long as long-term investment uses money that is not used for other purposes, And confident that a new ATH will soon be achieved.We just need to follow the flow and have to stay afloat.",

Last year though was very different, it was a full bear market and most likely the majority just keeps on a hard grind as it's hard to see the price going to the lowest $15k because of the FTX collapse. But this year, it's over, we have gotten over that news, sentiments are very bullish.And that $40k mark is still going to be our biggest support. We've seen the price almost going to $45k, but then again, speculators taking profits as the price is on the sideway pattern at $40k-$42k. Perhaps I will say that we should look long term though, at least in the next 2 years as it will be very bullish for us.",
