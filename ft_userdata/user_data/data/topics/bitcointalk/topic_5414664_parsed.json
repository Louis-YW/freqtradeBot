I don't see any effect receiving them if you only receive it only in your one address but if the amount is too small better you manually choose what coin you want to spend because it can affect the transaction size which could lead to a high transaction fee excluding it can save more fees.

Correct me if I'm wrong.It's a privacy problem, not necessarily a security problem so yea.As for MetaMask, Ethereum and other smart contract chains uses a different transaction model as Bitcoin whereas Ethereum/etc just reuses addresses by default; so dust attacks aren't really needed. The tokens you get on your MetaMask wallet are scams that could potentially execute malicious code when trying to move them.",

Dust attack are usually common when miner fees are low and usually never in strong bull markets. But they are hoping you just send all your bitcoins from your wallet from all your addresses and your privacy is affected by linking all your wallets and addresses together.Also very common on ETH. But with ETH they send you thousands of some unknown coin. You google where to sell it and it’s some unknown exchange where the coin has high value. Only way to sell is to put in your private seeds and all your coins and tokens are gone, very common scam and many fall for it.",

I remember the first time I got a shady token, I was  so excited thinking it came from an airdrop and its value is also huge but I only found out the truth when I am about to sell them because the transaction always fails as it needs a lot of gas fees to be able to swap it.We must be careful when dealing with these random coins. Much better if we don't touch them if we want to stay away from trouble. I never experience this to a btc wallet but thanks for this thread. Now I now that it's also possible. I hope wallet devs can do something to combat this issue soon.",

But in a dust attack, the attacker may prefer to increase the amount with few satoshi. The main purpose of the attack is to track where the victim is sending coins to which any amount sent to the victims can help in doing. Even if it is not a dust attack, it should be assumed and seen as a dust attack and should be avoided as long as the victim do not know the source. But the amount sent is not that big too but small.",
