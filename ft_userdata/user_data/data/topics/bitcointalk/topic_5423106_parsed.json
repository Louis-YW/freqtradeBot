So what do you want to achieve?Do you want to automate it for solar power?I can't seem to find an API command yet but I guess it uses Cgminer API check the APIs below- https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer/blob/master/API-READMEOr instead, try to check awesomeminer managing tool and I think they do have feature to auto sleep and start the miner when needed.",
