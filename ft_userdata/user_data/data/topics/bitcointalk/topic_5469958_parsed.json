And how did you know what merit was for? Probably maybe through reading the rules you will say. Then I will say you can find your way to that rules thread to learn a thing about the forum. Also since you were able to navigate your way around to a merit board then try to check on the pined posts on this board it will guide you. A piece of advice don’t chase em merits they will never come, just contribute to the forum by sharing your knowledge and also gain more knowledge if that’s truly why you’re here Check out this thread by Ratimov",

It's just unfortunate how our generation will visit a place without bothering to know about the rules and regulations guiding it. The important thing now is that OP is here and willing to learn about the forum.To OP, all the necessary threads you need to read to get yourself familiar with the forum has been suggested for you in the comments section but I think it's also important to read this welcome message and know where to start from. This forum is actually a nice place to be and I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay if you can keep to terms and abide by the ethics. You don't only read the rules but you follow them accordingly so as to not shorten your stay here. I join the rest of the forum members to welcome you once again.",

And you can always ask any question regarding about what topics you want to discuss since to many people here are willing to help those newbie who's eager to upgrade their knowledge regarding on cryptocurrencies. Also don't ever think that its so dumb for a person to always ask some question since its normal since its more better to ask than learning nothing on some topics that quietly help for those people who's starting up. You can also use the forum search bar to easily navigate those old post which is also a big help for you to know the past discussion made by many people.Also stay updated on latest and be active for sure you can learn a lot of things in this forum.",

But its just some newbie doesn't like to spend much time to do some research that's why for them its difficult to learn about bitcoin since they want an easy one for their selves then automatically they can start earning bitcoin as soon as they can. This is not good action that's why many of them fall on wrong information so for them not to face in such situations its really better for them to start researching many information as they can so that they can fully understand on how those information they want to understand works and what are important things for them to avoid. If he also do research for sure he will never create this thread but rather reading those past topics created by other newbie.",
