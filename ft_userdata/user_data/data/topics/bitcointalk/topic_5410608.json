Built by South African developer Kgothatso Ngako, the new SMS-based service is named Machankura, a slang South African word for money.But no matter what these would be, there would be a third party involved that will help the users to connect to the internet, the bitcoin blockchain is online and needs internet access.",

I'd agree with this one, phones/texts are generally easy to attack afaik (especially without an Internet connection) and this might make an attacker try/succeed at targeting certain areas where this is used a lot to send funds to themselves (it might not be much they'd get away with but it could add up to quite a bit of they attack several people/a large town).Quote from: Eternad on August 20, 2022, 03:32:02 PMCorrect me if Iâ€™m wrong but this kind of Bitcoin transaction is just like an IOU since itâ€™s not recorded on blockchain. Iâ€™m not totally familiar on this kind of method but I preferred transaction being recorded on blockchain to be valid It's probably a way crypto might be able to compete with banks though in some areas. You are handing over the custody of your crypto to a third party too which I think would be quite a drawback (you're still relying on their security as well as your phone's and your network's).",

I guess if they can't afford to pay electricity and internet cost, I don't think they have a plan to buy Bitcoin because usually they're lack of financial.",

As far as we know, bitcoin transactions must be supported by the internet, nowadays it seems impossible to do transactions without the internet as a transaction facility, but in today era I think many blockchain developers and companies are starting to look for solutions to overcome this, such as by Criptolago, a Venezuelan company that is now starting to develop a digital system that allows sending bitcoins only through a short message service or SMS.For now it looks impossible but I think in the next 1 or 2 years it will be very possible to do.",

Though this kind of transaction is not totally worthless, it really requires some guides for the people who use it will prevent themselves from getting scammed. right now, I just prefer the usual transactions we are doing so far because for me it is the safest.",

You send the signals to some software through your cell phone without internet, and then that signal gets passed to a machine which carry out the commands for you while being connected to the internet? Basically, no offline transactions are possible in crypto world without internet. Otherwise, no data will be saved, and you can't move assets from one place to another, right?",

I read in an article that we can send Bitcoin without the internet and it is true. However, the concept is almost the same as the internet, it is only using other things as the media to transfer Bitcoin.There are 4 alternatives that we can use to transfer Bitcoin:1. Waves of Amateur Radio2. SMSPushTX3. Pony Direct4. Blockstream SatelliteFor complete information, you can read here: https://cryptomode.com/4-ways-to-use-the-bitcoin-network-without-an-internet-connection/However, I think it is still easier to use the internet to send Bitcoin than using those 4 alternatives above. So, to send Bitcoin in an effective way, we always need the internet. The Internet is still irreplaceable, it is something that has a vital role for the existence and development of Bitcoin.",
