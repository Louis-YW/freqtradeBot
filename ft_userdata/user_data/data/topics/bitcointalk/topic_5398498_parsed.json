  "content": "Hey everyone! I just wanted to share a story of mine about using Bitcoin, defying Putin's regime and getting a cool zipped hoodie all at once. I went to a pro-Ukrainian rally in a city I currently live in, and I saw a couple in merch that I really liked: a blue hoodie with yellow text, and a yellow hoodie with blue text (colors of the Ukrainian flag). The text is in Russian, the famous \"Russian warship\" phrase. I asked them where they bought it, but it turned out they've made them themselves. They said they make them for friends in exchange for a donation to a Ukrainian charity of one's choice, and said they can make me one if I'm interested. It's kind of their way to do something to support Ukraine. I asked if it would be okay for me to donate to a charity in Bitcoin, not fiat. They said that it's all up to me. As you probably know by now, Ukraine as a state as well as some private foundations accept cryptos. I donated Bitcoin to our most trusted foundation that helps the military called Come Back Alive, and I got a great bright-blue zipped hoodie with a yellow phrase on the back. While I've been here on the forum for many years, I believe it's actually the first time I sort of (although not technically) paid for something directly in Bitcoin (transferring money to a wallet address) and got something in return.Perhaps in the thread, you could share your opinions or your stories of using Bitcoin as money.",

For all you peeps out there who had made good money in bitcoin/crypto, donate to your favorite charities. Not only that you help people, it feels great personally as well.",

      "body": "Hey everyone! Thanks for your support! Yes, it's indeed very cool that it's possible to use Bitcoin to do something good, not just as a store of value.It's also cool that I see people are getting interested in such hoodies. It's not an official state program or anything, it's just a couple of people I met who are from Lithuania but they are very supportive of Ukraine and they make such things. I told them they should make it a business because many people might be interested in such things. So far, however, it seems they are only doing it small-scale, and, after all, they don't take anything to themselves since all the money goes to donations, which means they are also spending some money and effort.But I'll ask them if they, by any chance, considered making it more available to people and get back to you if they do.Quote from: batang_bitcoin on May 13, 2022, 05:19:11 PMThat can be said as purchase although you've donated it to the chosen foundation in support of those who are in need and being affected by the war.Well, congratulations.

I think you're feeling overwhelmed now and wanting to do it again?Â  I'm a Ukrainian myself, so what Russia is doing to my country is quite painful to me. I've donated to this fund before, just to support the army, and this time it's especially nice because I got a cool product in return, and I actually intended to buy a zipped hoodie anyway. So it all worked out great.",
