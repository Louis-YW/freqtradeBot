  "content": "It appears that if there really opens a real regulatory implication for bitcoin in Europe, I reckon the government will do their best on where they can attack something that might be threatening to them. They do this by imposing higher taxes. I speculate that capital gains tax will be increased to discourage trading bitcoin.In any case, according to Tuur Demeester this research paper is a declaration of war against bitcoin.In a paper from European Central Bank (ECB) economists Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf, they argue that Bitcoin’s rise in value disproportionately benefits early adopters at the expense of latecomers and non-holders.While this doesn’t necessarily reflect the official stance of the ECB, the paper has opened debate over potential regulatory implications.The paper claims that, in a scenario where Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, “the existence of Bitcoin impoverishes both non-holders and latecomers” as early Bitcoin holders accumulate wealth without contributing to the productive economy.It describes the situation as a “zero-sum game” where early adopters “increase their real wealth and consumption” at the expense of those who enter the market later or never at all.Read in full https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/european-central-bank-paper-declaration-war-bitcoin-tax-ban/",

They can not say this principle only works with Bitcoin market and early Bitcoin investors and holders.They ignored another fact that if people get richer by Bitcoin investment, they will use money to purchase things, use many services and it's their ways to help economy. They use their own-made money, you can consider it as hard-earned money too, for right things to help many business and people by their spendings. It's better than governments and central banks that only print more money, increase national debts, and use money from citizens, tax payers very unprofessionally and kind of wasting valuable money and resources.https://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.htmlhttps://worlddebtclocks.com/QuoteIt describes the situation as a “zero-sum game” where early adopters “increase their real wealth and consumption” at the expense of those who enter the market later or never at all.[/i]They must admit that in any market, it's zero sum game, not only Bitcoin market. When they are brave enough to admit this fact, they will feel better with this Bitcoin market and no longer hate it.",

They claim that the redistribution of wealth due to bitcoin is not really a redistribution of wealth because it is not redistributed evenly to everyone. They claim that increased spending by Bitcoin investors will drive up prices for the rest. On its face, it's a dubious claim, but made worse by omitting the fact that it would also be true for every source of wealth.My impression is that they are complaining that Bitcoin doesn't fit their communist ideals. They seem to believe that people should not be rewarded for their ingenuity, intelligence, and work.It is ironic that they also say that Bitcoin has no economic value. Time will tell, but their criticisms are moot if that is true. If Bitcoin's economic value never develops, then any wealth created by Bitcoin will simply evaporate.",

      "body": "The \"zero-sum game\" argument totally neglects what happens to the greater economic impact of Bitcoin. Its decentralized nature offers new avenues for transferring value across borders without intermediaries, and for this reason alone, it has created new markets, jobs, and investment opportunities that add to the economy.Moreover, while we are quick to focus on the gains made by the early adopters, it's equally impossible to overlook that the adoption of new technology often starts with those early risk-takers. Similar to the internet or smartphones, early players put their investments at risk with no guarantee of success. Add to that, Bitcoin's technological aspect-blockchain, for one-continues to drive development in everything from finance to supply chains.It is understandable to be afraid of aggressive regulation such as the tax hikes instituted in Italy. However, regulation can balance innovation and consumer protection to create a healthier environment for growth, rather than stifling it entirely. Bitcoin is not all speculation. it is financial inclusion, mainly among people in regions that have limited access to banking facilities.",

It would be laughable to say that Satoshi invented Bitcoin to be an actual Ponzi Scheme.

Why do they talk like we live in some communist country and everybody must be the same? Those who invested in bitcoin at the beginning took a huge risk, they were visionaries, why should someone who buys today (maybe using an ETF) making the same profit as someone who bought 12 years ago?",
