      "body": "Have you tried looking for it in the Services section, or made a request to buy with BTC for anyone who can provide it to you? I tried to search on the Marketplace but it seems like most of them are no longer active. A search on Google gives me Freeje as an alternative. Some of their numbers require KYC, but they claim that others (numbers issued in countries that don't require one) do not need any documents to be activated[1]. Please research it on your own since I never tried their service myself. They also offer a Telegram bot for easy registration and top-up, but I believe some of them will still be subject to KYC if you need a number from a country that requires one[2].I find them here btw[3], just in case you want to search more. Unfortunately, there is no \"free KYC\" filter so you have to manually check them out. You can also find some SMS phone numbers on KYCNot.me[4], just make sure to research them first.[1] https://freeje.com/faq/what-documents-are-required-for-activating-a-virtual-number[2] https://freeje.com/services/telegram-bot[3] https://bitcoinwide.com/_voip-service-btc-e5d108c3-e927-496a-ba2f-4617907160b6[4] https://kycnot.me/services#SMS",

      "body": "It's a bit of a 2 step process BUThttps://silent.link/ so long as you have a device that takes an esim you will get you incoming SMS and calls.Once you have that you can get a google voice or similar thing to get a phone number for outgoing since they just want to call you / send you a text to verify that you exist.Not perfect but it does work.Also, depending where you are a lot of airports these days have 'disposable' local cell phone vending machines. For us diumbasses that forgot to activate international roaming.-Dave",

I WILL NOT use the service for SPAM. It will be like 10-20 SMS and calls per day (US). Thanks!I will show you several sites that work as VoIP providers and accept cryptocurrencies for payment. You can do your research as I have found them in the search engines, and I do not know the extent of their credibility, and they do not require KYC. You can go to the FAQ for each of them to gain information about the service, and then you can choose the excellent platform that meets your needs and has reasonable prices. And do not forget to watch reviews about them on YouTube or on any sites or forums in case you want to buy their services.[1] https://juicysms.com/[2] https://www.textverified.com/[3] https://jmp.chat/[4] https://sms4sats.com/",

Thanks!Do you only need to send SMS messages or you need voice calls option also?Anonymous eSIM is a great option you can use and they accept Bitcoin payments without kyc, but I believe I also saw people selling physical prepaid sim cards.You can use that for sms, calls and even for internet, just make sure that you don't use your main smartphone device if you care more about privacy.For phone numbers you can check services listed below:https://kycnot.me/services#SMS",

I don't understand what are you talking about.  You are getting SIM cards, and I hope you know what that means... you can use them in your mobile phone to make phone calls and write sms messages.They also didn't say on that website that you can create your address book and all other stuff you can do with any other sim cards... it's common sense.",

      "body": "I think,  provider that you may want to check out is Anonochat. They offer encrypted messaging and calls without any identification requirements. They also accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, so that might be a good option for you.Another provider that you may want to look into is Linphone. They offer free voice and video calls, messaging, and video conferencing. They also support Bitcoin payments without any KYC requirements.[Anonochat: https://anonochat(.)com/ ][Linphone: https://www(.)linphone.org/]Note: remove ()So, there you have it! There are definitely VoIP providers out there that accept Bitcoin and don't require KYC. I hope this helps you find the right provider for your needs.",
