But some people can fall for further price downturn which suppose not to be, if the price of bitcoin still fall, do not sell, it will rise again beyond the price you bought it and grow much more farther than that. We are expecting six digits next, which means $100k or above.",

All of them have suffered severe beating in price to warrant anyone taking them as gifts now at whatever price one buys them. Just imagine there are those who invested when Bitcoin was $64k+ but are now dillydallying buying it now at less $23k. It doesn't make any sense at all.",

According to experts, before you jump in, first assess your risk tolerance and prioritize other aspects of your finances, like saving for an emergency, paying off high-interest debt, and investing in a traditional retirement account like a 401(k).",

What is Yours Opinion?         Going all in crypto space is a very risky thing to do, if you had dca it would have been better, my advice for you is that if eventually you have a spare cash that you can afford to use in buying the dip, kindly do it as that will give you an edge when the market starts pumping again, but I think you have to watch the movement of bitcoin before investing, there is still speculation that it might go up to $10k and we all know what that implies to altcoins.",

Hopefully in the future the market will go back to bulls and penetrate the new ATH.These market cycle is normal if you've been into crypto for some years now. Bull cycle will definitely happen again so the best thing to do is to accumulate while we are in bear season. We should not be like those other people who will just buy crypto when it's at its hype and become disappointed in the end because they bought at the top. For me even if the market is unstable right now, it's less risky to buy at these current prices because cryptos are down more than 50% from their last ATH.",

The goal is not to acquire as much as 1 BTC but to have enough coin that before the next bull run so for me i will still wait so i can always buy more",

I never urge people to buy but at least, I'd help them to know about it. We are supposed to prepare for the upcoming halving if we want to earn huge profit, or else we just regret it later.",
