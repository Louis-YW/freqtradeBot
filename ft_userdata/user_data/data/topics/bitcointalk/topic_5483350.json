  "content": "Turning your highly traceable bitcoin or other cryptocurrency into perfectly untraceable coins can be done easily in a matter of hours, for as little as 1%. The key is in the details.Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies are revolutionary technologies that serve a wide variety of uses. One feature that can cause problems is how easy it is for anyone to track transactions on their blockchains. There are situations where some users of Bitcoin and other cryptos may not want their business to be so public.In previous years, privacy minded people could use what were called Bitcoin Mixers, or Tumblers, to basically “launder” their Bitcoin. However, recent technological advances have made this method obsolete… governments, crypto exchanges, and other companies can now trace your transactions through those mixers.In 2024, there is one easy way to guarantee you can safely hide the origins of your crypto stash: convert it to Monero, and then back to your desired crypto. Monero, also referred to as XMR, is a privacy based cryptocurrency, that has proven to be untraceable by blockchain analysis companies, governments, law enforcement, or crypto exchanges.By following the steps in this guide, anyone can make their Bitcoin or other crypto fully anonymous and totally untraceable, in about an hour.Read the entire guide (no paywall link):https://bitcointomonero.substack.com/p/make-bitcoin-fully-anonymous",

QuoteDesktop: Feather WalletWeb Wallet: MyMoneroMobile: Cake WalletDon't use MyMonero because it's lightweight wallet, if you don't run full node, you can't achieve 100% privacy. You can use feather wallet or cake wallet, but it's better to use the official wallet e.g. GUI or CLI.QuoteThere are a few options, but I strongly suggest using XchangeDon't use xchange.me, they're less anonymous. Better to use Bisq or exch.cxQuote from: https://xchange.me/terms-of-serviceUnder limited circumstances, we may disclose your personal data you voluntarily provided to us to third parties as permitted by, or required to comply with, applicable laws, rules and/or regulations in the jurisdiction of which you are a citizen or a permanent resident and in order to comply with laws of Marshall Islands.
