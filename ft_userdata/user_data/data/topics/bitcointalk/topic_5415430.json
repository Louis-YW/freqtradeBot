      "body": "The spirit of bitcoin is to verify not to trust.Downloading the blockchain (and other related files like chainstate) from a centralized source means you are giving up that verify step and that makes running a full node pointless. In other words it is better if you use a SPV client instead.Additionally downloading it from a centralized source then verifying the file from block #1 is going to be slower than just letting bitcoin core download and verify blocks on its own. Which is another reason for not doing that.If you are facing problems syncing, you should find the root cause of that problem and try to fix that instead of looking for a workaround.",

It's pointless to verify blocks if there's at least 1 you took someone word for it instead of verifying.The problem is that Bitcoin Core just hangs and nothing happens, synchronization stops completely, nothing works. I don't think that this is due to system requirements, because many 1,000-s of blocks are synchronized with absolutely no problems, and only then problems begin on some block, everything stops and nothing happens, so this is a system error.
