You can check here if you want to know more: https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/airdrop-eligibility-distributionIt's quite surprising to me, considering the co-founder of Offchain Labs once stated that there were no plans to launch an Arbitrum token. But hey, it's a pleasant surprise! My wallet is eligible for 2250 $ARB tokens! In hindsight, I guess it was a no-brainer to launch the Arbitrum governance token, especially since other L2 chains like Optimism and Polygon have their own tokens too. It makes even more sense when you consider that Arbitrum has a higher TVL than Optimism, along with real dApp usage and activity, such as GMX, which boasts millions of USD in daily trading volume without any trading incentives.",

It seems like the yearly inflation is not too big as it was only taking 2% as the maximum inflation that can be reached by arbitrum token. We did see how successful OP airdrop and will arb become even more successful compared with OP? I guess there will be huge dump to come soon. I personally learned from OP if try to prepare some money to buy at the bottom and then waiting for the pump to come soon. Only got a few thousand tokens but it seems like that will not be enough for long term hold considering how bit the circulating supply is. The price for each token must be even lower than OP. There are bunch of people attacking arbitrum dev in the discord caused by they were not eligible for arb airdrop.",

I have been using arbitrum as it kicks ass and am now wondering what are the requirements for the airdrop, when is the snapshot and and does the amount of airdrop per wallet vary how much we use it. I definitely want the token but at the same time i am wondering why the token even exist? We already see it working without it so what's the catch? Usually token is needed for incentives so what am i missing in here?",

Regarding the price, I'm expecting it to have a similar FDV to Optimism and Polygon, which is around ~$11B.

If the price ever reaches that range, I'd sell all my liquid holdings and bid hard . I don't even think it'll go below $1. Arbitrum is superior to Optimism not only in terms of TVL but also in other metrics like activity and on-chain DEX volume. So, it's unlikely that we'll see significantly lower price opportunities.",
