Can be APY or APR, drop your earning strategy in this market condition.Staking Altcoins except stablecoins usually a bad idea since altcoins volatility is very high while APY was low. You shouldn't do staking especially liquidity mining since you will just suffer impermeable loss. However you can still enjoy staking even with bear market by using stablecoins. The APY is just but atleast you are safe from dump and still earning despite bear market without shorting the market which is very risky since we don't know when will the price swing. Stablecoins is your friend in time like this so make sure you're not being greedy when seeing alts in red.",

And since this is not the only example of the collapse of stablecoins, it is now very difficult to determine the safe preservation of your deposit in the bear market. So in any case, the risks are very high even if you refrain from staking altcoins and focus on staking stablecoin.",

The only winners in the case of staking are the big coin holders who actually get big rewards. It all ends up selling out in the market and putting serious pressure on the price. This economic model has not proven itself since the advent of POS coins.",

Who knows if we were not able to see this again.

A good example of that is looking at the history of the Bitcoin chart.",

Can be APY or APR, drop your earning strategy in this market condition.i think if you already have coins that are staked and are generating revenue at the moment then i would just keep them staked. I would only sell those staked coins is you really need the money and therefore need to sell. Let's say you have some BNB or KucoinShares or some other staking coin that are giving a fixed percentage of APY then they are still giving you that at the moment during the bear market. Of course if you get 0,1 BNB revenue at the moment it does not have the same Dollar value as it has in a bull market when BNB was above 1000 USD per coin but as soon as the market begins to recover again, those revenue that you got from staking during the bear market will also be worth a lot more too.",

Don't ever try compare ust with other stable coins because they are not the same. What I heard is ust is an algorithmic stable coin but the standard stable coins that we know like usdt, busd, usdc and dai are not like this so they are definitely much safer. Other than trying to stake a coin, you are also mining a coin?Nice, but mining can be hard as many factors are involved like electricity, maintenance cost, network difficulty and so on. If you want to you can also try buying btc, during this bear. With btc, there is no need to worry anymore or doubt about its safety.",

However, never think that this strategy will give you a favorable profit, plus the risk of doing it as you are trying to put your money in the control of the exchange, not yours. Well, of course, this is a much better option while holding and waiting for the next Bullrun but as I've said the risk is accompanied by it. You can try trading as well but the situation seems too difficult for the beginners. You'd only have the two best options whether to hold or stake.",

So it's really up to you whether you want to continue with this strategy or not.As for earning in a bear market, others just continue to accumulate solid altcoins and then HODL. I know this might sound like a stupid idea, but this is a long term investment strategy. So you buy at bear market, fill your bags and then sell when the bull market arrives.",

Might can do trading provided that you are really good at this or else, you will just lose. Buy now and hold - everything seems so easy to manage, unlike if you do staking were you risking your money especially if you use non-reputable exchanges.
