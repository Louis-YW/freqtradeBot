Are we in for a whole new hype or will the old trends also give themselves away?Your thoughts.",

It could be institutional blockchains at the hype. Because more institutions are developing their own blockchain for different purpose. Entering into the market by the large scale firms will surely cause hype in the market as that we experienced during the days of ICO. In between so many small scale firms too will enjoy the benefit out of the hype same as ICO launched without purpose grow good in the past.",

      "body": "No clues I guess except for what we all know that halving would take place in 2024. Earlier dates on that would be absurd. There could be a trend which may unxepectedly enter the industry likewise with how memecoins, nft, and p2e, emerged out of nowhere even if there are existing for years already. So maybe, trend will also come from existing concepts in this industry.

It might be tokens with land-based utilities or tokens which can be used on a certain application. But eitherway, this is something to look forward with in the future. More businesses are engaging with this technology which makes this industry more acknowledged by many people.",

According to my opinion, Layer3 will rise in the upcoming bull run. It has got the ability due to its new implementation with the new projects and all are superb.",
