  "content": "I remember that day, when the merits become a thing in the forum. Since I was a Legendary user at that point I get instant 1000 merits, and when I realize other users have to get those 1000 merits to become a legendary user I really feel bad for them.It has been a long time, this week was the 5th birthday of the merits system as we can see in this thread ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2818350.0 ). And a lot of people have worked hard to become legendary user in the forum. So, I was thinking...Let's rest 1000 merits to all the legendary users from those who get 1000 merits and make a new raking for those who haven't hit the 1000 merits. For example, if you have 1990 merits, then you will be 10 merits away from legendary, but you will have the new rank until then.What would be a good name for this new rank?",

People that post quality content rank up and shitposters won't make it.Apart from that, you should visit Bitcointalk to communicate, talk about Bitcoin and socialize with other Bitcoin enthusiasts - not to hunt for a new forum rank.What would you call something after Legendary anyway? Super Legendary? Elite Legendary?I think we're good.",

In the past, such request was raised a few times.2016: What's above Legendary?2018: Above Legendary rank2019: What if Theymos added new Rank after Legendary?With some rankups of outstanding members to above 10,000 earned merits, this request makes more sense. Personally I would like to have only one more rank with a required earned-merit is 20,000. I mean above Legendary is something really huge and very extreme challenging to reach it.theymos has never replied on this idea and likely he did not feel comfortable to deploy it officially.",

If I'm not mistaken the current rank (Brand new - Legendary) was created from the first time and there's no update about the new rank.There are a lot users already earn 3K+ merit and few of them already earn 10K+ merit.I think the new rank should be at least 2.5K merit, similar like how Full member rank up to Senior Member. After 2.5K, then 5K and 10K, however after all there's no end since merit keep increasing and there's no any \"adjustment\".",

Like I proposed, let's make it 20,000+ earned merits, not required activities but should be not smaller than required activities for Legendary rank.Its new rank name can be Elite so we will have an Elite class here",

What I would also suggest to make is some kind of difference between the Legendary rank that is achieved only with airdropped merits and the one that is achieved exclusively with earning merits.For example :Legendary (airdropped) remains the same as before.Legendary achieved without airdropped merits (coin color change).Legendary who earned over 1000 merits after airdropped merits - maybe call them Legendary Veteran.",
