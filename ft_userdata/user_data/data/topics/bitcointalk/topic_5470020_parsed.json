  "content": "To be honest, I've had this question for quite a while. I keep seeing people claiming to just hold and hold; it'll take one, two, three, or whatever years for the next bull market. However, I'm often wondering: do you ever feel tired of waiting for Bitcoin to thrive? The past few months, or the whole past year—I'm not sure I've lost track of time—have been quite stale. Bitcoin has been ranging between $25.000 and $28.000 for quite a while. The volatility compared to other periods is lower than we're used to, or at least, to what I was used to in the past.I feel that there isn't too much excitement and this adrenaline feeling anymore; suddenly you'd see Bitcoin climb or crash; you'd be curious when it'd stop, what your next move would be, or simply feel accomplished seeing your money's value grow. Price movements are quite insignificant at this point compared to the huge pumps or dumps that occurred in 2020 or 2021.Don't get me wrong, I'm not against holding, nor am I getting frustrated, at least not yet; I did it in the past and regretted it, even though my only source of income is signature campaigns. It's just that sometimes you can't stop the thoughts from circling around your head. I generally didn't bother to even look at it's price, but I've recently started feeling a little wearied. Perhaps it has to do with the life-induced stress that I've discussed in a previous thread. Who knows? How do you cope with waiting?",

Anyone that has prepared himself on a long term investment should know that patience is the key to the bull run, or else one will get worried or tired of waiting and can make some drastic decisions. You should be busy stashing up your bitcoin portfolio to pass time so that, you will be able to make good profit during the bull run, because it is based on the size of your portfolio that will determine the profit. A volatile asset like bitcoin is worth waiting for. I am using this opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin now that the price is low so that I can be proud of my profit when the bull run arrives.

People might trick anyone they come across with to say to hold but in fact they are selling their own crypto. This is not true at all, and there are many who rely on the long-term storage strategy. Among them are those who sold their savings after achieving what they believe was the profit they dreamed of, and among them are those who are still waiting for the appropriate opportunity.Do you know those who recommend Hoddle but do not follow it? They are people who were forced to sell their investment savings for one reason or another, or people who invested from the beginning in amounts that they need in their daily lives such that they cannot afford to spend a long time. You could say it's something like a state of regret.In general, Hodel's strategy has proven its effectiveness with Bitcoin, and I believe that a large number of users follow it.",

I now treat it more like a bank fixed deposit.  When we create a fixed deposit in the bank we have to deposit the money for a certain period of time. This is exactly how I use Bitcoin now.

You see the price rise and you do not sell. Suddenly the price drops like crazy and the fear increases until you reach a point where you sell at levels between $60,000 and $70,000 if the price reaches $140,000 dollars to $180,000.Creating a rational strategy is the best, and the mind says that the price will be between $70,000 and $100,000. Make your basic plans based on that, and if the price increases, consider it a bonus.

When the price of the token was going up, I was happy and intended to sell but then realized that I was holding it. When the price went down, I had no other Money to buy something because most of my money was invested in that. Then this was frustration for me. When it got listed on exchanges I got too much profit.

But whats better, having 1 Bitcoin when its worth 100k or having 100 BTC when its worth 1k? Although I doubt that Bitcoin will ever go back to 1k USD, I just wanted to make an example. I would rather have more BTC, regardless of todays fiat exchange value.I think that if more people adopted that kind of mindset, the world would be better.",

Bitcoin has been ranging between $25.000 and $28.000 for quite a while. The volatility compared to other periods is lower than we're used to, or at least, to what I was used to in the past.I feel that there isn't too much excitement and this adrenaline feeling anymore; suddenly you'd see Bitcoin climb or crash; you'd be curious when it'd stop, what your next move would be, or simply feel accomplished seeing your money's value grow. Price movements are quite insignificant at this point compared to the huge pumps or dumps that occurred in 2020 or 2021.Don't get me wrong, I'm not against holding, nor am I getting frustrated, at least not yet; I did it in the past and regretted it, even though my only source of income is signature campaigns. It's just that sometimes you can't stop the thoughts from circling around your head. I generally didn't bother to even look at it's price, but I've recently started feeling a little wearied. Perhaps it has to do with the life-induced stress that I've discussed in a previous thread. Who knows? How do you cope with waiting?You arent the only one who do feel out such boredom or generating those type of questions on mind on the time that you are seeing that you've been waiting for a while or years already with your current holding. If you've been here on this market for some couple of years or had been able to experience those previous bull run cycle or with those extreme volatility back into those early years then for sure you would really be able to make out some comparison in between their movements on which i could also say that the movement now doesnt turn out to be that interesting anymore. You would be having those thoughts that the market is really that a bigboring now which movements in sideways takes too long before some action do really happen.For those who had been that waiting for so long then it wont really be that necessary for you to hold up without doing something. You could always allocate a % of your holding and trying out to scalpwith those minimal movements if you do find yourself get bored of waiting. This is what i do actually do on the time that i do have those kind of boredom on which trying out to playwith those price movements and it do really make my emotions been fixed and starting on where i have been trying out to achieve or getting in line with the track thative been following for years.",

I keep seeing people claiming to just hold and hold; it'll take one, two, three, or whatever years for the next bull market. However, I'm often wondering: do you ever feel tired of waiting for Bitcoin to thrive? Not really. I don't have an amount of bitcoin that I see as okay now, so I don't even want bitcoin to be in a hurry to thrive when I have not accumulated enough. I would only be tired of waiting if I have accumulated enough bitcoins, and I am just waiting for the rise, but that is not my situation. Most persons also have the feeling that they have not accumulated enough bitcoins, so they are not in a hurry for the value of bitcoins to rise. They are still okay with waiting.",

How do you cope with waiting?Due to the challenges we face on a daily basis, it's very normal for an individual for in a blink of an eye to wished the price of Bitcoin had skyrocketed higher, most especially those who put all their life savings into Bitcoin investment, so as to sell and make more profit. But to me, I can say that for the past few months now, I hardly worry about my Bitcoin savings, simply because I had save an amount of fund that I know I won't be in need of it over a long while, unless in a case of an emergency. Note: That you invest in Bitcoin shouldn't stop you from living a normal life, that is by using part of your campaign payment for daily needs, while you hodl the rest.",
