  "content": "At the beginning of the year 2022,Â  i was still more or less a newbie with hope was held high as to what goals and achievementsÂ  needed to be done. Am sure a lot of us wrote our goals down and through the months, we somehow ticked good for those that have been completed and updated with more.At this year end, staring this month and December, even though the pen mark may have faded, but going back to review the years goals, is what contributes to forge the projection for next year.On my list, is the acquisition of bitcoin knowledge and acquiring of some coins. Earning passively at a second and third hustle, also. Although am yet to really invest in purchasing some coins for trading and keeps, joining this forum and giving it my attention no matter how little paid off, in that I can confidently tick good as my bitcoin goal was achieved. This may not be the biggest of achievements so far, but it is a sure start as contribution to my next year projections. I intend to commit more to cryptocurrency and take ample advantage of its numerous benefits.What goals or achievement did you accomplish purposefully from the beginning of this year 2022 till date?Â What projections for next year form the basis of your hopeful thinking, after a careful review?",

This goal has been my priority this year and I can safely say that it has been fulfilled more than 50%. Maybe it will continue to be so until the end of this year it really closes.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 19, 2022, 06:16:41 PMWhat projections for next year form the basis of your hopeful thinking, after a careful review?The idea is still the same, but maybe a little different in terms of achievement depending on my financial situation. My current orientation is how I can buy and collect lots of bitcoin, and I really want to enjoy the the return in the future.",

It is also very pleasant to read that you are a purposeful person with a positive attitude toward the future. As for the plans, I think it would be the right choice to buy bitcoin; the rest of the coins are for risk-takers. No matter what, Bitcoin remains the leader, and if we talk about what has been or will be, it always remains the center of attention for those who own it.",

      "body": "OP, we have to stay optimistic about the future and the great thing about your current attitude is that you have plans for the future. We never fully know what the future holds either for ourselves or about this very volatile crypto future. However, optimism about a good future is something you can look forward to and will be complete if you are willing to invest in it.I never expected anything particularly big, but I did hope for something useful for the future. Obviously financial improvements are expected for everyone, and I also hope that my investment so far in crypto actually pays off for my future. There's no big goal, but it's something that will pay off in the future.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on November 20, 2022, 09:13:35 AMNo matter what, Bitcoin remains the leader, and if we talk about what has been or will be, it always remains the center of attention for those who own it.You are right, and this optimistic attitude must be maintained. The future for bitcoin is still very bright and will continue to grow as a useful asset and currency, so we shouldn't doubt it any more even if it's currently fallen in price a lot since its last ATH.",

If it's about real life, many people and including myself will not say. But regarding this forum, I can share my achievements as;1. Being able to join in the promotion of the green avatar and signature company.Â  Thank you Best_Change for the opportunity. 2. Being able to reach the Hero rank, thanks to all btt members who helped by sending out their merits.My projections for next year is to remain in this forum because here is becoming part of me.Meanwhile, the year has not ended, there will be more achievements before the year ends.",

I am not really accomplished my financial goals in this year to be honest but happy to say survived with no big hustle. With the forum not really concerned about ranking, getting more merits, but I am just doing much contribution as I can to others.Off topic - For the record successfully lost 20lbs.",

I guess that's what OP did.Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on November 20, 2022, 09:13:35 AMAs for the plans, I think it would be the right choice to buy bitcoin; the rest of the coins are for risk-takers.May I ask you a personal question on this. You don't have to respond if you don't want. You don't hodl any other crypto apart from Bitcoin or you consider yourself a risk-taker too?Quote from: KingsDen on November 21, 2022, 08:02:15 PMQuote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 19, 2022, 06:16:41 PM~snipped~Did you mean my achievements in this forum or in the real life.OP is referring to life here (not real life) and that's why there's \"Newbie to Full Member\" in their text ðŸ¤”",
