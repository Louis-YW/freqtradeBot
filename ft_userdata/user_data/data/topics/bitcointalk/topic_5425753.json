Bit of a shame that there's no way to do it all in one step but I'll take what I can get to maintain my privacy",

Most of them are centralized anyway but they will lie to you that they are decentralized.Bisq is the real gateway to decentralized p2p exchanging.",

Obviously CEXs are out!You can also try the Currency exchange section of the forum.Not much on offer, and, besides, you being a stranger to the forum should use a reputable escrow for the exchange, but I'd be the first place to look, since we're on the forum. You can create a post there and see if you have any offers.",

You might not have much problem s trading on a decentralized or P2P platform, but when trying to use a centralized exchange, you could hit some barriers.This is one reason to check with a little amount of coins when making a transaction on an exchange first to ensure you can see it to completion, to avoid having your bitcoins locked on an exchange.",

Obviously CEXs are out!Personally, I would not trust most  of those bridges and I cannot recommend any.P2p might also be insecure depending on your volume.I would convert all my coins in a good cex and then I would use a bitcoin mixer to get privacy. I believe this is safer in most cases.",
