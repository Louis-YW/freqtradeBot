Congratulations and happy independence to India. The goal the prime Minister set is one of those bogus political goals that never get fulfilled, it is on occasions like this that we hear politicians promise things, set goals that they never live up to, or even try to fulfill. I am not an indian, but I do have a family member there, and let's just hope they work towards achieving the goal, for the good of the country and its citizens. Quote Although almost all country are face with inflation recently, some adjustments in the economic sector can help to ease the citizen as well improve the country's development.The truth is that, every country is blessed in their different ways, but the major problem is our politician who know what is right, what to do to lift the country out of its numerous financial problems, but won't do it because they just can't get enough of looting public funds.",

What's crazy is China has vastly overtaken India in the last couple decades to become a manufacturing hub and used all of that knowledge to slowly upskill their workforce. India has pretty much stood still or even gone backwards in that time, they have a lot of cottage industry but are not thinking strategically when it comes to business planning. With their recent decision to side, or at least make economic gain, with Russia in the war they started against Ukraine - they will increasingly be looked at with suspicion and this can harm their future development for a few short term gains.",

Let's imagine, for example, how the use of the Internet in the world was 25 years ago compared to today. Regarding wealth inequality, I agree that governments should guarantee education for all and access to healthcare, which does not necessarily have to be managed exclusively by the public sector. I hope that with the development of the country, these aspects will improve. What I tend to believe is that the solution to poverty problems does not usually come from a politician making laws, rather it usually comes from letting people progress with their initiatives without crushing them with taxes and regulations.",

Therefore I do think that big companies are not only targetting India but they are also improving the production as well here, soon enough you won't have to ask your friends from other countries to come and carry around your iphones. 2. India's economic growth is increasing tremendously which also means that after surpassing UK it would soon be able to surpass other countries as well, one should understand that countries like UK are only economically ahead because of the population overexplosion in India, this we need to get it controlled first.",

The can start to rebrand some of their industries especially their automobile industries, with they Already have TaTa mobile and some other companies. India can begin to export goods that are high in demand and the most important of them All is good governance.",

This is important, because without a real picture, it is useless to change something, as wrong decisions will be made.And secondly, they set a goal to become better. It is very important.One simple question remains - what, according to your criterion, are the indicators of a DEVELOPED COUNTRY? You can bring, well, let there be 10 points, which, with a probability close to 100%, will indicate that the country is DEVELOPED?And then it will be possible to discuss how to achieve these indicators, and whether they can be achieved, taking into account the local features of the economy, politics, history and other things.",

For example Singapore.But there are examples and the opposite - from developing or approaching developed. For example North Korea. Or a slightly more northern \"great\" country, which for some reason is trying to slide into the \"Stone Age\" as quickly as possible. Or here's another example - Iran, compare the progressive Iran of the 60-70s, and what it has become ....So everything is possible",

Given this India can easily become a developed nation. Overpopulation was the very first thing that came to my mind when I was reading this projection, without a doubt India is a country with a lot of possibilities and potential but the large number of their population is something that plays against them, because in order to become a developed country a great deal of infrastructure will have to be built and the costs will be massive, so India will have to find a way to leverage and take advantage of the huge population they have, and if they don't then it will be very difficult to reach that goal by that time.",

That is why they have failed all over the world. :)The whole world is going through difficult conditions caused by the pandemic. We have to have great ideals to overcome the difficult conditions we live in. For this reason, we need to convey our ideals to the public in an objective format by preparing projections that shed light on the following years. Otherwise, we may show psychological reactions that will make us stop resisting the difficulties of life as a society.When I evaluate the agenda in this direction, I think that the Indian government is following the right policy.
