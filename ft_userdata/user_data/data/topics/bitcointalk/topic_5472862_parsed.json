Launch Electrum then You'll be prompted to create a new wallet or restore an existing one.2. Choose \"Create a new wallet\" and click \"Next.\"3. Select \"standard wallet option\" and click \"Next\".4. Choose you want to create a new seed then Electrum will generate a seed for you.5. write down this seed and keep it in a safe place. This seed is essential for wallet recovery.6. Confirm the seed by entering it in the next window.7. Set a strong password for your wallet and click Next.Now you completely set up your wallet.Receiving Bitcoin:Click on the \"Receive\" tab to generate a receiving address. You can generate multiple addresses if needed. Sending Bitcoin:1. Click on the \"Send\" tab.2. Enter the recipient's Bitcoin address, the amount you want to send.3. Choose the right fee as suggested by Electrum, you can also use https://mempool.space/ to find the actual fee and click \"Send.\"If you still need any tutorials then you can use Helpful Guides For Newbie on the Electrum Wallet posted by Ratimov.Electrum is only available for Android so if you are an IOS user check out https://bluewallet.io/Installation and all other procedures are more or less the same for most wallets so anyone with basic knowledge about operating mobile can find how to do it.",

Since you can't master a PC well, you can use the suggestion of using the bluewallet wallet that people mentioned here because it's the best option.Bluewallet is available on IOS and Android. Bluewallet only supports BTC does not support other asset options. Bluewallet can also connect to Electrum servers if you want to at some point.In my opinion, the weakness of the bluewallet wallet is that it is not a wallet for storing large amounts of assets in the long term.If OP wants to use a wallet for long-term storage of large amounts of assets, choose an open source hardware wallet.Considering that recently there are many choices of open source Bitcoin wallets available, also pay attention to the authenticity behind the mask they display.",

I didn't mention that the mobile wallet drawbacks I referred to apply not to Bluewallet wallets but to all types of hot wallets including Electrum.Dear OP. I think the questions asked by Pmalek are serious for you to answer. You don't have to answer here because before using a wallet, the method of securing assets in a wallet is very sacred and must be considered.Assets like Bitcoin are difficult to hack, but wallets with addresses that hold large amounts of assets will be of concern to hackers.Skeptical users will not believe anything that could harm their wallet. For me, this has positive value for long-term safety.Even if you use the mobile version of the wallet, make sure the seed phrase or key is not connected to the internet.",

It's a good start that you've asked that and please only go through the official links that were given to you and before doing so, always verify them if they're the official ones although the given ones on this thread were all official. I'm saying this because usually a person that's searching for a mobile wallet would go either to Google search engine or playstore and then search with the keywords not specifying the wallet they're downloading. In the end, they fall to a wrong wallet, a phishing wallet and that's going to discourage you. That's why it's nice that you've asked and always learn to verify sources starting from the link and its characters/letters before downloading. And I wish that this is just the start and soon you'll upgrade into PC/desktop and will have your own hardware wallet too.",

Any device which is connected to the Internet increase the chances of getting vulnerable to malwares / hacks etc.The large amount of bitcoin should always be stored on the hardware wallet or on the Air gapped devices (for those who are techy and understand how to setup and operate). You should only use wallets like Electrum or blue wallet only for the purpose of storing small amounts of bitcoins that you want to transact with. The right place to store the majority of your long term savings are the hardware wallets.",
