I had the impression that it was active already, to be honest.The alternative / 'original' actually (RGB) is active on Testnet for a long time now, just want to mention it since LL likes to make a big fuss about their stuff, when something very similar already exists (like with LND and CLN).Quote from: illusive_moose on February 08, 2023, 01:34:13 PMIt is now being developed by Lightning labs.Was it developed by someone else before?",

      "body": "Thanks for pointing me to the thread.Taro was active for a few weeks. I think over the past 1 month it really become useful with now errors.Yes LL like to make tuns of press releases, I kind of like it though as they seem to be building a solid community around it.As for RGB, I have heard about the protocol. I last checked their progress about 6 months ago. Will have to leek what progress they made.",

Were you in a rush to release this?As for the grammar errors, etc - thank you for pointing that out to me. Yes I was kind of in the rush as I want everything to be ready by the time Taro hits main net. I am originally from Europe and English is not my first language.I will fix the errors.Also I do not think this will ever make too much money as the level of activity on Lightning is still limited.",

What are the advantages of using Taro for the common Bitcoin users apart from ability to send scam images with pseudo value back and forth?  You're being rude. You don't even realize if more people use RGB/Taro rather than Ordinal, there'll be less bloat on Bitcoin blockchain.As for the error: Yes I am sorry, I had to switch the testnet currencies that I am offering. I had to nuke the entire DB and tarod files as my taro node crashed.Thanks - yes I will change DEBUG = False.",
