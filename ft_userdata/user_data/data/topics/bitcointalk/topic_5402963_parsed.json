  "content": "Native Staking and GovernanceAhead of the upcoming catalog of casino games, Ridotto is priming the tokenomics of the platform with both native single asset and liquidity pair staking, as well as a token based governance system. Both staking mechanisms and governance will provide the basic scaffolding on which future token utility will be built.Specifically:Staking will be a crucial component in open-source community bankrolling of Ridottoâ€™s games as well as a necessary tool in attracting sufficient trading liquidity of the $RDT token.Token governance will set the stage for Ridottoâ€™s DAO, giving $RDT holders direct voting power on how the platform is run in both casino operation and deciding team development priorities.Solid Proof AuditSolid Proof is one of the most efficient auditing companies in all of blockchain. They offer custom, thorough, and transparent reports that classify all manner of security vulnerabilities.The team is excited to announce that they found zero critical flaws in Ridottoâ€™s staking and governance smart contracts and are giving the team the green light in progressing to deployment.After completing a final round of internal team security tests, both native staking and governance will go live! With them completed, the next step is the Ridotto lottery!Full Audit ReportFind the full Audit Reports here: https://ridotto.link/3tL76x1Follow us on :ðŸ“¢ Twitter: https://twitter.com/ridotto_ioðŸ“¢ Discord Server : https://discord.gg/ridottoðŸ“¢ Telegram Announcements: https://t.me/ridotto_ioðŸ“¢ Telegram Community: https://t.me/ridotto_community",
