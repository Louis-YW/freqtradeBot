  "content": "I have been speculating the forum since I created my account. I am a newbie here in forum but I already knew cryptocurrency since 2018. But all I know is to invest and trade my money only.I started my trading journey in 2019 and it did not bring a lot of profits. Luckily, I am hired in my company this 2022 and I opened my eyes again for the cryptocurrency opportunity. I came back with my initial investment to my friend.I invested in MYER, a cryptocurrency platform that gives a positive ROI (For pioneers). When I invested, I thought I will become a millionaire by this time. Not until I found out, that this crypto farming was a SCAM. It scammed many of my co-workers who invested also in this HYIP.I did not learn from my past mistakes and yet, I was still aggressive. I lose more than 1000 dollars because of my ignorance.Here is my last photo of that Crypto Farming Scam:upload picNow, I discovered the different forums in cryptocurrency as well as this forum. Hoping to learn more about cryptocurrency and how it really works. I will not stop until I can invest in a right project and contribute a lot in this forum.So for the newbies like me, why did you join bitcointalk.org?",

Have it in mind, any centralized network is bound to face one out of two things, either they get compromised and fold up or they get compromised and get regularized.

I am not familiar with that MYER thing, but surely if I hear investing to a third party crypto miner, I am pretty sure that it is a scam. Since you are already here, just telling ya that you might not need other project to invest to, maybe just call it to Bitcoin and leave it.

On 2018, I was taught by someone I know personally and guided me what he knows about this forum and what I can do in this forum. During that year, ranking up an account doesn't require merit in order to rank up. Days later after I joined the forum where the merit is implemented which is the additional new rank requirement to rank up. Before the merit implementation, my goal is to increase my rank through posting where as I have explained that ranking up doesn't require merit. The reason for that is because of bounty campaigns that I can participate and also earn money. To make it short, I joined forum to earn money which is what I was taught before when I know about Bitcoin and Bitcointalk forum. Anyways, that was before and all those time I spent in this forum is what made me know the things I know about cryptocurrency until now.",

After being here and doing many tasks, I was aware that earning money here is not as easy as I see. And moreover, the condition has been different in the past. This was hard. However, I didn't know exactly what to do. But, experiences told me much. Experiences from myself and also from many members here really taught me many things that to earn much money, to get worthier, I must learn more and more. And never expect to be rich because of those forums. However, I didn't know many things. Additionally, this is not enough, crypto is complex. I also started to get money from ding airdrop and also future trading. And these failed because I was really a newbie and didn't know anything, but only following any signal. Well, this is a worthy lesson. And please, for everyone who is new here, you need to set first what you want here. This is not the forum where you will need extra money easily because it is not as easy as you may think. Try to learn more before expecting, so you can consider at what level you are and what to do to reach a higher level. Investing in crypto is a high risk, never believe someone who promises you big profits easily by investing in shit tokens, I had this bad experience, shit tokens will only make those people who really know the ways to utilize pump and dump, only for the developer teams that earn money from victims, but for newbies, this is harmful and high risk because you are on their traps.",
