  "content": "Hey Peepz:All of the Live Stream tickers went down on 22/12/02 in the United States and a couple other countries.The issue was caused when Binance changed the stream (for the first time ever (that I know of)). Their change log says they added a stream, but in fact killed the stream without notice and started a new one.We discovered this before being contacted by any users since our tickers at home went offline.The fix only took seconds; however, code must be recompiled for all of our devices.  The real issue is how to notify and update everyone.We sent out emails to all the contacts that purchased directly from us; however, it appears we didn't have all emails (like those tickers given away as gifts or spam filters ate it, etc.Please read the details and instructions at.... Update Information / http://tiny.cc/qim1vz   It's a live document, so I may make changes in order to better explain instructions.Ultimately, we put out a poll years ago requesting thoughts on if self-updating was an issue. Overwhelmingly, we were told that a call home feature was NOT wanted.  And now, everyone is for it.  So, the firmware updates listed have the update to the new stream and the ability to take on self-updates when they're available.  Please note that it doesn't matter if you bought something this year or five years ago. We still support everthing.Also note that there is likely several items at the bottom of the above document that you may not have seen.And, if you want the update without a call home, I can make that available as well; however, we will not longer support them since it IS a big hassle with one-on-one emails each time there is an update.Lastly, again, this is NOT for tickers that update once every few minutes as they reach out to coinbase (if memory serves me correctly).  That said, you can use the firmware to update any device to live stream.  Not suggested since I haven't done extensive testing.Oh, and there is going to be new updates which I am sure people will love.  Namely using a browser to go to the IP address of the ticker on the network to see live streamed prices for a select few cryptos and certain settings.Please contact me directly with any questions or suggestions.
