I was not connected to this forum but I used to buy and invest in various coins. A few days ago I bought $870 worth of Bitcoin when the price of Bitcoin was $25000. Today it has increased to around $1200-1400. It was one of the happiest days of my life. People do various important things with their earned money. I also did one of the most important things of my life with the money I earned from my investments. My most important job is to get married. I got married in a family and all wedding expenses and wedding party arrangements were done with my bitcoin investment money. In the country where I live, $1400 is about 2 lakhs money, which can cover the entire cost of a wedding. If I hadn't invested in Bitcoin I might not have seen this happy day and party with my friends. Writing about bitcoin and bitcoin forums may never end.Finally, good luck to all those who are investing and connected with bitcoin forum and may all pray for our married life.Presented to you very briefly and generally.These pictures are from my happy wedding day. While partying with friends:I am very happy to invest in bitcoin and connect with bitcoin forum.",

People don't always wants to showcase how much they made or their profits since this could likely attract an evil eyes which might lead to danger of kidnapping or robbed case especially to the country where their currency is very weak against the dollar so they knows any amount is always valuable to them.Congratulations for your wedding, but I will say you should apply wisdom not to openly showcasing the little lift you've gained from bitcoin.",

You are very lucky to have invested in Bitcoin as soon as its value increased, and you made a good profit. Although Bitcoin was going up and down between $25k and $28kÂ  for a long time. Anyway, it's great to hear your story and other people must be wondering how well Bitcoin investment can give us good returns in the future and we can do our life's important work with this investment.By the way, it is very easy to get married in your country and it seems that there is no inflation in your country and the cost of marriage is low, because in our country only bridal dresses can be bought with so much money. Hearing your story will increase people's interest in Bitcoin and help highlight the potential of Bitcoin among people. May you both always be happy.",

OP, you made a lot of profit in a short period of time because you invested in Bitcoin at the right time. One of the most important things in a person's life is getting married, which you did. OP, you would have made more profit if you had held the investment for longer. However, for your personal needs, you have not kept the investment for a long time and sold it. I suggest you, you invest in Bitcoin again with DCA method, because you can earn more profit in future. Finally I wish you a happy married life. Best of luck.",

I watch your success Bitcoin story I am very happy to see that Bitcoin helped you and you made the right decision at the right time when Bitcoin was low and now it goes up. This is a motivation for all the other users to not waste their time thinking whether to invest or not just find the correct time and do it before it goes up. This is not a single story that I have experienced since attached to this forum some other users share their stories and there many are other persons who take profits from Bitcoins but they may be trying to hide them as they are following satoshi",

Yes, majority of us here are investing because of the potential profits, in your case though, it's just short term. And if ever I will give advise to someone specially on how they should look, go for long term. There's nothing more satisfactory seeing the price of bitcoin at least in the 6 digits in the next bull run and obviously look at the big profits.Nevertheless, we can't blame you for selling some of your stash as you have needed some money for your special and momentous day. But if by chance you come back and re-invest again, look for the long term or at least see how the next bull run will be in 2024-2025.",

Bitcoin has done a lot for people with low income and it has given them the opportunity to do great things that they never expected after they have sold their bitcoin investment portfolio. I am also someone who have benefit a lot from my bitcoin investment and I know that I will still achieve great things and attain great height in my financial status with bitcoin as long as I am increasing my bitcoin portfolio regularly through the DCA strategy. OP, I will advice you to buy back bitcoin and don't sell so quick but rather hodli for a long period of time so that you can make a very good profit compare to selling in a short term. Bitcoin price still have a long way to go, and we are expecting bitcoin price to hit $100k in the next ATH. Imagine that you didn't sell your bitcoin investment till 2025, you will have a done a big wedding and maybe also buy a bike.Congratulations and Happy married life.",
