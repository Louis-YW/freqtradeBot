  "content": "1. Our brain is designed to help us surviveOur brains have one goal. We create sub-goals, we may want to start a family, get rich, get a better job, make winning bets, etc.But to our brain, that’s all the same goal, to survive. When the brain loses the drive to survive, we fall into a depression.We must understand this drive to survive if we are to make winning sports bets. The drive to survive can lead us to making bad bets or to making bets with higher winning percentages. It all depends.The other thing about the drive to survive is that it is both a logical and emotional response. Emotions, fear, as an example, helps us survive. This isn’t the way our consciousness and mind think but it is the way our brain thinks.2. Know that our brain’s survival instinct always pushes us toward the negativeThe most significant aspect of our brain’s survival instinct is that it always pushes us towards the negative. Why?Our brains have yet to catch up to advancements in society. We understand blockchain and AI and how our iPhone works. But the survival instinct is more powerful than any of that.Always remember, that at the end of the day, our brains are built to help us survive. So emotions are always stronger and more difficult to control in the negative because while we know Chat GTP isn’t the Terminator, our brains see Chat GTP as the sabretooth tiger we had to run from when we lived in caves and hunted with spears.3. When our brain believes there will be a positive outcome, it releases endorphins, it’s important for us to understand thisEndorphins push us to the positive. So we could get ourselves in a loop, meaning we get excited about all the money we’re going to win by betting on the Cardinals to beat the 49ers because the Cards are a +450 money line underdog.Those endorphins tell us, “Do it! You’re going to be rich!” So, of course, we do it and then, when the 49ers beat the Cardinals by 30 we fall into a survival depression because we realize we needed the money we bet to pay rent.Doing something like the above doesn’t mean we have a gambling problem. It means we have to understand how our brain works. Then, we have to realize that our brain doesn’t understand things the way our mind and consciousness do.We can then pull our brain back by saying something simple like, “Brain, calm down.”Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/74f269a",

So even in gambling,  in other to control our emotions we must properly position our brain to have to right reasoning so that our heart can be at peace to make better informed decisions during the game.",

      "body": "I guess we really have to admit defeat though. And with that kind of mindset, our brain might tell us to stop gambling so that we still have our money in our pocket to pay our monthly rent.I think gamblers though know how brain works, but most of time we go against it. And it will take some experience if we wanted to have total control of it. Of course positive thinking might help, but I don't think that it will be a effective method though. What if this positive thinking fell? We don't have any plan B? So the best thing to do is once you understand that you might not win everytime, then your brain might tell you to to stop completely while you still have some money.",

      "body": "This is an interesting topic which intrigues me, because it really looks contradictory that we get addicted to gambling, since our brains always look for survival instinct. It's like gambling lured our brains to believe that betting is positive for our survival through the profit we can make. Somehow our brains get immune to the threats signals gambling can be a bad thing if you are going too far. It's like there were a lion in front of you, but instead of running away from it, your brain executed the command of running to it. From a survival perspective it doesn't make any sense...",

Or our heart?And I doubt that as a gambler, we can win more games because of our brain being positive.I mean it's all about the odds and our extreme luck. If we have luck on our side, then we might go for more wins because we \"feel\", and our brain and heart tell us to play for more.So it's really very hard to control ones emotion, regardless if we are winning or losing. The only way to win more bets is to stop when you are winning and not go for another run.",

And while I know that in every case your brain takes the top spot over your conscious, that shouldn't mean you'd relinquish control over your own agency cause \"you can't win against your brain anyway\". As with gambling, you have a lot of ways and things you could employ that will help you from becoming addicted to gambling, controlling your emotions or not. It all boils down to assuming control and ensuring that you're not being abused by your own brain. I've seen one too many people fail at this and eventually succumb to gambling addiction, don't detach yourself from your brain, use it as a tool to make the most out of your gambling journey.",

And only tip you are giving is that we shouldn't bet on the underdog, because we would be betting on the underdog because of endorphins. Not betting on underdog might give you more seperate wins but it doesn't mean you would get better roi as it only takes 1 loss to undo several bets with low multiplierSo this doesn't really make much sense to me. Taking risks is the whole point of gambling. Without risks this wouldn't be called gambling.",

It is important that we'll know our control and limitations right before we start gambling so we have set a complete goal and we are conditioning our emotions and mind before anything else. We all know how tricky gambling can be, there will be times where we could have long win streaks which will tempt us to bet more because of greed but we should be wiser than the result. Once we have win streaks, we should be smart enough to stop for a while and secure our profit than to continue betting where we could only end up chasing our losses. It's mind over matter and no matter how our urges may tempt us, we should know how to control our emotions or else, it will be the one to control us. Also, we should keep in mind the the possibility of losing will always exist as it isn't always glory days for us so we should always be ready for the possible results.",

      "body": "I believe that the brain is the engine on which every other part of our body functions including our fears, anxiety or happiness. When we gamble, the brain send signal on the way we should feel depending on the outcome of the bet. So for example if the bet is a lose then we are likely to feel bad, if we are not sure of the winning potential of our game it is the brain that either make us have that anxiety or fear. So if we are able to get a balance of our emotion due to our winning rate then, we can make more progress and I think that is why sometimes when you are winning then you can be able to continue winning but a lose changes your countenance which also interacts with the brain. Therefore, a bad feeling may not be good for gambling and that could be the reason addicts lose more than profit.",

      "body": "Controlling our emotions in gambling just basically means, we won't turn irresponsible along the way. It doesn't have to do with winning more bets especially if we refer to playing luck-based gambling games such as dice, slots, roulettes, and so on. Even on sports betting, controlling the emotion won't add even a bit of a percentage of chances of winning as what the emotion covers here is, the amount of bankroll that will be placed on a bet or analyzing what the best odds to choose - staying at average odds or risking more money at huge odds.It isn't really necessary to always keep in mind to control emotions, especially in gambling. There are other things to prioritize rather than that.As long as we continue to gamble, our emotions will automatically adapt to the situation.",
