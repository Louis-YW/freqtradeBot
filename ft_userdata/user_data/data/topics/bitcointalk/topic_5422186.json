Banks will ask you regarding what's the reason you withdraw your money and they're actually already know what have you done with your money, they just want to verify it. Don't forget someone that you've traded can expose your illegal business (if you did for criminal) and there's many CCTV can trace you.Fiat isn't anonymous and CBDC will not give any impact to Bitcoin.",

So in theory, that could be the same for CBDCs as we've got new sets and versions of Tether that might inject a lot of money again to the market. Well, that's what I can think of since it's just another version of a stable coin.",

It doesn't matter on the location, what matters is the \"HOW\". For example when PayPal, credit cards, debit cards or even bitcoin were created they didn't change anything in the existing monetary system. You can and do still use cash and all existing methods are usable, the only difference is that now you have multiple options to choose from depending on the level of privacy, security and convenience you need.Most probably CBDC will be another extra options on top of existing ones that won't change a thing in existing options.However, HOW they enforce its usage makes the difference. If some government (be it Argentinean or Canadian government) decided to go full dictator mode and force everyone to use only CBDC and nothing else then it would be different than if they were suggesting it as an extra option with \"benefits\"(!) that you could freely choose to use.",

This is a good example on how regulations can contribute to help society better.After the Terra and FTX collapses and some related entities, I believe more regulations will be executed soon but it is good for cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems in future.",

CBDC’s are one step closer to social credit scores & literally nobody wants that. I suggest you buy bitcoin before CBDC’s come in & governments ban you from buying bitcoin. Bitcoin is the future, CBDC’s are restrictive. Do not let anybody have the chance to stop you spending your money how you want to. Bitcoin is empowering & governments don’t like that.",

I don’t want to completely ignore CBDC but let’s not worried about until it was already making some noise in the market.",

First of all, when we get in and out of exchanges KYC means we are already tracked, which means when you turn your USD into USDT that means you are already tracked. So instead of trusting a company in the Bahamas and buying usdt, or trusting CZ and buying busd, you will trust the American government and buy their CBDC instead for example.
