I effort to get you under 150 day on all gear.remember the L3+ have the ability to mine doge which is not subject to the ½ ing,here is a L3+ on doge solo just for shits and giggles.I placed tons of the gear as Avalon (new from Texas)you get fast cash flowyou get a hedge with the L3+you get a voltage meter with the M10 what's miner shows you voltage supplied for free actually you get paid. So you get to know that you have voltage issue for free.notice the voltage readings all around 230and the list of gear above generates cash flow so if you want to slowly upgrade to: m50s+ from mikeywith ors19 xp from a guy like kaboomracksor to a guy like https://vmssecuritycloud.com you can add a top of the line piece of gear once a monthwhat ever you want to do good luck mine on.",
