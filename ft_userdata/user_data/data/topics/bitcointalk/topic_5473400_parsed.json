  "content": "I have a few questions from what I have studied so far, some are from my studies while others are just from my imagination.I believe nodes are already programmed to accept/confirm transactions based on some rules and if a transaction fails to meet those rules it won’t be passed on. And since we are dealing with something that was programmed by a human, is there a possibility that a node could malfunction or for an abnormality to occur and then accepts a transaction that does not meet those rules? If something like that happens is there a way for other node to detect such transaction and drop it from the chain?What's the differences between bitcoin core and bitcoin wallet? I always thought bitcoin core was a wallet, but in order to run it, you'd have to download the blockchain data, which would require some things, as stated in my previous thread, but while reading through \"learnmeabitcoin\" they kept using \"bitcoin core\" and \"wallet\" in a way that makes them look completely different. Or are they using the term \"wallet\" to refer to \"SPV\" in this context?Another thing I encountered that caught my curiosity was this discussion I saw on  bitcoin.stackexchange.com (recommended in my previous thread) Concerning the number of public keys that a single private key can generate... According to one response, the logic is as follows: generate one public key from a private key, and then use the public key to generate multiple public addresses. What is the distinction between \"private key, secret phrase, public key, and public address\"? I tried researching it and still couldn't make sense of it, so I'd appreciate it if someone could explain it to me in a simpler way.",

I tried researching it and still couldn't make sense of it, so I'd appreciate it if someone could explain it to me in a simpler way..Secret Phrase or Seed Phrase - master key for all of your private keys which can be combination of 12/18/24 words. Using seed phrase you can generate all the private keys associated with that.private key (imagine it as key to your safe) - It's a long, randomly generated string of numbers and letters.Public Key ( your mobile number) - This is something you can share and others can contact you using this such as send their Bitcoins to your address.Only you can access the bitcoin associated with it since it needs private keys to authorize it. And the hashed version of public key is public address.",

You need the private key associated with your address for unlocking the fund you receive. A private key generates a public key and the public key generates your address. Usually, you don't need to know your public key at all. Instead of having a single private key and a single address, you can use a HD wallet and generate a seed phrase. A Seed phrase is a series of words. It usually contains 12 or 24 words and it's also called a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase.

BTC core is also a wallet, one that gives you better privacy than SPV clients because you don't have to connect to third party servers, but to only your own server.",

Please if it’s possible for you to explain it in a more simpler form I would greatly appreciate it. I just edited my previous post, as I noticed I made a mistake.There are nearly 2256 valid private keys and 2160 addresses. (There are more addresses, if we consider different types of addresses).Therefore, any address can be generated by around 296 private keys on average. Note that in practice, it's impossible that you can have mutliple private keys that generate the same address. 2256 is a very big number and you can't find the collisions.

They are simply servers, and there is no mechanism to assign ratings to servers as either \"trustworthy\" or \"malicious\". Electrum gets around this problem by connecting to multiple different servers rather than just one, but you could very easily connect to a malicious server which either tries to feed you incorrect data or (more likely) surveil your transactions.Quote from: Bitcoin Smith on November 08, 2023, 07:50:31 PMprivate key (imagine it as key to your safe) - It's a long, randomly generated string of numbers and letters.Most private keys are not randomly generated, but rather deterministically generated from your random entropy.

This simply means that all the private keys in the wallet are generated in a deterministic (procedural) way, following a set hierarchy (pattern). In simple English, the wallet takes your seed phrase and generates a tree of private keys using a set process, meaning that you can use your seed phrase to recover your entire wallet and all your private keys and addresses.This differs from original bitcoin wallets in which each private key was randomly generated from scratch, and you therefore had to back up each private key individually.",
