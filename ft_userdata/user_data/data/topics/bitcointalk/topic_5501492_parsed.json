Regulatory changes or bans in various countries.2. Competition from other cryptocurrency or alternative technologies.4. Loss of public interest or confidence.Nothing lasts forever; even bitcoin to me won't last forever, but it's definitely going to take almost forever. At least this generation might not be able to witness that if it's ever going to happen. I don't see regulation as a big threat to bitcoin anymore. Gone are those days when bitcoin was banned in a particular country, and that will have a great impact on the market. Now that people have adopted that and planned for the worst from their governments, they will only attack big firms, but adoption will still continue secretly by those interested in it.  On the side of competitors, for the most part, I haven't seen anyone, but if there ever has to be one, then it will hold its place, while bitcoin also holds its place. These days, it's hard to see a crypto project that's completely decentralised to start with, so how can they compete with Bitcoin? Greed, censorship, and centralization won't allow developers to get something close to Bitcoin.",

Loss of public interest or confidence.1. I don’t think the government can stop Bitcoin from existing. IMO should nations of the world all simultaneously ban Bitcoin, it would only make Bitcoin a rare commodity and cause an increase in the price. 2. Most altcoins have no utility, no real use case. They are only good for trading as they yield more profit than Bitcoin. In the long term, Bitcoin will outlive altcoins because it cannot be manipulated by anyone not even the creator or developers. On the other hand, altcoins can be easily manipulated by the developers. 3. It is a waste of money to attempt a 51% attack on Bitcoin blockchain. The attackers will end up losing money because the electricity cost to perform such an attack is so expensive and unprofitable that no one would want to waste their money. 4. I doubt people will ever lose interest in Bitcoin. As we know, many consider Bitcoin to be an asset and as long as there is profit to be made, I believe that the interest will remain.",

I'm sure you don't know about the so called Flippening (ETH) and Rippening (Ripple) before.

What I believe about bitcoin is that it will last for a long period of time, but it doesn't mean It will last forever because no one even know how long it can last. The world is full of Changes meaning that a new thing greater than bitcoin may come up and distract the minds of people. because most people are already Groumblings about  the price of bitcoin, saying it's too expensive to afford so they need  an investment that will help grow gradually and make them rich just like bitcoin. And if anything slight difference from bitcoin should exist I think bitcoin will reduce the value because people will pull out their fund, that is the only thing that will reduce the value of bitcoin.",
