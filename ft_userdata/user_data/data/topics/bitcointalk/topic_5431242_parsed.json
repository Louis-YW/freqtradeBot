Happy Holidays everyone.Thanks for bringing this to remembrance. If you realize that the season is more about giving than receiving, then the promise of getting double your bitcoins when you send to an address for Santa or just receiving bitcoins when you submit details that make your wallet accessible will not be enough to tempt you. As you prepare to spend quality time with family, some scammers are brewing tactics ad strategies to be ahead and steal people's coins tomorrow, please let us not be victims. It will be sad thing to read about one of us here fallen victims to this kind of Santa bitcoin scam even after this timely notice to be aware and careful has been posted.",

In this case, it is a Christmas season, and they can use this festive celebration as a trap to lure them as a form of giveaways they are giving to their loyal users or new users who are joining them. Whatever the case may be, we should not be drawn to such things because scammers always find a way to make people believe in them. One must be extra cautious not to fall into their traps. It is said that for the wise, a word is enough, so let us all be wise all of the time.",

At these times, I would even take extra precaution since all those \"Santas\" are going to be around. I can imagine a lot of \"Santa\" emails coming to random people's Spam Mailbox.",

Bitcoin just allows criminals to get away with it easier because the police are not as interested in small scams when using Bitcoin. I think because it is not legal tender they do not consider it worthy enough although if someone stole your collectibles they would have to investigate so I have never understood why cryptocurrency is not treated the same as a collectible at least.",

I've checked the addresses a few times to see if they're getting some people to pay them, but there were no transactions, so I guess people aren't that dumb.

This happen to me sometimes but I have to respond not to get into trouble.If you occasionally receive messages or links that are not important via the email that you manage, I don't think you need to respond further, because it is better to block or delete without further opening. Clicking on unimportant links or links sent via e-mail where the link is completely unknown to you will also be very dangerous. Because scams can also occur via links that are deliberately shared in everyone's email.",

Something has to give, as they say. The principle should be for people not to be beggarly in their approach to things. When we look out for others to hand us freebies, it makes us lose our self worth. That's the way I see it anyway. I see a great deal of that often on social mediaQuoteBtw don't feel bad cashing out (a little) just to treat yourself or family.By the way, talking about \"cashing out\", let me quickly mention a token I saw recently called \"Christmas Shiba (XShib)\". What the heck is that? A token in that format will always be what it's. People are already skeptical with Shiba Inu and then another comes with a name bearing the moment. I think XShib will end up a shit token and those in charge will cash out big time.",
