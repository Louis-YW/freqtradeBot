      "body": "Just from the response of my vote casted, i perform transactions ones or twice a month and barely ones in a week all because i personally have my monthly plan and budget on how i use my bitcoin for my personal and economic life, unlike those that engage in trading, i think they often engage in performing transactions more than twice a day depending on the position and types of trading they get into, once i make my own transaction for the month, i maintain having my digital asset untouched so as to avoid unnecessary spendings, since am not that involve in trading like others, but my priority is to ensure a desciplined use of funds by avoiding over spendings that are unaccounted for.",

Mighty few times, maybe once a month or less.Where to spend Bitcoin physically around me are not readily available and I do not perform online transactions as much; when I do, they seldom rarely accept bitcoin for payment.I believe the answers would be heavily dependent on the region the respondents are from. There are places with a greater online purchase culture than most and they would have more options to use Bitcoin directly for purchases.",

I wish to use bitcoin directly but no one to pay directly aside friends.The only altcoins I prefer are stable coins, I hold some if I know bear market is coming while converting it back to bitcoin after a massive bear market.",

I hope one day I will be able to make purchase with bitcoin, but currently most stores are scared because of Central Bank ban on accounts linked to cryptocurrency, I think that's why they are scared they don't want their accounts to be compromised, but am sure time will come when everybody will be able to spend their bitcon freely in my country.",

If I happen to be in one of such places, I wouldn't mind at all. If its the number of times I use bitcoins directly, I'd say currently I use it occasionally, and it is usually to fund my wallet on my crypto online casino to gamble once in a while. I suppose that should count as a transaction.",

There are places with a greater online purchase culture than most and they would have more options to use Bitcoin directly for purchases.Yeah, I suspect those living in cities will have much more opportunities than those that don't to spend their Bitcoin. I literally don't know how a shop that accepts cryptocurrencies around me. If you go to Cardiff, I'm sure you'll see quite a few, but even then I don't think it's widespread. I imagine bigger cities in America are the ones which will be finding more use for Bitcoin. I literally only use Bitcoin when its only Bitcoin being accepted, and usually at a good price. My latest transaction was joining a betting group over in the gambling section, and before that I hadn't made a Bitcoin purchase in as long as I can remember. I've become a hoarder basically. I've said before though, as soon as mortgages, groceries, and utilities are accepting Bitcoin, then Bitcoin becomes a much more lucrative thing to use for almost everyone. Until then, it'll probably be hoarded by the vast majority.",

When I had purchased my first home back in 2017, I coverted a good amount from my holding to pay the token amount to take care of the registration cost and other government taxes. Since my bitcoin savings helped me to take care of such a huge expense, I don't usually sell off my bitcoins. I see one person has responded as daily. I would like to know his/her experience.",

Other than paying my credit card and have some cash for emergency, I rarely spend my Bitcoin. Just because paying with Bitcoin for goods and services is now illegal in TÃ¼rkiye we can't spend Bitcoin like that. Sad but government always take wrong steps about this.

I don't use bitcoin to acquire anything with a physical beingness besides electronics (such as a RPi). Stuff like food, clothes, alcohol etc., are paid in paper money and I'm ok with that. I prefer using physical cash above bitcoin whenever that's possible. That's because bitcoin works better as a savings account.",
