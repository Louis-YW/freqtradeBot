  "content": "In as much as life is concerned, there is no shortcut to success or greatness before you succeed in life you must pass due processes and hard work as nothing good comes on a platter of gold.It is unfortunate how some persons choose things that are less complex or cheap without knowing the repercussion of choosing a shortcut. Many a time alot of people choose the easier way to make money through frauds, illegal activities, rituals and so on. It is important for us to know and understand that there are consequences that are attached to making money through shortcut just like I've mentioned above, now let's look at the likely penalties.1. Frauds: over the years a lot of people have been defrauded one way or the other and I begin to question the conscience of these fraudsters like do they really think that the people they deceive in other to take their property or money will be happy when they find out that they have been defrauded?. The answer is no, like no body will be happy if they find out that a business someone negotiated with them is fraudulent as some persons might even choose to go diabolical with them and some will channel their grievance to God while others might to use the law and bring them to book. It is really going to tarnish your image, and the reputation of your family as people will tag you and your family as fraudsters.2. Rituals; it is unfortunate that humans heart have been soiled with so much evil to the extent of taking lives that they didn't create. God made man in his own image after his likeness, so it is important for us to know that God cherish human so much that's why creating human took him more time than other creatures so taken a life that you didn't create is an unforgivable sin before God and humanity. Some of this people that performs rituals in other to make money doesn't have rest of mind as either the diety they make sacrifices to or the victim's ghost keep hunting them from time to time and they may not even enjoy the wealth to the fullest before they die.3; illegal activities; illegal activities like stealing, kidnappings and other social vices can lead to death when caught either by the mob that caught you taking laws into their hands or by the security agencies. It is advisable for people to stay away from these social vices as it can lead to ending ones life earlier than God assigned for them. No matter the circumstances or situation, do not allow yourself to be involved in criminal activities instead struggle just as others are struggling for a better tomorrow.In conclusion, it is important we understand that nothing good comes easily, even Rome the greatest city wasn't built in a day as it takes time to achieve positive results. So let's learn to be patient and get involved in legal things that others are doing to make ends meet and also do those things just like this platform have aided a lot of our youths that would have been involved in social crimes but due to the introduction of this forum it has helped most of our youths grow one way or the other and it has also helped in poverty eradication among our youths",

      "body": "OP you're right shortcuts are not always good all the time, but however most people find it very difficult following the due process in life, obviously when we talk about shortcuts is simply means getting things done or achieving something in an easy way Instead of going through some due process, so however shortcuts can tend to be good or bad depending on the intentions of the user. With the development of technology in the world now, however it has impacted on the society positively and negatively, it says to be negative since most persons decided not to focus on acquiring a skills or establishing a business for themselves but instead they feel the only way to become rich is using shortcuts by navigating through computer and doing all kinds of activities such as scamming, defrauding people of there money. However what shall it profit a person indulging yourself on an evil act to make money and at last you were not able to enjoy the money, so irrespective of how difficult things may seem to be, shortcuts to success is not always the way forward because even if you manages to scale through but sometime in the future they will face the penalty.",

      "body": "You are totally correct, shortcuts sometimes don't end up well. Most people who took the shortcut to their success will not tell those who are pleading for them to tell the truth about their success. If most of those guys who took the shortcut tell you what they are passing through most times, will we not even have the mouth to mention the word shortcut anymore. Some people that took the shortcut in their life go extra miles just to gain what they want.However, I believe that in this life, not everyone is supposed to be rich. Yes, if everyone was rich, who would do laundry work or do some stuff that most of us find difficult to do? But, nobody is supposed to be utterly poor. Yes, but these days some people find it difficult to feed themselves twice a day. Some people are extremely poor. It is just a result of laziness and not even ready to work and earn, but just like depending on others' property.Some shortcuts don't end well, and we should try as much as we can to work hard so that even if we don't get RICHER, we should try and get RICH.",

Maybe we should get this right once and for all, looking for a shortcut is just as finding an easier way to make things done faster for our own benefits, this shouldn't be pictured from the perspective of doing manipulations or cheat over the normal procedure or laid down protocols of doing something, it is just that people have taken this for granted and also try to abuse the whole thing for their own selfish goals, we should know that performing a task requires time.But we can use a single stome in hunting down two birds at the same time, which is what going through a shortcut should mean or sound to our hears and not that we should engage doing things from our own discretion and personal interest without considering others or the risk involved.",

Yes you are right to some extent as their are also easier ways to meet up life obligations without being involved in wrong ideas. Like the use of machines to make works easier rather than bear hands. Then also using the computer or keyboard instead of writing with a pen and paper. In a nutshell, I am not referring to easier way to make it legally am emphasizing on illegal shortcuts like the ones I mentioned on my threads. So far as there ways of ways of making things easier in a genuine way it's welcomed.",

But that shouldn't be an excuse because those people who you are defrauding are working genuinely, and deserve not to be treated as such. According to Albert Einstein before his Demis, he states that \"life is an illusion\"there is nothing worth dying for. Those who did money ritual at 1970 what dey achieved was a 504 peugeot which is now a scrap. The magnificent building dey had den, is now outdated and a home for bedbugs. Many of them died long time ago because of short Curt. If you follow life short cut you end up in a short cuts. While the rush? Our elders said\"an antelop that grew long horn overnight does not last long\"",
