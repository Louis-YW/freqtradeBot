Bitcoin is nearly below $30k. And if this continues, we're going to see a lower prices for all of the altcoins and no matter in what exchanges they're listed, as long as the market is being stomped by the bear. There's no way that it will eventually go back to the high price that we've used to see it. Well, most of the markets right now are being bloody so, just think of it that if it will go back to 15k sats, it will take time.",

It's unbelievable thing when it was happening during the bearish market. im sure that the result will always be the same if altcoin must wait bitcoin to stop its bearish trend and enter into the green market again.",

No one knows the answer for this question but yeah that's how market is working right now. Im sure that you can be patience waiting for recovery to come but if luna keep dumping their bitcoin to the market and the downtrend will still continue. This garbage foundation can't even create a proper stable token. You must be careful when deciding to buy any altcoins during the bearish market",

I prefer to hold on to stablecoins or major coins like bitcoin, ethereum, or bnb.",

But if you really believed that this project is somewhat special and has something to offer to the market that investors are going to buy them, then it's best to invest it right now when the price is still very cheap and then HODL.",
