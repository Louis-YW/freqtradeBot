Because of being busy and not following up on my Galxe tasks, I am not qualified for their airdrop. But since it is on a vesting period, I bet that we could only get less and may possibly get dumped in many months to come.This is highly anticipated that most of the crypto airdrops right now if qualified would gradually drag the price down overtime and may end up getting pennies to a few two to three figure dollars when lucky.As of today, I am yet to experience being rewarded for a big airdrop this year compared to the past few years. Right now, I am focusing more on common L2s like Linea, Scroll, zkSync Era, etc.",

But whatever is the case this is just outrageous, scammers are willing to do anything just to get one more dollar in their pockets and if this means insulting the most precious beliefs people have they are still willing to do it, so people should just avoid these coins as it should be clear as day their developers will at some point scam anyone that was willing to give them any money.",

I didn't really hear anything interesting about the coin, and the fact that it's specifically targeting only the Muslim audience, this might be a big hurdle in its way to achieving a lot of success because the industry consists of people from all religions and they might not be interested in a project that is targeting a single religion out of all.However, I guess we will see how the project does once it gets launched and the token starts getting listed in exchanges, or maybe it did already? The altcoin market is getting so saturated lately that it's becoming difficult to actually keep track of every single project coming out these days.",

It seems that the teams were using Dubai residents and prominents people to push the token for marketing before the launch and trading which was misleading because that is impersonation that could even bring down the project in the future if the team were to be investigated, no wonder the price has been crashing.In addition, the token is basically listed on 4 exchange, $2M volume with a fully dilluted valuation of $4B, if tokens were to be unluck, I doubt if the two exchanges are going to able to handle that supply, the price will further slide down.",

This have nothing to do with the real aim and practice of Islam and I believe that the coin is nothing but just a mere pozi. The other reason why this Islamic currency fails so quickly is that the Islamic community is one of the least integrated communities with modern technologies such as blockchain and crypto, because most Islamic countries are third world countries and countries with technological development have a small population, such as the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain. This can be confirmed through activity in the Arabic section here in the forum, since Arabs represent the Muslim majority. I am one of the active members there, and unfortunately we have a small number of members from some Arab countries, and there are countries that no one represents in the section.",

Anyway, at first I didn't believe when you say that there are only 8k something active crypto because I think that was too tiny but it was actually true when I researched it again.There are millions of crypto but many of them are dead, I guess that was also better so that we can lessen the pressure or the load in the market. It's impressive if that was the current rank of this coin shared here by the OP despite being new or is it really? Because the name sounds familiar to me. It seems I heard the coin somewhere before.
