I believe I said that originally.no need for the formula - lol I know how it works.  I would just prefer to see the forums built up vs somewhere off the forums being built. I know you said that originally  I just wanted an excuse to use a formula in a discussion and do some pontification about Austrian economics.  Forum is not going anywhere, but there are not enough people with bitcoins to spend or forum accounts to facilitate a full-scale economy. lol @ the formula.I wish you luck. If the forums are \"going nowhere\" it might be because people with very little time here such as yourself give up too easy on it either way - I do wish you luck and profits in your endeavor.  Maybe some day my view may change - or yours",

Perhaps because you are so new, you did not realize this. I have never personally had coins consigned to myself for imaging, listing, grading and advertising purposes. I have acted as an intermediary for reshipping coins to some of my customers. Sorry, I guess I was not very clear.  My point is there are many here that may chime in and offer advice and information as many here have either done consignment for others or have used members such as minerjones to handle their sales.",

      "body": "Well I'd be interested in giving it a try . I have never submitted my items to a grading company except once. I have seen one other piece graded by a 3rd party but they always seem to get things wrong   . Maybe PCGS can get one correct.  The current engraved pieces remind me of USA territorial minted gold pieces of the 1800's, but will be moving towards high relief portrait pieces that will be similar to titan/norfed quality dies. Sometimes simplicity and straight to the point is all that matters though, like simple territorial pieces. History shows us what territorial gold piece prices can do.  Maybe I will write up a CT encyclopedia and submit my line of product to PCGS and see what happens. If they grade it with no issues, I will contact you on sales in the future. I like to work with others that build people up and not try to tear them down. I feel fairly confident that I'm sitting on the largest physical crypto inventory on the planet (and growing by the month), so I will have supply waiting for the correct moment.",

The scam works by getting you off eBay onto telegram. Once on telegram it generally goes downhill from there. This scammer I have dealt with in the past, he is rather convincing.  If you want to lose your fiat and bitcoin, make sure to buy from eclipsepayments1.    The Cas the scammer is claiming to be selling is from a previous auction on the auction platform Scarce City. Oh wow and using your name….. Thanks for the heads up man. You can never be to careful",
