  "content": "I rarely go out of the house when there is nothing important for me to do, but in the past week I was idly out of the house just to watch a football game which is very close to where I live. Then I started to be surprised when I read that there was a sponsor that said Crypto and there was someone wearing a shirt that said Bitcoin. This actually made me very amazed besides I was a little surprised because what I know around where I live no one knows about Crypto and Bitcoin. And even most people here don't want to know about Crypto and Bitcoin because they already consider it as something that is completely unimportant to them. But I'm actually very happy when I know this now because I'm trying to conclude that Crypto and Bitcoin have started to be liked by some people around me even though I don't know who they are, but this makes me happy to see it and also makes me even more excited to continue learning Crypto and Bitcoin and trying to tell everyone that Crypto and Bitcoin are good things to know and learn. Hopefully in the future there will be more people who want to learn Crypto and Bitcoin here because I never tell about Crypto and Bitcoin to people around me. How is the condition of Crypto and Bitcoin in your area guys?",

It's not effective, waste of money and time.QuoteHopefully in the future there will be more people who want to learn Crypto and Bitcoin here because I never tell about Crypto and Bitcoin to people around me.The awareness and adoption of Bitcoin increases with each halving and consequent bull run.The increasing adoption occurs by proactively activities (education, social media seeding, etc.) and natural activities that you can not stop.",

One way to get good data about how many persons are into cryptocurrency is to host an exciting event it can be a football tournament or even a conference just like what you have in your area  that will lure crypto friendly individuals. That way it will be easy to give a good estimate of how crypto friendly your environment could be",

And also as it was very local tournament, so there is no need to take any government’s permission to host the matches or neither BTC or Cryptos are required to be legalised there. I don’t know the exact thing that might have happened there, but yes feeling proud after listening to OP.I live in quite urban city, so in case of my place, many of the people are aware of Cryptos.",

Those that have ideas on Bitcoin in the rural community are doing well in every area of their lifes compared to those who don't have any knowledge about decentralized currency and how it works for humanity in the land are seriously experiencing  hardship, because they don't believe that people can use it to grow their economy and family in the societies.",

It is good thing that regardless of government policies they do not affect wearing branded materials. Noticing that there is need to play a part, I advice OP that if possibly you take it upon yourself to maybe give out more materials branded with bitcoins.

Maybe sell tickets with discounts when they use cryptocurrency and give them a different ticket so you can easily check which one is a crypto individual and who's not. Or you could probably ask the individuals, it's taxing and annoying for the individual but who knows, it might get the job done.How many persons will be willing to pay for a ticket to a cryptocurrency conference or tournament even with discounted offers. tournaments brings people of like minds together and when its done without a price tag it attracts even more crowd. If you were to ask individuals, how many persons can you really ask? How much patience and tolerance can you endure to see this work.",
