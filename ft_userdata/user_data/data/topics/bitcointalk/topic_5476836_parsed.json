This topic should be moved to exchanges.This thread is not fully based on the exchange,it was described about the impact of the current transaction fee on the gambling site.Since it was based on the gambling site transaction,I think this will be exact location to discuss about it and it was my recent experience in the gambling site.This was not my situation being the gambler,it was the same situation faced by my all of the gambler friends.We should wait for the market fees to settle down to deposit in our gambling site.Quote from: Oshosondy on December 07, 2023, 12:09:28 AMQuote from: kenshi222 on December 07, 2023, 12:03:58 AMNow the gambling site was in the trouble because of the high transaction fee by the exchanges like the Binance.It was unacceptable one for the gambler to pay 26 dollars to withdraw funds from the Binance.Being a gambler,my opinion is to hold till the money in the exchange itself.Surely we get the profit from the gambling site,if we follow some techniques in the gambling site.But my point is why we need to pay the exchange fee of 26 dollars for the single transaction.Binance is charging fee on bitcoin transaction excessively.

It was their own decision to get some dollars from their user at this bull run.But it had impact to the gamblers who only use the exchange for the deposit of the money to the gambling site.Because even the best gambling site had high fees to buy crypto using our credit cards.This was the important reason the gamblers to buy their crypto coins in the binance and then send the same to the gambling sites.We hope the transaction fee will back to normal in few weeks.So the gamblers should have some patience for their further transactions to the gambling sites.",

If such a transaction fee (small holders/owners of small amount of bitcoins will definitely be vulnerable here). Some time ago the Bitcoin transaction mempool was much larger. We cannot afford transactions with such high fees. Small gamblers in particular are currently at risk because dollars cannot be transferred elsewhere.

Another thing you can do if you use a softwallet like bluewallet is to monitor the times when there is low activity on the network like towards the midnight and early in the mornings. You can take advantage of those times. Have you thought of using other substitute of bitcoins that has very low transaction fee. There are no consequences to using them as long as they accepted by the casino.",

What is quite worrying is that the current situation makes gamblers think that saving it at an exchange or casino is the right choice to avoid high fees even though that is not very appropriate, especially if the funds stored there are quite big which will make the gambler lose the money due to other things whose losses are greater than the current fees.",

They will continuously compete with each other to win the hearts of customers. The beneficiaries are probably the customers, who will have to reduce transaction fees to keep their customers.",

But it's what it is right now, nevertheless I believed that the high fees can't sustain this kind of run, I mean it was obvious that this is a deliberate attack on the mempool by some entities or the people behind Ordinal or whatever you call it.I don't see that being back in the bear market will reduce the fees, again the reason for the increased is the whole ordinal thing. If they will simply stop then we will be back to normal with less than 5 sat/vB to make a good transaction and be included in the next block.",

It is really that too costly  for the current fees that we do have as of this moment but we know that this isnt something that very often. Just like you do say that whenever the network do have this congested situation then it cant really be denied that it do really sucks on making some bitcoin transactions which the fees were too high and confirmation of transactions is really that too slow. If you are that someone whose really that making sometransactions and needing it asap then you would really be making yourself get delayed because of the current market condition.
