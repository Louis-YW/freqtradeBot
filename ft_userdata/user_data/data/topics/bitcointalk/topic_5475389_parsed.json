If your confuse and do not want to make mistake I would advice you swap the coin since it is still on exchange to another coin that you understand it’s network. Example is the tron (Trx) network, it’s fees are cheap and transactions is fast",

You can either choose to withdrawal other network like Tron or any other blockchain that it will be cheaper for you and if you so much desire to hold LTC then you can later convert back to LTC when ever necessary.",

I think in the past the network was called litecoin network?I don't know what exchange you use - but you should get more network options when withdrawing LTC. You should get lower withdrawal fees if you withdraw LTC using its own network [Litecoin] instead of BNB Smart Chain [BEP20] or BNB Beacon Chain [BEP2] - but then again I don't know which exchange you use.Get a comparison of withdrawal fees here if you use Binance: https://www.binance.com/en/fee/cryptoFeeQuote from: david678345 on November 24, 2023, 08:37:58 PMbtw is LTC still the best option to use for withdrawals?Maybe not - bitcoin withdrawal fees using the Lightning Network are definitely lower than LTC withdrawal fees using the Litecoin network. In fact, you can still withdraw BTC from an exchange even if the value is only less than $0.2 - especially if the exchange you use has integrated the Lightning Network.",

It might be that it is from the exchange end of the site so you can wait for them to update the site then you make your withdrawal and op if you don't mind, you can mention the exchange name so experts can help you out from another approach. Normally if you are using LTC then the services will come from it and just as bitcoin network. And also the network options would been more than one for you to select the appropriate one to withdraw your funds.",

I think in the past the network was called litecoin network?It's not a wrong network to use, as Litecoin now already has its peg version on the BSC network. So, it won't be a problem if you make a withdrawal. But it would be even better if you used the native Litecoin network. BTW, what exchange do you use? I'm curious about that exchange because they provide the peg version of withdrawals but don't provide withdrawals on the native network .Quote from: david678345 on November 24, 2023, 08:37:58 PMbtw is LTC still the best option to use for withdrawals?For Altcoins I prefer Tron (TRX), it has low fees (around $0.1) with faster finality than Bitcoin & other old Altcoins like Litecoin.",

If you want to withdraw any other altcoin beside bitcoin then Sol has the lowest withdraw fees as per my knowledge. It can change based on the exchange like in binance if you withdraw any crypto from the BSC network and that project supports that network then you will get lower fees compared to others. The same way if you use the KCC network when withdrawing from kucoin withdraw fees will be very low.",

I am not sure if there's support from wallets about Litecoin in Bep20 (BSC) and that's going to make no sense as Litecoin itself is cheap and fast. What is this exchange that you're withdrawing from? There should be an option to choose the actual LTC network than of those smart networks from different chains.Quote from: david678345 on November 24, 2023, 08:37:58 PMbtw is LTC still the best option to use for withdrawals?One of the best but there can be other options that will make you choose them like if in Tether, there's the common one that is being widely used for TRC20. But let's just go with that and say yes that LTC is still the best option for withdrawals if you're trying to avoid the high fees of Bitcoin if ever you have no other choice at all. But have a look in the mempool because if you're trying to withdraw money from an exchange and you have it on BTC, you don't have to exchange it anymore and just withdraw directly from it because fees now have gotten down at least.",

Do way you asked is the right thing to do most people don't ask is after their error they would come to cry here over their mistakes.",

The fees are smaller for LTC network.BEP20 are LTC tokens on BSC network, if you are doing a exchange to centralized exchange it would not have much difference as they might consider equal to any other LTC. The fees could be a bit higher and many exchanges don't support LTC on BSC network.If you are withdrawing it to your wallet, you would have hassle to further deposit BNB for fees. I suggest not to deal with LTC on BSC if all you want is to save fees. Go with BSC or similar low fee coins that are widely accepted in their native form.",

I just checked Binance a few minutes ago to see if it was the culprit, but it came out clean on that. I wonder what exchange that could be.Quotebtw is LTC still the best option to use for withdrawals?Yes, it is. Both withdrawal charges and daily limit are more favourable to those utilizing the main Litecoin option. Quote from: royalfestus on November 24, 2023, 10:55:18 PMIf you want to deposit BEP20, look for an exchange with more than one blockchain, including the BEP20 blockchain. As soon as you deposit, you can withdraw with other blockchainsMost exchanges don't restrict that much when accepting deposits. They're literally relaxed in their rules but they tighten their grips when withdrawals are ask for. OP's issue is withdrawal, BTW.",

When he is trying to withdraw from the exchange wallet it doesn't give the option of Litecoin blockchain. It only gives BEP-20 which basically converts Litecoin to a BEP-20 token. The OP doesn't want that and therefore is asking option. Now if the transfer is made in BEP-20 tokens than changelly won't be able to convert it back to Litecoin. Further there would be a transaction and conversion fee which will cost him more. It is better to convert it into TRX and then make a withdrawal.
