But the one important things I have known is that bitcoin is store of value. Talking about monetary system, it's a kind of things that's not taken care of and it causes a lot of inflation in the societies we live in today because it's manipulated by governments and CBN, one other things why government is against Bitcoin is because it's decentralize and it's unpredictable because it goes up and comes down within seconds so they believes that Bitcoin is very risky to fix money, and i aldo don't have think if it could fix the monetary system at all.",

I don't think anything is wrong necessarily with our current money system however people have preferences which they might prefer using fiat or crypto. The only thing I can think of that crypto can 'fix' is people's economic situation. Here is me hoping that crypto makes all of us richer.",

However I have computed the correct one and placed in a code element above so you can just copy and paste if you can't find the error. From my experience in image placement I think using the \"left\" attribute to place an image isn't necessary for one image because the system will place it to the left by default. Anyways adding does no harm than make the post longer it's best for placing more than one small sized photos.Now with respect to your initial question , all I'll say is Bitcoin will only prove a better alternative for battling inflation and also a better alternative for p2p but Bitcoin didn't come to replace Fiat. Bitcoin gradually became the safest form of crypto investment because of its good trend over the years especially with respect to price.",

Saving our money in banks with low interest rate, lower than inflation rate, is failure against inflation.Bitcoin is a good investment choice and since 2009, it has brought very high ROIs, the best investment asset. I believe in Bitcoin and its growth in future and I agree that invest our money in Bitcoin can help us to build up our wealth and don't fail against inflation.I disagree to say Bitcoin can fix inflation. It was not designed to do this and can not do it.",

      "body": "Well, in the phrase \"fix money,\" I'm not really sure in what aspect or what kind of fix. So I will assume that the fix that is being mentioned in the t-shirt is that bitcoin could be the solution for the lack of fiat currency or fiat system in the world. For example, with bitcoin's technology or block chain, bitcoin is so secure that no one could control the currency and no one could own it, only the investors and its users. Another aspect that bitcoin could fix is maybe the problem when it comes to the low or fixed value of a currency, but with bitcoin or crypto currency, many people could have the option to invest in a currency or crypto currency in order to earn an investment, which could give many opportunities for people who want to upgrade their lives. And many more that bitcoin could provide, but remember, it is only a \"fix,\" meaning crypto currency or bitcoin should not replace the currency system because it will be a big change and adjustment. I'm glad that bitcoin could be legalised and treated like a fiat currency system.",

All we have is currencies. There is also bitcoin which is a currency that can become money. You also don't fix money (which is a tool) as the thing written on that tshirt says. You can use the tool to fix something else. What needs fixing is the monetary system as you said. But that problem is not new and doesn't belong to our lifetime as the tshirt suggests  It's been going on for centuries, ever since they made the first currency that wasn't backed by anything and could be printed unlimitedly (can't be store of value hence is not money).Fixing it is not easy either. It affects all aspects of society and most importantly there is no solution or alternative for the existing financial system. As I said, even if Bitcoin becomes money, it still is money not the solution to the monetary system problems.",

In short, Bitcoin is decentralized, and the rest, like gold and real estate, can be regulated by the country.
