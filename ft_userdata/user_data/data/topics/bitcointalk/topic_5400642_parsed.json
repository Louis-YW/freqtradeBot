  "content": "Greetings,I got a few questions regarding the way how miners choose transactions.1. While a miner hashes, will the nonce be reset on every new transaction added to the block?2. And if blocks are not full, are new transactions added instantly or is there some sort of \"waiting time\"?Best regards",

If you mean the block hash (the thing that's targeted to be below a certain number) then that'll change: when a new transaction is added; when a transaction is removed; or when transactions are moved inside the block.The mining software takes transactions from the mempool of the node running and organises them (they normally prioritise higher fees but could also prioritise their own transactions too ahead of that). Transactions are immediately minable once they're sent to the node and some mining software may shuffle round transactions anyway for finding the solution for the next block.",

While a miner hashes, will the nonce be reset on every new transaction added to the block?The block the miner is attempting to solve is known as the candidate block. If the miner adds new transactions or replaces some transaction in their candidate block, then the Merkle root they calculate will be different and so their block header (the thing they are hashing) will be different. At that point, miners would reset the nonce field to zero.Also note that the nonce field, being only 4 bytes, can be exhausted in under a second. The miner will then change something else about the block, usually incrementing the extraNonce field in the coinbase transaction, and reset the nonce.

And if blocks are not full, are new transactions added instantly or is there some sort of \"waiting time\"?It doesn't make sense for a miner to update their candidate block every single time they learn of a new transaction, as the pool would need to recompute their Merkle tree every time it does and then send the new block data to all their miners, which has an associated cost to it. How often a pool updates their candidate block is up to the pool, but I imagine most pools would be somewhere in the 5-30 second range.Quote from: jackg on May 29, 2022, 06:38:37 PMThe \"nonce\" is the random number stored in the coinbase transaction to change the block hash.This is the extraNonce.

Mining has gotten more complicated but with adequate knowledge it can be navigated",

OP, newbies, fellow plebs. The bolded statement in that post is a very important point. It's the incentive structure that makes the whole Bitcoin network/system stick together. I don't know if it was the same to many of you, but it took me some months after buying Bitcoin that I truly understood that for \"decentralization\" to \"work\", it's all about having incentives to keep everyone \"honest\".",

If its designed to stop a transaction to go through, an imposed regulation will make it hard for users if the coins are tagged.That's why it's the incentive structure that keeps everything stick together and actually work. If there was a miner who decides that only the transactions that he/she only likes should be included in the next block regardless of profit/incentive, then there's another miner who would be more willing to include those transactions as an opportunity to earn more. Given enough time, the miner who excludes transactions would earn less and less, and its competitors earn more and more, and grow bigger in hashing power, making the miner who excludes less and less competitive until it's unprofitable to mine.",

The precursor to Stratum V2 - BetterHash - also allowed miners to choose transactions for their candidate blocks, and was implemented by Blockstream pool at the time.I suspect as time goes on such a feature will become more commonplace.",
