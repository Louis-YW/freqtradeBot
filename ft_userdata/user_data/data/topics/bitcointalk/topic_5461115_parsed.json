BUT not really resulting in more multiples of transaction counts.and thats the jist of the war.. both sides not getting consensus(mass vote) in 2015-mid 2017 core proposed in mid 2017 a method to implement their upgrade that did not need majority users vote to activate cores method (due to 9 months of lack of even 50% demand for cores idea.. (nov2016-july2017))the network upgraded eventually(unnatural 100% compliance in just a matter of weeks) using a mandated blackmail event(NYA agreement) which caused the fork. those that were on another team slinkered off to live on the fork caused by core and adapted their fork into something different due to realising core (emphasis on their name) became centralised powerhouse no one can fightit did not require miners to write new code themselves.. instead it was core devs and their corporate sponsors that wrote code demanding that mining pools had to flag a new signal to accept the core upgrade or be rejected and forked off the networkcore accomplished their goalit was not a other team caused the fork. it was not average joe user nodes, it was not miners that wrote the code for segwit. it was corporate sponsored core devs that wrote the segwit code and blackmailed the wider community to comply or have their blocks rejected. where the corporations(NYA agreement) were the majority economic services everyone uses so had to follow or not have their coins seen by those services. the mining pools did not even need to run the segwit code, they just needed to flag a bit of data in a block header that they were complying to avoid rejection. the users nodes didnt need to pre-run segwit code to cause activation neitheri now expect certain cultish behaviour people to scream and cry their mantra of how they want to promote core as the saviours and leaders and how anyone going against core are agaisnt bitcoin.. and must be ignored, banned and told to f**k offno people can still admire bitcoin but despise cores centralist methodology, because bitcoin as a previously promoted decentralised network should not be complying to a central power house of blackmail. and no this does make those despising core be pigeon holed into supporting the forked team. nor does it mean anyone that wants to promote how core gained too much power should be told to shut up and just obey the cult mindset as a blind follower",

However, it should be kept in mind that fork wars are not something that is a thing of the past, especially in the case that the spot BTC ETF is approved in the US, which in combination with what BlackRock stated in this context means that at some point in the future no one should be surprised with some new fork that will be backed by a fund with a capital of several trillion $.",

In truth this \"conflict\" about scaling bitcoin lasted at least 5 years and it definitely wasn't just bcash versus bitcoin with only 2 sides. There were many sides or better said many different proposals for different approaches which we may categorize in a simple way into 2 or 3 categories.1. The group saying bitcoin should scale using the second layer and should not have a hard fork.2. The group saying bitcoin should only scale on-chain (layer one and only layer one) by hard forking to a bigger block size3. The group saying both at the same time. This was short lived and was very messy mainly seen in SegWit2x which had its own separate issues.Of course this is an oversimplification since for example the second group consists of many different approaches like one saying we should have a one time fork to a massive block size while another saying we should let the miners choose to change the size at any time they wanted, etc.",
