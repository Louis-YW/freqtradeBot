I have no idea of how things are really going overseas but here in my country, everything has fundamentally changed and people are shocked by what we are today: distancing is becoming a habit so less people are willing to associate with each other; everybody is on smartphone, addicted in social media videos; countless companies go broke and the number of unemployed keeps soaring; prices of pills, even for regular flu, are insanely going up; parks that used to be crowded before COVID are nearly empty nowadays.  The economic reccesion is worsening the situation even the whole country reopens. It's just different now and everything can not go back... What about the situation in your country ?",

So sorry about the situation in your country. COVID-19 was a major pandemic and global concern, some countries had the effect worse than some other countries and it looks like your country is among the countries with its serious effects. Things have changed, just like they always have been changing, it means that you have to adapt to the changes to be able to survive. On the news, there is talk about a new variant called the Kraken that is resistant to antibodies. We all still have to be careful whether we are vaccinated or not.   See news here",

People are losing their jobs. The price of food, the price of medicine is increasing in the price of all the products which are beyond the reach of people.  However, this situation will have to wait for a few more years.",

Covid-19 is a pandemic that I will never forget,it has crumble so many countries economy, especially the third world countries which might not be able to recover from their economy melt down. Even big countries are still struggling to survive the present ongoing recession in their country, talk more of the third world countries. After Covid-19 the world hasn't recovered from the destruction it did,the war started and that has brought much inflation in every country. I don't know why your country is still on lockdown, will your government be able to fend for everybody by providing them with their basic needs,if No then I guess,your country situation is very terrible because how will citizens survive in the nearest future. There is high rate of inflation in my country with high rate of workers loosing their jobs but the ports are open and we can travel oversea",

And one of the industries that's back and up is hospitality so that includes the catering business.That's sad to hear that your family business went go bankrupt but I guess you're considering to be back again as most things are becoming normal and restrictions were loosen at least for many countries that has a huge percentage of vaccinated citizens.",

It's just different now and everything can not go back... What about the situation in your country ? The only positive change Covid-19 brought was that it increased the rate of health awareness and preventive measures against some communicable diseases. Simple preventive measures like washing hands or the use of hand sanitizer have been inculcated by most people.But this pandemic has changed the political and economic and social space of some countries. Some political parties used the pandemic as a means of getting political power. In the US it was one of the campaign tools of Democrats when they claimed that Trump's response to the pandemic was not encouraging. Economically it made many nations face challenges because most industries in major manufacturing countries like China were shut down and it affected the price of oil and gas. Socially, people have learned to stay alone. The pandemic reduced the social life of many people and they are now used to staying indoors. Before in my country marriages commands a lot of crowds, but after the pandemic people have started embracing low-key or even secret marriages.",

I can't convince myself, is this intentional, technological war, conspiracy or whatever. but certainly, I feel the impact once. it's not just one or two people I know have died from this virus.Even in my own place, at least in a day there are 1 or two people who die either while in the hospital or during isolation in their own homes. the situation was really, really bad and gripping, because I was one who witnessed it and felt it. fortunately, the situation in my country is all under control, even cases affected by this virus are rarely reported on local television media.if what you say is true, i hope you and your family are fine and this virus will gradually disappear by itself.",
