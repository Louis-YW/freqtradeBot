In that case, I believe your best bet is to use a hardware wallet, you can either use their desktop wallet or just simply connect it over Metamask.",

      "body": "Almost the options available to you are rather slim if we consider that you want a wallet similar to the Core wallet. Perhaps the only option in this case is to use a hardware wallet through the Ledger Leaf app.At the same time, there are some other safe options, which are mainly limited to applications that help to deal with the Ethereum network, such as the EVM gateway or the MetaMask extension on the web browser.",

      "body": "The safest way - it is a metamask, which will be connected to your hardware wallet, all other ways, such as the same Trust Wallet or Atomic Wallet can not be called the most secure solutions, as well as mobile wallets. If you put a question like: \"tell me the most accessible and most convenient wallet,\" then of course you can consider various browser extensions or wallets with closed source code, but it certainly has nothing to do with such a characteristic as the most secure.",

It will be safer for your assets instead of using a software wallet regularly connecting to the internet which will have certain risks.",
