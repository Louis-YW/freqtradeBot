Either will work for me.I want to get into a job that I really like and it's a plus that they're exchanges and related to cryptocurrencies. And the role will be depending on what will be given to me. I've got offers before during the ICO days where projects like B2B have been scaling and I've got no idea and was scared during that time that I might just compromise the trust that has given to me and that's why I've declined most of those job offers.",

In this description it only stated the same amount but not job description. I will rather know the kind of activities I will perform in the both exchanges before taking any part. For I love doing things am good at, after going through the work of each exchange, I will choose the one that I will deliver almost 100%.My own reason of choosing the one I know very well is because when am ask to defend I will do it perfectly. Binance is my best exchange because is the exchange I use very well but if I eventually find out that I could do the in Uniswap very I will go for Uniswap exchange, my opinion depends on the area am good at.",

You have to see what skills do you have and what are their job requirements (tasks) for you.You did not describe what you will do for them, like a customer service support (I guess).Quote from: Nwada001 on March 21, 2023, 12:22:12 PMLet me say for instance that they both need a community manager or support that can be active in one of their social channels. I will go with Uniswap (a decentralized exchange) because they have fewer complaints daily than centralized exchanges like Binance.Exchanges will do their customer support via support tickets officially opened at their websites.Customer support via social media channels are very vulnerable to scammers and impersonators and I am sure those channels if used for customer support, are only supplementary channels, not main ones.Few complaints from DEX and CEX, are you sure? It depends on many factors like how many customers they have, how smooth or laggy, buggy their platforms are as those factors contribute a lot to needs of customer support and complaints.",

I'm not saying that Binance is better than Uniswap, both of them have the best service for me, but Binance seems more rational to choose compared to Uniswap because most people know Binance better than Uniswap, especially since Binance is a large multi-national company and has worked at this company was a good experience for me, so I will choose Binance.However, if the decentralized exchange is quite popular like Uniswap, and the centralized exchange is not popular, I prefer to work on Uniswap. It's not about working at DEX or CEX, it's about the credibility of which company I work for.",

As a lover of Bitcoin and one who wishes to promote only Bitcoin and no other alt, I will choose to work with Binance over Uniswap, reason been that since Uniswap is a decentralized exchanges who only offers Ethereum base token \"ERC20 tokens and pegged coins such as Wrap Bitcoin (I.e WBTC), I will rather go for Binance who thou it's centralized, but at least offers buy, sell, swapping and trading of Bitcoin with much higher market liquidity compared to Uniswap.

But if you have to choose where to live with the same salary, you might prefer Binance, because Binance is the most popular Exchange today. It is everyone's dream to join their team. But it seems to be a dream that is difficult to achieve, we will see how many people want to enter and can become a Binance team. and the skills required are certainly not just any skills, it takes people who are competent in their fields, as Blockchain developers, programming etc. But if I have to be part of the cleaning service I also want to, LOL, the important thing is to be part of them and be able to monitor what coins will be listed :v",

Majority would work for Binance cause it's a much bigger company and improves your chances of landing a future role in another similar company. This does not mean the user is encouraging people to store their fundson CEXes.",

Assuming the payment or salary is the exact same amount every month which one will you prefer to work for and why? Payment/salary is very important to consider before taking a job, so also are some other factors. If two companies offer you a job with same amount as pay, you automatically begin to consider other things so you know which of them will be better for you to work in. Some examples of these other things to consider are;- If you are required to work offline, you consider the proximity and distance from your house to both offices and how far you will have to go everyday.- Working hours.- Working environment if it is an offline job too.Considering these factors since salary is the same can help in your decision making process.",

Joining a team or company that shares the same vision and goal with you is the pathway to job satisfaction and fulfilment. Working because of money could lead to frustration. I don't believe in the centralization of cryptocurrencies because it could lead to loss of funds and privacy invasion. It will be self deception to work for a company you don't believe in. I will gladly work for a decentralized platform even if the pay is lower than that of the centralized exchange. Since the salaries are the same it it will be a great pleasure to be part of a team that promotes privacy and upholds the principle of becoming your own banks.
