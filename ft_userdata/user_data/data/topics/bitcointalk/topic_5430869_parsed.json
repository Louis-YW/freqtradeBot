It would be shown on the gambling site withdrawal page. There should always be wire transfer if you have no other option. Using wire transfer, the withdrawal may take 2 weeks, if you have no other option, just go for it. Better to make use of one of gambling sites on this forum instead of the stress international fiat gambling site will make you go through while depositng or withdrawing, that is one of the reasons I am no longer actively using fiat gambling site ago. My deposit on crypto gambling sites are almost instantly.For Casino, you can visit https://livecasino.ioYou can visit sites like Trustdice, Rollbit, Roobet, Stake, Duelbit and some other ones. You can see their official thread on the gambling board. Do not go for 1xbit, it has negative trust from forum members.On the gambling board, read the official thread of each gambling site to know the services they are offering.",

You freely contact them and ask which online bank they are supported by since this question is indeed very common. Bet365 is non-crypto supported and I am sure because of their legalities, if they have an ANN thread here we can answer your question, remember this is a BTC/crypto community, most popular gambling casino that accepts BTC and other cryptos will usually easy to recognize. I don't know what is the reason why Bet365 still now did not accept BTC as a mode of payment, it would be easy to deposit, and there is no link your account to any of your bank accounts.",

If your country allows gambling, I think it will be safe and the shipping process will continue until it is finished. But if not, the bank may ask a few things before they can complete the process. Maybe sending the money to Paypal, Skrill, or some other method is safer than sending it directly to the bank but I don't know.But indeed, asking for customer service is the best way not to violate their rules.",

I remember I did a research before if they support crypto payments or not, I then saw a statement that they are planning on adding one but it seems that they cancelled it out because until now, they still don't have it. Too bad but let us see in the future once cryptos became more popular. I don't think any company is going to ignore it.If they will ignore it for the second, third, x time then they are going to be left behind. For now bet365 is still doing fine. They still have lots of customers, given that they offer a great service. I think that's one of the reasons why they aren't bothered adding cryptos.",
