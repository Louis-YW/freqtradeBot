  "content": "In Nigeria, where bitcoin and crypto currency at large is termed illegal by the government, a young investor by name Gaius Chibueze, also the founder of Tactcoin has donated a sum of 10 million Naira worth of Btc (approximately 0.55btc) to Peter obi a presidential candidate in the country's forthcoming General election. The donation is meant for obi's campaign and mobilisation. Gaius believes that obi can take the country's economy forward.This post isn't about the donation to the presidential aspirant but the continuous involvement of my country into crypto currency, how it can open the eyes of the government to see the real light of crypto world and how it will also influence more people about crypto currency genuity and is also here to stay.I am seriously happy about this new development in my country and hope this will lead to crypto been legally accepted here in Nigeria",

You must have forgotten or don't even know the reason why the Government Banned crypto transactions by all financial institutions via the CBN pronouncement, \"ENDSARS\" even though Crypto has been in use way before then. You must not have also known about this too?Kano school accepts cryptocurrency, asks FG to embrace digital payment",

This contribution to this political campaign might be a \"Greek gift\" to attract favor or political patronage ones Mr. Obi becomes the President. Google about this Presidential candidate and you would discover that he has the largest youth support base. Many youth are contributing as low as $1 to ensure that they support his campaign. He is perceived as an incorruptible, youthful and a visionary leader. The good-news is that regardless of the intentions of the donor or the recipient the message of Bitcoin is being preached and publicized.",

It will start looking like more traditional currencies and other donations, and while that might not be why crypto was thought up in the first place, it's definitely something that is unavoidable. And it will put the donator in a favorable position if the politician gets to power, and in return, help crypto be more represented in that country.",

The donation is meant for obi's campaign and mobilisation. The donation may just be a freewill donation without any other motives like some users here have suggested. 10million Naira is a small amount compared to what some of these wealthy Nigerian men have, plus it is a little amount to give in support of someone you believe in. Peter Obi is the youngest option of the three top candidates, and because of his entrepreneurial character, many youths see him as one who will make favourable policies that will be in benefit of businesses and crypto. If you further analyze the situation, you will find out that the political party Peter Obi is in do not have a good financial structure, hence the need for financial donations from well meaning individuals, Mr Gaius Chibueze may just be fulfilling that and playing his part knowing that in a better crypto environment in Nigeria, his tatcoin may have some hope of survival.",

Plus, he might get an endorsement from the presidential candidate Peter Obi that would massively advertise his Tactcoin. And as a bonus perk for being a “sponsor” of Peter Obi’s presidential candidacy, he made those people who were unaware and misinformed about Bitcoin to simply study and check out its real use cases despite that the Nigerian government’s stance on BTC is still in question where they are still banning banks and online payment service providers to adopt crypto but P2P transactions are still on.",

So with the  \"kind gesture\" of that young investor towards the presidential candidate in the light of showing how positive bitcoins can help the economy, can bring about the mass adoption of bitcoins or rather cryptocurrencies as a whole in that country.

For his personal interests; The OP stated that the money was donated to aid the political campaign of the politician because he believed that the aforementioned politician had the potential tp move the economy of the country a bit faster. 2. To ensure adequate publicity of cryptocurrencies; Like I said earlier, He may have done it to ensure cryptocurrencies can be generally accepted in the country. And there are still other things he gains such as publicity, influence, etc.",

I am sure that Gaius Chibueze must have his own personal and political reasons for the act and maybe it can partly be because he is looking forward for Peter Obi to win the election and be able to influence him and his government somehow to maybe make cryptocurrency not illegal but strictly regulated in Nigeria. I see nothing wrong with that per se. Now, let's hope this candidate that he is supporting can really win the coming election so that his donation can really mean something for the crypto industry of this country.",
