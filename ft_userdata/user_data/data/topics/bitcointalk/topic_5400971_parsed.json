But before providing a service you should concentrate on what you are writing on the forum. You have introduced as a bitcointalk manager where you should say Bounty Campaign Manager, Bounty Manager, Signature Campaign Manager or something like that. Along with these you should provide as many information as possible base on your service.",

You are still a newbie with less than 5 days of activity on the forum. You cannot even post pictures on the forum with your current rank, so how will you post ANNs or service topics?",

Being a newbie you will have to work alot harder to get jobs, so while you have time on your hands you should do as I suggested.",

      "body": "If I would have business which would need some promotion, I definitely would hire random newbie without experience than experienced manager with good reputation. C'mon, you didn't even made proper ANN, wait, you didn't even checked spelling before posting and wrote bitcointlk twice. No offence OP, but it's not professional.You can follow suggestion give by yahoo above, but I suggest to look for other business ideas. We have more than enough established managers on Bitcointalk, probably more than available campaigns. So, IMO, there isn't much perspective for new managers.",
