It would be interesting to see how the market is going to react.Thoughts on what to expect next as he's out of the picture?

His resignation news just came earlier than expected. Let's see what the news will bring to the market, or can we already tag it to be part of the factor pushing bitcoin to the $100k level already?",

With Trump stepping in and openly supporting Bitcoin earlier this year, it makes sense he'd want someone more aligned with that vision. If Teresa Goody gets the role, we might finally see some clarity and less hostility toward the crypto space.Markets could react positively to this, especially if it signals a more pro-crypto regulatory environment. I‚Äôm curious to see how this affects not just Bitcoin but altcoins and stablecoins too,could be a big shift coming next year and hoping that most of the countries will follow, especially my country PH.wagmi!",

Here's a man who has knowledge and has in fact taught about blockchain, digital currencies, Bitcoin, and the like at MIT. Here's a man who seems fond of the rising financial technology and even shared stories about Satoshi and Pizza Day and whatnot with his students. Gensler isn't necessarily pro-Bitcoin, but he probably was open-minded and looks at things objectively. It's just that there are bigger policies in every administration and he has to abide with them.",

Maybe even set a new ATH while we're at it?Whatever happens, I am sure it is all positive for the industry and the community.
