Be interesting to hear who is for and against micro cap altcoins? If you own any what is your plan with them and if not why do you not believe in them?having said that, you have an extremely diversified portfolio containing over 20 different altcoins and are still looking to invest more. investing in low cap or micro cap projects is possible, why not? investing is about making a profit as long as you know what you are doing with your money and know the risks you will take when investing in such projects. but it will be a bit difficult here as we are in a bear market so investing in such projects will be much riskier than profitable. i also invest in low cap coins but only do that when we are in the bull season because then things were going up and making money was easier than it is now",

I'm not against to those investors that understands what they do and is making a profit from these low cap coins. And that's because they know when to enter and when to get out.But, if by the chance that it happens and I'm lucky to have that type of altcoin and managed to earn from it, I'd definitely, without a doubt sell it and put that profit into bitcoin.",

Similar to VC space. A standard VC company may make bets on 30 companies, 29 of which go bankrupt and one company that over 1000x's. But there's a lot of both skill and luck in determining this space. Of course, if you have that skill, the rewards are a lot higher than betting on established trends.",

That's all well and good I'd just make sure they are real products with real users with real technology and a real plan. That way they can't default as hard. If it's just a scam hype dog-picture squid-game project, the best you can hope for is a greater fool theory where you come out ahead.It is all a form of gambling, so is everything, but there's a lot of skill in this. The major question is if your level of skill exceeds the average participant also buying into microcap coins. If it is higher on average, you'll do well on average. And vice versa.Also realize that the game is also by definition rigged against you to a degree. Whale participants and people with more knowledge than you are just some of the participants you'll be competing against. So you have to be not just a little better than the average competition but a good margin better.",

But the problem is that we can find it difficult to choose the coins because there are so many. Apart from that, we also don't know when the altcoin will increase so it will be a very long wait. But maybe you can try to look in the list of top 100 altcoins so you won't have too many targets for you to look for. And then, you can try to manage the funds you need to invest and then just wait until the altcoin increases.",

Putting some small amount could be ok but I would rather focus my capital on some altcoins that have really the potential to give me profit in the future even if it's not that big. I would not be afraid holding them for many years as they already have real utilities.Feels the same way but sometimes the higher risk we put to such project could definitely give us a good or prosperous gains. Ive kinda like OP whose investing on top 20 coins or even can go beyond top 50 as long as I saw some even the slightest fundamental or even influential reason to it. We cant deny that a good coin must have all features but there are always exception to that.",

Also, there is a huge possibility that you will be buying on someone's stash and they can easily dump their coins on to you and you will be left with bags that cannot be sold to anyone. If I were you, I'd just go and invest on some new projects with low market cap and hope to make it big from them. That's less riskier and even more reliable than throwing your money on some projects that people have no interest on.",

However, I am not that much satisfied with any of the alts yet because despite the fact that there cap comes to an end they wont really make much changes. After all only reduced supply or supply which is going to be zero soon does not matter if there are no investors to buy it ? Basically you should look it the reverse way. Do we have enough investors for it? Will there be heavy demand once the cap is reached to its final roadmap journey? Then we could think about investing into such coins irrespective of the caps.",
