  "content": "As we know inflation is high and rich people need more money to stay wealthy.Solution is economic recression for example good rate hikes.But they cant print money more until economy have not going down.They dont want to let economy too low also.Solution will be new currency based on blockchain so they can control better money supply and inflation and deflation instantly they can burn or mint if too much coins the tokems the new currency they can eliminate or add more in the circlelation.Nominates for new currency: Off course all usd stable coins since you can mint or burn them so if supply is too much you can burn it.We can not go back to old fiat its done so first we will start with usdt or usdc and its not same as usd anymore becouse usd dollar is done allready the new currency is usdc or usdt its much better to manage.Make note all stable coins aka new currency must be backed by 25% of btc or other volatile probably the btc coins in the reserve.Soon even people who was not imterested about crypto will find out that those who own crypto will literally buy all the world the real assets and fiat is not even needeed.Even ur hard work or labour dont cost nothing the ammount of crypto u got will decide your wealth in the future and present.As we know they will change the atm cash maschines to.connect to crypto exvhangers and stable coins so the crypto exvhangers are our new banks.I dont mind that im happy to see world goes the way i.like it i want it.Plz dont add nonsense comment.",

      "body": "One approach to rising prices and costs is to increase production.Our society revolves around rampant consumerism where the role of the average individual is to consume as much as humanly possible in order to boost profit margins. Society can shift to a structure where the average person produces more, which would solve many of our shortages and price hikes over time.Pre COVID era cultural values were most americans wanting to be high paid lawyers.Post COVID cultural values could shift to most americans wanting to be producers of industry due to it filling the biggest gap in society. Conditions aren't currently ideal but people can change and adapt to better suit their circumstances. It is what they are naturally prone towards doing as Charles Darwin is known for writing awhile ago.",

Don't change a model that's already successfu l for them, money attracts more money there's no chance it scares it off... If you've got enough money to be able to do something like this, you've got enough money not to care about inflation, a recession...",

Burning peoples bank accounts? It actually doesn’t make sense to mint, because if it’s distributed equally everyone has the same as before, if it’s not distributed equally we have fiat 2.0.QuoteMake note all stable coins aka new currency must be backed by 25% of btc or other volatile probably the btc coins in the reserve.Why not use Bitcoin directly, what’s the advantage of creating a shitcoin first? Luna was “backed” by Bitcoin too, yet they couldn’t and wouldn’t protect their holders, because it doesn’t work in practice. Bitcoins deflationary mechanism(lost coins) is actually interesting, because it’s distributed to every address automatically(their coins become worth more) without a central authority deciding this, which could work like an inbuilt savings mechanism for everyone.QuoteSoon even people who was not imterested about crypto will find out that those who own crypto will literally buy all the world the real assets and fiat is not even needeed.Even ur hard work or labour dont cost nothing the ammount of crypto u got will decide your wealth in the future and present.As we know they will change the atm cash maschines to.connect to crypto exvhangers and stable coins so the crypto exvhangers are our new banks.I dont mind that im happy to see world goes the way i.like it i want it.Plz dont add nonsense comment.This just sounds like adding crypto for the sake of crypto, without actually solving anything.",

For example, I have seen big corporates removing their employees when company is not doing very well in terms of financial matters. They will plan their future finance management with caution without hampering the profitability of the company. This is condition when performance is at risk however similar workflow is activated when they are in the inflation, when worlds doomed! Obviously that's why they are on that position doing businesses and earning millions of dollars. Richest will always have expenses controlled, planned, mapped!",

If you are pursuing fiat, there must be joint work from the government, the people and the economic management in it. Cryptocurrency is one of the efforts to minimize the chaos that occurs due to the heaviness of demand. .and create a new style of decentralized money performance.you are so thorough, maybe in your country this has happened. Although this topic has been discussed several times, there is nothing wrong if you add a few % in your country in dealing with inflation?or some leadership in the past that was better? that doesn't rule out the possibility.",

Government will simply print money and make enough supply so rich people never run out of cash. And you know rich people ( most of them) don't want the other class people to know the real advantage of decentralization so they will give more effort from stop the things from happening.",

But each country is doing their own thing to counter it like higher rates and what we're experiencing right now is the effect of the war of Russia and Ukraine.",

I didn't get the solution you proffered for rich people who has more expenses to make though. Governments of different countries are busy introducing CBDCs. This is a sign that they won't let their fiat go into extinction or neither will they adopt what they cannot regulate or control.As long as we live, fiat must be in existence, though they might not exist in the physical form anymore but they will remain fiat for the country.",

Extend the frontiers of thier feasible tangible businesses which they have on ground to different and more productive locations..2. They should draw out a niche of friends and relatives that may seem to be benefactors of thier resources and train them on BTC and other cryptocurrencies...3. Monitor them for a specific period and release them to go out and explore by so doing they will be empowered..I believe that husbands need to train even their wives too....This will create more channels of income rather than expenses",
