Transaction data may be missing or incorrect. Rescanning wallet. I'm sorry, but I've got to ask these questions even though I may not get answers to them.What exactly is the topic of your post \" Hello everyone\"? And secondly, who gets 12 BTC, the person who solves what's causing the problem on the forum or the person who can recover the 689 BTC?If this isn't some kind of riddle, and it happens to be a real-life situation, then I'll first say that a burnt computer with a hard disk that is still functioning is really remarkable. I can assume that's how you were able to find the wallet.dat, and now that you've found something that valuable, there's a high probability that it's corrupted and inaccessible. That's sad.Now, how old exactly is your friend to have his last transaction in 1970? I really got confused with this one and I went on to research it. Turns out, that particular day 1970.1.1 is known as the Unix epoch. When wallet software encounters corrupted and uninitialized timestamps, they automatically lead to the Unix epoch.You failed to mention who the people giving you information about your friend's computers are. But in case you don't want to trust them, there may actually be no need to trust them. Let me remind you that wallet.dat has private keys and you can easily access the Bitcoin in connection to your friend's BTC address. This seems like a fair solution, doesn't it? Try gaining the private keys and transfer the BTC into another newly opened wallet.",

Op, I'm sorry, but this story you're telling here on the topic you made is too suspicious. 689 bitcoins is big for the price we have now in the market. What sane person in this day and age would trust 689bitcoins in such a situation? is thereThen they will give 12 bitcoins as a reward; the size is still the same, and maybe later on, the person who helps will become even more corrupt. it seems that you are more suspicious to me actually, sorry this is may assessment to you op.",

The question here is from where I got it, as your friend gave it you, you do really think he hasn't tried to recover it?At the same time why anyone would give you such a lottery file even if it's useless there's hope and greed for everyone. If you find any solution make sure to drop 1 BTC for the top 20 posts in the answer to so many concerns haha, it would be nice.",
