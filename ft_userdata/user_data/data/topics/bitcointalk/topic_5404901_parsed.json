  "content": "This is a rematch between two 4-division champions, WBO champion Kazuto Ioka defending against its former holder and nemesis, Donnie Nietes. The first match happened more 3 years ago in Macau for then vacant WBO super flyweight strap. Though Donnie Nietes won clearly, the scorecards made it a split decision. Donnie Nietes then became inactive and many thought he was actually retired because he was already 37 years old that time. The WBO decided to declare the belt vacant. Kazuto Ioka managed to win the belt and is holding it strong with 4 successful defenses. The difference in this rematch is that 33-year old Ioka is now the defending champion. Nietes is now 40 years of age. And Ioka will defend his belt in his home turf in Japan. Kazuto Ioka win-loss record: 28-2-15 KOsDonnie Nietes win-loss record: 43-1-23 KOs",

      "body": "So the last breed of those Filipino champions that they have right now. Donaire is already out and could retire and Donnie might be the next one. Although he was shadow by his compatriot, but he is one of those solid PH champions. Anyhow, at 40 years old, let's see, Ioka is not younger as well, but obviously less wear and tear and it will be held in his hometown, so it might be very tough for Donnie. So I would say, Ioka by split decision in a very close fight.",

One wants to cement that he is the winner of that controversial unanimous decision and the other looking for a big bang and win the title back before his retirement. That sure is an exciting match. According to Donnie, he had been training since February after he received the message that the fight is on. He will definitely put his A-game here and a best ending should be a knockout to erase all the doubts.",

Even though I want to support Nietes but I think this match will gonna be same story to Donaire vs Inoue. I don’t want to get high hope for this kind of match.",

Kazuto Ioka win-loss record: 28-2-15 KOsDonnie Nietes win-loss record: 43-1-23 KOsYup, that first fight was pretty close, that jab of Nietes really made a difference in the judge's decision. That was an amazing win by the former ALA pug considering that fight was held in Japan if i'm not mistaken, as we all know that Japan had a reputation of protecting their homeboys but that was not switch on in that fight lol.Again, this rematch's output would be different from the first i think, because of age factor. Nietes was inactive for so many months due to pandemic and their stable was defunct so i think this might be it for Nietes, his last fight or he may be made a stepping stone for upcoming prospect.",

Also its perfect time for Ioka to prove that he's much stronger than Nietes.",

Age will only come in based on a fighter's last fight so far based on his two fights there's no showing of age, Nietes is a different breed of fighter he is good at counterpunching both fighters knows each other very well, and they have given us a very good fight in their first and last fight could go either way, I'm sure there will be a lot of adjustment on both fighters so it's going to be a very exciting match and I'm betting Nietes to win the match.",

Well, the age might matter here but since Nietes already won against Ioka, most probably he still have a good advantage here. Less than two weeks from now we will witness again another Filipino boxer and I do hope that he can get this belt again, and lift up the pride of Filipino boxer again, I will support Nietes here.

Can't speculate on that but that might have higher chance if somehow he's defeated compare to when he win this fight. Who knows he's still chasing that record to be one of the PH longests world champ at an old age, we may never know. I think he's still good to be at the ring but we can judge that when the fight comes against Ioka, if he can still dominate the ring.",
