  "content": "Writing a script to generate BIP-85 child seeds is beyond my abilities.  Does one already exist?  I'd like to run the script on a Mac to generate passphrases for securing specific encrypted files (disk images, for example).My basic idea is this:  I'd use a short BIP-39 seed phrase on my Mac as a master key (or parent seed) for generating passphrases instead of passwords for encrypted files, using BIP-85 child seeds.  I want to be clear here, I won't be using this seed or the child seeds for storing Bitcoin.  I just love the idea that a BIP-39 seed can generate millions of BIP-85 child seeds based on index numbers, which means if you remember a master seed phrase, you have access to millions of child seeds based on an index number.BIP-85 such a brilliant system that could be useful for generating passphrases to better secure files.EDIT: I probably should have added...  In a perfect world, the script would ask to input two things: the BIP-39 seed phrase and the BIP-85 index number.  Also, I'm not looking for help creating a parent seed.  I have hardware wallets that can easily do that.",

Otherwise stick to popular code like like Iancoleman source code or look at the BIP page itself, they almost always have a couple of \"reference implementations\" listed there that are more reliable than something you can find through quick search.

In general, the problems you have, should guide you to the solutions. Which means, if you say \"I need X, but I really want it to do Y\", then maybe your \"Y\" will require something completely different in the end? Some video about passwords: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgpsIBLvrGYAs you can see, each next step is reached by analyzing weaknesses of the previous solution. Which means, you should first reveal, what do you really want, if you want to get a solution, that is good enough for your specific problem.",
