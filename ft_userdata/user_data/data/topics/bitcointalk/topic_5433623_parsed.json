      "body": "Maybe the problem was really from your internet service provider, not from duelbits server or Evolution gaming. We would see a lot of complaints about this issue if it was from Evolution gaming. We would also see a good number of complaints if it happened from Duelbits. These three incidences happened on the same day within 10 minutes. You have played more than 50k rounds blackjack game at Duelbits without facing any issues. So, they won't scam you for such small amount.You wouldn't be able to place bets if your internet connection wasn't working, maybe your internet connection was weak while it happened.",

Duelbits is now quite popular, we would be seeing many more users having similar complaints just like yours.",

The attitude shows how much of a loser you are and probably highlights why you are moaning here with an inaccurate scam accusation. Carry on jackass.QuoteIf evolution is so a legit company, they should release the stats of the games played and the millions of people who fall for their trap.Go ask them.Quote from: kingbj21 on January 13, 2023, 07:51:32 PMI am so fucking done here.Does that mean the forum will die?

To get a good number of complaints as you say, you need to get a good number of players first. And unfortunately here, only few people are regular gamblers. So I'm not sure if something goes wrong on one casino one day we will see many complaints popping here. Moreover on a Blackjack table there are usually not more than 7 players at the same time. So if the issue has only happened at one table, it hasn't concerned many users.@kingbj21 those messages have been sent by Evolution or by Duelbits support?",

It was a heads-up game, it was just me against the dealer. I won't trust evolution/duelbits henceforth, they both are shady companies. Which live table games provider and which casino do you recommend instead? Unfortunately bugs can happen from time to time because we are dealing with digital games here, not physical ones, but I agree they should be able to investigate more seriously when this kind of thing happens in order to find if the bug really came from the customer side or from their part actually. A thread about the disconnection policies from the different live blackjack providers and tables could be a good idea though.",

You rely on a business that fuels gamblers/gambling, if it is not for us, you would have not made the money. Be blessed with what you have and don't mock someone who doesn't because it won't be the same all the time MR.DICK.Since you seem to know more, what business is that which fuels gambling that I heavily rely on for survival?  You started by behaving like a twat, why should I have kind words for you?",

It happened to you multiple times consecutively and you still play without checking first if there's a problem on your side? Besides the table continuos running because the other player is playing normally, It's unusual for a bug to occur to you alone while the rest on the same table doesn't experience it. With this point taken, It's very hard to believe that it's really a bug rather than a poor internet connection problem. You are dragging too Duelbits name on your case while the problem is inside the 3rd party game.",

You are dragging too Duelbits name on your case while the problem is inside the 3rd party game.Yes, there must be conclusive proof that the bug is on their part. I only see that the mistake comes from the @OP until he did not bother to check his internet and yet he continued to play at the Duelbits table, and he was given the decision to make a decision several times when a problem occurred in his internet provider, but he did not make any decision, which resulted in him expiring the decision time and an automatic stand was applied by the game server and he lost the rounds. What I see is a natural accident that may happen to anyone, so if anyone has a problem with the Internet, I do not advise him to play until his connection is stable, because Betting and Casino sites need a good internet connection.",

If someone steals something from you and acts like an innocent, I don't know how else will you react.The common sense tells me you lost due to your carelessness. I read the messages, they even gave you an option to make a decision, of which you didn't make any. So it's all on you. Move on.Quote from: kingbj21 on January 16, 2023, 02:10:09 PMDuelbits threatened me and I abused people who supported them blindly without knowing what happened after the incident, they didn't handle the case properly. Why would I waste my time for $100, when my loss is more than $100k.No, you are just an ignorant prick who lost and have to blame someone for your losses. You lost $100K, that's in the past. Now $100 feels like gold to you. Maybe you should just stop gambling for a living. It’s never too late.",
