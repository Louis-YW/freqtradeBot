Please let me know if you know of any. Thanks.Just to clarify what you are actually looking for - software that needs to detect that some content is plagiarized/paraphrased, or software that creates such content? I don't offer any of that, I'm just interested in what exactly you're looking for, because there are a lot of free detectors online that do the job pretty good.",

He's searching for an illegal thing and that's not allowed in our forum. I recommend the OP to stop searching for such software that misuse the hard work of another writer.A writer has to research and learn the topics and the stuff before writing good content and such thing requires really hard work and devotion. I don't think that it's a fair thing to paraphrase the work of a writer to make it undetected by plagiarism detectors. That's one of the worst crimes and is totally against copyrights of the owner.",

It's really amusing that people jump into conclusion about issues that they know nothing about. How would anyone conclude that an article rewriting software automatically implies it's used for cheating? The funny fellow is even threatening a red tag in their ignorance. By the way, as a writer, I can decide to reproduce my written work in different forms. for instance, the article I wrote for my blog could be adapted for voiceover in my podcast or video. The rephrasing software would do that just fine. Also, if I feel that the quality of work submitted by a writer I hire isn't unique enough, I can also use a paraphrasing tool to improve it. I hope its clear enough to you, Rikafip, the red tagger.",
