      "body": "Back in 2018, any Bounty you join would have earned you a good amount of money. In 2022 it is not like that anymore a few bounties would help you to earn but the amount you get might not be that decent. The Gambling based Signature Campaigns are still generating a proper amount every month. To join those signature campaigns you need to rank up to at least Full member and above. Ranking up is not that easy now as you need to earn merits to rank. You can check those requirements here.",

      "body": "There are many options like working for BTC I guess is the only option since token bounties aren't even getting listed on exchanges. Another is just to keep trading assuming you already know how that works when someone says buy low sell high.Or like what pakhitheboss ^signature campaigns. Along with this what I'm doing is staking coins and play to earn a fallback plan that might not be enough if you live in a 1st world country.",

Old and new friends, and what is your perspective looking into the job market of india, if bounties still reliable Forum has changed a lot lately from 2018 to 2022. It has become pretty organized even though the engagement is still not that high but the spammy bounty hunters are nowhere to be seen now. Best way to get some money is have some good skills, either be a quality poster and go for some signature campaigns to make sure you post regularly. Or sell some social media skill on the platform as well. Don't expect to just retweet and get money as it used to be in 2018.",

Old and new friends, and what is your perspective looking into the job market of india, if bounties still reliable The entire ICO market is dead so the bounty market should be dead too! So I won't recommend anyone to join any bounties now. We all have to change with time. If you want to earn serious money, freelancing is the best way to do so. Some client will also be willing to pay you through cryptos. Startups are everywhere nowadays and these startups don't hire expensive people at the beginning. Rather they try to find a freelancer. That's where you need to tap in. Digital marketing is the most niche skill in freelancing market.",
