It's consuming the block space for no reason and as a result, the normal Bitcoin user has to pay a higher fee. Just a guess as I have seen a lot of talk regarding Bitcoin Ordinal in the last few days.QuoteAny idea of when my money is gonna be received?No one can predict the fee rate. Which wallet have you used and have you used RBF enabled? If so, you can bump the fee as required. Alternatively, if you have access to the wallet where you sent BTC, you can use CPFP method and get your transaction cosnfirmed.QuoteIn all, suggest permanent solution to this problem for bitcoin fans if there is any.Consolidate all the input when fee is significantly low.

Well apart from pumping your transaction like have been suggested to you if you are in a rush, I think you can be patient for the congestion to be cleared. If you check the transaction you see how many thousands of transactions waiting to be cleared. One reason that cause such traffic is fees when it is lower.",

For example, you can set the fees at Medium Priority to be confirmed during the next 10 blocks, and the fee estimate was correct, but suddenly something happened, so that thousands of transactions were created after your transaction Thus, when mining pool found the block, they will choose current transactions with high fees, not according to your estimation.Quote from: Call_Me_Guru on May 02, 2023, 06:02:33 PMI always use 15 sat/vb with no problem for all my bitcoin transactions.Do not take it as a fixed rule, but if you are in a hurry, go to https://mempool.space and pay a fee that is 30% higher than High Priority.

In general, for a long time, much lower fees allowed confirmation in the next block. Not to tell you on weekends that with the minimum fee I have gotten quick confirmations. The fees thing is not an absolute concept, it depends on how congested the blockchain is. You have to look and depending on the hurry you are in choose a fee, do not always use the same fee regardless of whether the mempool is empty, so you are wasting money, or if it is very full as it is now, so your transaction will not be confirmed in a long time unless you opt for RBF and increase the fee later. The reason why it is so crowded is because as noted above there are a lot of people using the blockchain to store images.",

As you can see, sometimes the necessary fee can be quite high, but there are times when 1 sat/vb will get it into the next block.Helpful tips:1. Look up the current transaction fees before sending. Wallets can be unreliable, so I look at mempool.space or other similar sites to see what the fees look like.2. Be patient. If you are paying for something, then you might want to pay a fee that will get the transaction into the next block. But, if you are just moving money around, you can save some money by paying a lower fee and waiting longer.3. Use RBF. If the fee turns out to be too low, you can increase it with RBF.",

Always check the fee suggestions before you send or approve a transaction next time For the past one week, Bitcoin transaction fees have been on a hike and there is no possible reason for that rather than the fact that the network has become congested which has resulted in high fees and a longer time for transactions to get to confirmation, over the week even with a high priority fees you will have to wait up to 2-3 hours for the transaction to go through. And just today, bitcoin recorded the highest trafics in Bitcoin transaction even though most cryptocurrency users are looking for alternatives the highest volume in the last 3-6 months cycle and that indicate how user trust and use Bitcoin and also the underlying reason why the fees have become excessively high recently even though the price of bitcoin still remain under 30k.So I wonder what the reason for the recent fee hike is since high fees have always been associated with raise in Bitcoin price but this time the case is different.",

I realized that the transaction fee was 19% of the coins am transferring. I was wondering why and I had to check if the fee can be reduced through RBF but it was impossible. What I noticed is that if you are sending higher amount the transaction fee is always favourable compare to when you are sending a little amount.OP, there are two ways out,it is either you increase the transaction fee if your wallet has RBF,or you should be patient with your transaction as it will surely be through.

If you're impatient then you have to shoulder the fee and set it up to the high priorty fee which currently is @ 137 sats/vbyte. You'll have to accept that if you're not willing to pay such fee at these moments, you just set it in low to no priority and just be patient until it gets confirmed. It sucks to see the network is congested again and this is also happening in many alts like ETH which is still having a high gwei for its transactions. Plan ahead your transactions so you won't be annoyed or pissed of waiting but has to pay the highest priority fee for it to be confirmed.
