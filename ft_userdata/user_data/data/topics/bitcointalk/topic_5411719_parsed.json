  "content": "https://mobile.twitter.com/FA_Touadera/status/1562393278963744768First National Workshop on Digital Economy and Digital Transformation of Society & Private SectorThe Decision Taken by President Faustin-Eurchange Touadera, not only bitcoin was approved as a legitimate means of payment, but the most surprising was the \"Sango\" Project.What we know is that the state still has weaknesses in the field of technology, extensive electricity coverage and low internet use, the skepticism of project feasibility is not well connected and is still haunted by civil war.https://databoks.katadata.co.id/datapublish/2022/02/06/10-negara-dengan-penetrasi-internet-terendahTen Countries With The Lowest Internet Use, The Republic Of Central Africa In Number TwoEven some of the online media that I explore, the \"sango\" project will be described as the National Digital Currency of the Central African Republic, this is a very rushed step or as an option for low-sales people, to receive bitcoin and crypto as progress in the period forward.I try to assume and analyze some problems with the big plan that will be carried out by the Republic of Central Africa1. The National Digital Currency \"Sango\".This refers to some of my comments in another thread, population coverage is not possible for bitcoin to be used as a legal transaction tool in short term use, so \"Sango\" makes a choice for citizens who fall into the category of low income.The goal is that Crypto can be widely introduced in the country, citing the absence of resistance and demonstrations against their main project.2. For Us The Formal Economy is No Longer An Option, Says \"Faustin-Archange Touadera\".This can be related to my first point, that the reason the \"Sango\" Project will be displayed as the national digital currency of the Central African Republic, they understand very well that the country's economy will not develop, if using Crypto (Bitcoin) only , considering that it is only 30/50% people who can reach Bitcoin in the near future.So that it will create new problems in low-income (grassroots) communities, if \"Sango\" is not immediately rumored or developed in the near future.3. Sango Is An Economic Powerhouse For The Country.If the two points above can be realized perfectly, then the Central African Republic will be the only country that has economic power in the crypto field.Under this Central African Republic initiative, foreign investors will be able to purchase citizenship for $60,000 worth of crypto, with the Sango Coin held as collateral for five years, and an \"e-residency\" for $6,000, held for three years. (Sango website)This country is quite good at seeing opportunities, thus preparing Bitcoin options to be used as legal transaction tools, along with the launch of the \"Sango\" project, the State will not be strong if the small people are not given the option to accept technology , \"Sangoe\" is a stepping stone for the development of Bitcoin in the country This includes Crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular.Of course the problems that will be faced are not so easy, such as writing what I did, the Central African Republic is still lagging behind in terms of Technology, the Internet and progress, there are even some authorities who think there is no unconstitutional against \"Sango\", but this weakness is not a reason for them do not develop.President Faustin-Archange Touadera really knows what they have to do in the future, this will also explain how the problems and impacts on the course of the \"Sango\" project if there is a change of president in the future. With the ratification of the \"Sango\" Project, and will be described as the national digital currency of the Central African Republic, this problem is solved by the existence of regulations that they make as a binding and systematic legal guide.They will be the second El Salvador State, which has more potential in realizing the progress of Bitcoin, this will be a great step for Bitcoin to develop, regardless of what will happen in the future, but I hope we deserve to appreciate the President's steps in making decisions.",

My assumption is used by people who live in urban areas, because internet network is not available in rural areas, 50% of what you mentioned is more relevant in urban areas.QuoteI wouldn't call this the CBDC experiment I'd want.

Thus Bitcoin and Crypto will be more easily developed there.Quote from: Zlantann on August 30, 2022, 02:15:18 PMYes the government of Central African Republic has come out with different policies and programme for the Sango projects.

We want to see massive Bitcoin awareness and education activities in CAR. Investors would also need to be assured that their investment in the Bitcoin project in CAR is safe even if the current government leaves power. Â Thus the approach that is needed is to accelerate the distribution of internet and electricity in all districts in the Central African Republic region, the plan they have developed is good enough for progress, but in other sectors it must also meet the necessary elements, so that the Sango project can run smoothly.In addition to education, technology development must also be carried out hand in hand, especially for rural areas that are still unfamiliar with technology, so that the readiness of resources can develop over time.Quote from: 348Judah on August 30, 2022, 02:15:34 PMTo say the fact, this is the only shortfall of the Central African Republic bitcoin adoption with their proposed Sango Project, why do they need to accommodate room for other cryptocurrencies while they are yet to go far in bitcoin adoption with evident results  This is the right step taken by the President, they know that bitcoin is not a need that can be reached by many people there, so it needs another approach as a solution for bitcoin recipients.The Sango project can answer these doubts, the people there can take a role first in this project, where the bitcoin adoption process will not feel disturbed and slow, so that people who do not agree with bitcoin adoption easily accept technological advances and investments involving cryptoI think the President of the Central African Republic is Innovative and knows how to make a persuasive introduction to his people. Quotethe introduction of Sango coin is a total spoil on the whole Sango project, at least they need not to engage other currencies or tokens by now since bitcoin is the solution they all seek better alternative with, introduction of something else aside bitcoin will deviate them from their initial standard and plan while many may not key into the adoption in contributing to altcoins along their Sango Project. If we calculate the number of people who are able to invest in bitcoin, then the Central African Republic is not one of the countries with high income per capital income, so the target for bitcoin adoption will not run quickly, it will actually lead to strong protests from organized communities in rural areas. Because of the adoption, the impact felt by the small community is very untouched. So the Sango project as an incentive and a starting point for the introduction of bitcoin for the future.Quote from: mumang siat on August 31, 2022, 04:55:32 AMElectricity, Internet and Technology, these three things are a big problem for the decisions taken by the President of the Central African Republic, so far there may not have been an impact of a wave of protests from the people, because awareness of crypto only applies to urban areas of their capital and I am sure to their rural areas do not have access to receive this information, if Electricity, Internet and technology have not been distributed evenly throughout the country.This will be the main step that must be addressed, the wave of protests that you mean can be contained by a persuasive approach that involves all existing elements.Sango will become the nomenclature of the source of solutions for them, awareness of technology recipients, crypto will work well, if the government conducts education thoroughly.Thus Bitcoin will feel important in the country, because the process of introduction and approach is done by providing solutions, when development has been going well, Sango becomes a springboard for citizens to invest in bitcoin.",
