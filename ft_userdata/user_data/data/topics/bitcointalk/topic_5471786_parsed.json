We couldn't sue over the vaxxes themselves, but we can sue over the impurities.Proven ADULTERATION of COVID jabs means Americans can now SUE vaccine manufacturers – and FDA is REQUIRED to take action by pulling them from markethttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-10-26-adulteration-covid-vaccines-americans-sue-manufacturers-fda.htmlInvestigative journalist Steve Kirsch spoke with Prof. Byram Bridle and Dr. Robert Malone recently about the contamination issue with Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) \"vaccines\" and what it means for the general public that was harmed by them.Contrary to popular belief, it is actually now possible to sue the pharmaceutical companies responsible for these adulterated injections, the mRNA varieties of which were found to contain plasmid bioactive contaminant sequences that were never revealed to regulatory authorities prior to their emergency use authorization (EUA) and later approval.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was never told by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna that their respective messenger RNA shots are contaminated with these foreign, toxic substances. As such, anyone can now sue these vaccine manufacturers – and according to the law, the FDA must respond by pulling these deadly drugs off the market.According to Kirsch, the Michigan remdesivir case sets an important precedent for all this in that it has shown that the liability shield afforded by Big Pharma disintegrates the moment any undisclosed contamination of the jabs' active ingredients is proven.\"The FDA is now at a crossroads,\" Kirsch says. \"Either they admit that they knew about the plasma contamination, and failed to disclose that to the public and to the outside committees, or they can claim that they didn't know about it in which case Pfizer is liable.\"\"But we have the Pfizer documents that were given to the FDA so we know what the FDA got. And I seriously doubt there's any disclosure of SV40 contamination. That means we have an adulterated vaccine and the FDA has to remove it from the market until the adulteration is fixed. If the FDA doesn't do that, they should face criminal prosecution for endangering the public, and not following the law.\"(Related: Did you catch the new study showing that COVID jabs did not save any lives – they took millions of lives, though.)All Americans who got jabbed for COVID can now sue Big Pharma for damages due to contamination...",

The following vaccines were available under emergency use authorization as of October 4, 2023 (archive):Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)Moderna COVID-19 VaccineNovavax COVID-19 Vaccine, AdjuvantedPfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 VaccineSpikevax (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA)All of the vaccines listed above are considered safe and effective by both the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)COVID vaccines continue to be recommended by health authoritiesFor the fall and winter months of 2023 and 2024 when COVID is most likely to peak, the CDC recommended Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax vaccines to protect against serious illness from COVID-19, none of which are preferred over the other. Everyone aged 5 and older should receive one dose of an updated COVID vaccine current for the time period above, the agency added.\"COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are effective at protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. As with other vaccine-preventable diseases, you are best protected from COVID-19 when you stay up to date with the recommended vaccinations,\" wrote the CDC in an October 4, 2023, update to its vaccination recommendations.mRNA vaccines do not contain SV40 amounts harmful to human healthIn the post on X, Kirsch implied that there had been some sort of regulatory decision to require that the FDA take COVID vaccines \"off the market\" due to \"adulteration,\" which he claims in the subsequent thread resulted from the \"SV40 promotor\" having been \"found in all the vials.\"As Lead Stories reported in June 2023, SV40 refers to a common monkey virus that was unknowingly present in monkey kidney cells used in the late 1950s and early 1960s to make poliovirus vaccines. Hundreds of millions of people were inadvertently exposed to the virus as a result of being immunized by contaminated vaccines. However, SV40 has not been present in vaccines since 1963.Michael Imperiale, a molecular biologist at the University of Michigan Medical School, told Lead Stories at the time that any potential traces of SV40 contained in COVID mRNA vaccines would be too minimal to cause harm to human health. (COVID vaccines use DNA sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to synthetically manufacture and insert a spike protein, which allows the virus to attach to the host cell, into a small piece of DNA called a plasmid. Any trace amounts of the virus would be negligible to human health.)https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2023/10/fact-check-fda-is-not-required-to-take-covid-vaccines-off-the-market.htmlThis Steve Kirsch guy is a slime ball.  Literally just making shit up for the clicks.https://healthfeedback.org/authors/steve-kirsch/https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/activist-misuses-federal-data-to-make-false-claim-that-covid-vaccines-killed-676000/",

(you can watch it in full below) – to demand full criminal prosecution of all involved in COVID injections, which they both now refer to as \"bioweapons.\"Najadi and Dr. Stuckelberger put together a new documentary film called \"Cutting off the Head of the Snake\" that delves into the \"democide\" that COVID jab perpetrators engaged in under the guise of fighting a global \"pandemic,\" which was largely falsified for maximum terror effect.Najadi resigned from his powerful banking position a short while back, but while on the job he wielded significant influence over world affairs. His job was to advise countries and heads of state on the financial direction of their respective countries.Najadi is also responsible for the recent resignation of Swiss President Alain Berset, against whom Najadi filed a criminal lawsuit at the high Supreme Court of Switzerland, accusing Berset of making false claims about the \"safety\" and \"effectiveness\" of mRNA COVID jabs.(Related: Back in July, the Brevard County Republican Executive Committee (BREC) in Florida declared COVID shots to be bioweapons.)The time is NOW to punish the war criminals behind Operation Warp SpeedUnwilling to face the charges, likely because he is guilty, Berset is instead officially stepping down from his post by the end of the year, though he has already basically left the seat vacant. ...",

Even if you did not get the vaccine yourself, I would bet someone within your family did, so why not try? Isn't USA legal system supposed to work that way?

The study, published in Frontiers in Immunology, found that “Among COVID-19 patients, mortality rate was significantly higher among Vax vs. NVax patients (p=0.002).”“While mortality rates were 36% (n=25) and 27% (n=15) for non-COVID-19 [non-vaccinated] and [vaccinated] patients, respectively, in COVID-19 patients mortality rates were 37% [for non-vaccinated patients] and 70% [for vaccinated patients],” the study states. That suggests that vaccinated COVID-19 patients were nearly twice as likely to die from the disease than the unvaccinated.However, despite the shocking findings, the researchers noted that the “Charlson’s Comorbidity Index score (CCI) was also significantly higher among” the vaccinated. They cautioned that individuals with serious underlying health conditions were also the most likely to be vaccinated....",
