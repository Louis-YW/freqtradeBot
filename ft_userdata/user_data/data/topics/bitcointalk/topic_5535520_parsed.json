That is not a bad decision. Anyone can use their Bitcoin to buy goods or pay for a service or hold for future ROI, it's must not only be used for payment. QuoteI am pretty bored right now.

      "body": "Real money has two important functions - the payment function and the savings function. Currently, the payment function of Bitcoin is not in great demand. There are too many worthy and working alternative financial solutions. At the same time, Bitcoin is actively used as a means of payment in situations where it is impossible to use fiat money. For example, some countries, corporations and individuals successfully use the first cryptocurrency to bypass economic sanctions. But Bitcoin's other function is much more in demand - the savings function. Unlike old money (silver and gold coins), modern money becomes cheaper over time. At the same time, usually even bank deposits are not able to compensate for the inflation of money. In this situation, the Bitcoin savings function becomes key for users of the first cryptocurrency.",

Do the math, if you had filled your portfolio must have been a Millionaire by now, don't take your disappointment of not holding and try as much to change the minds of others, getting profits from investment is what will bring more investors to the market.",

I didn't have a way to acquire Bitcoin, so I just resorted to using faucets; there were hundreds of them in the past and paid large amounts of Bitcoin, over 1000 satoshi in a single spin. You could easily accumulate a single coin through these platforms alone if you were determined enough.I was also delighted when I spent my Bitcoin then, mostly on online goods and platforms; thus, I understand the feeling you're talking about. However, times have changed, and Bitcoin is now considered an asset more than a currency, and it makes sense with each coin being worth over $100,000. Thus, it's fairly easy to assume why people, including myself, don't want to spend Bitcoin anymore.",

Stories and pics were even shared here of stores around the world accepting Bitcoin. There were even clamor for certain brands to start accepting Bitcoin payments. Cities and towns and states accepting Bitcoin as payment were once a cause for hype. Perhaps the game has changed because Bitcoin is already accepted in many places. Or perhaps because it was once accepted yet it didn't really boost its use as a currency. There was a time when Lamborghini dealers, even Tesla, accepted Bitcoin payments. How much of their sales were actually paid in Bitcoin? Perhaps very low. Also, the focus has somehow transferred to a kind of adoption which involves global financial giants and countries.",
