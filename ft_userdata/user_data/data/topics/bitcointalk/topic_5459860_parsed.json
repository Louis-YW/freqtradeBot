The last time I recommended the casino I was using for sports betting for a user here in the forum when they encountered a problem that was caused by them, they PMed me reminding me that they took my recommendation and the casino was quite popular and also reputable in the forum, not some new junkie casino. But in the end, I heard nothing from the guy, I did expect a scam accusation but instead, he just left.",

I just ask for some recommendations, and you or anyone else for sure don't have to worry. Whatever would happen I would for sure not call anyone out or blame anyone else if I lost my money in someway since I am an adult and take responsibility. No need to make it a big deal, if you have a tip you can share it, if not don't do its, its no biggie. Who know maybe someone have a good tip and share it and make some extra bucks as affiliate.",

You might have difficulty looking at that kind of gambling site as promotions and bonuses vary per site.You really need to test the waters at each of those and found your preference.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on July 14, 2023, 10:48:26 PMSine it's impossible to win on Slots & BJ on Stake.. Whether you switch to other gambling sites or not, you will still face the same algorithm even how reputable are those.I don't think that should be a reason for a switch but rather simply you just want to test the waters (or maybe luck) on other sites.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on July 14, 2023, 10:48:26 PMSince I been member here for couple of months, you see many sportsbetting website using this \"KYC argument\" when players want to cash out big winnings, so I don't want a casino that allow me to gamble and deposit but not withdrawal my earnings, be honest and you will get honestly and loyalty from me as a customer. There are still lots of KYC-free crypto-gambling platforms here and KYC is not that mandatory thing. Besides, those big winnings do have a certain tier and not that it will be subject to a KYC request right away. You can freely withdraw your winnings at the most reputable and popular crypto-gambling sites here (sorry but I don't want to mention some names since I do think you can do it by yourself based on your experience).",

It isn't a sportsbetting site, but it does have slots and blackjack. So you might want to give it a try. They also have a monthly wagering contest and a VIP program. If you are a VIP user, you will be receiving weekly fixed voucher/bonus that can help you boost a little. But its not a KYC free casino. For some cases you might be asked to verify your identity. So make sure you read the terms before playing.If you are looking for a casino without KYC, then you should be looking for a casino without a license. But do you really want to play on a casino without a license? They might scam you, or the casino may disappear and you can never do anything about it.",

I also do sportsbetting mainly and cashed out like 1000 USD or more at once. They never asked me for KYC. Regarding the Drake thing you mentioned,then it’s just a promotional thing that is being done. Drake doesn’t use his own money, instead the stake team top up his account balance and his aim is to bust those balance and entertain the people. So yes I can recommend you Bitsler and Fortunejack. But before investing any big amount, have a chat with their customer support to know about your limits.",

I think it's a casino site that I play in sports betting or slots or other types.But you have to look at the list of casinos again that have been provided above it helps a little which one you want to choose from one of them, of course if you ask for advice from other people will mention a lot of casinos to make you confused unless you are going to play with many casinos so it will be a different sensation when experiencing in many casinos.One more KYC is now difficult to avoid when you win big or there is a problem then it is an agreement that must be chosen.",
