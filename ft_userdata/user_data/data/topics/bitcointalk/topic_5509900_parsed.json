  "content": "The following is my writing about the importance of Bitcoin through the accumulation of knowledge and life experience of myself and others. I hope it inspires an interest to any newcomers about the potential of Bitcoin. If anything needs fact-checking, don't be afraid to call me out BTC     BTC    BTCMoney is such an integral part of our lives, yet many of us know absolutely nothing about the intricacies of our financial system, rendering us completely unaware of the destruction banking practices bring and how they affect our lives. All we’re shown is that inflation goes up or down, prices follow, and life becomes harder. In reality, money is so much more than what we’ve been falsely taught. And if truth is to be told, by understanding Bitcoin, your entire perspective on money will be completely redefined to such a degree, that you will be forced to consider whether you understood it in the first place.The entire foundations of your opinion on economics, politics, banking, leadership, freedom of speech, war, power projection, tax, inflation and debt, will be challenged, debunked, reconstructed, liberated and internalised. And the best thing about it? The further you venture outside Plato’s Cave, the brighter the light of truth shines.   Why should we challenge tradition banking?On a long enough time frame, every single one of us comes face to face with the detrimental effects of running on a financial system backed by expectations, false promises, and bloodshed. Your time may come sooner, as has happened for Lebanon, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Turkey, and many other countries whose financial devastation occurred at the hands of greed fuelled, corruptly backed, war driven, individuals and institutions.But for the very fortunate majority of us, we are only noticing the minor, slow burning effects; food and energy prices are increasing, bank and inflation rates are fluctuating, and the overall cost of living is becoming increasingly more difficult for the common man. Savings accounts, bonds, HYSA’s, LISA’s, stocks, gold, silver, land and property, are no longer fail-safe ways of ensuring your purchasing power stays above the declining value of the currency you keep your money in.We’ve simply all become so accustomed to, and reliant upon our current system, we’re blinded to its flaws. And as with most intangible belief systems that stem from the avoidance of truth; just because that which you cannot see and experience personally, does not mean it fails to exist.   What do we have to rely on then, when very few investments actually beat the rate of inflation?There is no longer any accountability held against the bankers, governments and politicians that clearly have no regard for the treatment they deal us, the working class. We’re sold dreams by parties that spout the same nonsense every four years, led by politicians who are part of the very same organisation of world leaders that the opposing parties are also members of. What hope is there for the family man, that his, or her, hard work will pay off? What is the point to the lifetime of sacrifice, dedication, discipline and perseverance, for it all to be diminished at the hands of another?It’s too easy to ignore problems when they arise, especially when the problems we’re facing today get swept under the carpet, downplayed, and blatantly lied about, by the same institutions that influence how we think, feel, act and react. The banks that tell you to accumulate as much debt as possible, because “it’s essential for the growth of the economy” will be the same ones that profit off your inability to pay back the very loan they loaned you. The politicians that raise taxes to fund wars under the guise of “foreign aid investments” forget to mention that their, and their friends, salaries, also happen to increase tremendous amounts during these events. Instead of reporting on the list of known paedophiles that fund the worldwide government-ran media, the facts behind the greed ran operations that send innocent people to die at war, or the fabricated votes and distorted truth when it comes to the exposure of electoral fraud, the media choose to prevaricate reality, gaslight opinions through emotion, and distort truth by constant psychological influence.   And the repercussions for those who speak out on what is happening?Their name gets slandered with accusations of heinous crimes, to inflict irreparable damage on their reputation before they even get a chance to prove their innocence. And if that doesn’t work? They’re thrown in jail, overthrown, assassinated or brought out. True evil works on both the micro and the macro; economic hitmen are dispersed to the minerally rich, yet socially and economically poorest countries for financial aid, and in return they gain resources for extraction, land for military operations, and forced future relations. If the offers are not accepted, leaders are physically and financially threatened into submission, or assassinated. Their compliant competitors then gain the opportunity to step up and humbly accept their role. Whatever choice is made, the game of submit or oppose continues its cycle.So long as greed and power run the world, money will always be used to foster criminal activities. It is an undeniable fact that everyone knows, yet nobody will ever have the power to change, because the few that do have the power, will stop at nothing until they fulfil their desires, usually at the expense of those without the means to stop them.The focus of Bitcoin should not be to scare people away from a technology that has the capabilities to give financial power back to them, but rather on the underlying issues of greed, corrupted power and lack of leadership that allow, and drive, criminal activities.   If nothing changes, nothing changes.As with any problem, it’s up to the people that care about the future of those around them to confront the root cause of what is creating distress, to find solutions that can be taught to future generations in the hopes of inspiring change. Or else history will repeat itself. And as history shows, the examination of previous nation’s downfalls has not been humanity’s strongest breakthrough when it comes to learning from our mistakes.Ignorance IS bliss, yet unfortunate. If you’re happy to stay dismissive to the reality of problems by thinking you know better, you’ll eventually be forced through hardship and first hand experience into changing your opinion. Humbling? Very. Necessary? Without a doubt. It’s about time we, the people, learn to work together as a collective, to teach one another the correct education that aids us in gaining sovereignty over finances, so we can work outside such indiscriminate control.If on a government ran financial system, money is created and devalued at the expense of our time and energy, why would there not be an incentive to pivot towards a system where the money created from our time and energy increases in value the more the system is used? What’s the motive to continue using an outdated system that has no benefits for the underappreciated, overworked and downright pissed off.Do you not value your time and the time of your children over the judgement of people that don’t care about us? Where is the uproar? The action? The hope? But most importantly, where’s the excitement? Imagine your life really could change for the better, no matter your circumstance, if a little education was all it took?   We all spend roughly 90,000 hours across our lifetime making money.   What’s 100 to learn how to keep it?",

There are limitations because the government uses a centralized system. The government is also in the business of making money, they take a small tax on transactions. They also have difficulty tracking the conditions of decentralized transactions, so they also have difficulty getting tax money.",

This is Bitcoin/crypto forum. Does he want to convince other users about the importance of financial freedom? In a cryptocurrency forum? This is like trying to convince gamblers about the benefits of gambling on a gambling forum.This topic has been discussed  a million times.
