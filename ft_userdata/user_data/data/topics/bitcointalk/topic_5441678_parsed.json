I suggest you to use blockchair since it's the most accurate crypto explorer and you can use Tor too for increase your privacy.",

Do you check the address many time to know if the money has been sent? Or you check to confirm if the address sent to you is receiving money for the first time? I mean, what kind of information do you have a keen eye on when looking for an explorer? With that the best in that aspect can be recommended to you.  Isn't it?",

Maybe the one you need to check is your Bitcoin address if you copy it correctly since there are copy paste malware spreading and your device or hardware might get infected with that so double check always if you paste the right address you use before sending or accepting anything from other people.",

No one can spend from watch-only wallet even if you have it on your device because your master public key or addresses are used to set up the watch-only wallet, it contains no private key that can be used to spend from a wallet.",

If so, I suggest doing what I did and store all your crypto on a cold wallet that isn't connected to the internet.",
