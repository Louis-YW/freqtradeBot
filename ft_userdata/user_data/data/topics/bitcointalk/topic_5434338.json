Ripple (XRP) already lost -90% from its all-time high now while Ethereum (ETH) is already around -70%.Some retail investors for sure already lost a lot of their money by buying Ripple (XRP) instead of Bitcoin or other altcoins like Ethereum.",

[1] if you think it's still high, you can use Bitcoin in lightning network where you only need to pay for few cents only. If you're looking coin that has stable price, stable coin is better than XRP since the price is pegged with the real USD price.Those aren't an utility, because new created coins have lower transactions fee since the network isn't busy.[1] https://mempool.space/",

It makes the token more volatile every now and then whenever there is an article coming out as an update on the legal issue. Any investor will be caught in the middle while there is a battle between the government and Ripple which they better left this token.",

This is one of the reason why I still hesitant to hold XRP and their only way to rise again is to settle the issue with SEC and if they are able to do, probably the hype will be in favor to them. Centralized thing though is quiet getting normal as many project seeks regulations, but with XRP issue most probably many are also doubting as they continue to work with several banks and being centralized meaning if they can easily do what every they want. Better to hold what you can afford to lose, XRP investing is a big gambling for me.",

Being a little bit interested in the crypto space as a whole was enough though to read a few statements from people why they dislike XRP. The mostly used argument against XRP that i have read on the internet was the fact that XRP is completely centralized and for me that is a very big factor to be honest.Bitcoin and therefore cryptos were invented to put the power away from the banks and to give it back to the people. With a totally centralized coin like XRP this is not possible.",
