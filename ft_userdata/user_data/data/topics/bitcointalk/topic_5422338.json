  "content": "The CBECI mining map claims to track the geographic distribution of Bitcoin’s total hashrate. For this, so their claim, they get geo-information from pools based on the IPs of their miners. They write:Quote\"Data collection  We have partnered with several Bitcoin mining pools to collect geolocational mining facility data in a non-obtrusive and privacy-preserving manner. This geolocational data is based on IP addresses of mining facility operators (‘hashers’) that connect to the servers of mining pools. \"Which pool is partnering with them? Are pools giving away the IP data? Really? Or is it just part of their overall FUD?",

The best you are going to get is an approximation, and even then sometimes it's not even close. In the end most of the large mining operations are in known locations anyway. As for the smaller ones it should not be difficult to find a legitimate registered business. For the home / hobby miners it is what it is. If you want to talk to another service they are going to know your IP and I am sure their ToS says they can sell any of your info they want to.-Dave",

May be wrong.BTC.com represents 2.1% of the miners, Poolin and ViaBTC about 9% each.So what CCAF is furthermore writing: QuoteEach participating mining pool aggregates IP addresses on their end to create an average geographic distribution of total pool hashpower by country and region. Pools then periodically push their individual distribution to our database via a dedicated API endpoint, connecting with a unique, pseudonymous access token that obfuscates the identity of the pool. Their methodology is just crap. And the more I dig into their methodologies for different data they produce, the more I am purely shocked that they aren't called out publicly.",

Their methodology is just crap. And the more I dig into their methodologies for different data they produce, the more I am purely shocked that they aren't called out publicly.I can see some flaw with their methodology, but it's not that bad and i won't call it \"just crap\". Identifying country based on IP address should be very accurate since each country has it's own IP range. Many miner probably don't use VPN/proxy to avoid risk of invalid/late submission share or unstable VPN connection. But personally i'd question accuracy on region level.And it's not like they try to hide details of their methodology (such as requiring people to register). They emphasize their assumption under bolded orange box and limitation of their methodology on discussion section. Although i disagree with assumption 2 which state those data is good enough to be \"representative sample\".Okay, I agree that \"crap\" is too strong a word. However, when you read Marc Bevand's paper, you see that he was calculating with some hardware that I look at with very nostalgic feelings. And the hashrate was 3250 PH/s.With today's figures, and the current energy prices, most miners would not be profitable. Therefore, using best guess figures may lead to very pessimistic figures regarding power consumption, i.e. assuming that many miners just invest money without getting anything back.",

My miners all run on excess solar power. The price is below 1 cent per kW/h. And I'm not the only one who's running a small operation. That's why I love used miners. Are they profitable? Yes, absolutely. Do they appear in the statistics of energy \"waste\"? No.And geolocation is often a game of guesses. When I use industrial SIMs, equipment located in Spain appears as being in Latvia...",
