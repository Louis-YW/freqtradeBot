But Binance has new CEO now that CZ announced which CZ said he is having experience about regulations and how to handle exchange. Let us hope there is nothing that will happen. I do not think Binance will shut down. The government do not just fine people money, they will do it in a way it may not be convenient for the people but not in a way that may bankrupt the people. Or if I am wrong, I can still say that I see no sign of bankruptcy yet.",

I think they settled on the fine; if it was too big, they probably wouldn't have agreed. They could likely handle it. However, this might affect how many people try to cash in or out. Either way, it only hurts CZ and the folks at Binance. I'm not saying it's cool, but it could be the incentive in play.",

Possible but do they have the proof of reserve as what they have tried to campaign before? If the revenue is still above the fine that they've paid, I guess that it's still fine on their end to pay it and then continue to rake revenues in billions again.Aside from the revenue, the reserve fund that they have I guess is one thing that they have been boasting for so long. But as a user and someone who's aware of exchanges can fall anytime, you don't keep your funds saved there.",

I guess then they would first declare bankruptcy and close the business before paying such a fabulous fine. If there is a business closure, it will be caused by future wrong steps (if any). btw. No matter how much I'm not a supporter of Binance, I still don't like these kinds of revelations about any company.",

The main parasite CZ which was laundering moneys has been removed - the exchange will now become even betterThat's only one of rge reason for CZ removal. Binance wasn't registered fully as money remittance and they were making billions of dollars for people, cooperate bodies, companies and many highly recognized people and even bad people (according to US) and that's violate the US law. The exchange was also trading without proper requirement of KYC, they allowed free trading untill may 2022 and they think money has been laundered between this pass period, so many other minor and more charges, hence why he didn't have choice but to admit in other to save the company.Binance isn't going to die because US are not the only country that used the exchange but I believe Binance will soon be avoiding US very soon. They are bad for business, they want to tell me that Coinbase is very clean exchange, there is more like this that might been going on in that exchange but US as usuall will cover up for their own because they don't like CZ and Binance.",

Despite others having a stake in Binance, CZ and Binance are the same. They're one. So, even if CZ only cares about himself, which might be the case in reality, that means he cares about Binance, his main source of money. That $4.3 billion fine is not imposed on them as if it's just a huge sum of cash they need to release right away and anybody can contribute to it. It has a breakdown. $1.81 billion of it shall be paid for the next 15 months. The remaining $2.51 billion shall be forfeited from the platform. But that's just for Binance to pay. CZ, on the other hand, is also fined $50 million. And he also paid a bail bond of $175 million.",

Regulatory actions and fines don't necessarily lead to an immediate shutdown. So the chance is low but not impossible. They find ways to comply with new regulations. However, we cannot deny that their reputation has truly been damaged, and it will be difficult for them to attract new customers. If they are unable to recover from these setbacks, they may be forced to close.We know that the issue is not yet resolved, and it is a developing story. Regulatory scrutiny continues, and there may be further fines or sanctions imposed by regulators that will make it challenging for them to operate profitably. Investors may lose confidence, and maintaining liquidity could become an issue.Let's not forget that there are new competitors emerging that can comply with regulations. If Binance cannot adapt to the changes in the regulatory landscape, it may indeed have to close its doors.",

Then again, with the market looking better and only months away from the bitcoin halvening, chances are that more new exchanges will start oppoing out, instead current ones closing.
