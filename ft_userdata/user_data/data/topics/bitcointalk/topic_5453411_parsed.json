And that's not to mention that the majority of the population is simply incapable of comprehending complex issues or consequences of changes (the average IQ in developed countries stands at around 100).",

      "body": "I dont think it would work. Because the democracy as we know it requires us to rely our power as citizens to a handful of representatives ,in real life there are very few instances where we can effectively represent ourselves. On the other hand, I am agree on using software and technology to involve more people of society to take part of the decision making on where the country is supposed to go. It is a concept  I like to call, \"micro voting\". No about selection people but actions.",

Because the democracy as we know ................Dont know what country you from but US, Germany, France...... are a constitutional Republic and not a Democracy.Democracy:    A government of the masses.    Authority derived through mass meeting or any other form of \"direct\" expression.    Results in mobocracy.    Attitude toward property is communistic-negating property rights.    Attitude toward law is that the will of the majority shall regulate, whether is be based upon deliberation or governed by passion, prejudice and impulse, without restraint or regard to consequences.   Results in demogogism, license, agitation, discontent, anarchy.REPUBLIC:    Authority is derived through the election by the people of public officials best fitted to represent them.    Attitude toward law is the administration of justice in accord with fixed principles and established evidence, with a strict regard to consequences.    A greater number of citizens and extent of territory may be brought to consequences.    Avoids the dangerous extreme of either tyranny or mobocracy.    Results in statesmanship, liberty, reason, justice, contentment and progress.     Is the \"standard form\" of government throughout the world.Thats why most countries are a Constitutional Republic, with democratically elected representation.",
