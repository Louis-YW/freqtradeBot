  "content": "Some time ago I bought some satoshis and installed Electrum v3.x on a fresh install of Windows 10 on a spare laptop, to use as a cold storage setup. This is always off line and only ever used to sign transactions.I upgraded to a watching version of Electrum to 4.x on an online pc.The question is, do I ever need to upgrade Electrum on the cold storage laptop, assuming the laptop continues to work?",

If it works don't touch it. If it's a version prior 3.3.2, you have to change it, because there's a serious vulnerability, even thought it can't harm air-gapped devices.",

Or, is it 'set in stone' and fixed by the Bitcoin protocols?",

Highly unlikely I suppose, why would the format ever need to be changed? You shouldn't worry about the format of the transactions, but the new features that are added on top of the Bitcoin protocol overtime, and that you can't use in 3.3.8, such as Taproot. Quote from: ps1234 on June 04, 2022, 03:56:24 PMOr, is it 'set in stone' and fixed by the Bitcoin protocols?I don't think it'll ever will, and even if it does, the network will treat the old format as non-standard. Currently, there are thousands of Lightning channels opened and people who've signed transactions for inheritance. Suddenly rejecting the old format would destroy these applications.",

I think there was an issue with the signing process for multisigs was there not? If one Electrum app is 4.0 or higher, they all have to be at least 4.0, meaning you can't use Electrum 3.3.8 in this combination. Maybe my brain is playing tricks on me and I am thinking of something else.",

The previous Electrum partial transaction format is no   longer supported, i.e. this is an incompatible change. Users should   make sure that all instances of Electrum they use to co-sign or   offline sign, are updated together.",

The compatibility issue would likely remain as Electrum decided not to fix it in favour of PSBT and coinb.in doesn't support PSBT and hasn't changed their raw TX serialization.The previous reply is correct. You need to update your cold storage if you want to maintain compatibility with the format generated by the newer versions.",

If it's like version 3, and version 5 came out, I would at least move it to version 4 or something known to be working fine. Otherwise I would just probably update all wallets to the latest stable version at the same time, both cold and watch-only wallets.There is very little reason not to update the watch-only wallets often enough, like maybe wait a week or a month after the latest version came out. You can take your time too. There is no rush. I just think it's a good idea to update.",
