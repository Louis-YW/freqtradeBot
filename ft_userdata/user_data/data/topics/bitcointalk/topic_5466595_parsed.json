And why shouldn't they? This income is even better because it is more passive than trading income. Sometimes with affiliates, when you refer them to a site, they give you a percentage of sales for life. Few incomes are better than that.

Of course not everyone is a trader, but…Let me try my best to answer all these questions in full.There are traders who are social media influencers, and there are some who only have the idea but use their creative reportage skills for social media influencing. Either way, it's irrelevant, what is relevant is what they are telling you. Are they true and genuine, and are what they share helpful? If yes, it's then a win-win for both parties. I learned all that I know in trading online (through the websites and email subscriptions) and I'm proud of what I've become today in trading.For the second part, even if you are earning in trading, they might want to earn more, so sharing through social media doesn't matter and can't absolutely define them. Everyone wants more money unless we are lazy or don't value money much.Nonetheless, some of them are only making money from social media but using their idea of trading to get this money without being profitable in trading themselves.",

Paid texts and advertisements make the YouTuber’s content very variable. Every day he will tell you to invest in something new and completely different from the past because he is looking for profit, and here you should. Stay away. The YouTuber who preaches on creating content and sharing the entire experience, whether good or bad, and with all the circumstances it went through, is the one who makes affiliate money as if it were additional money, and if it does not exist, it will continue to work. It is just like those who have a lot of Bitcoin and yet they are present in the forum.",

One of the top reasons that comes to mind is money or another source of income – after all, who wouldn't want that? Yes, we often have questions or sometimes wonder about their motives, but as an audience, it's up to us whether we buy into what they're offering. Perhaps there are a few cases where, even if they haven't tried using the crypto product or they genuinely don't like that product, they'll still do it for the money. It's ultimately your decision as an audience whether you'll be swayed or believe them. But not everyone is like that; some are genuine and maybe even passionate about creating content, so let's not be quick to judge them.",

Trading is profitable but you know that no one know which side market will goes. Trading will not gives you guaranteed profit and no Youtubers claimed that so far. Most of the new projects are just advertising but if we see the basic learning then I think it's not bad to learn from these influencers.Youtube videos earning is without risk while trading you can loss also. I agree that many new influencers are creating video on trading course just for affiliate but there are still big Youtubers we can trust on them. Their videos consist so many valuable knowledge about cryoto market news and about some specific tokens. If i see youtubers pumping a product, I will do my own research because I have brain, No Youtubers force me to buy, I will choose my self either the coin influencers pumping has potential to give me profit or just advertising.",

What is unacceptable is It promotes fraud, Ponzi schemes, pump/dump coins, and all forms of digital scam.

However, not all crypto influencers are desperate enough to feed people with lies so that they can convince them to believe in them. Some are doing their best to show to the people the reality about trading and let them understand about it.Personally, I think the reason why traders still trying hard to be successful on YouTubing or crypto affiliating it’s because they want to maximize their potentials as a successful trader. Aside from the fact that they are making decent income from YouTubing or being a crypto influencer, there’s also high chances that they can also bring some big positive changes into other people’s lives. That is, if those people follow the advices from reputable traders.",

Of course they are extreme cases, already not worried about making a buck even before Satoshi's white paper, but you get my point... Should I prefer \"influencers\" that do not need the extra buck? (In this case I will be restricted to millionaires with their millionaires agenda, but detached from the affiliate noise)... Is this a cleaner solution to go through the noise? Do you have anyone that consistently shares good stuff to recommend (people not companies)?An example that comes to mind would be Aaron Bennett who offers a great informative service, and still cares for the extra affiliate money. Which is totally fine for me.I do not have anything against affiliates (I am -and want to believe- an honest affiliate myself in another sector), just trying to pick the voices I pay attention to... and the online Bitcoin and general crypto world is quite noisy for someone entering the space.So, thanks everybody for their replies and opinions!

There is no YouTube currently that does reviews like that guy and he will warn from the beginning that they are only educational content and not should be used as financial decisions.I don't see anything wrong in affiliate but you see influencers, they are the reason why we are where we are today, they deceive a lot of investors in to buying scam projects, they bought most of these coins when the prices were lower and shill to their fans and then sell when everything were at the top. There were lot of drama after FTX exit scam that went hard on everyone, some of them paid chain analysis to see how they rugged pull and they were draging each other. The trust is lost and most fans are no longer loyal after the incidence and I doubt if altcoins are going to grow like before as we had in the past.",
