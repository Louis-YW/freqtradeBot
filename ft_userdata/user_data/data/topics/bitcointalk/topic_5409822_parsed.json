I have bought some thousands USD below 65 cents and took nice profit from there. Acala team was aware with it. It seems like that mechanism that used by acala was also giving a huge impact unlike terra luna mechanism which was a failed mechanism since it was getting started. So, did new tokens minted by hackers were getting blocked?",

Do Kwon moved very quickly cashing out billions of dollar and nothing can prevent Luna from crashing because its a ponzi scheme.

I don't think Luna team doesn't handled his case, he could abandon their project and take all of the investors money instead of maintain their project even though the price are completely low now. Imagine if you know AUSD price are still low as $0.009, I don't think you will buy the token since you will remember USDT price is still not recovered. That's what how many people did, they're only regret all the past opportunity.",

No doubt scalpers were being very profitable in this case. It seems like ausd minted by scammers will be burned https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1559360833087488001The vote already surpassed the minimum requirement to make ausd being minted will be burned. That's why sometime scalping this was very profitable enough. It shows that all of exchange sites are still pausing withdrawal until it will be fully fixed",

But the fact that she allowed such a hacker attack shows her incompetence. And it definitely does not increase its rating in front of users and may cause reputational losses.",
