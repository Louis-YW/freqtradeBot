Yes if man would decide what happens to the price of bitcoin directly then hodlers would always have the price high so that they will always be in profit but it is not happening that way. First, the rule of demand and supply applies to bitcoin and that is why there is buy and sell, bull and bear. Also, the halving makes bitcoin very much attractive and creates more traffic to the bitcoin Blockchain and that creates the volume and volatility. One single man does not determine what happens in the price of bitcoin except in exceptional cases of manipulation and it never last forever.",

Optimistically, we Bitcoin can reach the price of $ 50k in the middle of next year, it is a fairly close target.But the end of 2023 we will see if Bitcoin is able to touch the price of $40k++ or not. The volume of Bitcoin will increase with a lot of buying and selling activities carried out by traders and all of them have a contribution.Who is able to survive, they will certainly contribute to the increase in the volume of Bitcoin. We will see how Bitcoin develops for 2024-2025, and those years are predicted to be good years for Bitcoin.I myself can only hold Bitcoin and a few altcoins that I believe can provide profits later.",

The decentralization of bitcoin is what still opens a window of opportunity for us to take part in the technology today and I'll say same for those persons that will be adopting bitcoin tomorrow too. If a circle of men called an authority were to dictate the price of bitcoin a whole lot of people wouldn't have be able to get onboard as they would have as many times as they want manipulated the price to their gain frustrating new interested coiners.With the divisibility of bitcoin anyone can accumulate at their own speed based on their income flow without panic. On the brighter side the next halving circle for anyone that is buying now can bring them some profits which makes them not late compared to those that will be buying after the halving, by then the price would have been twice what it is now.",

However, when I started earning, I realized it was not too late after all. Maybe entering the market early allows for significant gains compared to my overall earnings.Since I believed in the potential of Bitcoin, many good things happened in my life, especially in the financial aspect. I was able to help people around me, and numerous other opportunities opened up and were beneficial. You just really need to believe, be willing to learn, and take risks.

CZ News will not effect prices.There is still quite a long way to go and there are still many opportunities to be able to set new records.This cycle will be proof that Bitcoin will get stronger and can reach a new ATH afterward, we are all certainly very optimistic about Bitcoin. $50k is a good target before Bitcoin reaches the new ATH, but my hope by the end of the year to be able to touch that $40k price is good enough and stay above that. Regarding the CZ news, this can certainly affect the price, a few hours ago Bitcoin had a dump because of the news, but the effect was indeed slight and not too long. This is because people still believe in CZ, and I am also a fan of CZ. Unlike if FTX and SBF are experiencing problems, it is a very strong decline and even a dark event in the crypto world.",

Until now, the price of bitcoin can still be said to be low compared to the previous ATH. So I think investors should be able to consider this as a good opportunity to earn a lot of bitcoin before the big bullrun starts.The halving will happen in a few months, and a spot bitcoin ETF is also awaiting approval. Many other ETF products have also been proposed and it seems that the fundamentals are very strong to create a larger market capitalization in 2025 and beyond. Some people think we will get ATH before the halving, but for me it's just a bonus.",

Its a huge news as we all know that CZ and Binance is the top crypto exchange. But then again, maybe we really doesn't care anymore about this kind of news as everyone is very bullish at this point.And with that, market is up to $37k'ish and could move to $38k in the next couple of days or end of November and then the last month will be exciting for us.",
