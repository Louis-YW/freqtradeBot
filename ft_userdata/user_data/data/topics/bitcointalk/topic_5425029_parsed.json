But I still recommend you to avoid any custodial service for keeping your coins. Keep your coins on a non-custodial wallet, so you can have full control over them. Quote from: Raj Sri on December 01, 2022, 04:48:06 PMNow, I am wondering can I user a VPN, TOR or anything similar to access the website without being banned and having my Bitcoin seized ? If you are going to use VPN for multi-accounting, that's surely against their rules. I have seen many reports regarding banning accounts due to abusing their system. By the way, freebitco have a thread in the forum. You may get a better response if you ask any question you have there.  Click here to visit their thread.",

(captchas likely won't load well for you either).",

We are dealing with people we don't know for real and the same can be said about them regard us, so the relationship must be most transparent as possible to not open gaps for any suspicions. Also, if someday you use the faucet by mistake, it will be already a justificative for the website to lock your account...For practical examples about daily compund interest investment at freebitco.in you can check my thread below:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405945.0",
