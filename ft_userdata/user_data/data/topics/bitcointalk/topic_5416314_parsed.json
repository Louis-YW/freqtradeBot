  "content": "I am starting this topic as an exploration and research about PIN codes and how they work in various hardware wallets.Not all hardware wallets are made equal, and nor all PIN codes work the same in hardware wallets.What is PIN code?- Postal Index Number or PIN code is usually a four to six digit number code, that was first introduced in 1972 by Shriram Bhikaji Velankar for Indian Post.This year we celebrate 50 years since usage of PIN codes, and today we use them everywhere including in hardware wallets.In hardware wallets PIN code is used as protection, and entering wrong PIN can create different results for different hardware wallets.PIN codes can be hacked with right tools and equipment so don't consider them as ultimate protection for your devices.Some wallets use regular Password instead of PIN, and they can use letters, pattern or biometrics like fingerprints.Note that some hardware wallets can be bricked and permanently unusable if wrong PIN was entered specific amount of times!Ledger walletEnter an incorrect PIN code 3 times in a row and device will reset after the third incorrect attempt as a security measure.https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017582434-Reset-to-factory-settings-?docs=trueTrezor walletTrezor hardware wallet will be wiped after entering 16 failed attempts, but delay time was longer each time you enter wrong pin.https://wiki.trezor.io/Security:ThreatsColdcard walletColdcard permanently bricks itself after entering wrong PIN 13 times!https://coldcard.com/docs/Passport walletPassport permanently bricks itself after entering wrong PIN 21 times!The Secure Element includes monotonic counters that enable PIN attempt tracking, where the Secure Element will “brick” itself by no longer permitting login attempts if the maximum number of attempts is exceeded.https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware/blob/main/SECURITY/SECURITY.mdKeystone walletAfter 12 incorrect attempts using the pattern unlock option, users will be required to unlock their devices with the text password. After 5 incorrect attempts to unlock your device with the text password option, the device will automatically wipe itself of all data.If your device is wiped in this way, please be advised that your Keystone can only be restored with the recovery phrase. The system password can also only be reset by entering the recovery phrase. https://support.keyst.one/basic-features/passwordSecuXIf you enter the PIN incorrectly five times, it'll reset the device.https://secuxtech.com/faq#wallet_device_issuesNgraveTen wrong PIN codes results in the device wiping itself.https://support.ngrave.io/hc/en-us/articles/4409603287185-The-wallet-doesn-t-recognize-my-fingerprint-how-do-I-access-my-wallet-JadePIN entered wrong 3 times are locked out by the server.This page is a work in progress.Feel free to post your suggestions for new hardware wallets, and correct any mistake I accidently made.",

Some hardware wallets allow you to use multiple PIN codes when you add a passphrase. This is interesting because you can have 2 wallets in the same device, and even a \"hidden\" one in case of a physical attack.Ledger nano allows 2 PIN codes:https://www.ledger.com/academy/passphrase-an-advanced-security-featureQuoteAnother option is to link a passphrase of your choosing to a secondary PIN code. When choosing this option, you would first create a passphrase directly on your Ledger device. After having done so, you would be able to choose a secondary PIN code for your Ledger device. After this, each time you turn on your device, you could choose between entering your normal PIN code or your secondary PIN code. If you would enter your secondary PIN code, your accounts hidden behind a passphrase would be accessible.For example:Regular PIN code: 1653 → Normal accountsSecondary PIN code: 8530 → Hidden accountsIn ledger nano case, both wallets (one for each PIN) will have the same seed, but one of them will have a passphrase. So, they are different wallets.",

Ledger device will not break after 3 attempts, it will just reset. And the owner has the private key.If an attacker just enter into my house and find the device he may discover the secret code in 17 attempts that some those device allow. This is not a brute force, he is trying easy pins.Although people should not use birthdays, year of birth,etc as pin code, those are VERY common. Someone may just try a few dates or other easy to remember combinations and discover the pin.I feel safer with 3 attempts and device is reseted.Just to illustrate... When I am traveling and I need wifi passwords, I just try \"nameofstore2022\" or 2021, 2020 etc and it works like 10-20% of the times.",

I wanted to say how American of them, but they are assembled in Canada. Still, close enough.I remember reading that ColdCard has a unique PIN that you can set up that bricks your device just by entering it once. I forgot what it was called, so I had to look it up. BrickMe PIN  Enter it once, and it achieves the same result as a wrongly entered main PIN 13 times. QuoteThe Coldcard additionally lets you set a BrickMe PIN to effectively destroy the Coldcard device permanently. When the BrickMe PIN is used, the critical secret is irreversibly destroyed, and the wallet essentially becomes as useless as a brick”. https://7labs.io/tips-tricks/coldcard-btc-hardware-wallet.htmlQuote from: m2017 on October 10, 2022, 05:47:39 AMLedger wallet -3 timesColdcard wallet - 13 times There is a difference between these two. If you wrongly enter your PIN 3 times on a Ledger, the device will reset itself to factory settings. It can still be used but you need to recover it from seed. If you enter the PIN wrongly 13 times on a ColdCard, the HW gets permanently bricked. It's destroyed and you can't use it any longer. Ever. Quote from: dkbit98 on October 11, 2022, 09:42:38 AMI never said I am against passphrases at all, I just don't like how ledger is connecting them with PIN codes. It doesn't have to be connected and accessible with the PIN. You can set a temporary passphrase valid only for that session and until you turn the device off. In that case, you don't need to attack a new PIN to your passphrase account.",

As far as I am aware, no device comes with such a warning.What I can extract from available information by Foundation (since I've looked up more information about this wallet than any other) is this.Quote from: https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware/blob/main/SECURITY/SECURITY.md#118-maximum-pin-attemptsThe Secure Element is configured so that if the monotonically increasing counter ever reaches the same value as in the Match Count slot, then it is no longer possible to read or use the PIN Stretch key in Slot 2 of the Secure Element – which means it’s impossible to hash the PIN with it, so there is no way to login to the device after that. The device is essentially “bricked.”Passport allows a maximum of 21 unsuccessful PIN attempts.I guess they chose to use the built-in counter mechanism of the secure element, to make sure that nobody is able to bypass the counter. If they stored the number in flash for instance, a skilled attacker could reset the number to 0 before hitting the n-th attempt at which it would factory reset (or brick itself). This could even be automated with relatively limited required hardware and combined with a brute-force PIN guessing script.The downside is that the secure chip with this secure built-in counter probably doesn't have the ability to factory reset the device when the counter is reached, since it doesn't have as 'direct' and immediate, full control over the main processor, the type of acces it does have to its own internal secure storage 'slots'.Therefore it leaves you with 2 options:(1) Use the secure counter of the secure element, but when it reaches its maximum value, it can only trigger a 'permanent brick' as it's not capable to factory reset the device.(2) Use an insecure counter stored in flash, and have the freedom to do with your MCU what you want. Erase the flash, restore to factory settings, brick it, you name it.I'm not sure that this is 100% accurate, but it may be a technical limitation actually.",

It does however raise the question that if this were the case, why have we not seen the PIN counter being reset on other devices which do not use this hardware counter? Given how eager hardware wallet manufacturers are to disparage the competition, if this were possible would we not have seen a disclosure that \"X wallet's PIN counter can be bypassed\"?",

It does however raise the question that if this were the case, why have we not seen the PIN counter being reset on other devices which do not use this hardware counter? Given how eager hardware wallet manufacturers are to disparage the competition, if this were possible would we not have seen a disclosure that \"X wallet's PIN counter can be bypassed\"?I'm sure that on a hardware wallet like Trezor without secure element, this is a pretty viable attack vector. My guess is that if you already go through the trouble of doing hardware attacks, you may as well skip all the boring bruteforcing that is still required in this example and 'go for gold', directly dumping the seed during the boot process, like Joe Grand did it. Or use any other attack type that doesn't require waiting for potentially days or weeks.This actually makes this list even more interesting, because we can now easily point out which hardware wallets have a non-destructive 'attempt counter', while also having a secure chip. These are exactly the devices where it may make sense to attempt finding the storage location of the counter (obviously outside the secure element) and attacking that to get unlimited PIN entry attempts.",
