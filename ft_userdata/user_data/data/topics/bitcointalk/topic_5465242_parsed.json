  "content": "So I have new topic. At the beginning you have to screen which coins to trade. And here comes the problem. Can use coingecko, coinmarketcap and similar websites that show % of movement up and down then you go to the chart and see nothing happening, 80% of the time are just some shitty consolidations so you have to wait an hour or so for trend to develop. Time wasting. Is there a way to screen coins efficiently and fast? Not by using signals - a signal means you get a message or SMS then quickly jump online to see the chart movement in panic.... and make panic decisions.... If I use Tradeview Screener I can just set 2 parameters/filters - Exchange and Directional index and result will be blank, since there are no coins at that moment on certain exchange with strong trend - but only time wasting consolidations. Any method/website to make this process fast?",

In addition, the data is not updated within seconds, but sometimes actually lags behind for several hours. Thus, these data are completely useless as indicators. I usually use directly the data of the exchange on which I want to trade. It is also very easy to use bots to give personal signals such as (\"Volume on BTC is increasing by leaps and bounds\") and then react immediately, the exchanges also offer interfaces to be able to access this data yourself. The data is usually also very reliable and quite suitable as a trading signal.",

Instead of looking for most of AI kind of trade, it is better to develop your strategy and trade what you see. If market is volatile it should reflect in btc pair, checking CMC or coingecko are quite sufficient to follow the natural tides of the market rather than creating more indicators that will end up confusing you and you eventually lose your money.

      "body": "This process is not supposed to be a fast-rich thing. It is a slow paced time consuming and long term thing.Indicators are only 50% correct, dont base your trades on them, but add in fundamentals and trends. You cannot say that a certain indicators is a 100% accurate reading of profit or loss, because such things dont exist.Also be careful not to pay any attention to signals groups. They exist to scam their members not profit them, the only profit makers there are the owners.My suggestion to any new trader about screening coins is to observe them for at least 2years before investing. This might seem long but only legit projects will survive that long and your money will be saved, this I am saying from my 6years of experience in this sector. Otherwise, it is always the safer bet to buy bitcoin at the lower price.",

Right advice ... but ... we all are humans ... I guess  At least I would suggest to start with small amounts. OP, What's wrong with Tradingview? If you like a short overview (and bring along some trust): https://www.tradingview.com/crypto-screener/And if you like to dive deep, build up your own strategy or get some from others, backtest it until it fits your requirements. There is a paid version if you need more features.But don't forget, charts never tell future movements, they are only able to look into the past. Sometimes it's more reliable to let your cat predict which coins to choose than charts.It's not only choosing the right coin, it's choosing the right investment strategy too. So hodling BTC combined with some sort of DCA is something I would suggest doing nowadays.",

I believe blockfolio have this kind of feature before that notifies you whenever there’s a sudden movement or consolidation happening on the token you are watching depending in the parameters that you setup.I’m not using that app anymore after they are purchased by FTX but they are the best screener before. You can try Dexscreener too since it’s the most popular for shitcoins hunter.",

Any method/website to make this process fast?My advice on this is for you not to trust or rely on any website to do what you are meant to engage doing by yourself, they can give you notifications and suggestions about them, but how fast and accurate do you think they can appear and everyone will not be using them? Come to think of it in such direction, make use of your own personal efforts in making research and drive out conclusion on your findings, risk is in everything we do, we cannot be hundred percent effective about what others gave us because we all have same brain, why not crack yours and use it for what you want.",

Tradingview provides real-time statistics from the exchange you use. So you can easily screen the coins you intend to trade. Coingecko and Coinmarketcap are quite sluggish, making them unsuitable for trading. It is up to you, if you want to choose another platform that meets your requirements. But, for me, tradingview is sufficient because it contains the majority of the trading tools that we want.",

Then its true that it isnt really just basing up on a single exchange on which those movements would really be thatcalculated and this is why % movement whether up or down would really be not precise. It would be better on sticking on the platform you are trading or tend to trade or make use of rather than on making yourself trying out to reference with those common marketcap sites which shows that in overall average and not on a single point. So its never been recommendable for you to make use if you are really that trying to snip out with those small percentage movements. Better be specific and would really be directly touching up the platform on which you do tend to use.CMC and CG are really just that good on peaking about price movements but in speaking about making it as a signal or indication then it wont really be able to fit out on the criteria.",
