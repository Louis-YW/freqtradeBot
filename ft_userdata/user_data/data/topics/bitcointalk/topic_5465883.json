  "content": "This topic is mostly addressed to global administrators and to gmaxwell, achow101, as they are mods of Wallet software board. The topic should be addressed, in fact, to Andreas Schildbach, the mod of Bitcoin Wallet for Android board but, since he was last active in 2018, I doubt that he is acting as a mod anymore.During some recent research, I observed that most of the topics posted in Bitcoin Wallet for Android board are not referring to this wallet.Based on some posts made by Andreas Schildbach or by Mike Hearn and also based by common sense (n.b. the name of the board should tell clearly its purpose), it was clear to me that topics from the respective board are supposed to be dedicated to the wallet named \"Bitcoin Wallet for Android\" and not to any wallet running on Android platform. Having that in mind, I noticed that most of the topics present in the respective board do not belong there.Therefore I would like to point this out to the above mentioned moderators, in case they think they should move to Wallet software board all the topics from Bitcoin Wallet for Android board which do not related to Bitcoin Wallet for Android app.Alternatively, I could also report those topics for not belonging to the respective board but I don't know if this would be the best approach. For instance, some topics are older than 6 months so reports made for those would be mostly flagged as Bad by default. This is the reason for which I thought to write this topic.",

I will try to monitor this forum at least daily and answer questions if I can. So just ask ahead!Quote from: _act_ on September 06, 2023, 05:03:08 PMI will prefer the board to be for all Android wallets or it should be ceased.Quote from: joker_josue on September 06, 2023, 07:22:40 PMNow, this board could also be changed to cover all Android wallets. Does this make any sense?Well, I can not change the forum design... I just mentioned an existing issue. The fix can be done by keeping only the wallets related to Bitcoin Wallet inside its allocated board, instead of changing the forum design (by removing the board completely or by making it a board for all Android wallets). Furthermore, if the board would be redesigned as a board for all Android wallets this would mean even more work for mods, as they should move all topics from Wallet software board which are related to Android wallets inside Bitcoin Wallet board... Does this make sense?",

I have a topic there since 2020/2021, so I think we are talking about most of the topics in that board, and it may be archival due to inactivity.Rename board name is the best solution or create an archived board for \"Bitcoin wallet\" by schildbach and keep other topics after rename it.so only admins can do this",

Does this make sense? It makes perfect sense.If the wallet specifies that it is still active and updated, it is still used by many - including members of this forum, so it should remain as is. In turn, topics that are not linked to this specific portfolio must be moved to the appropriate board.",

Even the post made the app developer is not 100% clear. The only clear message about the purpose of this board is this one, made by Mike Hearn (highlight is mine):Quote from: Mike Hearn on January 10, 2014, 03:10:51 PMThis forum is for an app called \"Bitcoin Wallet\" by Andreas Schildbach, this one:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.walletIt's not for all wallets that run on Android, despite the perhaps confusing naming.Additionally, I found one more post, made by the app developer, which explains the same thing:Quote from: Andreas Schildbach on January 08, 2015, 09:48:56 AMThis forum is about the Android appÂ  Bitcoin Wallet. Look here for other wallets.",
