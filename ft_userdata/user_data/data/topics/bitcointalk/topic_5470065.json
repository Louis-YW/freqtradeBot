But I never take them to heart for the sake of my health as well. While anything is possible with Bitcoin, I feel it is not necessary bothering too much what the price will be in the future. Funny enough, many of these analysts are not even hodlers. The best approach is always to ensure you own Bitcoin to remaining in the game and let the future decide for itself.",

      "body": "The ability for you and I to talk about bitcoin price is what makes it speculative and for that we can not accurate thought or deep feelings that such will likely happen, we can say bitcoin can successfully achieve a higher price of $90k or $100k comes bull run but what we can consider is the probability of hitting the price. I won't say nothing is possible but sometimes this feelings gives people the impression that it works as ponzi scheme and besides what is the mechanism behind this price increment and overhyping that is making people to have too much hope and believe that it will surge to $1m?",

      "body": "The subject title says \"FUN\", so... yeah To answer the question, I would say NO. It's too high for Bitcoin to reach that price in such a short amount of time. We've seen lots of predictions in the past telling that Bitcoin will reach 6 digits even before the pandemic in 2020. In the end, it didn't happen, and it hasn't happened yet... or it will after a year or so. Anyway, I will not share the photo anymore, but my initial price prediction for Bitcoin's peak in the next bull run is at around ~$140,000. How did I come to that number? During the bull run in 2017, Bitcoin's price increased by at least ~3300%. During the bull run in 2021, the price increase from the lowest price to it's highest is at around ~1800%. I just get the half of 1800% which is ~900% since it seems like the price increase in the last 2 bull runs cut into half. Well, not exact, but at least half. Too much words to say for me, but it's for fun. My prediction is ~$140,000 is it's peak. Maybe some can share theirs as well.",

No, why i said no is not because bitcoin cannot get there, but the probability of having that market worth is still far, maybe we should begin to think about that after some other two halvings coming after 2024 but for now, we have the highest speculation of $120,000 above and less than 200,000 this coming halving bullrun, if what Arthur Hayes said is true, them many would have taken bitcoin for ponzi scheme, because everything will just happened all of a sudden.Quote from: Oshosondy on October 12, 2023, 10:16:41 AMIf I should guess what bitcoin price would be by 2024/2025, I will guess $170000 which has been the highest price of my guess.

I do know if that would have changed, but what people will think more about that time is that bitcoin price could have reduced slightly back again.There's this certainty that bitcoin will run a bullrun next after next year halving, we are having anything more than $100,000 and the previous halving could be a direction to the rate we should expect, there's going to be a bullrun, we are going to experience a new all time high over the previous $68,000 and the market will rise, bit after then comes in another dip coming in gradually jist as we are now from the all time high.",

If you ask me then yes there is possibility that Bitcoins will definitely cross this price segment. We have seen Bitcoins follow a 4 year cycle to reach its new ATH price. And if we make a estimation then 2024 is the 4th year. So it is bound that Bitcoins will cross atleast 70k usd by 2024. Now as the price will be so high, so more people will try to buy the coins and hence the price will go more up.",

      "body": "That's quite a bold prediction from Arthur Hayes. Predicting the Bitcoin price is challenging due to many variables and market dynamics. To me, $750K to $1M might sound like an ambitious prediction. Your guess of $170,000 by 2024/2025 is a bit more conservative and falls within the range of what some other analysts might predict. Your point about 2026 being a bear market year is valid, as the cryptocurrency market often goes through cycles of bullish and bearish phases. Historical patterns and trends can provide some guidance, but accurately predicting the timing and duration of these cycles can be challenging.If there is a significant increase in adoption or if Bitcoin becomes more widely accepted as a store of value, then it is possible that it could reach these price levels. Let's revisit this discussion in a few years and see how these predictions hold up!",

But without adoption, I would not bet on that as nothing will push the price that higher during the bear. After the expected halving, the next halving should be in 2028, so 2026 is definitely a bear year. I don't see such price increase apart from real adoption and legalization of bitcoin in more than 100 countries.",

Then all the crazy people will go reverse FOMO and dump all the coins they were hodling since 2019",
