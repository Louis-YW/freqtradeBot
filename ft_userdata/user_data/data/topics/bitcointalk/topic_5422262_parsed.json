Remember, there was a time we had the barter method as means of exchange and then fiat. Now we're (almost) in the digital bit financial world method. Bitcoin leads here and to the best of my perspicacity I believe that has everything to do with the phenomenal tech that came with it. That's the blockchain tech. Bitcoin may be overtaken in the future by another financial method. We can't for sure rule that out. Hopefully, blockchain remains and possibly metamorphose into something new.",

I like such motivational themes aimed at believing in the future. Especially for beginners who come here and do not always correctly assess the state of affairs. There will always be alarmists who want to create a lot of drama, but I would prefer people who, despite everything, do not give up and believe.Tim Draper still positive on $250K Bitcoin price prediction in 2023Mark Cuban: “Cryptocurrencies will thrive even despite the fall of FTX”",

They must pass through trial and growth period till it is widely acceptable. Do not forget that more than a decade and as of today, bitcoin is still in its beta version.Surely, many things will change about bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency, but it is yet to establish let alone to extinct. There is so much great power in the blockchain and the goodness is that both the internet, blockchain and bitcoin is not controlled by a central server (government point). It is in our hands, even if bitcoin fails today, it will take less than two years to produce technology motivated by bitcoin that will be more advanced and acceptable than bitcoin. What we owe an evolving technology is to have an open mind, so that we won't become that pastor that taught his audience to forbid the television because it is the devil's mirror, but today the same pastor broadcast his gospel via television.",

It's probably because humans who are already very comfortable with the status quo would normally resist something that disrupts and brings change.

The reason I have no doubt about it is, if we consider the fact that a decentralized system unlike web 3.0 is a system that is technological and future based. Meta verse is also a concept though still in its developing stage is a result of advancement in technology of which Bitcoin or other crypto exchange is a perfect suitor when it comes to acquisition of such for use, also for other reasons of which concerns international border trade.",

We have seen the promise of decentralized currency, we have seen it's potential to change the financial world, and yet this is only the tip of the iceberg. Distributed networks will eventually grow beyond financial applications into social media platforms and other areas, taking decentralization and blockchain technology to new heights. It all depends, however, on whether we can get past all the hype and drama so that we can see it for what it really is: an ingenious piece of engineering that could become a fundamental building block of our future economy.The Internet grew by leaps and bounds because it was a free and open network for anyone to use and build on. Bitcoin is similar in that there really are no costs involved in using the network. There are low transaction fees, but you don't need to get permission from anyone before using it.",

It's the fact that some investors that were against btc, in the days when it was worth nothing, it couldn't reckon as a durable tender (yeah, it's durable now.... Wavering on the price rate due to the market structure isn't happening for the first time and, atleast -- for several years -- it has proven that, with some voluminous pages of TURN UPs, in every ATH; the latter which could have been made to recover lost involvement and accumulate profits, that's been due, overtime.), It was even used to purchase a pizza and yeah? How's that supposed to make much sense to 'em by then? But look at it now.... They keep turning away from investing on/with their so-called Fiat and, they keep seeking for the least slots to have. If this uncommon transformation has been consistent, then it came to STAY....

But the continues existence of bitcoin has already proved the enemies of bitcoin wrong. Bitcoin has died many times in the mouth and minds of many and yet it is still alive.

I don't agree if anyone says we can not live without Internet because I believe in fact we should live as most natural friendly as possible. It can help us to refresh our minds and it is a good pill for so many issues in modern life from mental to physical problems.

Let's take for example the case that you want to explain the Internet and its use to someone - you need a computer, a browser and an Internet connection. A person opens a browser, enters the term he is interested in into the search engine and gets the results from which he chooses what suits him best - it doesn't take more than 5 minutes for someone to master that process.Try to explain to that same person what Bitcoin is in the most basic terms, with the addition of how to safely install a wallet, how to buy Bitcoin and how to make a transaction - many will certainly not understand everything at first, and some will not be able to understand at all.In the almost 13 years of Bitcoin's existence, we are talking about the fact that it is currently owned by 1-2% of the total world population, while some estimates say that around 5% of people in total are in possession of some cryptocurrency. What I want to say is that it will be much harder for people to accept (understand) Bitcoin than the Internet, which, unlike Bitcoin, is not an alternative but something that has become a generally accepted technology practically necessary in everyday life.",
