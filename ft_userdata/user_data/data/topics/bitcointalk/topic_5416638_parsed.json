Their system is composed of strong algorithms that automaticly buy undervallued assets and sell overvalued assets on the blockchains. By doing so they are making large profits. But it is hard to do so alone, we (the investors) by investing in their Defi (decentralized finance) and by making escrows, they can put these amounts into the automated algorithms. They make huge profits from it and we keep some of it, but these amounts are quite substential. You can even get from 100% to 140% profit in a escrow of 120 days and can withdraw the daily profits at any time.https://i.imgur.com/yWDwTS3.pngSeener operates on the Ethereum network with USDT which has the ratio of 1:1 with USD. It is only accessible at the moment on Coinbase/Trust/Metamask app.https://i.imgur.com/PczmHBx.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/upk66IJ.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/pCD3Vf1.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANTThis things works, but be carefulWhat is important to keep in mind is that Seener launched their Dapp (decentralized application) in august 2022, it hasn’t been long and even if the company is doing well, you never know what might happens if it crashes or any other possible reasons to go down. So this thing works, but do not put high amount in it unless you like to gamble. Some times when things are too good to be true, you wonder, how long with it last? We don’t know, so be careful, but for now it’s fantastic.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Seener documentationCompany name: Seener Foundation PTE. LTD.Authenticated and Licensed by the ACRA(Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) of singapore. Shown on the ACRA website, but the certificate itself can be given if asked.UEN (Unique Entity Number): 202122638NWebsite: seener.orgTheir social medias are linked at the bottom of their home websiteWhite Paper: at the bottom left of their home website---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How to reach SeenerIt is very simple, you can reach Seener on any of their partners. Only Coinbase/Trust/Metamask at the moment. As any Dapp (decentrilized application) you need to go on your wallet brower and then go on Dapp.Seener.orgI highly suggest adding it to your favorites so you won’t have to type it evrytime.Then you need to enter the invitation code and connect your wallet via your public domain address, as any dapp (decentrilized application) would ask.https://i.imgur.com/VzU0A3X.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/hXDInRl.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/6uRVNxQ.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/9HQ682o.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After entering the invitation code, add the main page to your favorites, it doesn’t appear at the moment because I already did it, but it’s there!https://i.imgur.com/g7apVy3.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/cWMUTzb.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/DY4seHX.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SubscribeTo be able to invest in Seener, you will need to put USDT in it. It is the same as any Dapp (decentrilized application), it is linked to your wallet by your public domain address. To subsribe, it needs to be a minimum amount of 100USDT. Also, the first and only time you do subscribe an amount, there will be a minor amount of ETH gas fees.https://i.imgur.com/yWDwTS3.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/8WabXSj.pngThe crypto USDT ratio 1:1 with USD real money.https://i.imgur.com/zyMaf3w.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/YUEJqUi.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/2VpFHi4.pngOnce subscribed, the USDT will be in your balance tab, to be used to escrow or to be withdrawn.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------https://i.imgur.com/zglfRq8.pngStatic incomeYou can make any of these 5 escrows (minimum amount of 100 USDT).-3 days (limit of 3 uses) for a periodic daily income of 0.2% to 0.4% of the escrow.-15 days for a periodic daily income of 0.3% to 0.5% of the escrow.-60 days for a periodic daily income of 0.6% to 1% of the escrow.-90 days for a periodic daily income of 0.8% to 1.2% of the escrow.-120 days for a periodic daily income of 1% to 1.4% of the escrow.The 3 days escrows are mainly there so that you test how things work, that’s why they put a limit of 3 uses by account on them. You almost have no gains with these.Once you put the amount and select the period, simply press on the escrow button.https://i.imgur.com/y8iFCbb.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/20BMhXp.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/m4jq2jq.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You can also view the escrows you made with their dates and timer statushttps://i.imgur.com/KXMlBE9.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/vdOAboA.png          *.https://i.imgur.com/csAtEil.png.**This only shows the total amount of USDT that is throughout all the escrows of users on Seener.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All you need to care for during the escrows is collecting within every 48 hours the profits you make. If you do not, Seener will gladly take it off your hands by an automated system. I highly suggest to simply doing the collecting daily. The profits are based on the % of the escrows and are distributed every hour of the day. You could even collect every hour if you wished to do so.These profits will then be at your disposal into your balance tab. You can then decide if you wish to escrow them again at any time you wish. Or you can also withdraw them at any time you wishes.https://i.imgur.com/y5Y0K17.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/M057coi.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/sKCB9a1.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/MXbhp6u.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.https://i.imgur.com/wZh97C4.png     2.https://i.imgur.com/KlCj8eD.png     3.https://i.imgur.com/xbJudBX.png1. This is the cumulative amount you’ve put into escrows since the beginning.2. This is the amount you currently have in your total ongoing escrows.3. This is all the USDT in circulation throughout all escrows of Seener users.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WithdrawYou can’t withdraw on weekends.With the amount of USDT at your disposal in your balance tab, you can escrow them again or withdraw. To be able to withdraw all you need to do is put an email address of your own choosing on the first usage. And of course, same as escrows, the minimal withdrawal amount is 100 USDT.The first withdraw is free, afterwards Seener keeps 5% of the withdraw amount + a variable minor gas fees, so don’t be surprised if you don’t get back the full amount.After that, the amount you’ve withdrawn (minus the fees) will go back to your crypto wallet (Coinbase/Trust/Metamask).https://i.imgur.com/0cJXmdn.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/PqFgrpm.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/LpR66Tg.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/qY7fHvG.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The pyramidal system of SeenerThe static income alone of Seener is impressive, but even more the fact that this Defi (decentralized finance) works in a way to encourage team effort. To get on the Dapp (decentrilized application), you need to get invited, but once you’re in, you also get you own invitation code (unlimited). On Seener, everyone is the boss of somebody else and everyone gets benefits from the people they invited and so on. https://i.imgur.com/zglfRq8.pngStatic team incomeAll the people YOU invite, YOU will get a bonus of 8% their daily income. They are your first level subordinates.Then if these people (first level) invite other people (second level) YOU will get a bonus of 6% their daily income. They are your second level subordinates.Then if these people (second level) invite other people (third level) YOU will get a bonus of 3% their daily income. They are your third level subordinates.Then if these people (third level) invite other people (fourth level) YOU will get a bonus of 2% their daily income. They are your fourth level subordinates.Then if these people (fourth level) invite other people (fifth level) YOU will get a bonus of 1% their daily income. They are your fifth level subordinates.This system applies to everyone. This is why it is called pyramidal and that everyone is their own team leader.This type of income can only be collected on each Monday and is added automatically on your balance. But if you have subordinates that don’t collect their daily income, you naturally will also lose that bonus share. Remind them if needed!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The VIP system and the dynamic team incomeThis Defi (decentralised finance) also offers a feature which when one of your subordinates makes an escrow of 60 days or more, you get a profit % of it instantly into your balance tab. All depending on your VPI level vs their own VIP level (see the calculation section).VIP levels goes from VIP0 / VIP1 / VIP2 / VIP3 / VIP4 / VIP5To progress your level of VIP, you and/or your subordinates needs to make escrows of 60 days or more.How to level up these levels is shown lower on the topic.Calculations of the dynamic team incomeThis is what the VIP system is about.Once you are VIP2 or more you get 15% instant profit when you, yourself, make an escrow of 60 days or more. This is the only way you can benefits from this system by yourself. The rest is done and provided by your subordinates.To gains benefits, your subordinates need to make escrows of 60 days or more.Depending on your own VIP level, here are how the profits are made by this feature.*If your subordinate has the same VIP level as you, you get 1% instant profit bonus from the escrow they make.-If you are VIP0 you don’t benefit from this feature.-If you are VIP1 (0%) you don’t benefit from this feature.-If you are VIP2 (7%)And if subordinate at VIP1 = 7%-0%= 7% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP2 = 1% instant profit bonus when they escrow.-If you are VIP3 (10%)And if subordinate at VIP1 = 10%-0%=10% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP2 = 10%-7%=3% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP3 = 1% instant profit bonus when they escrow.-If you are VIP4 (13%)And if subordinate at VIP1 = 13%-0%=13% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP2 = 13%-7%=6% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP3 = 13%-10%=3% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP4 = 1% instant profit bonus when they escrow.-If you are VIP5 (15%)And if subordinate at VIP1 = 15%-0%=15% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP2 = 15%-7%=8% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP3 = 15%-10%=5% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP4 = 15%-13%=2% instant profit bonus when they escrow.And if subordinate at VIP5 = 1% instant profit bonus when they escrow. https://i.imgur.com/zglfRq8.png--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Leveling the VIP systemhttps://i.imgur.com/gntVOIe.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/DeY9qv1.pngDo not forget, it only progresses when you and/or your subordinates escrow for 60 days or more.VIP0 is there only for people that got invited, but didn’t escrow.VIP1 is reached once you escrow 100 USDT.VIP2 is reached once you and/or your subordinates escrow a cumulative amount of 20 000 USDT. Being VIP2 also put you to a weekly escrow limit of 10 000 USDT, meaning you cannot invest yourself more than that until the next Monday unless done by subordinates.VIP3 is reached once you and/or your subordinates escrow a cumulative amount of 100 000 USDT. Being VIP3 also put you to a weekly escrow limit of 20 000 USDT, meaning you cannot invest yourself more than that until the next Monday unless done by subordinates.VIP4 is reached once you and/or your subordinates escrow a cumulative amount of 300 000 USDT. Being VIP4 also put you to a weekly escrow limit of 40 000 USDT, meaning you cannot invest yourself more than that until the next Monday unless done by subordinates.VIP5 is reached once you and/or your subordinates escrow a cumulative amount of 1 000 000 USDT. Being VIP5 also put you to a weekly escrow limit of 80 000 USDT, meaning you cannot invest yourself more than that until the next Monday unless done by subordinates.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Extra infos---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dext (decentralized exchange)There are Dext (decentralized exchange) that you can also reach in the web browser of your wallet that are also Dapp (decentralized application). Meaning that if you need to convert ETH to USDT or USDT to ETH, you can do it for a meagre amount because it is all done by an automated system that doesn’t require many fees. You will save tons of money compared to the usual exchange offered by your own wallets.I personally use UNISWAP.org which is done very smoothly. The only thing you need to remember, is every time you try for the first time a Dext (decentralized exchange), the first time you use it, they will ask for a small ETH fee for activating the use of it. I also suggest to favourite the Dext (same way you did Seener) that you feel comfortable with. So you won’t have to type it every time.https://i.imgur.com/UMEybAp.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/4AzSeLi.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/W7tnwsX.png          *.https://i.imgur.com/Wm6Nj6S.png.**. I highly suggest always leaving a few double digits $ on your ETH wallet balance so that when you exchange tokens (or subscribe on Seener and also use a Dext for the first time). That way you won’t be unable to do transactions because you have 0 ETH on the balance.Any kind of transactions/exchanges/transfers are not instant. You can view your activity log if you are curious.https://i.imgur.com/pTv3bB7.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/XIgehET.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/yK30db7.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/LfmF0yA.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Canadian usersApparently the banks in Canada don’t authorize credit and debit cards linked to crypto apps. So for other fellow Canadians like me who cannot, I use the app named Shakepay which allow the users to do e-interact transfers from your bank and also to your bank.https://i.imgur.com/GkdRQuu.png The steps are as follows:1. Send an e-interact to your Shakepay account.https://i.imgur.com/JZ9msti.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/gHEffTp.png2. Buy ETH with that money.https://i.imgur.com/MIopRs8.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/ugEs3TC.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/pvngYSx.png3. Send it to your Ethereum public domain address of your wallet. Copy your address shown inside the receive tab of your crypto wallet and paste it into the shakepay send ETH tab.https://i.imgur.com/xTLPhC6.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/tt4rDKR.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/CVQUUDX.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/WdvcYAf.png4. Use Dext (decentralized exchange) to swap ETH to USDT.OR, the other way around1. Use Dext (decentralized exchange) to swap USDT to ETH.2. From your wallet send it to your Shakepay Ethereum public domain address which can be found on shakepay/add funds/ethereum, copy the link. There is also each time a small ETH gas fee when doing so.https://i.imgur.com/LeWEL0D.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/dzoPGm0.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/8jl5qFy.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/pf3CVyW.png3. Sell your ETH for CAD money.https://i.imgur.com/HsmNKrc.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/JjFLd0W.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/kIQpxTK.png4. e-interact transfer it to your email address to proceed the transfer to the appropriate bank. You can also setup an automatic accept e-interact transfers on your bank account so that you don’t have to bother with it each time.https://i.imgur.com/U121zBe.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/zq9mvYO.png---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final thoughtsI know this is a lot of infos, if you have any questions or requests, post them and I will reply asap to my best of capabilities.This is worth it and works.But as I told you at the beginning. This is new and we don’t know how long it will last. So if you put money in it, it’s the same as any investments, put some that you won’t mind gambling. Never huge amounts. After you make back the profits you invested, you can let the investments reinvest themselves and from time to time add some.There is also a FAQ section on Seener and a customer service if needed. To reach it, just go into the account section.To get in, simply enter the invitation code: 674043Afterwards it will be up to you to invite people and get your own subordinates.",
