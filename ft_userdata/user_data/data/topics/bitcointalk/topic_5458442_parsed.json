  "content": "I am open to changing any of my feedbacks and I wanted to open this thread because of what I have had to read about the last one.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=239997As far as I know, there are two types of cases where DTs disagree.1. That of the newbies who ask for a loan in the lending section without offering collateral.2. That of purchased accounts.So I understand that, although not all DTs have the same opinion, it is legitimate to leave a negative tag for an account that has obviously changed hands. Well, I had to read this today:Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on July 02, 2023, 06:26:22 PMI think you and Poker Player should have a tag team together. Don't validate your nonsense misusing of power by including some others name who are much sensible than you two and respects the system. Clearly others are not as harsh as you. They don't feel happy after tagging someone.Happy? I find it pretty boring, actually. This is coming from a person who had the same reaction in this case:martyinshttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1114408QuoteIgnore all these BS negative and neutral feedback. The account seems changed hand but that does not warrant a scam. There are many accounts who are changed hand and they are doing just fine. This account should not be a different too. This forum is full of people who break the rules, who buy accounts that make ban evasion, who have alts in the same campaign, of which surely we do not discover even half, and when we discover someone and they are left red tags, as in the case of martyins and this one you have to come out with conspiracies that even you don't believe.All this when negative feedback means less than ever as we can see nowadays quite a few cases of people with negative feedback participating in paid signature campaigns.Let this thread serve to question my feedbacks, I will not hesitate to change them if I see weighty arguments or a consensus of DTs to say they are wrong.",

      "body": "Poker player, it is fine you opened this thread for the community to evaluate your feedback. I wanted to open a similar thread, but I restrained because of too much drama going on these few days. If I opened such a thread, it would have heated up the whole situation and you know what happens when ego begins to rumble. It also takes intelligence to be open in discussions before arriving at conclusion. I would say that you acted so fast in living tag in my profile.  Opening this thread while you already red tagged my account simply means you have already sentenced me as a judge before bringing my matter to the jury. But I am consoled by the reason that feedback can be deleted. Let me trust your statement here and continue. QuoteLet this thread serve to question my feedbacks, I will not hesitate to change them if I see weighty arguments or a consensus of DTs to say they are wrong.If you read my reply here with an open mind, you would have deleted your feedback by now.See this:QuoteRby was created way back 2014 only for the purpose of promoting the Rubycoin. The Ruby team was behind the promotion of Rubycoin even outside the forum. It was not a solo project, in the team had someone whose duty was to update the thread and others seriously working on the backend then. A unique password relating to the name of the project was used then to allow every member of the team access to any of our handles including BTT but it was the exclusive duty of one person to update information in the media. But incase of unavailability anyone can step in.From the above you should know that rby account was used by many people but was the duty of only one person to update the thread and social media handles(which was not me). See this:QuoteDown to 2021 (not 2022), After the covid-19. I remembered this forum and the rby account. The password wasn't changed and it was a unique password every member of the team could remember. I inputed the password and had access to the forum. I tried the password in our proton mail address and was denied access(which means someone changed it).I had access to this account because the team had a password everyone knew, which was created from Rubycoin, that made me still remember the password after many years. This should be able to settle your doubt about change of tone or English as said.In one other thread opened by JG, you made this statement. Quote from: Poker Player on July 01, 2023, 05:22:00 PMWell, I don't know, I was sure there was nothing, but now I see the untrusted feedback, I guess it was a mistake of mine. So, we have several untrusted feedback and the only one that has a reference dates back 9 years, accusation of which rby has defended himself although I don't know how well. I would tag him for the account having changed hands but not for that past event that I do not have the information to evaluate but since we are debating it, I will wait to decide whether to tag him or not. You agreed that you cannot tag an account for an event that happened 9 years ago that you do not have information to evaluate. But then, JG tagged me for that... A mere allegation by a competitor then who wanted to bring the project down. Funny enough we didn't notice him and no single member of the forum responded to the allegation, not even JG himself. There is a gross contraction in the feedbacks given. There was no; Wallet connections No change of local board, as I always see people use as a yardstick  There is no denial or whatever  This account woke up since 3yrs ago and has been active and contributing to the forumWhy the hasty painting of a profile, that is old enough to receive an accolade from the community  , rather some people just want to destroy it.PP, can you delete your feedback now?",

For criminal cases, the evidence asked for is much higher than for civil cases, and to me the cases we deal with here are more like civil cases.What is the Standard of Guilt in Civil Cases?QuoteCivil Court – Civil cases have a much lower standard of guilt and only requires the plaintiff to prove the defendant acted negligently with a 51 percent degree of certainty.When I red tag someone, I assign a probability (which I recognize is subjective) of at least 90%, higher than in civil cases.",

Then the next step is to see how good or bad it actually is.I think that it's OK if people have different views in certain cases, it would be utterly boring if we would all think the same.And while I don't agree with some of the views/decisions/feedbacks Poker Player has made, I do agree that somebody who has bought account is shady. And in the last 5+ years this was made clear in many occasions.On the other hand, maybe it would be the time to educate people that higher ranked accounts are not necessarily better, that even an account with positive feedback can be bought and scam, to basically trust nobody but math. Then maybe, after a while, I would get to agree with DireWolfM14 that such tags are wasted time. Just, sadly, I don't think that this is feasible (but I'd be happy to be proven wrong).",
