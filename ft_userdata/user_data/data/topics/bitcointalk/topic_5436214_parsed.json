Is this way possible to overcome inflation?Thank you for these suggested points, but they are still mainly important for individuals to save themselves from inflation than for an entire community. In addition to what you have explained in order to be more effective for the community, I believe that they need to be creative in the community and create wealth for themselves. The main goal of the community should be to bring/attract money to it through solving external problems and venturing into agriculture, ICT and others.By virtue of this, they would be able to attract money into their community and also create more jobs that will benefit all.",

Is this way possible to overcome inflation?While these are sensible tips for any time of life, in reality unless the whole country or world does them it won't help. However this can actually backfire and make things worse, if people stop spending then companies have to cut back which means job losses and you can end up in a dangerous spiral. Not only that but the current causes of inflation - Russia invading Ukraine - caused food and oil/gas supplies to drop. Which is beyond the control of the average consumer.",

Is this way possible to overcome inflation?Your first and fifth point both involve saving, which I don't think is a good idea during high inflation periods. Right now the inflation rate in my country is at 9% while the interest I am getting on my savings account is less than 1%. Some smaller and more risky banks offer 2% which is the highest you can get at the moment for your savings account. It just doesn't make sense to save money when you lose 7% purchasing power in one year. What would be better in my opinion is to make the necessary purchases you have to do this year as fast possible. For example you need a new washing machine or a new fridge, then I would recommend to make the purchase as fast possible and don't wait with it. Any larger purchase that is essential will become much more expensive the longer we wait. It makes more sense to use our money today then wait a few months until our money losses more value. The only real alternative is to invest our money into assets that give higher returns or at least match the inflation rate.",

The reality is that inflation is there to stay until we leave this world, that's permanent and even if how good a country is there will be several factors that will still affect them and can't skip inflation.Investing and having more source of income are the ideal thing in dealing with the inflation. You can save and get into budgeted activities but you can't enjoy what you'll do if all things will be on a budget. Increase your source of income and cash flow and that's how you fight inflation.",

Indeed, there are many ways to deal with inflation, we must allocate funds to invest. However, those who don't understand investment instruments, don't invest in high-risk ones, so you can't get a profit.Don't let it be because of fear of excessive inflation that you didn't understand Investment suddenly as long as you invest, the original money for short-term needs suddenly runs out because of a loss. Therefore, it is better to keep the money in a safe place, at least it can minimize the decline in value due to inflation.",

Since there is high talent acquisitions who are willing to work at lower wages creating some shit competition everywhere. This means you have to ultimately look for lower paid jobs as well leading to low income and hard time during the inflation. I think this creates complications and need of doing more jobs. Increasing passive income sources is always best.",

With inflation, a family household need to look for additional ways to generate money to add to what they already have because the value of money is usually reduced in purchase made. Another point is that both parents will have to work for it. The challenges will not be left for the man alone to take care of, if that happens the family will suffer with the rise of inflation all over the country.",

But the problem is that not everyone can do that, there must be discipline within them, even myself to do things that seem easy but in practice are very difficult to do. Sacrifice will also be there, because from the start we may live extravagantly, here we are forced to save money. Some people will surely complain and blame the government, but in fact the government's role is very important here, but we also cannot blame the government completely, because we also have to change from within ourselves.",
