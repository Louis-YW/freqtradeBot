How to go to bakeries, fill up the car, travel, etc? Do you know any coins like this?Well, you have just said the crypto that has the high usage for those things and it's bitcoin.Other than that, it will all depend on those merchants, stores, and business establishments if they'll add another crypto for the payments for the products that they're selling to everyone. But usually, we see that it's not just bitcoin that has it but some of the top altcoins as well. Another factor is the location, if there's not that much crypto adoption in an area, whether it is bitcoin, you barely see those acceptance of crypto payments.",

You can try them all if you have no problem with all the issues thrown against them. One coin I do not recommend you using is ETH since transaction fees are higher than the rest.",

Do you know any coins like this? there are thousands of people who use bitcoin to pay for travel, food, cell phone recharge, pay in hotels, pay bills, haven't you read that in El Salvador people can pay for things using bitcoin? from what i read there altcoins are not as used as bitcoin. I for example use bitcoin to buy cell phone recharge, I also use litecoin to buy cell recharge, if in my country I could pay more things using bitcoin I would pay without problems. unfortunately I still can't pay more things using bitcoinQuote from: Yogee on June 27, 2022, 10:39:55 PMSo you are after something that will immediately reflect on the vendor's wallet?OP just wants to campaign for altcoins, he must be angry about bitcoin crash",

In an documentary saw a street vendor accepting bitcoin payments in Venezuela.up until now, bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency when it comes to payment method. even if we say, the fees are expensive or the confirmation is too slow. still, most users and merchants are promoting the use of btc. though there are secondary alts like xrp, ltc, bnb or eth. still the most known crypto when it comes to payment sector is BTC. so the usability depends on the person and the availability of the merchant that will accept your btc payment. this is your job to know shops which are accepting crypto around your area, because some of them are not advertising it openly.",

Well you can but as the price fluctuates and you buy with your gains, every time you make a purchace you need to reserve taxes to pay for that too.

How to go to bakeries, fill up the car, travel, etc? Do you know any coins like this? This is exactly what many altcoins tried to do in the first few years of their inception. However things took a different turn which smashed their optimism. You see, you need merchants accepting an altcoin as payment for that dedicated service. Or they have to start a new chain of services under a name in order to sell their products or services in exchange of that token. Starting this from scratch is a whole different ballgame. Most companies who were raising capital in the first years of ICO craze wanted to do this but after understanding the reality they stepped back and changed their vision to something less daunting eventually dying out.Such ventures will take time and a lot of investment from the owners to compete with the existing market leaders. Hence it is difficult for a niche group to start this. But maybe in future we will see more adoption in crypto and gradually commonly known merchants will be accepting bitcoin, altcoins and their own specific token as well.",
