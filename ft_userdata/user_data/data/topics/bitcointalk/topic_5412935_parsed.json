      "body": "(a) http://www.crypto-stamps.com/private3.html     This stamp was also created in digital format but was never made and was only posted online to show what a stamp can look like with a  paper wallet on its face.Was also loaded and still loaded with 0.002BTC(b) This BIP38 private key has been exposed online for over 5 years and the bitcoin loaded on it has still not been stolen. Job well done Mr Caldwell on your encryption skills!http://www.crypto-stamps.com/private1.html     https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2049688.msg20422477#msg20422477    https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1AzREoFRBhmnvdvrFTibDZYi7Yfbq4u3sF      (c)   Then on July 28th 2017, custom postal stamp printed on an envelope, postage used loaded with 0.005BTC and of course now it also 0.005BTCcash since it was loaded prior to the fork on Aug 1st.           A copy of the stamps Private/Public keys and password are sealed inside the envelope. Stamp displays both a public and private BIP32 encrypted address on the stamp itself. Loaded with Bitcoin and mailed with the wallet loaded.         A Philatelist and Bitcoin enthusiast collector first. Making it the very first Physical Bitcoin Stamp created and to ever be used thru the postage system. It also marks the very first crypto Stamp ever made as well.           When you compare it to the Gibraltar and Austria Crypto stamps, this stamp has both the Public and Private keys on the stamp itself.             The Gibraltar stamp is on the selvage not on the stamp itself.             While the Austria stamp has a public QR code on the stamp, the private ley is on a piece that detaches from the stamp and in itself is not the stamp. In other words, it can be detached and the stamp can mail an envelope without it.                The stamp on the envelope below is all self contained and can be easily redeemed once the password is known with out depending on a website (like the Gibraltar stamp) and without needing the second piece of the stamp(Austria stamp).               Only two ever made, one was auctioned off and the other is safely stored in my collection.      https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2097158.msg20957878#msg20957878      http://www.crypto-stamps.com/private2.html d) Introducing Cypher Postage on March 03, 2021.     http://www.crypto-stamps.com/cypher.html     What are Cypher Stamps?Cypher stamps are stamps that are loaded with actual digital bitcoin issued by Cypher Postage.          What you see are two QR codes, to the left is the public address that can be scanned to reveal the amount of bitcoin loaded on the coin.          The right side QR code is the BIP38 encrypted private key that once scanned will allow you to sweep the bitcoin from the stamp, that is, if you have the correct password.          The passwords on these stamps are at least 17 scrambled letters numbers and figures that according to https://password.kaspersky.com/ will take centuries to solve.          Not to fear, inside the envelope these stamps come on is a full print out of the password along with all pertinent information for the keys for this stamp.          Can this stamp be used for posting items? The answer is no, these are novelty collectable stamps that are one of the first of their kind in the world in having physical bitcoins on them. Just like Bitbills and Casascius not being real government issues cards/coins, the same apply to these stamps. They are made by Cypher Postage as a tribute to Bitcoin and all the physical bitcoin collectors around the world.        https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5331739.msg56822198#msg56822198         These are also the very first Smart Contract Timelock stamps ever made as well, a new concept for stamps.    (e)    September 2020 Cipher Bills Cipher Bills come in four different denominations, namely, 50,000 Satoshi, 75,000 Satoshi, 100,000 Satoshi and 200,000 Satoshi. 50 of each will ever be created Cipher BONDSCIPHER BONDS UTILIZES A TIMELOCK TRANSACTION TO LOCK THE ABILITY TO SPEND BITCOIN UNTIL THE 1ST JANUARY 2030. A TIMELOCK IS A TYPE OF SMART CONTRACT THAT RESTRICTS THE SPENDING OF SOmE BITCOINS UNTIL A SPECIFIED FUTURE TIME. Cipher Bonds come in two different denominations, namely, 10,000 and 100,000 Satoshi. 50 of each will ever be created. Custom dates can also be created to any value or date you wish.  Bitbills 10 year Anniversary BitBills Cipher Bills 10 year anniversary. Only 21 of 10,000 and 20,000 Satoshi ever made. Loaded exactly on the 9th May 2021 the exact 10 year anniversary of the launch of Bitbills. SECURITY WATERMARKAll certificates have the Cypher Hodl logo Custom Water Marked on the paper that puts us a notch above the rest. This is a Secure Mark. It can’t be forged by a copier, printing press or computer. There is no other way to “watermark” a sheet except during the actual paper making process, which requires expensive dies, long delivery times, and ordering large quantities. Thus, anytime you buy a Cipher Bill or Cipher Bond with a watermark, you will know its genuine as they can never be copied,scanned,recreated on a computer or duplicated! Its virtually counterfeit proof!     (f)  Received Trademark status for my image and logo!       (g) Introducing for the first time ever a Smartcontract Timelock coin by Cypher Hodl!        Each stainless steel coin is 2.5 inches in diameter and is the first of its kind to be a smart contract time locked coin! Only 5 made and the first 2 stayed in my collection as always with all other collectable items ever made.        In the front you will find the raw hexadecimal code surrounding the Cypher Satoshi figure. This code would need to be broadcast on the bitcoin blockchain on or after the 1st January 2030 in order for the coin to be loaded with the 20,000 Satoshi.        If your not up to typing in that long hexadecimal code that is 383 characters long, you will also be able to scan the code from a QR located in the back of the COA that comes along with your coin. And if you happen to lose that you will also find the same QR code for the timelock code lasered onto the coin under the hologram as well. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5368259.msg58301754#msg58301754(h)    Cypher Hodl Stainless Steel 2.5 inch coins.          Only 21 ever made loaded with 0.01 BTC    (i)  Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch Smart Contract Timelock          Only 10 made 0.01 Denomination     (j)   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5389190.0          Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                   Only 21 ever made loaded with LTC/BTC          Coin with Litecoin and Bitcoin.

The idea is to peel one and give to a second party and in order for this coin to be redeemed both shares need to be used to reveal the private key which can then be swept.                   A file will be provided along with the coin such as this to unlock the private key using two shares.         https://mycelium.com/assets/entropy/checksalt/sss.html        Was going to make 3 coins one with a share in each, to make 2 out of the 3 design but it would have been too expensive,        So I eliminated the 3rd share and the 2 shares that are on the coin will be the only ones in existance to decrypt and reveal the private key.       (r)   Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                       Only 1 prototype made loaded with Ethereum/Bitcoin                               (s)    Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                     Only 1 prototype made.                      MONERO/BITCOIN/LITECOIN/DOGECOIN coin           There are 8 Private key water proof papers behind that holo...had to dig deep into that coin!Also threw in there a metamask seed for a wallet with an NFT just for kicks!             (t)    Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                     Only 1 prototype made.BIP38           This uses Mike Caldwells tech with BIP38 encryption...so you have the private and public key on the outside...behine the hologram is the QR code for the private key and also a 32 alphanumeric password to decrypt the encrypted private key. According to https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ it will take billions of years to crack it. I also placed the same BIP38 paperwallet on an online digital stamp back in 2017 loaded with 0.02BTC and it has yet to be cracked! http://www.crypto-stamps.com/private3.html        I also ended making a 2 coin BIP38 coin as well, seperating the private key under one holo for one coin and the long password under the holo for the second companion coin.          (u)  Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                     Only 1 prototype made           5 YEAR ANNIVERSARY COIN FIRST CRYPTO STAMP MAILED 28th July 2017.           This commemorative coin has two holos...in the back is the private key for loaded BTC and also the seed for a metamask wallet for the NFT for this coin.        The front has a cypher stamp hologram wallet seed for an NFT for the first crypto stamp mailed and also the first digital crypto stamp.                     https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/47547307638365115358100910084148609067724816525689145601576702520541581410305                    (v)   Cypher Hodl Brass 2.75 inch                       Only 1 prototype made..              I made 3 shamirs secret coins with each one having its own individual share behind the hologram.
