But coming from a legend himself? really not hard to see that we might in the future hit that price point and all we can say is that Hal is correct.And this could be the very first prediction as well.",

But before anyone else had that idea that \"anything is possible\" for the price of Bitcoin, he already had that on his mind before everyone said that, and note that it was in the early days of Bitcoin.

I seriously doubt that Bitcoin adoption is that high. That 1 in 360 people fully switched to Bitcoin, or that 1/360 of all wealth was moved to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's price is purely determined by supply and demand. And we have very poor understanding of what drives the demand and supply. We want to believe that this is adoption and people are using Bitcoin, but how much of it is just speculation? Maybe long-term speculation, but still speculation.",

These type of predictions only matter when we actually do something about it, if we do not do anything about it then you can say it could be 30k or 300k or 3million, none of it would matter at all. I think it only important if you bet on it and make an investment regarding this and we should not really invest based on it. It would hurt your confidence on the long run if it goes high but to where you want. It should not be all that possible anytime soon, it definitely is a multi decade thing if possible. Should be important to have some reasonable amount as your goal.",

People get carried away with big numbers, although Hal wrote in what context he thinks such a price could be realized. But I also agree that it is completely unrealistic to expect that all the world's values can ever be transferred to Bitcoin, because then the whole world would become decentralized, which really seems like one big impossible mission. I think that Bitcoin will always be just an alternative to the existing system, and that most people will never accept it as an idea conceived by Satoshi. From my perspective, the average resident of the UK or US is still very attached to their national currency, let alone countries like China or India that have very negative attitudes towards anything they cannot control.However, if in xx years there will still be $, perhaps 1 BTC will really be worth a million or more, but the purchasing power of those millions may be ten or more times less than today.Regarding the comparison between Hal and Saylor, it should be taken into account that Hal wrote this at the very beginning of Bitcoin's existence, and Saylor says it today when some things are still much clearer than then.",

But it's my concern about this interior underdeveloped countries that still lacks technology. how will there know about Bitcoin and it's future what if in the next few decades everything depends on Bitcoin will such low tech countries still survive? That is exactly what makes me thing Bitcoin getting to world acceptance is a mission impossible or can not be possible it's just imagination.

Or it is not straightforward because nobody knows anyway, but if we assume that Bitcoin will reflect total household wealth one day, you would also have to adjust for the time factor and that wealth in the meantime is most likely to increase as well? Good question actually, I wonder what a recession could do to global total household wealth. \"Global wealth is expected to rise by 38% over the next five years, reaching USD 629 trillion by 2027\"This is what I mean. It is a report from the UBS and without conducting an in depth validity check here, the numbers are significantly increasing in a short amount of time. This would put Bitcoin at $30 million already if we consider the upper bound provided by UBS here and I guess long-term further increases would be expected.",
