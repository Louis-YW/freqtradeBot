      "body": "If, we refer to the FIFA rating that each of these teams has. obviously, the safest choice is to choose Ecuador in terms of betting.  besides having a FiFA ranking above the Qatar team, Ecuador also has long experience in the world cup event. flashback to Ecuador's statistics, Ecuador was able to overthrow Chile with a score of 0-2, hold Brazil to a 1-1 draw, hold Argentina to a 1-1 draw. on paper, Ecuador is superior to Qatar.On the other hand, Qatar is the home team. where they will play in front of their own public, the moral support of the fans will fill the stadiums to support the team from their country. Don't forget, Qatar is a 2019 Asian Cup finalist. They have a lot of naturalized players, although most of the naturalized players are from the Arabian peninsula.if we refer to the FIFA rating that Qatar has, the difference is not too far. Qatar is ranked 50th, Ecuador is ranked 44th. This means that the fight in this opening match will be quite balanced. I don't want to be reckless in predicting this opening match, because after all, the home team shouldn't be taken lightly.And yes, if we refer to the odds that each of these teams has. I am a little surprised, the available odds are not far apart. it is unlikely that the match will end in a draw, but it seems that it is the ideal choice. however, somehow I think Qatar will win this opening match.",

Qatar does not have a good number of notable players to face the South American side Ecuador in the opening game and we can't compare the past result of the past host of the world cup Russian and Brazil because the two teams have good players that are playing in big teams in Europe so it was easy for the two countries to win in their opening games another advantage they had was the countries they faced in their opening matches I think it's good to put that into consideration when analyzing the possibility of the host winning the opening games. On the other hand, I think Qatar will have a chance to win or draw Ecuador in the opening game following the home advantage they will be given as the host country and the joy and moral boost they will have as their fans will come out in mass to sing and play different instruments in their names, who knows if they have good players that will be showing their skills during this time we should not underrate them till the end of the game.",

I think that the bookies are so generous because they are hedging the mood of the fans who, for historical reasons, override the strength of the hosts. Plus, there is a risk that in this game the result will be the result of corruption and some secret agreements (like the very fact that this World Cup is held in Qatar).",

Their performance in recent times have not been very impressive, they lost two of three recent matches and drew one. But they shouldn't be underrated because the defeated teams like Ghana and Bulgaria. The Ecuador teams have not also been impressive because they couldn't win lowly FIFA rated teams like Iraq and Saudi Arabia, getting just draws in both matches. But they also won big African teams like Nigeria and Cape Verde. The host teams might not have a lot of experienced players but the have the zeal and the fans. The team would be desperate to prove that the country's investment in this World Cup is not in vain.",

Even if in the previous 10 World Cups the hosts won the first game, this does not mean that they will win the first game at the 11th World Cup. Secondly, earlier the hosts of the championships were generally strong and their positive results were natural. Now everything is decided by money and even such a weak country in terms of football as Qatar hosts the World Cup. They were able to buy themselves the right to host the World Cup, but can they buy at least some good result in the game?",
