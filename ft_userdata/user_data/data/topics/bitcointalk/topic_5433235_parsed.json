  "content": "Note: This thread will be closed soon, thanks for looking!My email had a surprise, a very scary looking email all in Russian, except I knew how to read the \"$40\". It seemed like obvious, dangerous phishing spam, but the \"raw data\" in the email headers showed it was sent from Stake's legit email address. The link leads to the actual Stake site, and I was already logged in, not needing to give out a password. Very odd, but a real nice little surprise:Did you recently get a $40 \"Russian Bonus\" from Stake?",

      "body": "Usually I do not click on these type of emails due to phishing tactics from hackers especially when it says claim a bonus from a casino site and makes you click a link. Because obviously they can and will see your login information and once clicked they can get your casino account's password quite easily when the person has it saved in the device's profile. Even an off chance of a keylogger being placed on the victim's device without them knowing can also be a likely scenario.Luckily I have the email address connected to this casino on an email address where I do not get notifications immediately so I completely missed the original email so did not click on anything to do with this bonus.I did see the following email 2.5 hours later and see it is a valid bonus email and claimed the $40.But a bonus given from a casino by a mistake made?It is quite confusing for those not knowing what this is about.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on January 06, 2023, 02:03:08 PM-snipped-So to that effect, I would say congratulations champ, enjoy you $40 mate, you might as well deserve it if we check the amount of money you've wagered.It seems that not everybody received this bonus email. As from their sportschat they are discussing about it as well and not everybody receives email's from stake or they completely blocked them for some reason or another. In regards to much spam of promotions?Who knows.Maybe there was a wagering requirement so to receive this amount in the bonus, as I am nearing $10k for the week of wagering.",

In the past few days I have been getting emails by Roobet offering free spins, I haven't taken any of those but maybe in the next one I will hit the bait. Look at swogerino's comment above. It seems like the bonus was only sent to people who have wagered and crossed a certain threshold. The bonus is not for anyone, and even I haven't received anything in my email regarding this $40 bonus. Also, I'm not expecting anything from Stake anyway as I'm not that active on betting this past year.

Luckily, someone confirmed that Stake indeed offer these bonuses and that he's in the clear. With all the hacks and scams going around lately, it won't hurt to be a skeptic.",
