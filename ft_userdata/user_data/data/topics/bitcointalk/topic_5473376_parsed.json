A properly moderated forum could work just fine.I think the forum would be a great place! This issue of spam, unwanted posts and the like is a false issue.Forums allow you to create private tabs, where only certain users can see and post. It is possible, with just \"a few clicks\", to create a tab dedicated to Bitcoin Devs, where only authorized users can post. The tab can even be visible to the general public, but only those who are authorized will be able to interact. Therefore, in this scenario, this issue of spam simply does not exist.I believe that if devs are really interested in using the forum as a means of communication, @theymos will be happy to create a space for them quickly.",

But one interesting thing mentioned is a \"forum\" they might evaluate. I think, among all the other options, this will be the better one if not the best.We are a living example that bitcointalk.org is still running, not only running but thriving, thanks to our moderator theymos. No doubt they should explore this option; yes, you will lose the \"email\" functionality, but at least it will live for quite some time. I think theymos should approach them if they are considering this option since they mentioned \"What about bitcointalk.org\"; we should welcome it.I hope it's not going to be Google Groups, at least. I feel this Google product is going to die soon.\"Finally, another option is to do literally nothing.\"That sounds like theymos, isn't it? Quote from: NotATether on November 09, 2023, 07:45:10 AMWhy not Bitcointalk uses its forum fund to run a mailman server?I don't think budget or running a mailman server is an issue but the issue is in its management (management of mailman server). It's already highlighted in theÂ  mail that managing a Mailman server, especially for a large and active mailing list like bitcoin-dev, can be a challenging task there many things that need no full time moderators not part-time moderators or volunteer members can do this job.",

Spam control needs to be proactive rather than reactive, or else you end up filling everyone's email inbox with hundreds of daily spam posts before they are trashed.Indeed, and I think that is partly why the mailing list has been able to be useful for so long.For a while, the mailing list was greylisted - anyone could send to the list, but people who hadn't posted before would have their mails held in a moderation queue before they were sent. Apparently issues with mailman2 have made the mailing list now a moderated only list, although they still permit a lot of stuff and it's basically just manual greylisting. The key thing is the fact that emails from new people are held while emails from \"approved users\" go through pretty quickly. This cuts down on the spam.However any system which requires pre-approving users before they can send anything will discourage many people from posting. With email, you don't know that your email might get moderated before you send it, but anything that requires approval before being able to even send will just result in fewer new people participating.The fact that email is universal is extremely beneficial. New people do post to the mailing list, and sometimes they have good ideas. I strongly prefer a mailing list for these technical discussions since it has a low barrier of entry. Everyone has an email, and everyone knows how to use one. There's no need to make a new account with yet another password. No need to have yet another website that you have to login to in order to read or respond to posts. The barrier of entry is low, and that's what we want so that fresh ideas can come in. Of course we need proactive moderation so that it doesn't become all spam. Mailing lists are perfect for that.Of course the last bit that makes everything hard is who is going to host it, where is it going to be hosted, and how will it be paid for. Running a mail server is not easy. It's extremely easy to get blacklisted and then the server is useless. The mailing list also has thousands of subscribers and apparently the existing self-hosted mailing list software just is not capable of dealing with it, or have significant other drawbacks. It's not just \"a bit of modification\", and just because there are developers involved doesn't mean that all software problems are solvable. mailman2 and mailman3 are complex projects with lots of issues, and the people working on Bitcoin aren't working on fixing those software since they're interested in working on Bitcoin. Even if the software were functional, who would host? Who would pay for servers? These are questions that are yet unanswered, and often have unsatisfactory solutions. Even now, it isn't the Linux Foundation that hosts the list. It's OSUOSL, a non-profit that helps open source projects. But they too have limited time and money.",

      "body": "QuoteHow does this Mailing List system work?Imagine you have some e-mail address. You can send mails to anyone you want. If there are just two people, then things are easy. Alice can send any message to Bob, and he can reply. The whole conversation history is preserved on their machines.Then, imagine you want to add more and more people into the conversation between Alice and Bob. There are three people, four people, then five, and then it can grow very large. So, what happens then?In that case, if there are 1000 participants in the whole conversation, then Alice don't want to send the same e-mail to 1000 recipients. It would take a lot of resources, if every member would need to send every message to everyone else. So, what happens then?Then, people create some mailing list. Which means, all of them send their replies just to a single e-mail address they agree on, and then, this single server is used to collect all of their messages, and to send them to all participants on the list. Also, it makes moderation easier, because if you have \"pure P2P e-mail with no mailing list\", then Mallory would know the whole list of participants, and could send them some spam. Then, each participant alone would receive it, and would need to manually handle that spam.So, in the larger communities, mailing lists are useful to manage some conversations via e-mail, between N people. And also, there is usually some kind of moderation, because if you include more and more people, then you need to filter some messages, to keep the whole conversation on a sufficiently high level.QuoteDoes person A send an email to person B, with a copy of the Mailing List email?It can do so. You can write to some person directly, to the mailing list, to both, or to none of them. You, as a sender, can decide, where to send it (you can send e-mails even to yourself-only, if you really want). And then, the recipient can decide, how to accept it. Some people accept only messages from some trusted circle of senders, some others can accept messages from everyone.QuoteThis email is then evaluated/moderated and approved or not. And that?Well, each recipient can deal with its own mailbox, as they please. Which means, you can be a member of some mailing list, but you can arbitrarily decide \"I don't want to read messages written by John Doe\". Or you can decide that \"I don't want to read this topic about Ordinals\". This is your choice, and you can just apply it to your message rules, and then it will be handled automatically by your mailbox.QuoteOr are all emails sent to the Mailing List, and then managed by moderation?Yes, this is also the case. In general, you can just let other people do the moderation, if this is sufficient for you. But you, as a recipient, can accept less messages, if that is your choice.",
