Because more CO2 in the atmosphere means more and better plant life. When plants grow in abundance, they reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere, automatically, because they use CO2 to grow. In return for this automatic reduction in CO2, plants give us more food and more oxygen to breathe and use in our vehicles >>> burned with gasoline... and in our coal fired generators.If this produces more global warming - which has not been proven for certain - it is good. More warming puts more water into the atmosphere, which gives us more H2O2 in the air, that destroys disease naturally... in us when we breathe it, and in our lakes and ponds when it goes in naturally through rain. In addition, a warming of the poles melts the ice somewhat, which makes water to flood the deserts (like the Sahara) so that there is more room for more population and food in plant and animal farming.One of the best ways that more CO2 helps is, it gets rid of the lying, global warming cabal... and the fertilizer companies. There is enough wealth of nutrients in the soil if used properly.There are loads of benefits to more CO2 in the atmosphere. The thing that is the problem is the other chemicals that are burned with the fossil fuels, and the incomplete burning of the fossil fuels themselves. Filtering these other chemicals out of the exhaust would help to produce purity in the atmosphere.",

How can reversible computing help us in that matter? I have only studied the laws of Thermodynamics applied to big objects and the reversible processes are very difficult to achieve in those instances (in reality), as I am sure you already know, I have only used it in idealized models.

Placing more CO2 into the atmosphere will make even more plants, even if the CO2 comes from burned plants.Plants and animals will adapt to warmer weather, if such a thing really happens. Remember, when there is more moisture in the air, it will reflect the sun's energy automatically, to keep the earth from becoming too hot. After all, such is what governments are doing with chemtrails right now, except they aren't using moisture to do it.If the oceans ever grew so high that the coastal lands were flooded, there are the deserts and northern lands that will become luscious gardens that people can move to. And there is seasteading.

I mentioned it in my post with the idea of filtering the bad chemicals out of the exhaust. However, you are right about electric vehicles producing pollution, if only from their production. One of the major problems from the EVs that most people never think about is the electric pollution. You can find reports of how electric wave energy is harmful to people.Quote from: jvanname on May 01, 2023, 01:06:53 PMIf people really cared about carbon emissions, they would use a cryptocurrency where the mining algorithm were designed to solve the most important scientific problem.

According to this law a reversible ideal machine has an efficiency which depends entirely on the difference of temperature between the heat source and the heat sink.That means that in order to increase the energy availability in transportation, the reversible computer must have a role beyond being simple control system in a vehicle (as conventional computers do nowadays), but rather reversible computers are supposed to be used to model and design the automobiles of the future which would likely not function operating an Otto or Diesel cycle but rather using another source of energy which would produce less entropy per Kilo Watt of output. I assume reversible computers won't need to have heat sinks attached to them, right? because their near perfect efficiency?",

Reversible computation matters little on EV.The current challenges are the following:- Providing carbon neutral or carbon negative energy in an economic, sustainable and technically viable way.- Enhancing the electrical grid. It takes very long to add significant capacity to the electric network and connecting it.- Technical enhancements to battery duration and charging time. It simply takes too long to charge for a long travel.- Production of EVs, as factories or old vehicles would be basically a loss in financial terms by obsolescence. Many car producers would find themselves with useless factories.- Creating a charging points infrastructure. A slot for 6 cars takes around 1 MVA. Quite a lot.You see... you do not need to understand muons for this.",

I have always dreamt of living in an environment where there will be zero emissions and electric vehicles were my number one option. But this video is making me scared that EVs are not safe. In my country where the fire service is not too effective, this will be a disaster. I am also imagining this EV fire outbreak in the tight traffic jam in most cities in my country. I believe this issue is just an electric fault that will be corrected by the manufacturers as soon as possible because I am beginning to think that living in a world of Zero emissions is a mirage.Quote from: Jet Cash on May 01, 2023, 01:00:23 PMYou are forgetting the polution generated from the manufacture and distribution of new cars, and the poillution resulting from over complex engines that drivers can no longer maintain themselves, or afford to have garages maintain then. I drive a 1988 Volvo 740, and several reports state that it will take 20  years or more of my driving to equal the pollution created as a result oif the manufacture of one mid range Tesla. That doesn't include to pollution and damage resulting from the generation of the electricity to power it.I see!!! Modern technology is hypocritical, it destroys more than it claims it could fix.",

They obviously aren't as eco-friendly as they're being advertised.Quote from: Hispo on April 28, 2023, 03:11:37 PM when you coming back with the load of candies and other supplies, you find your new EV being completely consumed by flames because either you had a faulty battery or someone parked next did.At least the groceries weren't inside. You have something to eat your sorrows away They are not as eco friendly as we are told most of the time. Obviously, in order to make new cars in an industrial scale a lot of fuel is supposed to be burnt and also many tonnes or raw material extracted from the environment. If you look on the internet about the environmental impacts of Lithium extraction/mining you will find out what I am talking about, also if I recall correctly, Lithium is not easy to recycle as Copper or Iron, it is more complex and expensive. So the idea of the EV adoption in the short term is to make them even though they are not eco friendly, so in the future when we manage to efficiently get rid of gas and coal generation facilities, people can move around using that clean energy. On the other hand, I would not be surprised if some politicians in USA and Even China were receiving some good money from battery companies and car makers, though.",

A lot of these mines are in African countries so the large battery manufacture don't have to bear the burden of paying for safety measures.",

It is grossly inefficient to chop down ancient forests using diesel powered equipoment, and then after chipping, transport it across the ocean in ships burning the incredibly polluting bunker fuel. Those chips are then burnt in generators like Drax, which is the most polluting plant in England. The electricity is then distributed via cables with a loss of power as it is distributed. It is then used to charge batteries with a further loss of power, and the batteries are used to propel vehicles, and yes, there is even more loss of power. It is far more effiucient and less polluting to generate the motive power directly in a vehicle with an internal combustion engine, Especially if nano-particle combining addiutives are present in the petrol.I am starting to see a move away from virtue signalling with electric cards, as people start to realise they are accelerating global warming, and the destruction of gardens to provide charging spaces reduces cxarbon sequestration. What will happen to all those electric vans that boast about their electricity  consumption, when their customers and the public realise that they are contributing to blackouts and increased domestic electricitty prices.",
