Also being a moderator is not all about cleaning the chat but answering specific question from members since you can’t setup a bot that knows every question available.Seeing a telegram chat room without a real human bot seems like a dead community to me because the team can’t even hire a stuff to handle simple task instead rely on both with very limited function.",

Therefore the community still needs human moderators but still uses bots as moderation.",
