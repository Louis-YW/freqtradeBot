  "content": "Looking to purchase old vintage Nintendo(NES) and Super Nintendo(SNES) (ntsc only)games. Also, might be interested in the systems too. Everything is negotiable depending upon the price and whether it works or not. I'm not interested in non-working games or systems. Post what you have and i'll pm those who have something I might be interested in. Anyone whom I strike a deal with will have to wait for payment until item is received and is verified in working condition unless you are well known. I will pay up front to members I trust. Shipping is on me as well. Let me know what you have and what you are looking to get for it.",

      "body": "I still have my original Nintendo I received as a gift back in the 80s.  I would never part with it though.  I'll admit that there's been more than one occasion when some drinking led to challenges of Tecmo Bowl (I never lose) or a few Super Off Road races.  I may even find myself playing a game of Mike Tyson's Punch Out here and there.  I think I lost the 4-player adapter and most of my other accessories, but it's possible I may have a power pad (the thing you ran on) or a power glove (the controller you wear like a glove) sitting around that I am not very fond of.  No idea what these go for, but if it's a decent amount I could go digging through the attic...  I'm guessing eBay is probably full of this stuff for cheap though.",

The accessories aren't really anything I would use. You might be surprised at the value of some of the games man. I've seen certain games on the SNES go for 300$ if in good condition and have box and instructions. Of course, only a select few titles are worth that.",

I'm not dumb enough to give my real address, just so you people know. He has been online all day as well and his all is what1005. Maybe a tag for fake trades?I'm ok with someone not wanting to deal, but communication is all it takes. User has been messaged twice on telegram and I clearly see him online all day, so it is what it is.",
