  "content": "5 years ago or February 25, 2018 was the first pizza purchase using Bitcoin in lightning network by Laszlo Hanyecz, that's make me interested for me to buy a pizza using Bitcoin in lightning network too. Then I search a pizza restaurant which accept Bitcoin payment, however they only accept Bitcoin on-chain network. Actually I can just pay it since I have Bitcoin on-chain network, but I take a challenge for only pay in lightning network. Surprisingly they're still don't know the existence of lightning network, it took me for 10-15 minutes to explain them and ask to install a lightning network wallet e.g. Bluewallet since this wallet is really easy to use. So I ordered a pizza with black olive topping, it's cost for $6 or 25,740 Satoshis. When I have pay it, they're quite shocking because the fee is very very low. After that, they saying they have a plan to accept Bitcoin in lightning network payment because it will help the customer to not get charged for higher fees and they do get the same benefit too. Have you ever bought a pizza using Bitcoin in lightning network?",

Pay $2 and be recorded in the historyÂ  Quote from: Helena Yu on February 25, 2023, 02:54:34 PMHave you ever bought a pizza using Bitcoin in lightning network? I would feel happy if I could pay for pizza with Bitcoin. I don't have the chance here to use bitcoin for daily necessities as I live in a country where Bitcoin isn't legal. A lot people don't even know the existence of Bitcoin.",

Why is the BTC-community still not doing a similar flash mob? Are there few pizzerias that accept bitcoin?I think this pizzeria could make a small discount and round up the price to 20.000 Satoshis in honor of this day. Maybe they just didn't know nothing about Laszlo pizza?",

I thought only whoever owns the node can do the transaction. My first Bitcoin usage was on an online casino website. But I didn't purchase anything with bitcoin before 2021. I bought some kind of subscription from a reseller and he was accepting bitcoin. I paid him via coinbase transaction. After that, I bought many things from online using Bitcoin as payment method. Not all of them are companies, Some resellers accept bitcoin. But, I will try lightning network. Not sure if they will accept lightning network or not. Let's give it a try.",

It is good that you had the opportunity to spend BTC and you took it, there are so many people who want to spend BTC but they cannot because of where they live. BTC is a currency and and i believe in the future people would be able to spend it from anywhere in the world. I hope you enjoyed your pizza and i would like to read more stories from other members on how they spent their BTC.",

But anyway, congratulations on your first pizza purchase using BTC in the LN upon purchasing. This is an exciting moment for you and for the BTC community as a whole, I remember Pizza day.By using the LN to purchase pizza, you have demonstrated the power and potential of this revolutionary technology. The LN is a second-layer solution that enables near-instant transactions with low fees, making it an ideal solution for microtransactions like buying a pizza or even coffee. As more businesses and merchants adopt BTC using LN, it becomes increasingly viable as a mainstream currency. You have made a meaningful contribution to the BTC community that becomes an inspiration to adopt BTC using LN transactions.",

Topic title is saying that Lightning Network was used for purchase but from your post it looks like you paid with Bitcoin mainnet.Lightning Network can be a bit confusing for newbies with all different custodial wallets, now we have Blue wallet temporary removing Lightning Network (temporary).Â  Maybe you can clarify this and tell us what wallet you used for sending this payment.Quote from: Helena Yu on February 25, 2023, 02:54:34 PMHave you ever bought a pizza using Bitcoin in lightning network?
