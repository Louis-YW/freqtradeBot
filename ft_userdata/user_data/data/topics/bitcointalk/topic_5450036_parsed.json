Friends have the same colors and feathers that's what they say but if from the beginning you already know this friend of yours will likely cheat, then it's not worth partnering a business with him. You guys can be very good friends and surely you must have known the character of your friend and your friend must have also known yours. So, it's fine that friends go into business because they will synergize with the same spirit and friendship and make the business successful. But what happens is that ones it comes to business, there is nothing like friendship or family, everything should be documented and agreement made in a legal form. The document should capture the responsibilities and the sharing of profits. Every thing should be spelt out correctly before you start business with your friend, or even your brother. That understanding that relationship is different from business will keep the business going.If you go into business with your friendly blindly, there must be some problems in the future, either from you or your friend or relatives.",

Prioritize careful selection by considering factors such as their financial stability, integrity, and alignment with your business goals. Conduct thorough due diligence on potential partners, including reviewing their financial history, creditworthiness, and business experience. It's essential to establish a legal and financial relationship, so opt for partners who are reliable and trustworthy. Avoid giving a single individual sole access to funds, particularly the bank account, to mitigate risks and ensure financial security.",

If you have ever gone into business with a friend, what were your biggest concerns and how did work through it. Like many things in life, stress, greed or close proximity can bring out traits in people that you have never seen before. You better be damn sure that you know the person you're going into business with very well, even then it is liable to end up in disaster. There have been circumstances where it has worked for people in the past, it takes a very narrow set of the right ingredients, but what you don't hear about as much as the many failures and falling outs that have occurred. Disputes about money or whether people are contributing the same non-monetary inputs can put huge strains on relationships, so you'd probably be better off not going into business with people that you really want to remain close to.",

I have always thought that starting a business with a friend is a bad idea, in theory everything should be about being as efficient as possible and increase your profits margin, but when friendship is on the way things are never that simple as now you have to care about how the other person may take your criticism regarding something they did wrong, considerations you will never have to take were that person be a stranger which you just hired to do a job for you.",

As you have said their many people that do join business with their friends and both due succeed  without betraying each other and are also many to that did and betrayed. we should know that all human beings cannot have perfect mind and with that they can't be all truthful.but all it requires is trust, once you are able to study your friend well and found he/she with truthful character and you believe it will be very hard for someone to convince he/she away from the truth line,why will I be afraid of doing business with such person?as for me i believe much about many friends I have because their character toward make me, make me believe much in them that they can't betrayed me on any way but they may surely be some among them that may have bad mind ooo but I never witness that habit from them any of them because I don't make much friends and even before we agree on any business there are will be agreements between both of us.some people say trust nobody, but we need to trust some one in order to make some our ways easier.",

This happened about 10 years ago or so when I was a lot more younger and obviously a lot less experienced, but when we started it, it was a simple idea that couldn't really go anywhere, and yet he believed that we could start there and make it to the top, like literally dreaming to become a billionaire one day. Its great to feel like that and work hard, but he was lazy at the same time and focused too much into the future and not about today. Which meant that he lacked working today, and always dreamed about whats to come, which ended up resulting with us losing what we have, and not have a better future at all.",

Every advantage has a disadvantage; some businesses succeeded through partnerships with friends and family, while others failed due to a lack of trust.Trust is the most important issue that is causing problems in various businesses, which is why it is important to have a signed agreement with a lawyer to avoid trust issues in a business so that it ends well.",

It only centers on the chances that your friend won't run away with company funds but, don't say much about managing or running a business.Though, it is important that, one have a steady cash flow so as to be able to separate himself from the business. We know business is a separate entity of its own, it ought to take care of itself while, you can benefit from the profits it generates after settling all that need be in running the business, encroaching would lead to some gradual decline for sure.But again, before going into a partnership business with anyone, it must be someone you've really known all about and your sure could separate himself from the business. That's just how your likely to have a successful business and you shouldn't leave all the managing to your partner. The business should operate a double signatory account and ensure you get mails on happenings within the business and finance.",

If you have ever gone into business with a friend, what were your biggest concerns and how did work through it. If friends have been entrusted as a whole in building a business, then absolutely no worries will arise in our hearts, I mean if this decision is unanimous, of course we have thought carefully about what we will receive. There doesn't have to be a negative side in our minds towards colleagues, where we have to trust each other in order to create a form of harmony in building a business.In this option, there are indeed many that we meet out there where the closest friends can destroy you and this is certainly based on several factors, most likely there is no equal distribution when the company gets profits, even when it loses, we blame him as an actor in the company's failure. That should not happen in building a business, everything must be in accordance with whatever results are recorded each year.",
