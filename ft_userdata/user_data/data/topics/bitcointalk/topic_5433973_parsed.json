      "body": "You need consensus from several parties for people to follow your HF. I don't think miners can \"activate a hardfork\", if by \"activate\" we describe it as something that is actually functional (because anyone is free to hardfork at any time). So in practice, MAHF is not a thing. And I would argue other variants aren't as well. There is either consensus of miners, users and developers, or there isn't anything functional, the way I see it is that the method how it \"activates\" is not that relevant.",

Whenever there is a fork (whether hard or soft) a consensus needs to be reached among all of these groups even though some have more influence than others. If there is no consensus (MAHF, MASF, UASF, UAHF,...) the risk of chain-split grows hence these could be considered attacks on Bitcoin principles.That is why the result of such actions are always considered a shitcoin like bitcoin-cash that was created using MAHF.",

Proposal generated2. Code changes made to show what the proposal will do3. Miners asked to signal their cooperation in the upgrade4. UAF only goes ahead once a majority of the hashing power is dedicated to the change (only needs to be 50% but 90-95% is normally reached pretty fast iirc after the first few signal to accept it).Because it's being discussed, segwit was a soft fork and was activated as one at the time because there was a consensus of miners.The chain split to bcash was probably both a miner activated hard fork of bitcoin and a user activated one as bitcoin became incompatible with it immediately (at least because they had replay protection) but needed both miners (verifiers) and nodes (propagators) to make the new chain.",

It's debatable that UASF was \"nothing\", because it wasn't just \"nothing\". It had its role in the activation of Segwit. Eric Lombrozo and Luke Dashjr supported it.What was truly nothing was the 2X part. It probably had only verbal support from the signers of the New York Agreement, the fork that had very very little support/no support. In fact it was rejected by the community, plebs, influential Bitcoin people, and some Core Developers. The code for \"bc1\" was also buggy.",

Reaching consensus is rather a marketing like talent, even though I (and he) could be wrong. What's needed for a network to reach consensus, is to spread the word. Unarguably there was consensus reached for the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, and it really doesn't matter how it emerged (UAHF, MAHF), especially when miners are themselves users.

What can not be disputed is the fact that like any other soft-fork miners started signalling for the change through S2X (verifiable on blockchain since it is reflected in block versions and coinbase scripts) and when the signalling surpassed the threshold, SegWit was locked in and was activated later.I personally don't accept that 10% of nodes (not miners) signalling UASF forced anything on miners. Things were a lot more complicated than that, we had people in social media pressuring miners, we had the largest spam attack in bitcoin history taking place making everyone angry (except miners I suppose), there were big businesses that used bitcoin pressuring miners, there were scammers like bcash people trying to threaten chain split with Bitmain turning into a P.I.A. with their support of \"chain splitters\", ... Most of these things can be found in the news sites and on reddit and on this forum but I haven't seen anybody writing a full post mortem yet.",
