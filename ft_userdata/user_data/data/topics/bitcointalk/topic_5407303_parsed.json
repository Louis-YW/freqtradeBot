More details recap coming soon.SWOPTCOIN (SWOPT)❗️BetaKEY FEATURESSwoptcoin (SWOPT) is the native social token of the Swopter platform. The platform implements create-and-earn and engage-and-earn mechanics through which users can earn tokens and use in platform.The SWOPT distributed peer-to-peer network provides a solid foundation for the Swopter platform ecosystem of 100 million tokens. SWOPT is a hybrid utility/payment token. THREE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF SWOPTCOINThe measure of valuePayment instrumentMeans of accumulation PURPOSE OF THE TOKENFast peer-to-peer transactionsWorldwide paymentsLow processing fees SWOPTER'S GOVERNANCE MODEL - A TWO-PHASE PLANETo build an enduring governance model, Swopter - Swoptcoin (SWOPT) will pursue a two-phase plan. PROVISIONAL GOVERNANCE MODEL (< 1M MEMBERS)Until the network hits a critical mass of 1M members, Swopter - Swoptcoin (SWOPT) will operate under a provisional governance model. This model will most closely resemble “off-chain” governance models currently employed by protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Swopter’s Core Team playing an important role in guiding the development of the protocol. However Swopter’s Core Team will still rely heavily on the input of the community. The Swopter application itself is where Swopter’s core team has been soliciting community input and engaging with users. Swopter embraces community critiques and suggestions, which is implemented by the open-for-comments features of Swopter’s landing page, FAQs and white paper. Whenever people browse these materials on Swopter’s websites, they can submit comment on a specific section right there to ask for questions and make suggestions. Offline Pioneer meetups that Swopter’s core team have been organizing will also be an important channel for community input. Additionally, Swopter’s Core Team will develop more formal governance mechanics. One potential governance system is liquid democracy. In liquid democracy, every Pioneer will have the ability to either vote on an issue directly or to delegate their vote to another member of the network. Liquid democracy would allow for both broad and efficient membership from Swopter’s community. SWOPTER - SWOPTCOIN (SWOPT) - (> 1M MEMBERS) Upon hitting 1M members, a provisional committee will be formed based on previous contributions to the Swopter Social Network. This committee will be responsible for soliciting and proposing suggestions from and to the wider community. It will also organize a series of online and offline conversations where Swopter’s members can evaluate the long-term vision for Swopter's future development. Given Swopter’s global user base, the Swopter Social Network will conduct these conventions at multiple locations across the world to ensure accessibility.In addition to hosting in-person conventions, Swopter will also use its social network as a platform for allowing Swopter’s member to participate in the process remotely. Whether in-person or online, Swopter’s community members will have the ability to participate in the crafting Swopter’s long-term governance structure. ROADMAP / DEPLOYMENT PLANPHASE 1. TOKEN DISTRIBUTIONThe Swoptcoin (SWOPT) server acts as a emulating the behavior of a decentralized system as it will function after its operation. During this phase, improvements and changes in user interface and system are possible and relatively easy to make compared to the stable phase of the main network. All coin distribution for users will be transferred to the live network after its launch. The live net will pre-mount in its genesis to block all account holders balances created during Phase 1, and continue to work in the same way as the completely decentralized system. Swoptcoin (SWOPT) does not appear on third-party exchanges during this stage, and it is impossible to buy Swoptcoin (SWOPT) with any other currency on third-party exchanges.PHASE 2. TEST NETWORKBefore starting the main network, the host software will be deployed to the test network. The test network uses the exact same trust schedule as the main network. The Swopter team will host multiple nodes on the test network but will encourage more newcomers to launch their own nodes on the test network. In fact, in order for any node to join the main network, they are advised to start with the test network. The test network will be run parallel with the Swoptcoin (SWOPT) emulator at the first stage and periodically. For example, the results of both systems will be compared daily to catch the gaps and misses of the test network. It will allow Swopter developers to propose and implement corrections. After a thorough parallel launch of both systems, testnet will reach a state where its results will be consistent with the emulator. When the community will be ready, Swoptcoin (SWOPT) will move on to the next step.PHASE 3. MAIN NETWORKWhen the community will come to an understanding that the software is ready for production and it has been thoroughly tested on the test network, the official mainnet of the Swoptcoin (SWOPT) network will be launched. An important detail is that during the transition to the main thing, only accounts confirmed to be belonging to real people will not be restricted. After that, the Swoptcoin SWOPT Phase 1 network emulator will be closed, and the system will continue to work independently forever. Future protocol updates will be presented by the Swopter community and the core Swoptcoin (SWOPT) team. Their implementation and deployment will depend on the nodes updating the mining software, like other blockchains. No central authority will control the currency, and it will be completely decentralized. The remains of fake users or duplicate users will be discarded. This is the phase during which Swoptcoin SWOPT can be connected to exchanges. NODESComing soon The SWOPTER: SWOPTCOIN (SWOPT) ECONOMIC MODELComing soon HOW TO MINE SWOPTCOIN (SWOPT)?The Swopter platform implements the mechanics of creating-and -earning and engaging-and-earning.It's simple and intuitive.

Yea, I am with you on that.... I was a moderator for a Crypto forum that also tried that... and people simply ignored that \"pay for access\" features, because there were simply not enough incentive to pay for the extra features. I see someone already grabbed the \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" premium member name.      Well, in any way... the site looks good enough on the demo account for me to try out on my own account.  I see the \"Crypto Lottery\" feature is blocked.... which is a pity... I would like to try it.",
