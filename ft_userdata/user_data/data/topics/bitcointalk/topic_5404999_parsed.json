      "body": "In your chat with live support, did they give you any explanation why it was voided? There's probably a rule in there that Sportsbet can still void active bets in case of player retirement (subject to a refund). I think it's fair play not to return the bets that were already lost before the match was voided (under 18.5 already lost by the end of second set just like what @eternad said).",

Voiding unfinished game is the most common to handle this kind of situation but I have no idea if the parlay it belong will be voided too or payout without the odds of voided game.Although I’m unsure if the whole parlay is right to be voided for this result since this fall under special cases but still it depends on the terms and condition of the casino with regards to there game will govern on this matter.Give us an update about the support reply and I’m sure sportsbet owner will answer here once they see this.",

      "body": "I have read the topic. First of all congrats for your betslip that has won. You are complaining about Sportsbet.io's decision but you could have understood the reason if you read the rules. If the mentioned tennis player didn't withdraw from the game he had a possibility of winning the set by 5-7. If this possibility got real then your +4.5 handicapped bet was going to lose and the bet wouldn't be concluded terminatively. Because of this, your +4.5 handicapped bet wasn't valid and -4.5 handicapped bets have also been cancelled at the same time.If the -4.5 handicapped bets are cancelled and the +4.5 handicapped bets are paid then this would make the website be in loss. The rule related to the reason for the finalization of the under 18.5 bet and the ending of the bet terminatively is here:",

You should provide too there screenshot to make sure your supporting evidence is legit. I have no idea on sportsbet ToS on deciding for the result for this kind of games but there’s always a special note on casino ToS that they have the right to void the bet with such event.What I understand on the case of under 18.5 was the bet is already lose regardless if the game still continues or not  while in your case, there’s a chance that you can still lose your bet  if the player didn’t retired earlier since the retired player has a chance to score more and close the gap to erase your margin.If I'm not wrong this is the rule being applied to the OP's issue.

From my experience, the game handicaps are usually voided except for certain markets which could vary between sportsbooks as they have a different set of rules for tennis. I guess it's a different case with the totals as I remember Sportsbet tends to settle the total bet early before the match ends.",

It is not justiceWell I understand your problem and perhaps the best thing that you can do is read carefully the terms of use because each gambling casinos have their own terms to follow. I am not a regular bettor on that casino and perhaps those who are regular players there will answer your question. Another option is to contact their forum representative, sportsbet.io[1], he was active last July 1 at this month and perhaps he will answer your question. The last option is to chat in their chatroom on that casino or leave your post on their ANN thread given above the link.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=832366",

In their rules, there's a specific reason to void a bet and your bet might fall on that category again better to confirm this privately first.
