If you want to contribute, a great way to do so is to test open source software for busy devs. Finding bugs, or even giving general feedback, helps figure out the roadmap for their software.Quote from: peterwwwrowing on March 07, 2024, 12:43:40 PMIs there other ways to contribute? (Any Android phone options?)I have Blixt Wallet, Zeus Wallet, and Phoenix Wallet on Android. The first two are for power users, the last is for newbies who just want good UX.",

Running full node on Android generally isn't feasible option, while there are already many full node running on various data centers (e.g. AWS). Besides, you don't have to force yourself to contribute to Bitcoin network. But other than that, how about donate to Bitcoin-related project?",

To contribute, you can run a Bitcoin full node that does not need to run 24/7. It is perfect if you can manage your full node operation 24/7 but with less time, your full node contribution is still meaningful for the network by verifying blocks and transactions.[Guide] How to run a Bitcoin Core full node for under 50 bucks!.",

This is probably the best way for the average person to contribute. Help educate others. Sure most of the people are gonna call you a crypto bro or something stupid like that (though maybe that is more just over the internet rather in person), but every single time you convince someone to start owning bitcoin, you not only help out the network a tiny tiny bit, you also help one person. Just make sure you tell them to start owning bitcoin not in a bull market, as they will probably be mad at you for two years if you convince them to buy bitcoin this year.",
