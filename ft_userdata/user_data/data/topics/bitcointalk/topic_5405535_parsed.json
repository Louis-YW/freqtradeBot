      "body": "though most of the art is sending a message. each person has different preferences.for me art has to send a message/story but also be very detailed,  where there is so much going on that it surprises you every time you see it by noticing something new, even after looking at it multiple timesthis is a good example of what i mean about the detail stuff where lots of things are happening where you notice new things every time (the middle and right canvas's)also i see a alot more effort and time and work went into these styles of art so id be willing if i ever bought art to put more money towards art like this compared to the simple \"poster\" format art.. but thats just my preference and thoughtsi know others like ones that are more 'poster' form where its a simple in your face message.. each to their own i say. art is for those viewing it. everyone has different tastes.as for the 'simple message' format artworks i personally prefer the ones where the message is not a word format (like a poster) but using symbolic imagery using known common reference/trends.. EG(note this is not commissioned artwork. its a quick mock display to show a demo of a message without words)",

I remember this artist because he has a profile on this forum and I know that I posted in some of his first threads.Besides Hal Finney, there are identical portraits of Dorian Nakamoto & Nick Szabo.",

      "body": "I would vouch for Poletti as well, but predominantly for the artwork without text but just hidden symbols and meanings.  I find mysterious artwork to be the most fascinating for me compared to basic artwork like an object with a phrase around it.  On the other hand, the latter is more 'dumb-proof' as in they can be understood without much thinking and contemplation.  Maybe for interior design of a bar a text artwork may fit more.  It is like a T-Shirt, you get the idea and the meaning way faster than contemplating secrets of a mysterious art.-Regards,PrivacyG",

Nanu Berks was another we interviewed after they did an exhibit in France, Argentinian IIRC. Also to note they were part of a broader movement back then (the yellow jackets in France) so I dig those kinds of art and activism. And Bitcoin spoke loudly for them.",
