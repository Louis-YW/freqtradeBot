A - Can we see the message indicating three three simultaneous pic malfunctions? B - What is the voltage across the first and the last pins of the PIC?The chances of three simultaneous PIC malfunctions are pretty miniscule, a better explanation is that the control board is not supplying the voltage it should to activate the PICs it needs to communicate with.P.S. We call the code a PIC runs \"the HEX\" and the code the controls board runs \"the Firmware\"(even though technically they are both correct terms for both devices).Yes, is it weird.1. Damaged Control Board  - Shorted enable signal (EN) to GND from SoC to TL5209 (3V3 regulator) and damaged nand flash ( i have dump from another control board S19j pro ) - (MAC address is not stored in nand flash) so i replaced soc and nand flash and control board boot up correctly.2. Then control board  couldn't read data from eeprom on hashboards, ARC tester, i tryed REVELPROG-IS bud same result, cannot connect to eeprom.So i changed eeprom and writed \"s19j pro data\" from my backup.3. third problem, control board couldn't read data from pic controller. I de-solder PIC and same issue as eeprom, couldn't read data from PIC. I have PIC HEX backup from S19 PRO and S19. But i don't know if HEX files are same as S19j PRO.EDIT:Here is a log:Code:[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu[    0.000000] Linux version 3.8.13+ (jenkins@nomd-nomd-fwc-bj) (gcc version 4.9.4 (Linaro GCC 4.9-2017.01) ) #28 SMP Tue Jun 22 17:32:38 CST 2021[    0.000000] CPU: ARMv7 Processor [413fc082] revision 2 (ARMv7), cr=50c5387d[    0.000000] CPU: PIPT / VIPT nonaliasing data cache, VIPT aliasing instruction cache[    0.000000] Machine: Generic AM33XX (Flattened Device Tree), model: TI AM335x BeagleBone[    0.000000] Memory policy: ECC disabled, Data cache writeback[    0.000000] On node 0 totalpages: 65280[    0.000000] free_area_init_node: node 0, pgdat c05d9000, node_mem_map c0631000[    0.000000]   Normal zone: 512 pages used for memmap[    0.000000]   Normal zone: 0 pages reserved[    0.000000]   Normal zone: 64768 pages, LIFO batch:15[    0.000000] AM335X ES1.0 (neon )[    0.000000] PERCPU: Embedded 8 pages/cpu @c083e000 s9856 r8192 d14720 u32768[    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: s9856 r8192 d14720 u32768 alloc=8*4096[    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: [0] 0 [    0.000000] Built 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.  Total pages: 64768[    0.000000] Kernel command line: console=ttyO0,115200n8 init=/sbin/init[    0.000000] PID hash table entries: 1024 (order: 0, 4096 bytes)[    0.000000] Dentry cache hash table entries: 32768 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)[    0.000000] Inode-cache hash table entries: 16384 (order: 4, 65536 bytes)[    0.000000] __ex_table already sorted, skipping sort[    0.000000] allocated 524288 bytes of page_cgroup[    0.000000] please try 'cgroup_disable=memory' option if you don't want memory cgroups[    0.000000] Memory: 255MB = 255MB total[    0.000000] Memory: 245448k/245448k available, 16696k reserved, 0K highmem[    0.000000] Virtual kernel memory layout:[    0.000000]     vector  : 0xffff0000 - 0xffff1000   (   4 kB)[    0.000000]     fixmap  : 0xfff00000 - 0xfffe0000   ( 896 kB)[    0.000000]     vmalloc : 0xd0800000 - 0xff000000   ( 744 MB)[    0.000000]     lowmem  : 0xc0000000 - 0xd0000000   ( 256 MB)[    0.000000]     pkmap   : 0xbfe00000 - 0xc0000000   (   2 MB)[    0.000000]     modules : 0xbf800000 - 0xbfe00000   (   6 MB)[    0.000000]       .text : 0xc0008000 - 0xc053f674   (5342 kB)[    0.000000]       .init : 0xc0540000 - 0xc0571680   ( 198 kB)[    0.000000]       .data : 0xc0572000 - 0xc05d9ee0   ( 416 kB)[    0.000000]        .bss : 0xc05d9ee0 - 0xc0630448   ( 346 kB)[    0.000000] Hierarchical RCU implementation.[    0.000000]  RCU restricting CPUs from NR_CPUS=4 to nr_cpu_ids=1.[    0.000000] NR_IRQS:16 nr_irqs:16 16[    0.000000] IRQ: Found an INTC at 0xfa200000 (revision 5.0) with 128 interrupts[    0.000000] Total of 128 interrupts on 1 active controller[    0.000000] OMAP clockevent source: GPTIMER1 at 24000000 Hz[    0.000000] sched_clock: 32 bits at 24MHz, resolution 41ns, wraps every 178956ms[    0.000000] OMAP clocksource: GPTIMER2 at 24000000 Hz[    0.000000] Console: colour dummy device 80x30[    0.000347] Calibrating delay loop... 545.07 BogoMIPS (lpj=531968)[    0.015449] pid_max: default: 32768 minimum: 301[    0.015676] Security Framework initialized[    0.015768] Mount-cache hash table entries: 512[    0.024279] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuacct[    0.024311] Initializing cgroup subsys memory[    0.024373] Initializing cgroup subsys blkio[    0.024506] CPU: Testing write buffer coherency: ok[    0.025012] CPU0: thread -1, cpu 0, socket -1, mpidr 0[    0.025086] Setting up static identity map for 0x8030a500 - 0x8030a54c[    0.026452] Brought up 1 CPUs[    0.026475] SMP: Total of 1 processors activated (545.07 BogoMIPS).[    0.027751] devtmpfs: initialized[    0.091410] pinctrl core: initialized pinctrl subsystem[    0.091663] rstctl core: initialized rstctl subsystem[    0.092133] regulator-dummy: no parameters[    0.092632] NET: Registered protocol family 16[    0.093296] DMA: preallocated 256 KiB pool for atomic coherent allocations[    0.102711] pinctrl-single 44e10800.pinmux: prop pinctrl-0 index 0 invalid phandle[    0.102884] pinctrl-single 44e10800.pinmux: 142 pins at pa f9e10800 size 568[    0.103932] platform 49000000.edma: alias fck already exists[    0.103963] platform 49000000.edma: alias fck already exists[    0.103988] platform 49000000.edma: alias fck already exists[    0.105108] gpiochip_add: registered GPIOs 0 to 31 on device: gpio[    0.105330] OMAP GPIO hardware version 0.1[    0.106664] gpiochip_add: registered GPIOs 32 to 63 on device: gpio[    0.107963] gpiochip_add: registered GPIOs 64 to 95 on device: gpio[    0.109425] gpiochip_add: registered GPIOs 96 to 127 on device: gpio[    0.109940] of_get_named_gpio_flags exited with status 52[    0.109969] gpio-rctrl rstctl.3: loaded OK[    0.114835] omap-gpmc 50000000.gpmc: GPMC revision 6.0[    0.118078] hw-breakpoint: debug architecture 0x4 unsupported.[    0.119975] cpsw.0: No hwaddr in dt.
