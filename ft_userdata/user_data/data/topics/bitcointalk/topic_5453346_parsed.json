  "content": "Hello, how can one research where whales are putting their cryptocurreny into using blockchain scanners like bscscan? My concerns are, if you have located some cryptocurrency token that noteable significant whales have already made transfers to within the past few days, what does that mean? I would assume if they have already made transfers of large amounts of cryptocurrency tokens into the target token then it's too late for retail investors to invest in that token because the whales would have moved the market up already? I assume when the whales make transfers from one crypto token to another, the market value of the targeted token rises immediately if the quantity of token invested is significant?",

I assume when the whales make transfers from one crypto token to another, the market value of the targeted token rises immediately if the quantity of token invested is significant?No, and no, it does not behave like that. Transferring tokens does not directly affect the market price movements. If someone buys or sells tokens in an enormous amount of quantity, it is expected the market will immediately be moved, especially if it is a low market cap token. That is just how the basic market works, but sending or receiving won't involve a direct market action.If you are looking for market movement from the blockchain, you can take a look at the \"DEX trades\" tab of the Etherscan site. You must choose to visit the token's smart contract first. For example, https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#tokenTrade. I believe any other block explorers would have such an option.",

What kind of addresses whould I be looking for and where to find the smart contract section?",

Example this is the rich list of Ethereum holders https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/ethereum/richlist/ but keep an eye there are some address have a tag like \"Binance 7\" \"Smart contract\" \"Bridge\" etc, this belongs to exchange or controlled by few peoples, not a whale. If the address don't have any tag, then it's high likely belong to a whale.",

Would this lead onto something else?Did you actually clicked on that link which was included in my post?If you clicked on it like I said before it will redirect you see a total amount burnt, sent to exchanges and even those that goes to a personal wallet. I don't know what language to use and explain to you mate, please use pc to view it for a better experience or set your browser on a desktop mode, this could also help you. I don't know for other tokens but that is for bsc only.",

      "body": "The definition of a whale is what will determine its impact on the price, if one whale or several whales are able to move the price, then this currency is central and should be avoided.The non-influential movement is at a rate of 1% to 10%, and it is from which you can achieve profits, but most of the buying and selling of whales are outside the market OTC and therefore the buying and selling price is far from the real price of executing orders.What I am trying to say is that relying on it as a strategy in trading is a failed plan, and you can track the operations more professionally by glassnode ---> https://glassnode.com/",
