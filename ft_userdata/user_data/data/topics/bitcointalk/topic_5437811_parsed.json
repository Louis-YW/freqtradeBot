      "body": "I think the two biggest issues and why it never took off was due to bad timing and never gaining a Binance listing. When it launched it dumped to like $5 and a few days later it rallied up to $15 but it stalled when trading didn’t get a Binance listing.Then it did nothing for a few weeks and the FTX scandal made it even worst. So far it pumped a little to almost $5 but who knows if it will ever be a big hit. What it needs is a Binance listing and I can see it going to $50.",

The miners didn't care about POW. They just wanted to keep making money, obviously.This wouldn’t happen. The reason why is because before ETH forked to POS it forked first on all their test net chains. They did it to test stability and if any issues would arise. If there was an issue they delayed it. Hence why the fork to POS was smooth.I am very surprised that Binance never listed the coin. Probably pressured by ETH devs. They didn’t want an ETC event again I guess. And that is the main reason why it’s struggling right now. Eventually most will abandon it for ETC.",

Even at a price of $10, mining will be unprofitable, because the number of mines will probably increase. Miners still have a lot of unsold video cards, and until these video cards are distributed on the market, there will be no coin price pump.",

Nor any sane developer would stick with dead ETHW and lose the possibility of huge community.Etherum Classic was the original Ethereum that got breached and as such the devs of Ethereum that is PoS now named it Ethereum while the original fork who got breached continued with the name of Ethereum Classic.Both of these coins have a lot of time in the market while ETHW is relatively new with just near 6 months in the market and we have to give it time at least another year to see how it will go.The fact that there are a lot of large farms mining it even at a loss is a great sign that we may as well see some significant price increase for it while it shows that a lot of miners still support it.",

They did this with dual mineable coins like DCR and SIA because the profitability was there.However they will not create a coin out of scratch just to make an ASIC for it. It takes millions to fabricate these chips these days. Its only worth doing on algos which have decent profitability. I think newer technology for ETH Dagger algo will be halted. Most likely all the chips which were fabricated to the day it went ETH POS will be put into production. But in the near future I don't think anymore money will go into the developement of more efficient ETH ASICs because the profitability just isn't there.",
