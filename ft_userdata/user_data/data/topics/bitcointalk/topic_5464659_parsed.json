  "content": "I think this is an interesting question, it will become even more interesting in near future because Binance has some problems all around the world, in different countries and it has already stopped operating in some of them.So, let's imagine that I am from country A and hold a citizenship of country B and C.I am registered on Binance and KYC verified with the documents of country A, i.e. I used the passport of mine that I got from country A, whose citizen I am and where I was born. Now, let's assume that Binance got banned in my country (A). But I want to still use Binance exchange. If I open a new account and pass KYC verification again but with the documents of country B or C, will I be able to regain access to Binance and trade without problems?Just want to know, what happens if certain exchange gets banned in your country but you hold a citizenship of other countries where this particular exchange has permission to operate. Does anyone here has any experience? Please, feel free to change Binance with any exchange you wish, I just used that for an example.P.S. I know that it's bad to use centralized exchange and no, I don't use one, it's just a question that is interesting for me and don't teach me to use decentralized exchanges, I know that.",

To be honest I do not have any experience and do not want to gain one (in these type of cases   ) But I think you could actually use Binance in other country. Because they do not ban the person's Identity instead citizenship or ban country. So, If you could make a new account with \"B\" or \"C\" country details then your account could be made but you definitely can not get the access of your old account back instead a new one with new details. I hope I am not wrong here, And If there are some doubts then use different type of identity document like if in \"A\" country you KYC with Passport then in country \"B\" do KYC with some other document like driving license or ID card etc. I know it might not work because information is information but who says they actually verifies the information with governments. (I don't think so). Point is, Chances are high that you could use another Binance account.",

      "body": "Here's my take lol I'd say there's a good chance you could still pass the identity verification for your newly created account. Who knows, perhaps their kyc software ain't that hard to fool lol. Keep in mind that some exchanges like binance are geo-blocking people hence you must never access your account from a banned-country's IP.However I'd imagine problem/s would arise once they come to know you have a previous account with them, perhaps they will off-board you again. Binance as of writing allows one master account per person and you technically have an account with them therefore creating a new account under the same name/person could count as breaking the rule.In addition, the person in question being a citizen from a banned country is definitely up for discussion. Further, if it's revealed you're residing in the banned country as well, that would be a double blow on your chances.",
