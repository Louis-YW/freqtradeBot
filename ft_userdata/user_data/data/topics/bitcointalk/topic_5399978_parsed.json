  "content": "Since when did eBay enter the NFT game? Just saw a big banner on their homepage advertising exclusive Wayne Gretzky NFTs which I thought was pretty cool. Best of all, most have already sold out! I don't see how anyone on the internet could not know what eBay is these days, so I consider this a pretty good thing in terms of making NFTs more available to the public and maybe even peek some new interest. If you don't know who Wayne Gretzky is, he's one of the best hockey players of all time. If you watch sports and live in a country that has hockey, then you know who The Great One is....",

I guess eBay's been doing this longer than I thought. What you said makes me wonder how eBay handles possible scamming (buying an NFT with someone else's paypal, for example) or returns. Regardless, I'm always happy to see big marketplaces that have a huge reach to people who might not be into crypto-related things yet. I don't shop much on eBay, but kudos to them for jumping on the train and getting NFTs in front of potential buyers who might not have otherwise known what they were!",

So, it seems that eBay fits what NFT is capable of, and they just implement it into their business.[1] https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/prohibited-restricted-items/digitally-delivered-goods-policy?id=4289&mkevt=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&campid=5337590774&customid=&toolid=10001",
