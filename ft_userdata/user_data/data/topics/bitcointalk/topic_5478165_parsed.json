  "content": "Have you considered the antiquated and cumbersome nature of passing currency for each transaction?For each transaction one of the following must occur:In cash you must exchange bills and coins, cluttering drawers and pockets.In cryptocurrency you must pass digital units, cluttering the blockchain.In credit you must pay merchant service fees, cluttering accounts payable.The technology we stand upon is a network of keypairs.What is that exactly?With a private key you sign to prove ownership.With a public key your signature can be proven.Like a credit card, you may sign a purchase with the keys holding your digital assets rather than send units back and forth.What happens next?The selling entity knows how many units of the digital asset a signer holds and can determine whether to purchase more or sell some of their own holdings to balance all signed purchases at once.This simplifies accounting to the lowest number of steps possible and eliminates redundant transaction fees that would otherwise be required when passing digital assets as currency in each purchase.",

Since miners are the ones doing these trades, transaction fees spent to lock in keys are offset by reward blocks.",

      "body": "The absolute simplest means of numerically-delineated value transfer ever invented is called Haypenny. It's not cryptocurrency, it doesn't use PKI, it's simply anonymous value transfer between two entities whose standing in the transaction depends entirely on the possession of a secret token (called a \"block\", although this has nothing to do with a blockchain \"block\"). The Haypenny system is absolute heresy to anybody devoted to the cryptocurrency religion, but say what you want about it, the trading paradigm is as simple as it gets.Wanting more than the Haypenny system approach, therefore, means you demand additional requirements from your means of value transfer, such as protection from a central government (fiat currency and the banking/financial system), physical protection and possession (physical currency), or... all of the stuff you demand that cryptocurrency and blockchain give you.",

Can you just imagine the lines at the malls if everybody had to wait for Bitcoin transactions to complete?There are lots of things that are extremely valuable yet would make terrible currency. Shares of AAPL for instance. Bitcoin is, defacto, a speculation instrument and nothing more right now, and after 10+ years of trying, I don't see any reason why that will ever change. There's nothing wrong with being a speculation instrument, and there's obvious a lot of demand for that in our society, as we can see with Bitcoin and all of the other memecoins.But there's no sense in pretending that Bitcoin is something it's not, and it's not a viable means of currency.",
