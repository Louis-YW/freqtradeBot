This may be off topic but I think it's an interesting distinction that running a full node or an spv client both fall under decentralised. If everyone only had a choice of running bitcoin core, the network would be distributed instead of decentralised (as I understand it).From what I've read/understood so far, decentralised networks reduce the need for trust by having enough identical honest nodes to handle requests. Distributed networks have identical data and processes on all nodes (but maybe different implementations/software clients and versions - like eth being scripted in multiple languages).",

Remember \"Not your keys not your wallet\"If we are talking about decentralised coins like bitcoin and using these centralised exchange then it's completely depletes the base purpose of them and we should avoid using them for many other things also.We all are aware about they control the keys to our funds but over the top they also act as banking institutions restricting users from withdrawing their funds and also freezing your account as we have seen during many times for example the war cricis between Russia-Ukraine.So what type of security we are expecting from these CEX ? They ask for KYC norms and then are also selling our information on the dark web and to the government agencies keeping track on out financial activity also.They need profits and keep running so they will follow government orders only so yes this is what all the CEX are doing at this time.They file for bankruptcy your funds got dissolved and you won't get anything back but notice that if your have stored your funds in hardware wallets or some non-custodial wallets then they might be safe.Go through this threads for more information :Recent events should make you withdraw all your coins to your own wallet: Part 2 Another signal why to avoid CEX...Use of hardware wallets with backing up your seed phrases is recommended because your funds are your responsibility and storing them on these CEX is like giving away to them your hard earned money.",

      "body": "I also feel that you are confusing decentralization with being non-custodial. Â If you want a secure wallet, it should be non-custodial, decentralized and open-source. As mentioned above, being non-custodial isn't enough.For example, in trustwallet, you have full control over your keys. But since it's close-source, there is no way to know if you are the only one who has access to the keys and since it's centralized, you have to connect to their server. This can hurt your privacy.Another example is mycelium. In Mycelium, you have full control over your keys and since it's open source and its code has been reviewed by many people, you can be sure that you are the only one who has access to the keys. But there's still a problem with Mycelium. In mycelium, you have to connect to their server. If you want your wallet to be non-custodial, decentralized and open-source, you can use bitcoin core or use electrum and run your own server. If you want 100% security, you must create your non-custodial, decentralized and open-source wallet on a air-gapped device and your keys should never connect to the internet.",

Wallets can be categorized into centralized and decentralized as well. When you use bitcoin core, you are using a decentralized wallet, because you don't rely on any third party. Being decentralized means being distributed or dispersed, your wallet is a piece of software, it doesn't mean because it can be used alone with its own configuration it is decentralized, just like my miner for which I can change the mining pool at any time or go solo mining is not decentralized either as it's one piece of equipment if it breaks this is it. Just like with bitcoin core, if your HDD crashes there goes your wallet, what you have might have left be a copy on a stick but you don't have redundancy in this case as bitcoin nodes do.",

There's a lot of servers running electrum and a few implementations of it. It WAS easy for one to be malicious but it's also because of the way electrum is structured, it'd be a lot harder for a client like bitcoinj to have nodes that could cause disruption/he dishonest as it connects to multiple at once (and often hops between them).",

No bruh, bitcoin doesn't offer you 'decentralized' wallet (though there is no such wallet) or any type of wallet that there is, bitcoin offers you decentralization in itself, and allows you to make the decision of which wallet you want to use, some bitcoin users make the right choice and use non-custodial and open-source wallets, but some make terrible choices by using custodial wallets.",
