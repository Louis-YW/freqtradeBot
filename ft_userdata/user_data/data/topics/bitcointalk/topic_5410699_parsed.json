  "content": "Well, I have a few questions about exposing some old accounts that look like they changed hands. I've exposed two accounts, and I believe there are a few more accounts around us. We don't notice them because they don't want to contribute anything to this forum except gambling discussion. Only they want money, so they only post on gambling discussions. No 1. Should I expose accounts that already have negative feedback for a different reason? For example, An Account changed hands and participated in the 1xBet Signature campaign. Due to this, the account already got tagged. Does it worth creating another thread and proving that the account changed hands? Since the account doesn't care about reputation and participated in the 1xBet campaign, and already got tagged. People unlikely to trust them and I don't think people will do any deals with them. So, It's a waste of time. Still, I am looking forward to community feedback.No 2. I believe some accounts changed hands a long time ago (About two-three years ago). Right now, Those accounts are managed by shit posters, and most of them are not fluent in English. They were not exposed because either no one noticed or maybe didn't have proper evidence to prove the claim. I had created two threads before and added a Question mark (?) on the title. I don't want to judge them myself. Instead, I will present them to the community, and you guys have to consider them based on my information. Now, The question is; Should I expose those accounts that seem to have changed hands two-three years ago? Regards!",

Why always neutral when it comes to changed hands by account trading? Did you see my last two threads?",

It was discouraged but an open business. Back then, people used to farm account for trading. But later on, when number of scam increased due to account changing hands, if I'm correct, around 2018, some people started to tag account which changed hand and it has been a rule almost now lol. Before that, if any account changed hands, no one cared much. So, I don’t think you should dig such accounts.On a side note, why are you desperately looking for such accounts? I don't think it worths the time. Keep it simple, if you find someone during your participation in the forum, you can report them but looking desperately isn’t something I think you should do. You can do something better for yourself. Just my 2 cents.",

People unlikely to trust them and I don't think people will do any deals with them. So, It's a waste of time. Still, I am looking forward to community feedback.Accounts can have as many feedbacks as possible, for many or the same reasons (from different members), i.e. if an account has a negative feedback for participating in 1xBet campaign, and you have solid evidence that the account changed hands, then you should leave a feedback that the account changed hands, that will help people who will visit their profile to know that the account changed hands. So long as the reason is different, a member can leave as many feedbacks as possible, what may be stupid to do is leaving more than one feedback for someone for the same reason.Quote from: Crypt0S0ul on August 21, 2022, 04:26:57 PMNow, The question is; Should I expose those accounts that seem to have changed hands two-three years ago?

If the manager accepts such accounts for his company, then everything suits him. In addition, you are wasting your time and that of the DT, as they will check on their own. And in the end, even by proving the change of hands, you achieve a neutral tag. For those accounts who bought, stole, or something else, getting a neutral tag does not play any role. But if you find such accounts that participate in signature companies with more than one account, then you can catch them and punish them with a negative tag.

I would refrain from digging dirt on nobody accounts IMO. If they have 0 positive trust and are not DT, there's really no point. Just make a thread like the alt accounts thread and post all your findings in 1 place. If an account like say LoyceV was a bought account, then you should most definitely report it and let the community know so we can take action. ( I am just using LoyceV as an example, I am certainly not accusing that account. Users with a large rep on this forum can be used to pull off a huge scam.)",

Just nonsense rambling that nobody asked for or cares about. Not only that but I also see a lot of similar posts and then when I go to it we're on page 10 of some spam thread were 99 other people have said the exact same thing you are saying and you seemingly don't care as it's just another post for you that adds 0 value.",

Somehow, the betting company still continues to gain there customers despite the negative tagging of its promoters and you wonder why? Who are those that still gambles on the betting site?The truth about these is; a negative tag from a user is simply the users opinion and other users on the forum are subject to there own interpretation. Some might see it as an offence, while others see it as just a promoted sentiment but it's clearly not an offence in the forum and as such, they don't get banned.Now, account changing hands is still not an offence but, its something worth to warn the forum members about. Of course it would be subject to there own interpretation afterwards but, you still have to do it should you be on point with your provided evidence and sees the need.That someone has been found on one count, don't mean you should ignore the other counts on the user.Someone caught plagiarising, spamming, scams and more. The account could be reported on all counts and it would be valid and so, I think that an account have previously been tagged on one offence doesn't have to end there. If others offences are found as well, you can go ahead to create more tags on them. Let the users have there takes on the tags of there choice.This is a way to discredit and discourage account buying. The question here remains if they should be negatively tagged or given a neutral as its hardly an actual offence.",
