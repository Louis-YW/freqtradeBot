What do you think are the issues? Is it technology related, resources or personnel related? I believe that issues with Bitcoin adoption is not the same in our societies. That is what you experience in your society will be different from what is experienced in my society. In my case, it is not technological related that is it is not about Bitcoin but the tools and resources required for adoption. I come from a poor country and we still grapple with steady electricity, income, illiteracy, corruption and all of that. These are some of the issues that  slows down the adoption of Bitcoin in my country.",

No one wants to have there transaction delayed, pay more on fees over a few dollar worth transaction or have a transaction cancelled after supposedly have closed a deal on trust.even with congested high fee's, setting up a 1 or 2 time transaction of say a family trust could be cheaper using bitcoin than fiat, even with bitcoins congested fee rate.. however many normies still wont use bitcoin to store family wealth in bitcoin due to how elitism bitcoin is becoming with its terminologies which scares normies from even trying because they think its more complicated than fiat trusts.. EG people are told they need to run full nodes for full control, then learn what a full node is, then learn the command prompts and config file edits needed to set up a full node, then need to learn what a blockchain and a transaction and [insert needs] just to understand things before even just making a transaction.theres silly words only bitcoiners know like instead of learning about accumulating wealth they gotta learn how to say HODLwe still need to normalise terms and explain things within wallets for normies to just use without them needing a lengthy learning experience..its even getting silly where core even want to remove built in legacy tools from core, meaning people will then need multiple programs just to do a simple legacy transaction in the near future(facepalm). which wont be a simple copy/paste job but a 'migration tool' made to be complicated/cumbersome on purpose to attempt to make people not want to use legacy due to the added annoyance(facepalmx2)even in this forum there are people that talk in topics for years that still dont understand basic concepts because they feel its too much of a hardship to do the research, and they instead decide to play dumb hoping someone would spoonfeed them answers like a baby which they can just repeat to sound smart even if they dont understand it, or cry that they are being misled because they are hearing different versions of advicethings just need to be kept simple and explained in normal terms rather than having a bunch of idiots using buzzwords to sound like experts but then misleading normiesfor instance self controlled family trust operations, can be worded in normal speak rather than buzzword techno speakEG multisig : groupfund/trustfund/family trust       scripts : terms and conditions       m of n : number of signers of group total",

The user-friendliness that i meant has nothing to do with the design and user interface of the wallet, but with its possible correlation with other altcoins in a simplified ecosystem for any user, what I mean is that it is as simple as you make a transaction to x person in any cyptocurrency having only ''a one wallet address or their email, user etc...''.Something that would correlate all crypto systems in a simplified environment as easy to use for any user and from my point of view would help more in its growth, and I'm not talking about my ass in this case.",
