I've been acting carefully for a few months, but now I'm starting to think I won't be able to break the hash.I think I'm about to give up,I followed the cooperation here and was impressed, but I saw that people were always deceived in agreements made with well-intentioned people.Therefore, if the friends who want to be interested accept this as help, not a business agreement, and support me, I do not want to give an exact figure, but I will donate a minimum of 1 BTC as it will help me and help me hold on to life again in difficult times.I kept my hash code secret because I did not know if sharing it openly would cause a security breach. If dear expert friends who are interested in the subject respond to the title, I will follow up instantly. Best regards.",

Or is it something else?If so, what kind of characters did you use in it, and approximately how long was the password?Keep in mind that Bitcoin Core uses PBKDF2 for hashing its passwords so it's going to be quite slow to break into any Bitcoin wallet compared to other types of hashes like SHA even if the password is relatively short.",

People are simply asking what's your problem as the whole \"hash\" thing is ambiguous, not about giving a clue about what you used as a password or how many bitcoins you have! Simple, why can't you access it, you have forgotten the password, yes or no?You need that pass cracked?Also, since I've seen enough cases, it's your wallet, right? Cause if you bought a file online, I can assure you there are no coins there at all.",

But if you hang around in the Bitcoin community as long as the rest of us, you'll realize that it is a common theme that new users come here asking for help to recover the password for a wallet they have. After spending a lot of time trying to help them we finally realize that the wallet they claimed to own was actually something they had bought on the internet. Such files are fake and do not contain a single satoshi, however they are modified to show addresses containing large amounts of bitcoins.When you say you have a wallet file but you haven't set its password, it is a logical conclusion that there might be a chance that the file you are talking about could be one of those cases. Hence the question.If we can get past that and be sure that this is indeed a real wallet file that you owned (not bought/found on the internet) then we can start on trying to figure out if there is any hope of recovering it by narrowing the search-space for that password.",
