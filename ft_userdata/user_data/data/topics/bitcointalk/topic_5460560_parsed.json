Your opinions could help someone..Almost every individual has the experience at least once in their life, and if your depression is financially motivated, then a thought to help you fell better is that things will get better and not remain the same forever so long as you do not loose hope and keep pushing to success. Whenever you feel depressed, talk to someone if you are the talking type, take a walk, listen to some good music, hangout with friends to cheer you up etc. Do not allow yourself to get depressed to the extent of thinking of taking your own life.",

Even Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg also have problems that can make them depressed. I have suffered from depression not just because of personal problems but family, community, and societal issues. When I see children suffer because of poverty I am pained. When people die because of lack of health facilities I feel depressed. Even the war in Ukraine grieves me so much. But I have learned to appreciate what I have now no matter how small it is. I have also learned to be grateful for life and health even when I have nothing to eat. I am grateful that I can walk on my foot even when I cannot afford a car. I have also understood that I need to be grateful because I am far better than many people. From experience, I have also discovered it is better to trust nobody because people can disappoint. Don't expect much from people because you might be disappointed when you expect them to help. I strive hard to change what I can and if I can't change the situation, I don't bother myself.",

People who have gone through this would see that sometimes it is time that will pass and you will gradually adjust to yourself and you now realise you would have been the greatest full for wanting to take your life which is to the extreme.Apart from time, there is another solution which is talking it over with family or friends. They are source of encouragement for someone in such hopeless state .The third is music. Listening to some cool reflective songs that will bring your mind down and free from whatever you have been through with. Music have been known to be recipe for many people in such condition.",

Your opinions could help someone..Life have taught us so many things and is only few who learn from it, and they say experience is the best teacher. If some of these things don't happen to us then we haven't started living life. Is really hard to find yourself when things are not going your way, is like you're fighting against the world. Whenever I find myself in such situations I feel like pausing the movement of the world for a second and rearrange my life then play it back but when these things happens, to get yourself back you need the help of your loved ones to always be there to change your mood and distract from thinking much if not you might reason suicide, it happened to me ones but thanks to my family members.",

This limits the high risk of depressions that could lead to destructions in many ways.Bottling your controversies and struggles is a mental jungle which has the potential to destroy and not serving you proper solutions.I have been in a depressive and frustrating situation because non of my financial investments could work out good and I totally lost value to my family out of my incompetencies to handle responsibilities.Then I would just want to be at the darks left alone to path myself thoughts of self reasoning that even by the day lights, I still want the windows and all entrances closed just to get a darkening in the room and I don't go out.I really thought I was proceeding to pave a solution to my problems by being alone in the dark with a whole lot of negative reasons running through my head which all boils to suicidal option.I almost made it count a suicidal then I said to myself that... Yes, this suicide option would be best for me but is my exit going to create means of that responsibility I'm incompetent about? The family is surely going to face some challenges after you exit but you stays, there would be some challenges you can bridge against the family.The family might even count quick and more lost as traumas of your exit.And it is going to be a monkery to the family that one of them was a suicidal.I thought of these all then I found reason why I must live, stay mentally positively minded with the hope of thing's would be better again.Since then I had to adapt to being among people as a company, going to churches that has a better Pleasuring singing and activating the weak bodies with preaches of the words of God.",

Personally, I have a wonderful circle of friends that are supportive and always available.  They have helped me in countless number of times, providing both material and psychological support. I can remember how they supported me when I lost my dad I 2017. Unfortunately, not everyone is fortunate to have friends that will always be there for them. However, family can also be a good option. The most important thing is being able to share your burden as many people prefer to die in silence. Remember: \"a problem shared is half solved\"",

      "body": "We all cope differently. Some like to solve problems right away while some (like me) like to focus on what they're feeling at the moment. I find it most helpful if I give myself a day or two just to take a break and let my emotions run through. After that, I promise myself that I'll get up and keep living. It might be harder for other people to do this which is okay because I wasn't always like this. Talk to friends and family, start a journal, get professional help if really necessary and be a little forgiving of yourself. Life will always be full of problems so it's important to know how to bounce back up rather than knowing just how to stay on top.",

If you was an employee, then you got fired, it's why you shouldn't only depend on one of source income.Having a feeling of being not enough, it's all come from your mind, if you keep demanding anything, there's no end. Now you only have a bike, next you want to have a motorcycle, next you want to have a car, next you want to have a sport car, next you want to have bla bla.Loss of a relationship, never trust human for 100%.Business gone wrong, it's always a problem in every business.",

I hope you get out of it, bruh. There's been days I've been so blue that all I think about is getting my life over with since I feel it hasn't been productive but then I get motivated to do better and still fight after I must have spoken with my mum or better yet, prayed.. sometimes I stuff myself with loads of ice cream  .. one thing I've come to terms with is that when life throws you lemons, you make a lemonade out of it cause there's no assurance that there won't be troubles, but what makes it better is how you fight and come out strong.",

Hope for a better tomorrow is what lifts you up.The funny thing about migrating from one's country of origin to another country of foreign land is that you become a stranger and if you don't have a complete and legal traveling document including work permit is that you are going to be totally stranded and might be deported which will amount to waste of money and time. Moreover, your country of origin might be better than the country where you are running to because most times that is the situation since the grass is greener from the neighbor's end.",
