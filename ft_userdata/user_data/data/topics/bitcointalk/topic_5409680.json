  "content": "This is scary news for those of us who value our privacy.  The developers of the Ethereum mixer Tonado.cash have were arrested by Dutch police early today.  The police state are frightened by (y)our privacy, and are now showing how they are the real threat to democracy.  This isn't isolated to one country, this is a global concern.It started with news of the USA sanctioning the crypto mixer, which broke yesterday.  Guard your privacy, people.  If you are crypto user, you are a threat to them.USA Sanctions Tornado.Cash: https://www.wsj.com/articles/tornado-cashs-sanctions-show-shift-in-crypto-regulatory-focus-11660336224Dutch Police Arrest Developers: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/dutch-cops-arrest-dev-behind-sanctioned-crypto-mixer-tornado-cash/ar-AA10B44fSorry for posting this in the bitcoin section.  Even though it's related to an altcoin mixer I think it's more broadly about all crypto currencies.  If I'm wrong, moderator please more where appropriate.",

      "body": "when cryptocurrencies were defined by fiat law as currency. (circa 2014-5) instead of remaining as a digital product/good. things changed yep it may have made some think it legitimised bitcoin, but it also allowed an entrance by regulators to start putting rules on businesses that interact with cryptocurrenciesthe guys at tornado were not arrested for just being a mixer. it was that they were caught allowing PEP (politically exposed people) from russia, who are currently banned from trying to move value out of russia..side notemixers no matter who uses it, no matter the source of funds. no matter the destination of funds, are treated as a suspicious activity by regulators where businesses that are regulated have to red flag anyone that uses a mixer no matter the reason or purpose someone has for using a mixer. the same applies to coins/tokens with privacy enhanced featuresthis is things like monero, liquid, and othersthe same applies to sidechains, subnets/altnets bridging to main net blockchains, where such side/sub/layered networks are advertised as privacy networksthis is things like LN, this is not to say that mixers are illegal. but they are categorised as services that put users of service under suspicion and put on a watch list. ..some people think that mixers are not regulated and not meant to cause mixer users to be put on watchlists. and these people will try the foolish hardest to try to get everyone to use a mixer pretending it hides users.. yet by using a mixer actually puts a big neon arrow on users and makes them get watched far more. yep the regulation for businesses to watch users of mixers, creates a scenario where mixers then do not protect privacy. because now people are put on a watch list due to using a mixer.in short if there was 2 people waling down a street. one guy walking normally. no one cares, he isnt doing anything suspicious.and the other guy told to jump in a black box. where its closed off and several black boxes are thrown into the street so that for a 20 yard stretch you cant tell which one is the one with the guy in it.. is 'privacy'.. however when the guy gets out. he is then watched for every movement he does afterwards and also by seeing him get into the box, they can back trace his actions before getting in the box, and that is watched too..suddenly even if he never done a crime. all of his actions before and after using a mixer is now on a highlighted watchlist. thus defeating the point of a mixer.",

These included funds stolen through hacks by a group believed to be associated with North Korea. Tornado Cash started in 2019 and according to FACT it has since achieved a turnover of at least seven billion dollars. Investigations showed that at least one billion dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies of criminal origin passed through the mixer. It is suspected that persons behind this organisation have made large-scale profits from these transactions.aka aiding and abetting criminal activity.. a currency law that existed years before cryptocurrency existed.using crypto does not make currency laws obsolete. what you find is that pre 2014 crypto was not considered a currency by law enforcement and thus crypto didnt apply to currency laws. but now mainstreaming of crypto now classes crypto as currency. currency laws also apply to cryptopre 2014.a mixer would have not been classed as a laundering service or a 'money mule' but instead classed in similar respects as a pokemon card shuffler tool. where by it has nothing to do with money. but now crypto are defined as 'money' by many countries. those laws and definitions of AML apply to crypto services",

From what I understand from the articles published on the Internet about what happened to the two developers, the suspension was not due to the fact that they developed a crypto-mixer, but because the activity of their service was related to users from Russia. Of course, this presents the forms from a new angle, which is the extent of the credibility of the service that they are developing. If they were unable to hide their identities, were they really able to hide the identities of the users of their platform .",
