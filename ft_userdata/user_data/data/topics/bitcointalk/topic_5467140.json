Like publicly reported and caught due to it. As long as there's no one that has been caught by the law and it says that it's banned, they'll keep using it as long as there are ways of doing it.",

Are all crypto activities prohibited in your country? You should not buy or sell crypto on the crypto market?In my country, crypto/bitcoins are prohibited from being used as payment currency but we are legally allowed to own bitcoins and buy and sell bitcoins on the bitcoin market. We make purchases and sales using local banks in our countryIf you are prohibited from buying bitcoins using local banks in your country, then how to exchange bitcoins for fiat from your country? Does your country not allow bitcoin own and use of bitcoin as an asset?",

      "body": "Unless explicitly stated that the general public can't use cryptocurrencies anymore, everyone can pretty much use it as much as they please. This will hold up in the court of law too, where technicalities rule. So even though \"crypto is practically banned\" for usage in the country you're living in, since they didn't explicitly say you couldn't use cryptocurrencies anymore you're still pretty much in the green. Of course you can't just go out telling people you're investing in crypto anymore, that would be belligerent and stupid, but at the same time you're not necessarily prohibited from using it, so invest as much as you want, gain profits as much as you can, and worry about the rest of the details later. I swear if things go south and you get arrested for using crypto under these bylaws you could get away with it scot-free under technicalities, which is why you might think people aren't aware of the law. They know how it works for the most part, they just don't go out there telling people about it.",

Mostly I don't write what is that bank transfer for in and I do it not to hide what is that bank transfer is done for. It's just unnecessary and banks even don't mind to force users to write it rather than a template format like Person A transfer. That's all.If you are doing a bitcoin trade through bank transfer and don't add its details to show you are buying/selling bitcoin, how banks can know what you are doing with your trade partner?Don't know means bank can not ban your account.",

There is a difference between being banned and restrictions. Being banned means it is legally prohibited, so anyone caught guilty will face legal charges, while restrictions is simply prohibiting you from using it without any consequences. So, they keyword there is \"legality\". I don't think restrictions would stop people from using bitcoin when it's been widely accepted globally. Bitcoin is borderless in the first place, so I don't think it would stop me either if my country puts a restrictions in our local banks, I'm not transacting with them either lol.",

In my opinion, it is a ban on bitcoin but it is indirect, not direct. I think governments know that bitcoin cannot be banned because they cannot control it so instead they will limit what people use to participate in investing in bitcoin. That way, they think they can ban bitcoin. My country is in a similar situation, there are no regulations banning bitcoin but banks will freeze our accounts if they find out we are trading bitcoin with it in our bank account. It's actually a ban.",

And why are you so concerned that banks are not authorised to deal with bitcoin? Bitcoin was created precisely against banks, so the fact that they cannot offer trading and custody services should not be a problem, on the contrary.Another thing is that over time this will be authorised in many countries and help demand to increase, which it will, but it should not be a problem as long as the population is not prohibited from buying and using bitcoin (even if they are prohibited there are many people who buy and use it as Bd officer comments, but I think it is better that it is not prohibited).",

It was advices that the public who choose to use these cryptocurrency are at their own risk. Today, we can see that Nigeria sits among the top countries where Bitcoin is mostly used. These restrictions doesn't necessarily mean that you can't use Bitcoin or cryptocurrency but you still have to be careful why dealing with them since it isn't accepted by the government or local banks.
