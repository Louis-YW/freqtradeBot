For example, this link discusses changing the Linker settings to solve the error[1]. CMIIW.You can probably open an issue if the error persists and you can't run the app, although it seems unlikely as long as you follow the guide. I assume you use Windows, have you made sure to do what the developer suggests before running it on VS Code?QuoteInstall CUDA SDK and open BTCCollider.sln in Visual C++ 2017.You may need to reset your Windows SDK version in project properties.In Build->Configuration Manager, select the Release configuration.Build and enjoy.Note: The current release has been compiled with CUDA SDK 10.0, if you have a different release of the CUDA SDK, you may need to update CUDA SDK paths in BTCCollider.vcxproj using a text editor. The current nvcc option are set up to architecture starting at 3.0 capability, for older hardware, add the desired compute capabilities to the list in GPUEngine.cu properties, CUDA C/C++, Device, Code Generation.Source: https://github.com/JeanLucPons/BTCCollider[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33400777/error-lnk2019-unresolved-external-symbol-main-referenced-in-function-int-cde",
