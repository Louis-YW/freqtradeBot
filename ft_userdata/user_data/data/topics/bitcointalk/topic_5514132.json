Sure, you can get Bitcoin as long as you’ve got the means. Just always keep your country’s Bitcoin regulations in mind. For example, if you’re in a place like China where Bitcoin trading is illegal, you’ve got to be careful not to get caught. There are still ways to do it if you dig into some research. Actually, you can ask for tips and ideas right here in this forum.QuoteI am in need of detailed insights and practical instructions.

You should also check out some videos in youtube to learn the basics - they’re super helpful for getting a grip on the technical stuff.

Secondly you should proceed to summarising what aspect of bitcoin you wish to understand and how deep you wish to go. Well for me I personally prefer to understand all the basics including simple economics everything about wallets open source softwares, decentralisation and basic things like protecting your coins and your privacy too.The most effective way to grow in my opinion is to do alot of reading and also try as much as possible to practice what you read that's the only way you can experience it firsthand and hardly forget it, remember they say experience is the best teacher. Lastly , make sure to engage in important discussions and ask questions as you learn. As for acquiring you can do that by rendering a service even on this forum.Good luck on your journey.",

Bitcoin-related news sites may be good but they are prone to report exaggerations, fake news, unverified information, and the like.

Users are free to counter, refute, contradict, rebut what's being reported. The veracity of the news is constantly challenged and verified. It also matters who to follow on social media platforms. For research and development and discussions on them, it's probably best to follow Bitcoin developers themselves. It's fun reading them debating against each other.
