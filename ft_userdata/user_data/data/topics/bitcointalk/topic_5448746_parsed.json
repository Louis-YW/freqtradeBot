With regards to the games being offered, most are traditional games such as card games, dice, slots, and the likes other variation are sportsbetting. With regards to fairness and transparancy it solely depend on the platform whether they would be or not but mostly are not and those who does so are ones which are registered or licensed. There are many gambling sites which you can engage yourself with. A tip of advice are those which has a good reputation in this industry or those whoch are popular. To check legitimacy of a playform, try checking if they are licensed or not. Survey such as this topic qould also help but will only limited to those who are familiar with the gambling site you are checking with.",

I didn't find anything relevant about it, no positive or negative feedback. Not even here on the bitcointalk forum is it possible to find any mention of it.I would tell you to play carefully, start with low stakes and withdraw them as soon as possible.We have great casinos that are highly rated here on the site, Duelbits is one that has an excellent reputation, I recommend you to try it out",

Looking at this post as well as the OP seems like you are just shilling the casino itself through the form of fake inquiry to engage user here on checking the website for your question.The casino you are asking is new to the forum and trying might put you on risk because it doesn't have any good feedback here. You can try trusted casino instead of risking money to this unknown casino while there’s a lot of casino here that offers better than that.",

Are there any independent reviews or verifications that confirm its legitimacy? Here your casino website link: https://bithound.io/de/casino/national-casino/ Is your casino site officially approved?To run a casino site autonomously there are several rules and regulations to follow. The most important thing is the currency system. If your casino site is officially approved then your country must operate as a government approved currency payment system. Along with your native local currency, digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, Litecoin, Solana, Matic, TRX, Dogecoin and as many as possible currencies should be kept active.",

For global gambling seems not recommended if any casino using local language and better with gambling use English as their language. For clearly about this casino gambling trusted or not ask on local board and they have know well about how with this gambling reputation is popular or not in Germany.",

I see they have already implemented payment from Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum etc. Like other casinos, it also has restrictions, players from certain countries, such as the United States, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, are not allowed to play on National Casino.If you go through their official URL, in the footer you will see this information:- This website is managed and operated by TechSolutions (CY) Group Limited- registered office located at Parthenonos 5, Flat 103, 2020, Nicosia, Cyprus- Operated by TechSolutions Group N.V. with address at Abraham Mendez Chumaceiro Boulevard 03, Curaçao. Maybe this information will be enough for you to contact them or meet them personally as what I understood is that you are willing to purchase this project.About fees, I think National Casino does not charge any commission for deposits or withdrawals. Hope you get it worked out. Good Luck!",

When I enter the site the language used in it is not Global Language as well but National Language which can only be used by a Nation and not everyone in the world. And since the site is meant for a special group of people then the help you need from the general public is not possible as well because not everyone understands that you write up. The graphics in the site is also scanty. I don't know if it is from my end of the browser or the device.",

I don't think he is lazy to do his research because he has other main reasons for this post. He would have told us that he wanted us to review the website for him. He should have advertised the service and paid participants for the reviews. And I think the appropriate place for this thread is the service section. He is just stylishly advertising the casino to members.",
