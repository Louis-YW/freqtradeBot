I am not surprised at this because as long as it is a centralized system, issues like this must occur because it is been controlled by a third party and they can deprive you of your funds for no good reason. I feel pity for people that are using this bank and this is why one shouldn't put all his funds in one place because of such scenario like this. It is impossible for bitcoin to get rid of fiat because fiat is controlled by the government for them to have power over citizens financial life. This is why it is good to have both bitcoin and fiat, so that if fiat fails you, you can fall back to your bitcoin and take a little fraction from it to take care of any emergency on ground. Fiat and bitcoin will work hand in hand and no one will replace the other.",

I have heard several bad stories about that bank including indiscriminate charges, difficulty and delayed transaction amongst others. What I find strange is how they continue to expand and dominate to remain among the top banks. Could it be that they have strong political connection?There was even rumours of Access bank planning to buy Standard Chattered bank, a local bank planning to buy an international bank? That was strange anyways. I have tried to open account with them on several occasions but somehow I end up not proceeding... maybe I was not just ready for their drama. We hope CBN will step up on this matter and call them to order.",

There is no limitation or banned to operating with Bitcoin in Nigeria, everybody has every right and free will to participate, it is personal and no permission is required from the Government.In the case of Bitcoin being the solution when experiencing system glitch is based on the measure at which it was purchased, either as an investment, store of value and so on but it is not right to alter my investment portfolio because of a common glitch which is normal with cexs. The best solution is having more than one accounts because there is every lesser tendency of both experiencing system glitch same time.",

If you want to buy millions of naira worth of bitcoin in just some minutes, that is possible if you are in Nigeria.That's very true and that's why we are top in the chart of the most consumers and transacting of Bitcoin and all other crypto. Nigeria is the core region in the expansion of Bitcoin adoption too as I believe a ratio of 60% of Nigerian youth are aware of Bitcoin and other crypto but I don't know of them possessing it though because their is still this massive misconception that Bitcoin is something that has to do with illegal activity in the country and so many people shy away from it .",

I see am say network issue no be an escuse wey person go come say you go come fully adopt crypto. Morover bitcoin adoption dey since for Nigeria as a matter of fact w don dey for Long now. The real deal wey dey dere be say both crypto and bank go work hand in hand to achieve there goals. Let's take for example if everybody say them want to dey do p2p to avoid fiat banking system, sometimes we go dey get issues. Because fiat banking system still serve as middle man. If we say make we avoid fiat now then make we do direct p2p without any centralized exchange how we fit dey trade our coin for fiat? Because for you to see perfect merge go be problem and even if them merged you with person I think e go be for a purpose of buying or exchange of goods and services. so where the thing go dey possible na if them introduce a website wey dey accept bitcoin as a means of payment as an option.

You need to see terrible experiences of people with  that bank. The recapitalisation done by the then CBN governor, Professor Charles Soludo, who is the present governor of Anambra State, eliminated a lot of the problems facing the banking sector by ensuring banks must have at least twenty five billion naira to operate, this lead to the merger of several banks from where Access bank was born as a mega bank. I guess what is affecting them is administration and not just the capital to run the bank. If this issue lingers, there may be mass exodus from that bank because people wouldn't want much stories about their funds especially now that the country is facing economic challenges.  Quote from: Y3shot on November 17, 2023, 04:16:54 PMOur government really need to accept Bitcoin completely so that people can invest in it and in difficult time like this bitcoin can be a solution to the problem.

And each transaction you do go get cash back of about %3.Sometimes I dey reason say economic inflation they affect bank. Because of the way inflation they rise naso people dey comot there Money from bank they go invest am to wetting go profit them.

Emagine wetting happen for that  te time of scacity of money, person go go bank say him wan collect him money, bank get the money but them go deprive you of your money, them dey give people 2 to #3k where as CBN dey give them money. Instead of them taking advantage of the crucial situation of the economy to promote there services by making there customer happy, them choose to use the opportunity to make more money. By selling the cash to POS people. So that thing create a bad inpression on banks and many people come decide say after this monetary crisis say Dem no go fit put money for bank again. And I think that thing don dey happen. Just like @mayor of ogba describe how him go zenith bank to collect#100k but them offer am #30k that one na to show say money no too dey bank again.
