Bitcoin is not for everyone and it is better for someone who don't believe in bitcoin not to make any attempt to invest it because when one is not sure about an investment it normally comes out unprofitable. I think people needs time to adapt, understand bitcoin.  It seems when people take their time to accept Bitcoin they take good advantage of it because by this time there is a better understanding of it.",

Hardcopy newspapers still exists but they are mainly used by people who are fifty years and above. Some of them might have accepted online versions but others still fancy the physical ones. I know an uncle who still subscribe to daily delivery of hardcopy newspapers.Cryptocurrencies are mainly accepted by the young generation while the elderly are still sceptical because they are not conversant with the new invention. They will always choose to invest in traditional assets since it is what they are used to.

How well do you think the bitcoin community will accept a new technology that will replace bitcoin?

There is no need to criticize people who are ignorant about how Bitcoin works. But it because annoying when they begin to spread lies and misconceptions about Bitcoin. It is better to learn about a new technology or shut up if you don't know much about the invention. Anyway, Bitcoin is not designed to replace fiat but to serve as a reliable alternative.",

When Bitcoin didn't exist, real estate was seen as the best long-term investment, although it has liability, but that's okay because it also has passive income if used correctly.Although, there is a point that it is not that easy to accept new technology in this era, it seems like back then, when there was no internet, it was not immediately adapted quickly and the same is true for bitcoin when it was just starting out.",

If you want the truth, then one of them will receive an argument from one party in accordance with the data.The Bitcoin community will receive new technology if something can be better than Bitcoin because what is sought is not who wins as in a debate. Well, if the technology that will be designed to replace Bitcoin is not able to give more than Bitcoin, it is nonsense.",

I think we should try to be excited about the possibilities instead of just seeing the older things going away.  That's tough, I know.  But what do you think?  Maybe a bit of enthusiasm rather than criticism would be a good feeling, and understand what it will profit to bitcoin",

Are we not just going to become the same critics of that new technology even if it offers better opportunities like some people remain critics of investing in bitcoin till today. truth is that even if there is any technology that looks better than bitcoin and the blockchain technology, it will have to pass through all the processes that bitcoin went through before we can comfortably accept that more than just having good features, it has what it takes to stay for the long term and still continue to remain relevant while it acceptance gets more popular even outside of the crypto ecosystem.the market is big and even if bitcoin enthusiast remains skeptical about whatever technology that comes up just because of the believe they have in bitcoin, others can still buy into the technology and still make use of it until gradually the wave affects even those of us that are going to remain bullish on bitcoin and if it becomes necessary to accept it as a better modification of what bitcoin has to offer, we will comfortably do that. life is progressive and what is the talk of the globe might with time become obsolete and it will be unwise to remain glued to the old when there is a new that is better and more useful than the old has emerged.",

In my opinion, it's just an upgrade version of the old one like the floppy disk for example which I don't really see many people using it since there's a new device that do the same job and this also goes in cryptocurrency.",

That's why we're too hesitant to use it at first, the adaptation is still on process and people can't even crack how's everything is done. But let's say there is, the only thing we can think of is Ethereum, the technology can be developed more, Vitalik is still open for innovations that will improve Ethereum but at this point, BTC is still the one that leads. BTC is too advanced that people didn't expect a thing like this to come and brought digital money era to our world, some insisted to copy it but failed so IMO, replacing bitcoin is still not doable but possible, the idea might come maybe 10 years from now. That's why people already come up to compare it to gold because it acts like an investment asset. If another innovation will come soon, BTC will not be replaced because it's unique. Invest in both",
