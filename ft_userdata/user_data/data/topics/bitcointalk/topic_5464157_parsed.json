  "content": "Thin clients run on a server and its performance depends completely on a network connection. With ports for different peripherals like SD Cards to enhance performance and it works with Raspberry Pi. Full nodes on desktop oriented systems also requires round the clock network connection to run effectively. Thin client being server oriented reduces load on the system, which saves power. And it's less cost effective to set up a full node with thin client. I've seen some advantages of using thin clients and disadvantages like server failure. Yet I've not seen much usage of such devices to run a full node or contents about it, does it pose plenty vulnerabilities? found just one thread on reddit that talks about running full node on a thin client device. What possible issues could arise with using such devices to run a full node? I'd want to try it myself.",

      "body": "Perfectly possible. Generally, you wouldn't want to run a Raspberry Pi as a production server because it is quite underpowered and the alternative isn't that much more expensive. There is no vulnerabilities with it, it is just another computer but smaller and cheaper.If you want to run a node on it, be prepared to use HDD instead of an SD card. The constant IO operations will stain your SD card and you would suffer from slow synchronization as well. You can synchronize it on another computer before copying it over. It is a pain in the ass to set it up on Raspberry Pi and it would probably be better to just get a used computer to run your node. The cost differential isn't too significant.",

What possible issues could arise with using such devices to run a full node? I'd want to try it myself. With example you mentioned, 1GB RAM isn't enough. Even if you only use CLI, use tricks to reduce OS ram usage (e.g. recompile kernel with only bare minimum feature) and configure Bitcoin Core to use less RAM, it'll be very slow and you might face unexpected error. I wouldn't recommend you to use thin client which has less than 4GB RAM and 4 thread CPU to run full node, especially considering Bitcoin blockchain and UTXO count keep rising over time.For now, Bitcoin Core still works with 2GB of RAM and a single thread, as long as you're only using a terminal to connect and are not running anything else. You may have to reduce the mempool size and dbcache to get responsive performance, but that's about it. The kernel itself only uses about 256MB of memory, so there's not much to gain by recompiling it.",

There are many ways reduce kernel size/RAM usage. For example Tiny Core Linux only have minimum 46MB RAM requirement[1].[1] https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/blockdev/zram.html[2] https://linuxgizmos.com/cutting-linux-down-to-size/[3]https://elinux.org/Kernel_Size_Tuning_Guide[4] http://tinycorelinux.net/faq.htmlThe 256MB number is based on my own observations of running Linux systems, but from Bitcoin Core's point of view, whether you save 50MB or 250MB by recompiling the kernel is negligible because Core makes use of half a gigabyte itself after initialization, which increases as additional blocks are verified and the dbcache is filled.Of course, Core will struggle with the minimum memory that I posted, but it will hang with less memory while using swap space.",

However, CLI was perfectly responsive, and it didn't crash though you had to use your resources wisely.Anyhow, thread count doesn't matter as much as IPC.

Unbearable to use.I have had a few 'nodes in a box' over the years umbrel, mynode, raspiblitz, and although at times they did overheat and throttle it was USUALLY an external hardware issue.i.e. it was in a case and the fan died. Or in a case with internal fan and the case itself was a heatsink but it got covered so there was 0 air movement.But open with a finned heatsink on it never had an issue. The bigger problem that I kept running into was that even the 'name brand' power adapters were crap. -Dave",

At very least, there would be more space for linux buffer/cache memory.Have you guys tried running Core in the bare minimum required RAM? I have been running Core under a 4 GB RAM, and it's painfully slow sometimes. When it does the consistent recent blocks check during startup, it can take up to half hour. I can't imagine someone running Core with a quarter of that amount of RAM, let alone one eighth of that (256 MB). In fact, 1 GB is at least required.

I expect there would be noticeable performance difference with only 1GB of RAM.Take into account that this year, memory usage from unconfirmed transactions has reached an ATH. I don't have evidence, beyond the fact that we all were frustrated with Ordinals, and it lasted for months. Not just a week as in 2017. Even as we speak, memory used in my node is 300 / 300 MB, purging any transaction with < 3.02 sat/vb. (Do you guys remember the days we were paying 1 sat/vb and have it confirmed in 10-20 minutes?

I always thought it needs to be done from host side which apply for whole VM. BY any chance, is there similar tool to limit I/O usage?I haven't tried it, but knowing Linux, there's probably a way to do it. You can start by using cputool, which can limit the system load for a process. So on a cheap VPS, set it up to keep the load under for instance 0.2. \"Load\" is caused by different things, and that includes disk I/O. So it may be a start.It didn't work on all VPSses though, I think it works on OpenVZ but doesn't work on KVM. Another way to reduce disk I/O is by installing enough RAM QuoteWith that kind of deals, i would say it's near unknown provider rather than unpopular provider.I've seen good hosts on Lowendtalk.com, and I've seen hosts disappear (after I paid for a year).
