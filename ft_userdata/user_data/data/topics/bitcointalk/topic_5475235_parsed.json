      "body": "It's not a good idea to mine Bitcoin on a laptop because it needs a lot of computing power and can make your laptop overheat. It uses up a ton of electricity, and the money you make might not cover the costs of running your laptop all day. Plus, mining can damage your PC since laptops aren't built for the heat mining generates. If you're really interested in mining, it's better to consider building a GPU rig. Just as you've stated, the Asic can generate noise due to the cooling fans and other components involved in their operation but for a more efficient and effective mining it would be better to use the appropriate equipments.",

Bitcoin difficulty is too big and you will never find anything, just waste electricity.You should read a little in here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2415854.0PS. Your question may belong to mining or beginners, but not technical area, maybe you consider moving this topic, see bottom-leftNow, if you want to learn about mining you can seek some altcoins with low difficulty or ASIC resistant. Meaning ask in altcoins mining section. (Even pool mining for Monero may work).Just keep in mind that:* you will most probably get no profit at all off all this* mining means heavy use of your CPU and possibly GPU (depending on the coin and the hardware you have), preferably 24/7. Laptops are not meant for such use, hence you risk burning it (and possibly your home too), or, with proper (extra) ventilation you will just shorten the life of your laptop's componentsThis is how I see it.",

Mining Bitcoin with GPU isn't profitable either for years now, you need to have ASICs to mine Bitcoin or GPU rigs to mine the shitcoins.To OP, even if you have free lifetime electricity you are not going to make a penny via mining through your laptop whereas the continuous usage of the device will wreck and cause hardware failures in your laptop.If you want to have some BTC then sell your Laptop on eBay and buy BTC with that money that is 100x better than the idea of mining with a laptop.",

You can find various ways to earn bitcoin aside mining and of the best is getting paid through bitcoin. I advice you to use the money you wanted to get a ASICS machine to buy and HODL bitcoin with this you will make more money.Quote from: Cleanshit on November 23, 2023, 06:15:42 PMSo, can I mine bitcoin on a laptop? is my query.

Also about the node, in Bitcoin you are not paid for running a node.",

Honestly speaking, if you're going to mine cryptocurrencies might as well just go for those second-hand ASIC miners which costs just as much as a regular laptop, with the upside that these miners are way more fit to do bitcoin mining since that's their mine directive in the first place.",

Usually the first thing to go out is the power brick like it did on the HP G10 I used. Oh Trust me I TRIED everything at first!!!! They just don't like the constant power draw.My advice for just starting out is to look into building a small 6 card mining rig using 1660 Super cards. They are really inexpensive to buy, under $100,  and with the right OC (OverClock) they draw about 60-75 Watts each and can make about $0.10 a day which is not much, BUT you will learn how to set up a rig, mange said rig and introduce yourself to crypto mining. You can use NiceHash for a wallet and be up and running in minutes. That Easy!!!Feel free to DM if you have any questions and just remember, Have Fun!!!!",

Do you have any links you can offer that prove he is wrong? I just checked the prices for 1660 Super cards and they are just as he said, $250-300 USD. Sure perhaps you can get it somewhat cheaper on ebay for a used model. But it won't be that much cheaper.",

Any old PC is ideal for learning, as long as it's no longer needed for important stuff.But I don’t know what you can learn on an old computer. Firstly, you will get a lot of electricity consumption if you mine, let's say 200-300 watts from the wall. And this knowledge cannot be used in modern mining.New gadgets have communities where you can learn something, but I haven't heard of communities for mining bitcoins on old PCs.",
