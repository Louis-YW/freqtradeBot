In my eyes one of the best books - especially when you want to dive in to the technical aspects of Bitcoin. I would say that it offers the perfect amount of information for beginners and leaves nothing out for a good technical fundamentals.\"The Bitcoin Standard\" on the other hand has a different target group. The book is aimed more at people who are more interested in economic and monetary topics related to Bitcoin.Completely legitimate and the mix of both books really covers everything for beginners.",

I am sorry if you are not him. But that guy was annoying enough. He was creating useless threads all over the forum and never check back his threads to read what people write. First of all, do not create threads for every question raise in your head. Utilize the search button and google as well. If you do not find any answer, then you can create a thread in this section. Please be active when you create a thread and monitor the answers you get from the thread, respond to them if you do not understand anything. It's important. Otherwise people won't be able to know if you understand anything or not.",

If you think you have no good knowledge about BTC and alternative currencies, and if you make any posts, others will roast you and make fun of you, then you have to extract this thought out of your mind.Because in learning, we don't feel ashamed of bashing, instead, we have to bear it as students. And secondarily, do not make a post until you think you are ready, but even someday you will make a post under some thread, and that might be your best reply, but it would be nothing to someone, but at the same time, it would be helpful for any other person.I suggest you read as many threads as you can because reading will give you more knowledge, and then after acquiring knowledge, you can make posts. And please in order to make posts, do not copy paste content from AI bots or from any other website without giving source link otherwise you will be banned without giving any warnings permanently.",

I like your statement that no question is dumb. That's because this forum is full of different mindsets of people, and they take things differently. If one person finds your question, information, or any post dumb, then another person might consider that post helpful and might like it. That's why we should not think about what others will think, because what are they going to do?But it's not that you started to spam here and think that you have nothing to worry about. Properly following the Bitcoin rules should be considered if you want to stay here for a long period of time.And dear OP, you should avoid plagiarised content to post here because that can ban you instantly, so be open here, ask anything, and learn new things. Sometimes your questions are the questions of others, and they might be hesitating to ask them. Let me give you some inside info.Most of the time, high-ranking members hesitate to ask a question that looks childish, but when newbies ask those questions, it also helps them.",

Also note that many people came to this forum with zero knowledge about Bitcoin but with a commitment to learning, they are currently well grounded. You have been well-directed to different threads where you can get all the information you need to excel in this forum and the Bitcoin space. But you need to know specifically that plagiarism is a capital offense that can lead to your ban from the forum. The use of ChatGpt is also forbidden and can lead to severe punishment. The forum has different boards that discuss diverse subsystems of the Bitcoin space, take time and go through all these boards I am sure that one or more areas will interest you. The crypto space is highly dynamic and innovative so you need to keep learning and relearning to become relevant in the forum. It is good to learn from other sources but you can get almost all the information you need in bitcointalk.org if you keep searching.",
