However, in some rare cases, we might ask you to provide a Credit Card Validation form to ensure the safety of your transactions.How do I request a payout?After you have submitted all the necessary documents for proving your identity, you will be able to request a payout in the Cashier section of your account. If you are using your mobile device, you need to go to ‚ÄúMenu,‚Äù and then to the section ‚ÄúPayout‚Äù.QuoteEl Royale is operated by Wonder Play Company N.V. having its office in Willemstad, Curacao. Company Registration number 162233.When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding USD 2000 or requests a withdrawal of any amount at El Royale, they are obliged to undergo a full KYC procedure, wherein the user shall submit some basic details about themselves and then upload the files listed below:A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the doc)A selfie of themselves holding the ID docA bank statement/Utility BillYeah, pretty fair: give me 2K with no questions, but you won't be able to get a penny without fulfilling the rules.

Usually, KYC requirements are indicated on their ToS, not on their registration page. It usually scares away users after all and isn't really that advertising-friendly if they added it there. Registering from a banned country is allowed, and usually passes through for the first few days but once they check the accounts, they still usually get banned. They also need to cross-check for VPN usage as well. It's why you see so many people complaining about getting banned after a few days of playing. Plus, if they let you play on your own and then suddenly ban you, it's free money for them.",

When you want to create an account with any casino or other online platform, before you click on proceed or register, there is always a box in which they ask you to agree with their terms and conditions, or they will say, \"Clicking means you have agreed with their terms and conditions.\" Have you ever tried reading through those terms and conditions before proceeding with the registration?¬†Since you don't have the time to look out for the KYC, do they also have the need to ask for KYC from you? Until you have made a successful deposit and won a few games, that's when they will be like, \"Hey, that's reminding me.\" You have not passed the KYC, so why are you here?¬†Unless the casino is not genuine, if not, if they will ask for KYC, they will make it known to their customers, and if they will not ask for it, they will also let you know. You just have to look well and be patient with reading in order to discover what would have been shown to you in times of trouble.",

To add, all casinos have the same rule that they can ask for KYC. It's in all of their ToS. The difference is that some casinos don't ask for KYC. Here are KYC rankings. 1 equals that they will rarely ask for KYC upon a payout request. ¬†5 equals mandatory. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=717790.0",

For those who are reluctant to read the TOS, it can be quite cumbersome to enjoy the freedom of avoiding KYC while gaming.One thing I do when testing a new platform is to make a small deposit and then test a withdrawal with that balance. I do this not only on gambling platforms but also on exchange platforms. The information typically provided is the withdrawal limit that can be carried out without completing KYC, usually set at a certain amount in dollars. From there, I begin to observe the transaction withdrawal speed.At the very least, some of the steps I take during this testing process can help me make a well-informed decision about whether to use the platform or not.",
