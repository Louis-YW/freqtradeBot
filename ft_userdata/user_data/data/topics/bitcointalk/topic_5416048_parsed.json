  "content": "Alik Bakhshi Fuhrer Putin asked for peace      At the end of 2021, Putin began to actively prepare to complete his plan for the final takeover of Ukraine. In order to secure the tacit consent of the West to the planned aggression, Putin presented the NATO countries with an ultimatum not to join the alliance of the countries of the post-Soviet space, which should be legally fixed. However, in the ultimatum there is not a word about Russia's obligation to renounce territorial claims to the countries that left the Russian Empire. However, believing Putin, using the example of how Putin reacted to the Budapest Memorandum, is the same as trusting a wolf to guard a flock of sheep. Concluding any kind of agreement with a liar is obviously hopeless. (1) As a confirmation, in response to the alarming remark of Ukraine and the West about the concentration of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine, the liar Putin assured that this is a common army exercise. The President of Ukraine Zelensky, as a not stupid person, began to prepare the Ukrainian army for the invasion of Russian invaders. America responded to his request for help, supplying a batch of Jewels, which became the main weapon in the defeat of the Russian army near Kyiv at the very beginning of the war. The fact is that the Russians, as during the Second World War, assigned the main role to the tank attack. They did not expect how successful the American anti-tank weapons would be, the Ukrainians turned Russian tanks into burning torches with “jevelins”. The defeat of the Russians near Kyiv showed Moscow and the whole world that the Ukrainian people are ready to fight for the freedom of their homeland. Putin's hope that as soon as a Russian soldier crosses the border, the Ukrainian army will crumble, and the population will meet the invaders in Ukrainian style with bread and salt, turned out to be in vain. Yes, the meeting took place, but only with salt.     I must say, finally, the Ukrainian people were lucky to have a president. Zelensky proved to be a talented diplomat, he managed to convince the West that:  - Firstly, the people of Ukraine do not want to again play the role of a younger brother in the Russian world, the main asset of which is Lies.  - Secondly, the people of Ukraine are fighting not only for their freedom, but also for the future of Western democracy.   Thanks to Zelensky's active diplomatic activity, Ukraine is receiving modern weapons, which, according to Putin himself, have no analogues in Russia. The high motivation of the Ukrainian soldier, combined with Western weapons, made it possible not only to successfully defend against the Russian fascists (2), but also to move on to the liberation of the occupied territory, putting the Russian army to flight. The fact that things are deplorable in Russia at the front is evidenced by the announced mobilization, from which the Russians are fleeing, fleeing abroad, as well as Putin’s unexpected desire to sign a peace treaty with Ukraine, which he was going to denazify and demilitarize, and its leaders to be judged as fascists.   The St. Petersburg bandit, having killed thousands of people, ruined the country and seized part of its territory, asked for peace in a situation where his army was defeated. It's the same as if Hitler, at the time of the defeat of his army near Stalingrad, spoke about peace with the USSR, leaving behind the occupied territory. Putin's impudence is not naive, it is simply disgusting. After all, Hitler is a man, unlike the cowardly Putin, who is guarded from the people by an army of guardsmen. The Kremlin liar understands that a shameful end awaits his power, and even his life. I think Putin will not live to see the tribunal, the Russian people will not forgive Putin for the loss of the empire and will crucify their favorite at the gates of the Kremlin.1. Ultimatum as another impudence of Russia. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/77167.html2. Russian fascism. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/49653.html   05.10.2022",
