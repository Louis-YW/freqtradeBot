  "content": "So trying to verify 24.0 but using Kleopatra I keep getting a \"signatures could not be verified\" message.  I am guessing this is because I need at least one of the builder keys from the github key list.  But when I try to import one of them using this gpg.exe --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys E463A93F5F3117EEDE6C7316BD02942421F4889F I keep on getting \"keyserver receive failed: Certificate expired\" message, which surely can't be right, what am I doing wrong here.",

All three are processing Luke Dashjr's key normally without any errors.For the expired error that OP is receiving - I would first check that your system date and time is accurate, and then I would update Kleopatra/Gpg4win to the latest version, and see if that helps.",
