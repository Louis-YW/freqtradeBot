Does fairspin.io have a representative on the forum who can come to clarify things?Casinos know that by delaying withdrawals there are many people who do not resist the temptation to bet and end up losing. Some regulated fiat casinos also use some rule like that you cannot withdraw before 24 hours from your last deposit in this respect, but not with the degree of arbitrariness of this case. At the end of the day, I don't know why they use these ploys because I'm sure that people who have self-control problems, even if you let them withdraw quickly, with instant deposits many will re-deposit and lose.All you are doing is making yourself look bad in the eyes of your custom base.",

As much as I understand that casinos want their customers to keep gambling instead of withdrawing their money, asking the player to wager more just to speed up the security check is absurd and utter nonsense. Also, the casino's security check took a long time, which shouldn't happen at a casino that values its customers. That's very suspicious and worrying.",

The other red flag is that, their representative is still not here posting their side and that can conclude this site for that red flag. I wonder why it took days for that withdrawal and without even a help from the support. That can be address in just a week and yet almost a month now. I see their representative still active on posting, I hope to see their explanation here because if not, there will be a trust issue here and yes this is a big red flag for me.",

I have had withdrawals be checked and usually it takes a couple of hours to a day. Never seen something like a month of doing security checks.Â  Â Try sending a PM to the Fairspin casino representative on the forum.
