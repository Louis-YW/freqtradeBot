  "content": "Unlock the full course for only $2000, by following this link!The Long Awaited course is here!Today, Theymos has made a new captcha that flags you as a spammer if you do not complete it. It is a notoriously hard captcha, and so effective that I don't know why Google is still using reCaptcha. But anyway....How to play the gameGameplay - excuse me, I meant solving - is straightfoward. You have to put Flappy Bird through the pipes and collect a certain number of coins before you can win - I mean pass. after which you simply crash-land the bird and submit your post.Warnings:- Please try to solve the puzzle quickly, otherwise if you are unfortunate enough to pass and submit your post, you might have to solve it all over again because somebody (most likely a spammer) already replied to the topic, or your session expired.- Refresh the page frequently, so you're not wasting time for nothing.- Try to make the screen smaller. Nobody likes looking at a huge bird bobbing up and down followed by the screen descending into a quick and gory red color.- Do not use Space, up, down, right, left, etc. They will also move the page around and is the equivalent to having a giant squirrel on top of your F-15 cockpit glass.- The challenge is significantly harder when using touchscreen input, because randomly, one jump becomes a \"double jump\" and what ends up happening is that you smash your brains against the top of a broken pipe after you execute the perfect jump. (Though I suspect this is more of a bug PowerGlove forgot to fix than any malicious scheming for phone users )- Find your lucky key and stick to it. Don't use the mouse. It's full of your sweat and completely unreliable. Instead, use a key like Q, W, A, S, D or something. For me, my super key is \"S\".- You can actually fly above the pipes without getting splat... But if you do this, there is an 80% chance that your bird will turn into a missile and make a 50-ft crater in the ground.TechniquesLooking at the ground below, the roast turkey realizes its inevitable fate.\"If you want to play football, then you must think like a football manager.\" - Nobody everSo now that you have take up the brave challenge of collecting Bitcoins in hazardous locations, now it's time to see how exactly you can do that and come back in one piece right?The image above is a drawing of mine showing the strategies you can use to BYPASS THOSE PESKY PIPES (and eventually call Mario and Luigi to fix them).In it are shown three different tactics you can use when advancing towards the pipe.1. Normal Pass - you wait until the bird is level to the bottom pipe tip, and then you jump once. But don't wait too long, otherwise you will splat against the top of the pipe.2. Underpass - If the birdie is significantly below the pipe, then at a further and lower distance from the pipe, do two jumps (press any key twice).3. Overpass - This is the most dangerous pass of the three and comes with high risk that you will throw your keyboard our the window because your 20+ coins streak has been ruined by a stupidly executed overpass. But anyway, this jump is useful if you jumped over the pipes and now your F-15 fighter jet is on a collision course with the ground. Just press any key one the bird reaches the target range for an underpass, and watch your bird drift to safety.Critical: You have a 100 millisecond window to safely execute the overpass jump. Too early and you will ram into the bottom of the pipe tip, and too late and you will collide head-first into the bottom pipe without even jumping inside it.Even more critical: Do not attempt to jump while you are inside the gap. Attempting to do so will get your bird-brains smashed. The only exception where this is safe is if you are at the bottom-right area of the gap (but if you are unfortunate enough to get there it is more likely that you will crash into the bottom right part of the pipe first).Black zones - areas your bird must never enter. If your bird enters these areas it's game over. Because you will not be able to get your bird through the gap in time.The (inverse) scoreThe score, or as I affectionately call it, the inverse score, tells you how many bitcoins you have to collect before you pass the captcha. Note that these are not real bitcoins, and they are not being spent from the forum treasury, so relax, none of you are going to be millionaires playing this game.Ignore the score entirely! Treat the game as a survival mode type. Any lapse of attention away from your birdie's coordinates, and the US Air Force will come knocking demanding to know why you scuttled such a fine plane of theirs (in other words, you lose).The only thing you should be focusing on is getting the NEXT bitcoin, not how many coins are left. Because the moment you start thinking about that...DisclaimersNotATether is a professional Flappy-buster and the notice on the top of this thread does not affect the correctness of this guide.NotATether has no liability if you destroy any hardware or software as a result of failures to pass the captcha test by following the instructions in this guide.This is not investment advice.

This captcha is more difficult, and I don't think anyone has passed it because everyone is still getting the red note.I don't know about others, but I've been through this captcha many times before. It's complicated by the fact that you have to collect more coins each time. The first time I had two coins, the next time I had eleven(1). Although, in order to post this post, I needed to collect eight coins. It turns out that the number of coins is random each time.",

Dynamically typed languages are very much my \"second tongue\" (most of my background is in embedded systems) so the JavaScript is quite unidiomatic. During development, I only really had theymos in mind and not the wider world, so it would take some effort on my end to cut a release that I would be happy to share.It's also conceivable that parts of the project might get reused in the future and with forum members like you and TryNinja about, I don't want to be too forthcoming, if you know what I mean?  Of course, if anyone has gamedev questions about bird physics or sprite blitting, etc. then I'm happy to provide answers.",

Gravity pulls down on the bird at around 0.05 pixels per \"tick\" squared, where a tick is ~16.7 milliseconds. When a flap input is received, any accumulated velocity is canceled out and replaced with a 35 G impulse upwards.A fall from the top of the screen to the bottom terminates with the bird's velocity at around 4 pixels per tick. The bird is 7 pixels high, so that's about 34 birds per second. Assuming the bird is a chonky 12 inches (I know mine is) we're talking around 23 mph. Of course, if you fly high above the pipes then you can build up more impressive velocities. One regret I have is not finding the time to include any easter eggs, I wish I'd hidden a secret level below the floor that could only be accessed by crashing through it at >= 100 mph.

I thought it would run for a week, so I didn't continue playing after I was drunk early that day.Follow up question, what is the purpose of those coins? are there any easter egg reward or can we exchange those coins to something? I have missed a couple of times when I was trying to beat 99 laps coz the coins keep moving and I didn't bother that much since my goal is to finish the captcha/game, and then I saw the scoreboard yesterday with the accumulated coins. Maybe there is some sort of swap or reward?",
