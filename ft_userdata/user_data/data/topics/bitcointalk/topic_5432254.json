Just like your BTC being in binance doesnt count, there are a lot more ppl like you holding their btc in exchanges. So the number above is not fairly accurate.",

You say you're counting your balance, but you show the proof that the money you're counting is in others' pocket (in this case, Binance's).That's technically not your money. That's money Binance has promised they will give back to you if you will withdraw. But you know, promises can be broken...Most of my balance is in my own wallet. I won't lie, I have some at a centralized platform, but the amount is much smaller than yours.2.The chart means almost nothing in the context you've written, since a wallet can have more addresses and your chart is about addresses and not wallets.3.You should learn that it can be dangerous to tell publicly how much bitcoins you own. Internet is not forgetting and if bitcoin price jumps to $1M soon enough you may end up with bad people looking for you to get your coins that would then worth already $100k...",

How can I keep my Bitcoin safe?Day by day people are losing faith in the exchange after the FTX Centralized Exchange was hacked.  Now people don't want to store their cryptocurrency on centralized exchanges.  So they want to choose trusted wallets as an alternative to centralized exchanges.  A trusted wallet usually refers to a hardware or cold wallet.  Because the private key of the hardware or cold wallet is usually controlled by the user.  So there is no possibility of hacking.Some hardware & Cold wallets...Ledger Nano STrezor M1Safepal S1Steel Bitcoin walletTrezor Model T for Next GenerationSecux W20SecuxV20D'CENT Biometric walletEllipal titan BundleEllipal titan miniCoolwallet proAtomic WalletKeepKeyArmory offline bitcoin walletBitbox",

So let me tell you my friend that this is not safe at all. You didn’t aware what happened with FTX ? So as long as you have your balance in an exchange, you don’t own it completely.

I am holding some BTC in a private wallet, will try to invest more throughout 2023.The source is most probably https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.htmlHowever, since bitcoin blockchain is public, anybody can make such a chart.You seem even more confused than OP.What you mean by \"does it include 100% BTC holders data?\" - I mean, do you think that bitcoin's blockchain cares (holds info) about any other assets?!What you mean \"I am holding some BTC in a private wallet\"? Aren't all wallets private?! If it's a proper wallet, each address of yours will be counted in that list. If it's a custodial wallet, then it depends on many factors and, as I wrote in my first answer in this topic, in that case that's not your money anyway.You should really read more, and you should focus on real info, not the exchange platforms' advertising.Quote from: LDL on December 29, 2022, 09:53:24 AMAnyway everyone here suggested me to use hardware wallet but unfortunately till now I am not able to use hardware wallet.Just think like that. You buy a device at under 100$ and it can hold any amounts of coins safely. Plus it's very easy and straightforward to use.(Of course, depending whether you want to also hold shitcoins on it or not, you may have to be careful on what you buy.) Make a list of questions, ask if needed, clear up your mind and get your coins into safety.",
