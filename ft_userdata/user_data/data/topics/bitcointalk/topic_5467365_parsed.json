If your seed phrase has been generated by electrum, it's not BIP39. Quote from: kenobi1987 on September 19, 2023, 06:48:29 PMany suggestion ? or do i have to go through downloading electrum (if so will buy new computer ) ? will the old seed still be compatible or do i need to pull a old electrum versionThere is no need to go for an old version of electrum. You can use a new version of electrum. It's compatible with your seed phrase. If you worry about security of your computer, you should buy a new one or format your hard drive and reinstall your operating system. It may worth mentioning that you don't have to import your seed phrase into an online device. Electrum allow you to sign transactions offline.",

      "body": "To add to o_e_l_e_o's post:Electrum is open source and the algorithm it uses for deriving private keys from the seed phrase is available to the public. The private keys are derived from your seed phrase locally on your own device and you don't rely on any third parties for that. Even if electrum developers abandon the project and their website is shut down, you will be still able to derive your private keys from your seed phrase.",
