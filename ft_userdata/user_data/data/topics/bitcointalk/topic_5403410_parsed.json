  "content": "Iran have been on the support of cryptocurrency mining for a long. Recently it stopped the operation of thousands of cryptocurrency miners running without proper registration. This illegal usage of electricity is identified and further 118 cryptocurrency mining farms were given with licence. Now considering the summer and the need for more electricity the miners supply were cut. According to data collected by Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) Iran contributed 4.5% of Bitcoin mining during the May month last year and this dropped down to 0.12% January 2022. Will this have any impact over the price drop of bitcoin.Iran Cuts Power to All Licensed Crypto Miners",

It says the country will cut power to all licensed miners but then it also continues saying that this action is to be implemented to cut off power to illegal mining operations. I don't know if this article is only badly written or the official directive of the country is also confusing. It is badly merging two different statements.1. Iran is always fighting illegal miners who are mostly stealing electricity to mine cryptocurrencies (with basically free electricity). The operation against them is always intensified during summer since the electricity consumption naturally grows a lot.2. Power is supposedly going to be cut for undefined period to legit miners with licence like some other industries to pre-plan for the natural increase in electricity consumption.Quote from: dansus021 on June 21, 2022, 02:36:43 AM\"Due to international sanctions, Iran lacks the investment needed in power generation capacity and natural gas production to keep up with consumption.That is nonsense. Iran has the biggest gas reserves in the world and is currently extracting the highest amount per day, that is more than we can use and most of it is being exported.The problem is that manufacturing of new power plants hasn't been as fast as speed of consumption increase. For example the construction of the 2 new nuclear power plants would take another year to finish which is normal but still it can't keep up with the consumption. There are 2 more under construction that would take longer than that.QuoteFor political reasons, the Iranian government spends over $60 billion annually in indirect subsidies to depreciate electricity prices\"That is partially nonsense. Energy in Iran has always been cheap because we have the biggest reserves in the world and extraction of it is easy and the quality is high (eg. the oil is light and doesn't need much effort to extract). Also due to exchange rate and the sudden drop of it 4-5 years ago the cost becomes a lot smaller when converted to dollars.",

I don't know if this article is only badly written or the official directive of the country is also confusing. I do not think the article is badly written, when crypto mining was legalized in Iran, some miners were mining illegally and the illegal mining is increasing, this will consume more electricity that the illegal miners are not paying for, so it is not helping the government and the country. We can just put it like this, because of the sinful ones, the holy ones are also punished.

The government had done such earlier and point to more electricity to be available during summer to be the reason, done earlier means it was not done this time, but in the past recent time. But maybe this would be temporary as that time earlier may also be in connection with this.",

Obviously, difficulty will adjust, and mitigate that. I think the main problem has been that mining in the West, at Western electricity costs, meant there wasn't many doing it in the West, and usually either resorted to offshoring their machines or looking for alternative energy methods.",
