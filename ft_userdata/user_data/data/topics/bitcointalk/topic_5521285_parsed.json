For a financially savvy person it is not a secret, but for many people who have a vague idea about finances, it is a secret.Everything is relative, my other one.Even bitcoin for many, decades later, remains a \"secret\" financial instrument. Practically inaccessible.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 01, 2024, 03:14:26 PMDo your job. Innovate, produce, make money.Trade your fiat currency for the scarcest asset.Hold the scarcest asset.No one who is sensible will store \"wealth\" in money, because it is not a tool for \"preserving\" wealth, but for exchanging \"value\".A scarce asset (resource) can be anything. Be it a piece of land, one of Stradivarius' violins, a share (stock) of a technology (and other) company.But within the framework of communication on this forum, of course, bitcoin is voiced.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 01, 2024, 03:14:26 PMThat's it. It's all about delayed gratification. The hardest part is to actually hold it. Bitcoin has an addressable market cap hundreds of trillions of dollars worth more than it currently does. Don't be the guy who traded it with a 99% discount. This is not difficult if you allocate \"free\" funds for exchange for a scarce asset, and not the last, or even worse, borrowed money. Well, and of course, moderate your \"appetite\" for spending on all sorts of useless nonsense.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on December 01, 2024, 03:14:26 PMIt amazes me how difficult it is for some people to grasp that. Here we have the influence of the \"noise\" of the consumer society, generated by companies to \"pull\" money out of people. A banal redistribution of resources. If many begin to increase their own wealth, then corporations will not receive this wealth.That is, the propaganda of consumption is cultivated in society, which is difficult for people to get rid of. And without this, they can't move to the next level of \"awareness\" of how to get rich, which precedes the correct strategy for increasing wealth.",

It amazes me how difficult it is for some people to grasp that.  Any commodity that is scarce in circulation has the ability to make someone rich , and holding on to such commodity is key as scarcity is what defines the price value of a particular commodity, even in Bitcoin it's so those who have Bitcoin assets should keep holding it because the price is always appreciating so don't wast your priced jewels by selling it in the current price the secret of creating wealth is scarcity",

You have to understand that human friends are smart and stupid, and that will always exist, so there is no need to worry about those who don't listen, this world is too wide if you only focus on those who can't adapt and want to progress to be better.Even though their eyes clearly see how bitcoin provides benefits to its holders, but they are still afraid and don't want to make any moves, the answer is because they are stupid, that has become a conclusion that we must realize today why many people still ignore bitcoin, and you know what will happen if bitcoin becomes rarer and more expensive? they will ask, \"is buying bitcoin now good?\".
