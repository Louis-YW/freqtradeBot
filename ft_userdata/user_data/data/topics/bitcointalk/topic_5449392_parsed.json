Betting on casino depend how lucky or not we are but difference when betting on specific spot like soccer or NBA, every one know well with team underperformance and team have top performance. Beside some people betting because their favorite team are playing and not matter in bad performance or not but how excited with his favorite sport team. You can feel if you have favorite sport team and will bet for them who ever against team despite favorite winning or not with your favorite team.",

(One lucky punch or kick can make a underdog a champion) Please share your thoughts...  I love soccer as it is the most popular sport in the world and information for the major leagues is available in plenty amounts to anyone with internet access.It may look like it is easy to win and in fact it should be but since gambling has been introduced in 1997-1998 in the online world the games started not coming up as predicted anymore,before those years we rarely saw surprise results and when there were,they were just one game or two during the whole season not like now which surprise results are very common in almost every week.Another thing that makes betting difficult is the referee,in the game of Sunday Valencia vs Sevilla the referee impacted the game badly for Valencia by not giving a flagrant penalty.Nevertheless I as many people still bet on soccer as for me is the easiest sport to bet on.",

As many people are watching football and also prefer it, there are more people that prefer football betting. As for me, I personally prefer football betting because I am more exposed to football and it is what we mostly talked and argue about.It is what you know that you will bet on. People that know much about other sport also bet on it. If you know about tennis, you will find yourself betting on it too. So is basketball too and others.",

In sport betting, there's no priority place for any one in it, everyone has equal opportunity to get what he has base on his ability to make the best out of it, each individual gambler take his own risk to gamble and decided for themselves what game they play and hiw they make use of their playing strategy to gamble, if it were to be a quick one to win then u think every gambler would have love to always engage on sport betting than any other types of gambling bets we make, which means there's equal opportunity regardless of the type used.Quote from: Kakmakr on April 19, 2023, 06:36:38 AMI know most people will favor certain Sport, because they know more about the players or the teams and information is power, when it comes to betting... but some Sport are 50/50 when it comes to the outcome of the match.

(One lucky punch or kick can make a underdog a champion) Please share your thoughts...  I really only bet on certain sports because I only bet on sports that I understand, as you said, I know about the strength of teams, information on the strengths of even players, for example football, because I know a little about some clubs as well as their teams, so of course it takes careful calculation to bet there , so far I have only bet on football sports betting and have never bet on other sports because I don't know much about other sports so it's best not to make bets that we don't know the science of.There are many sports that can be a field of money for us, whether it's boxing and other sports, there are even lots of tempting odds, but what's the point if I don't understand the strength of each team or individual I bet my money and I will lose my money for being wrong choose without knowledge. that's clearly not very good",

(One lucky punch or kick can make a underdog a champion) Please share your thoughts...  I definitely prefer to bet on sports where it is more of a binary outcome, like football where you can place a win or lose/draw bet. It's the mentality of getting rich slowly if you pick correctly and don't get too greedy. It's just far too easy to lose money on things like a 16 horse race, where the odds look really attractive but random bad luck can regularly prevent the favourite from winning but good luck picking a long shot too! eSports can be quite fun and lucrative if you follow the players closely.",

It also depends on the casino games that you select, but I prefer the ones like Roulettes.Quote from: 348Judah on April 19, 2023, 06:53:24 AMIn gambling, ensure you do what you're good at, gamble the best game you're interested in, you're the one playing and you make use of your own money, decide for yourself and not others for you. It is gambling, you can decide for yourself, but sometimes friends influence can be there especially if you are gambling with friends. But in gambling, no one is forcing anyone to gamble or not, people decide for themselves has been what I noticed.",

I think betting should not be seen as luck based gambling option. If you know teams/players better, your chance of winning increases a lot. You can hit greater odds with secret knowledges.",

And if by chance that the outcome didn't favor you because the under wins, then there's nothing you can do about it.Even at 1.01 you are not sure that you are going to win, but there are bettors willing to put huge money, millions but we have one thread that even at that odds he didn't win. And it's more entertaining to bet on games, and you are in the edge of the sit praying that you are going to win your bets.",

I have seen a MMA or boxing champion never lose in his whole career e.g. Jon Jones and Mayweather, but look at basketball and football, both Nuggets and Arsenal have suffer few losses in this season.Let me throw my two cents - I think chances of underdog wins in combat sports are greater compared to team play. For underdog to win, just one person needs to fail. For underdog team to win, a whole opponent team must suck. You have mentioned Jon Jones and Mayweather - those two are unique, but even they have controversial wins in their careers. Also, one of the reason of their undefeated careers are their managers. Not saying that they had easy opponents in their whole careers, but some of them surely were cherry picked. If you google MMA (or better UFC, as it will be easier to find) upsets of 2022, you would see that nearly every third undefeated/champion/huge favourite lost to a huge underdog. Specially in women UFC/MMA. There were cases when a champ losses to an underdog with +8 odd. Can you imagine Arsenal loosing to your local school football team? No, but in MMA such things can happen. That is why I bet on UFC. I think I am good at making predictions (at least arguments are strong ) and there is a high chance that a unrealistic bet could win.",
