Can you add a link to your forum account to any of the verified Coinstore (CEX) accounts?Do you list any currency as long as it pays more or do you have standards? I did not see that you mentioned any standards or conditions to prevent listing, and how many amounts you request or the minimum.I read many reviews about Coinstore and they all talk about either glitching or difficulties with the site’s stability and withdrawal.",
