I don't think the Nigerian SEC has the same goal as the US SEC. As far as I'm aware, in my country, the same thing happened a few months ago. As of now, crypto exchanges need to register locally, have an office here, and so on before they can operate legally. The goal is to make crypto taxation easier, or in other words, exchange will help the government to record and to tax every trade made on their platform. Basically, the government wants some control and earns more taxes from the industry. I won't be surprised if this is the goal here. CMMIW.",

But it is like a means that Nigeria SEC is using to planning to regulate exchanges.As Charles-Tim stated, the Nigerian government is attempting to make everything totally regulated in order to oversee some of its activities and collect some revenue from any exchange operating in the country. However, I am curious as to why only Binance is being restricted currently.

They want to make money out of the market of a country without securing a license. Without being registered, it means Binance isn't paying any taxes. But the point is really simple. Without a license, it is operating illegally. So once the authorities know about this, they will surely make them stop whatever it is they are doing.",

They are nothing more than other Binance-like exchanges. Maybe the Nigeria SEC do not know much about these exchanges yet.

I believe the Nigerian government is simply searching for a way to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies by imposing tax on the exchanges that operate in the country to generate revenue for the country. This could be the cause for the ban, and if they are successful with Binance, they may come after the rest of the exchanges operating in Nigeria. Binance was possibly targeted because of its big user base in Nigeria, compared to other exchanges that citizens utilize there.",
