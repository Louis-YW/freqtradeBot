  "content": "Website: CryptoWebDirectory.comI created this website in early 2021 to give project developers and other crypto-related websites a place they could get listed to get additional exposure for their projects. As the domain suggests, this is a website where people can submit their crypto-related website, token or other project and have it listed with a backlink going back to their website.Domain is registered with DynaDot and the site runs Wordpress. If someone wants to have their website listed they will use the contact form to reach you via email. Once you collect payment from them just take the information they send you (which I also explain is required on the Add Your Listing page) and put it into a new post like you would any new blog post in Wordpress. I currently have the price of a listing set at $25USD but you could make this whatever you want.Price: $100 (Bitcoin/Litecoin)Contact me if you have any other questions. Thanks!",
