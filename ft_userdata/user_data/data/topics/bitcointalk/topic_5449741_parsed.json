      "body": "One person cannot change Nigeria; just as the slogan goes, \"the change begins with you and me,\"\" but corruption is almost in every government sector and work force sector of the country. For example, during the period when the country was faced with the new cash issues, some bank managers were hodling the new currency and selling it to other rich men for their selfish interests, while the poor mass were suffering to get cash. Also, in the oil sector, those who are involved in the exportation of crude oil and importation of refined products are corrupt, with no better refinery in Nigerian, while the country is rich enough to archive a standard refinery if they want. Insecurity! People should just be careful. Mind how you give out information about yourself to people. I mean, information that can cause people around you to envy you and want to do bad things against you. If going to bad areas at night is what makes it insecure, then respect that fact and avoid late-hour movement. Just take precautions first to be safe first.We don't need to always rely solely on the government for a job; we should probably learn a skill, open a business if we can, and when our business becomes successful, we should also employ others. By doing so, we are also adding value to society. Well, that's just my opinion.",

Na so we see am so o. The issue of corruption don too much for we country. Virtually all parastatals  is in one way or the other infested with the corrupt leadership, coupled with staff who in one way or the other know the activities of the various bosses  corrupt attitude and would want to remedy the situation in getting their ways too.Like I always say, the system here in Naija needs total overhauling from the top to bottom. We need new minds, new intellect's and vibrant  leaders void of corrupt traces in their profile.It is not a thing of waiting for God to give us a Messiah. The leadership system was approved of God to man make sure man has a system working in other for the benefits of all. Here we are still struggling with the system bringing in bad leadership to lead the affairs of man in the name of government. Not just government but a corrupt system of government. The opportunity we had in the just concluded election was robbed of by the power that be  in favor of their corrupt practices and continuation of their bad governance.This is how the situation has been and it would continue till we sit up and take the bull by the horns.",

Nigeria need to remove any form of immunity on any political leader as incumbent leader or had led before. The judiciary should be totally independent and not under the control of any politician in the name of money. To ensure this things become effective, the judiciary , health workers and teachers should be the highest paid civil servant. This will ensure them working in good health lacking nothing that could make them errand boy for politician.To make Nigeria a glorious nation again, integrity, faithfulness and obedience and equality before the law irrespective of status must be taught with practical examples and reference to men who had made difference through this way of life from child's early days of learning in school. Political office should be paid as other civil servant, today our politicians fight for the position because it's an avenue to be rich and become popular. There should be a total removal of unnecessary allowance. Nigerian must not allow politicians use tribal difference and history of bad times make us enemies, they do this so that you can be on their side to achieve their purpose. Let's begin to see ourselves as one. Those who ignite the problem are passing away, so we should not carry this problem as our instead start a new life of the new Nigeria Nigeria is a great country, we will all live to see the new Nigeria.With the way things are going, it's better we adopt Blockchain to monitor how Nigeria fund is been disbursed so that snake and elephant won't swallow our money again.",
