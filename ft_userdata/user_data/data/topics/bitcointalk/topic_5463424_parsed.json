Will it function as a safe haven similar to gold? Or will its value decline significantly?Check bitcoin price history from 2012 to 2016, from 2016 to 2020 and from 2020 to today's price. You will noticed that bitcoin is a store of value. If you have bitcoin, there is chances that you will gain than if you have gold which is another benefit of holding bitcoin. But bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, that still make some people not to see bitcoin as a store of value, but if you hold it in long term, it is a store of value.",

If the value reduces significantly, the price of Bitcoin might likely pump up so high that it matches the current dollar value.Those who are afraid of inflation, which the economic crisis might cause, and have access to Bitcoin will likely covert or exchange most of their assets into Bitcoin in order to escape what's to come. But not everyone will see Bitcoin as a safe heaven no matter the circumstances of the economy, as they still highly believe in their monetary system and how it is being run, and such people will likely want to trust their assets with what they don't believe in.",

Or will its value decline significantly?what do you think ?I would say that you shouldnt really be only focused with Bitcoin but rather it would really be always that best or ideal that you should be finding several or a couple of sources of income so thatif ever that economic crisis would happen then you would really be able to make yourself that sustain because you do able to earn still some income which it isnt really just limited on your day job.Im aint saying that Bitcoin isnt a solution but rather it is one of the solutions but it wont really be that enough i would say considering that we do need to spend up on day to day for us to live.This is why it would be always that ideal or wise on having that multiple source rather than on focusing on a single point.There's no such thing about safe haven but on the time that you would be able to have that multiple source then whatever the things happen around then you wouldreally be that confident since you could really be able to sustain and survive on such situation or condition.",

Â Bitcoin's decentralized and limited supply nature could be attractive to those who are concerned about traditional monetary systems and their potential vulnerabilities which are capable as a safe haven investment.So IMO, Bitcoin has the potential to offer certain benefits and attributes that could be valuable during an economic crisis, but it's not a guaranteed solution if there's an upcoming economic crisis.",

Or will its value decline significantly?what do you think ?Potentially this could easily be a safe haven actually since as we notice the market price of Bitcoin or if we check the Bitcoin timeline we could easily see that the market price just continues an incline and continue to increase over the years, with the increasing demand of bitcoin and the huge bitcoin adaptation around the world we could easily expect that the market price is going to huge in the coming years, I mean it just the nature of Bitcoin or how it was structure with just 21 million supply and the increasing demand this is probably going to be a huge safe haven actually, I mean one thing is the inflation, with just investing our money on cryptocurrency or bitcoin we could potentially bypass the inflation which is already a big problem around the globe.It might be similar to gold that holds a value, I mean it was already compared to a lot of gold or even called digital called in the past years, but still, this cryptocurrency or Bitcoin is still a new thing and possibly be the future so there was no guaranteed that Bitcoin is going to hold its value on the economic crisis. I mean last time when there are news about war the market price drop a huge percentage so possible it could be the case in the future as well.",

Allen.You can see the research methodology and details of the results and their analysis but I will quote:QuoteThe results of the tests of the measures of association between the returns on the S&P500 Index and the returns on these two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods all tell a similar story, regardless of linear and parametric measures, or non-linear and non-parametric measures being adopted.In the pre-COVID-19 period, the regression analysis suggests that there is a significant positive association between the two cryptocurrency returns series but no significant relationship with the S&P500 Index returns. Kendallâs tau tests of correlation provide a similar set of results. The results change in the post-COVID-19 period, and whilst the relationship between the two cryptocurrency returns series remains positive and significant, there is now a positive and significant relationship between the returns on both cryptocurrency returns series and the returns on the S&P500 Index. Kendallâs tau metric also suggests significant and positive relationships between all three series.cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin and Etheureum do not provide a strong potential portfolio diversification tool, at least in the context of this particular crisis. This result is consistent with the findings of Massoumi and Wu (2021); Kristoufek (2020); Conlon et al. (2020); Lahmiri and Bekiros (2020); Grobys (2021).Based on it, we can say that Bitcoin (in its current state) is not the asset that can be considered a safe haven or to diversify investment and risks when global crises occur, but this thing may change in the future.",

But there's also an argument to be made that the next few years might be a bit too early for bitcoin to reach the masses.Well I believe that in terms of increasing in price it will continue to do so as the cycles progress and that, although the returns will not be those of the former, the evolution of Bitcoin in fiat terms will far outstrip inflation.What I don't see is why it should reach the masses. The masses will be reached by CBDCs and for Bitcoin to succeed as a store of value, as it already is, you don't need everyone to use it. It would simply be enough for less than half of the people who buy gold as an investment to use it, because you have to think that gold can be used as jewelry, while Bitcoin cannot. And as limited as it is, I think it is not so much a question of how many people want it as how much money the big players are willing to spend to get it.",

Why don't you search for older forum threads instead of creating a new one.To be honest, I don't think that the Bitcoin price could rise in times of economic stagnation and monetary restrictions. It's historically proven that the Bitcoin price rises in times when \"money machine goes brrrr....\". Maybe the upcoming crisis will be more like stagflation rather than a classic recession/depression, so the central banks will keep pumping money in order to save the economy. In that case, Bitcoin could potentially serve as safe heaven. On the other hand, I don't think that Bitcoin could dethrone the classic safe heaven-gold. BTC is still more risky and volatile than gold.",

As for Bitcoin itself, it still has the potential to increase and decrease in the not so distant future, although if you want to use it as a safe haven, I think that's fine too because you can still wait for a price increase to get a better value than before through Bitcoin. But with gold, you are just like saving money expecting value stability through assets and for predicting the value of Bitcoin myself, I personally still can't be sure whether it will drop significantly again, or even increase significantly again for certain reasons such as cycles and others.",

But if we talk about safe haven for now it cannot happen knowing the big risk they can possibly face and maybe they can't cope up with its volatility especially if the price fall and some people cannot do any good decisions especially if they are new accumulators. Maybe we can see a lot of hype for bitcoin as alternative when crisis occur and for sure we can see people will accumulate to anticipate for possible pump. New accumulators should make sure that they will not buy in FOMO because if the hype fades for sure they might lose their money for wrong anticipation on turns of events.",

Gold or Digital gold are centralised in nature, that is they are governed or ruled by a particular body, but in the case of Bitcoins, itâs decentralised. Now regarding the value of Bitcoins during a crisis might surely come down, but as these are limited in numbers, soon the price will go up also.

In the short term, some chances can be evaluated. In many countries where the local currency is not the dollar or the euro, people have been in a very difficult situation due to both inflation and the depreciation of local currencies. Countries with the local currency of the dollar or the euro were also in trouble with inflation. It still continues this way. Especially the people of the countries in the situation I gave an example see Bitcoin as a safe haven. Many citizens of countries whose local currencies are devalued should invest in Bitcoin. They will always win in the long run.The size of the economic crisis is also important. If there is a major crisis around the world, I can still see Bitcoin as a safe haven. Of course there are many alternatives. You can research and learn. Everyone has their own preferences. Some argue that Bitcoin may not be safe during a crisis.",

This isn't really something we should be aiming at because it would be better if we could end up with a return that would be bigger.By basic sense, what I mean is that if there is a 10% inflation in your nation and you made 10%, then you didn't made any profit at all, if your nation has 10% inflation and you made 7% then in fact you made a loss and if your nation has 10% inflation but you made 15% then you started to make some profit. That's how it's calculated and thankfully I am doing better than I expected, right now I am making more income than what the inflation has risen so I am making a profit.",
