      "body": "It's not surprising reading the stereotypes about bitcoin because of the fall. The media outlets which are just enemies of bitcoin will find any chance to attach every exchange or crypto bad news to bitcoin. They feel it could discourage people out of it.This bear market is another opportunity for new investors to get a good deal of bitcoin at a cheaper rates and to also test the patience of the already existing investorsPersonally I don't see bitcoin coming lower than 15k although I think the bear markets will take longer time than we expected, because of the inflation happening and the looming recession talked about. If you check the immediate upsurge after falling to 15k you will see that it cannot go lower than that",

Those who are buying are an experienced investors who already went through bear market and know how good of an opportunity bitcoin is at the moment. You know what they say, \"everyone buys bitcoin at the price they deserve\".Quote from: Zaguru12 on November 11, 2022, 07:35:43 PMPersonally I don't see bitcoin coming lower than 15k although I think the bear markets will take longer time than we expected, because of the inflation happening and the looming recession talked about. If you check the immediate upsurge after falling to 15k you will see that it cannot go lower than thatSince bitcoin already went close to 15k, I would be very surprised if it doesn't go below in the upcoming days. Thing is, I don't think that we are out of the woods yet becase fall of FTX might bring few other names down. Either buying, I already started buying (bought more bitcoin at ~~15800 last night) but I won't go all and will rather wait and see how this plays out.",

Just stay calm everyone, on the contrary, it could be a perfect time to accumulate. Remember that we have the halving in 2024, the catalyst for a bull run, so it's better to stack sats when they are very cheap right now at $16k. For sure when we look back, we will say that we survived this dump, just like we survived the Covid-19 crashed.",

And you have to realized that the current dump is not by bitcoin's doing. We are just affected by the FTX drama, so somewhat a collateral damage like when the Terra Luna crash as well.As for the FUD, never mind them, just for the record, according to them, Bitcoin has died \"X\" times already:https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/",

But I wouldn't rule out more bad news following from FTX upheaval. Maybe Tether will finally become an issue as it has be rumored again and again. But since is didn't result in any bad news it's probably a news like \"yellowstone will erupt soon\" while it doesn't happen actually...However, I'm bullish and expect to see Bitcoin rising at least above 20k again in December.",
