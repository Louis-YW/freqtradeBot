For many members here for we local board Dem no go fit expose their identity. Even me self I no go warn come that kind seminar Because you know very well say we country no good and no so so bad things dey sub with many bad people Dem every where. Since I dey into this crypto matter, na only my friends Dem na know because them too still dey do crypto. Now imagine say den con organize such gathering and some bad people Dem con follow come all the people there go dey in danger because them go dey reason say since na Bitcoin all of una supposed get better money. The forum get everything wey we need to learn for here and I really no see watin we wan come learn pass this one for that kind seminar.",

      "body": "Privacy is something many people in our industry take very seriously. They respect the privacy of others and are reluctant to jeopardize their privacy. You've raised some valid points to consider, but I don't think it's acceptable. If we want to share knowledge, we can do so personally with the individuals we want to share it with, whether they are younger or older. This is because Bitcoin is not yet fully accepted as legal tender in Nigeria. The government has imposed various bans and increased taxes on traders. Bitcoin is still considered illegal in Nigeria, which is why gatherings involving Bitcoin are not permitted. Let's continue to play it safe and observe the development of Bitcoin in our country before implementing the actions you mentioned. I can gather a lot of information about any active member on the local board without meeting them in person. So, if it's about sharing knowledge with members here, there's no need to do it physically; it's already happening here, even right now.",
