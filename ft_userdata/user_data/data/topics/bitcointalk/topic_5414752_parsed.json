Thank you.Why not use P2P exchange on CEX like Binance, Kucoin and OKX. Some of this exchange offers free service fee and most them only charge few percentage that less than 1% to the total amount which is very small compared to the risk that you will take on doing a meetup transaction to some random user here.",
