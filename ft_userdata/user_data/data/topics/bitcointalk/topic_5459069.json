But if the merchant uses a custodial service that converts BTC into fiat immediately, then the process may be faster.",

      "body": "The details in your question are not clear to me, but in general, the feasibility of \"physical\" bitcoins as a currency has been explored in the past. Initially, it seems like a good idea, but so far it has not been shown to be practical -- primarily because of the cost of making the physical currency.Now, physical bitcoins are bought by collectors. You can take a look at the marketplace for physical bitcoins here: Economy > Marketplace > Goods > Collectibles",

It is used as collectibles but not very popular for some obvious reasons, like it being potentially stolen.Quote from: Riginac111 on July 08, 2023, 02:19:40 PMin future with such chips that's like a bank token you can make payment with bitcoin  with less network service of bitcoin confirmation.The future of Bitcoin is not in it becoming a physical commodity and it does not in any way make transactions easier except you plan on handing people the physical bitcoin pieces. That will not be smart either cause the person will have back ups of it and can sweep the coins before you do.You need to identify an actual problem before preferring a solution.- Jay -",

If this idea is what you meant for, it has existed already.By using mobile wallets or QR code scanning to initiate transactions, we utilize the existing infrastructure of the payment terminals and didn't require physical microchips or special hardware.",

Good, if what i said can be put into program and it can be possibly achieve that means that people who is good in coding should work on it, because it seems that something like this will make bitcoin to be more influential to the world if implemented, if I'm a good coders will makes research and program some electronic devices that will add meaning for existence of Bitcoin",

Such imaginable   chip/device would undermine the   integrity and decentralized essence of Bitcoin, its primary strength that prevents network from been controlled by single entity and make it trustless.  Furthermore, if  a single chip/device were compromised (for instance by maker)  it would represent a single point of failure or attack, thereby placing all funds transiting trough it at risk.",
