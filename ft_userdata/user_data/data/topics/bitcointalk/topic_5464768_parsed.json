  "content": "In recent time, inflation in Nigeria is on a high rate as the nationâ€™s economy is biting harder. It isn't seen that things will change as soon as possible. Therefore, it better for one to plan on how to live his/her life with the recent economy. The following tips could be helpful:ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Create a realistic monthly budget.Using your monthly take-home pay, set a budget that works with your lifestyle and spending habits. Ensure it's a budget you can keep. Work with this budget every month.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Avoid unnecessary visit.After the removal of fuel subsidy, transportation is very costly. If care isn't taken, one can spend more than one-third of his/her salary on transport. Moving up and down unnecessary can cost you more. Making one to spend more on transport and this may affect ones monthly budget.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Get a side hustle job.Depending on monthly salary alone may not solve any problem. An average Nigeria man will spend above #2000 a day, this is #60000 monthly which is far higher than the minimum wage. Doing something that can earn you extra money can help you out during this economic downfall.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Avoid borrowing or unnecessary loan.Some people are found of borrowing money on monthly basis to cope with this economic downfall. This isn't a good solution at the moment because you keep incurring debt on yourself every month. Loan is the worst as this come with high interest at the moment.

Avoid spending money on an item you can do without. Not all item is necessary to purchase at this moment. This money can be save to purchase more valuable items or use for more important thing.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Try buying your goods at a cheaper place.Avoid getting item at an expensive place when you can get the same item else where at a cheaper price. For example, buying a cloth you can get for #5K at Mokola for #9K at a boutique may not help the present situation. This is a money mistake that shouldn't be made at this moment.ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Invest in yourself.The best investment in life is for one to invest in himself.

Making one to spend more on transport and this may affect ones monthly budget.If you don't have an important place to go,it is better that you stay at home or visit friends within your area,instead of going to a party for fun at a long distance.Quote from: odunybiz on August 27, 2023, 11:05:36 PMðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Get a side hustle job.Depending on monthly salary alone may not solve any problem.

Doing something that can earn you extra money can help you out during this economic downfall.The way things are in Nigeria,one shouldn't depend on one means of income,when you are not been paid heavily. Establish yourself,because it is only daily income jobs or business that can put food on your table daily without a problem.Quote from: odunybiz on August 27, 2023, 11:05:36 PMðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Avoid borrowing or unnecessary loan.Some people are found of borrowing money on monthly basis to cope with this economic downfall. This isn't a good solution at the moment because you keep incurring debt on yourself every month. Loan is the worst as this come with high interest at the moment. Getting unnecessary loan for feeding, fashion and expensive shelter put you in more debt as you keep struggling to pay back.Infact,if you don't have a means to pay back the loan or you are that greedy type that don't like to pay back loan. Forget about getting a load to avoid additional expenses.Quote from: odunybiz on August 27, 2023, 11:05:36 PMðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Avoid spending money on unnecessary items.For the time being, you should learn how to minimize your spendingWise buying is the only way out currently with the situation of things in our country.

But just to add one more survival skill which is: 1: Eating twice a day instead of the 3 miles a day we are used to,Â  research has it that an average adult can survive on 1 meal a day,Â  which is quite realistic and a lot money money-saving mechanism to stay above the current situation.

Lolz. at the moment, economy don make some people to dey eat 0-0-1 so eating twice seems like a luxury. The OP mentioned that 2k+ can be spent in a day by an average man but the annoying part is you don't get value for what you spent. QuoteLearning a new skill is also a good alternative but then being committed to building on your skills and consistently developing and advancing on them is and will be quite helpful, You can be a crypto/blockchain analyst or become a professional content creator like me and you here in the forum.  This part can't be overemphasized. Arming yourself with marketable skills go help keep you afloat for this kind of country because if one continues to wait on the government to provide jobs, e go tey. Some people be jack of all trades, master of none. Learn and be good at what you do, that way you fit become employer of labor too.",

This time around peso no suppose do pass em self just to meet up with the people wey d get their own money from illegal means(fraud). Anyway, people don learn to comport themselves this time around. Even the so called yahoo people don learn to cut their unnecessary spending cos the economy of the country is not smiling at any one. Everyone don learn how to spend less by force. The issue of procrastination na em be d main thing wey d affect many people. Many no d dey ready to serve or to learn a particular skills. Na quick money many want or travel out.
