So scam has never been a scam, because despite the economic hardship wey dey this country, you go notice say it's always easy for educated people to fine good paying jobs (either online or physical) than the illiterate ones, and example is this forum signature campaign, whereby it only take an educated person to fit into this kind of job, hereby making it remain a nightmare for those who never went to school. However, from research i'm made to understand that it's only 31% of the total Nigerian population is said to be illiterate, and as such it means the number of educated people are far more than the illiterate onesNigeria’s illiteracy rate is now 31%, says FG",

Because taking you for example, do you think it would have been possible for you to be here on this forum without the basic ability to read & write?? The answer is \"NO\"... And likewise that goes to all of us here on this forum, because with the basic ability to read & write, the relationship we keep and the environment we find ourselves helps us to progress in life. You don't have to be a graduate, but with the right update, you fit make am in this life.",

Anyway @makus watin you talk I side am well well, yes we must get watin they give us money like one or two means of survival before we consider to invest for this investment way we dey call bitcoin, just imagine say you no get job how you won take invest for bitcoin abi the person won go thief or the person won go beg to get money to invest? You see @samlucky O you must get work before you invest for bitcoin so that when your capital mistakenly loss e no go affect you because you get another means of survival (job).",

And that phrase might correct and also be false. Why might be correct is that, most of our leaders our not educated but dem dey rule the most educated ones and even cut their salaries.Yes the illiterates ones can not join bitcoin investment because they can write and read so whenever things wey Happened, they are doom with it.

You are absolutely correct. About your explanation if you check this thread it was created when I newly registered on BTT and most of the topic created where do to how I think I knew things, but as time goes on i have another shape of knowledge. Normally this thread is out of date an shouldn't have been brought out. If you ask me I will say with my knowledge now this thread need to be adjusted. For example this particular paragraph of mineQuote from: Samlucky O on August 21, 2023, 02:58:05 AMMy people e just come to my notice say unemployment for don reduce for naija if many people were educated and informed about Bitcoin. is totally wrong because even educated people don't have work and still struggling to survive. Education is not a guarantee for success but prepares you ahead of the future. What education does is to keep you updated sothat whenever something comes up, you should be able to pick up from there an continue. Education is exposure when you are educated you are exposed and you are likely to take advantage of any given opportunity if you have somebody to help you but not a guarantee to success. A person which has a skill and is consistent can do better than a lazy educated person.Quote from: sotelorene on April 12, 2024, 12:02:47 AMOne of the problem in this country is that most people don't want to stress themselves they just wanna stay at home fold legs and be eating 3 to 4 square meal a day.In every country you must find lazy set of people who don't care to stress themselves.

Or rather organizing a course where he teaches people about Bitcoin, such individual is likely to have earn a decent sum of money and be living a good life.

      "body": "Not everyone who did not go to school.sees those that went as a waste of time and effort. Most of them wished that they had the chance to go. You know in Nigeria education is now like a traditional way of living, once a child is up to 18 or 19 years they start finding a way to send the child to higher institution. But my freind for a person to be a bitcoin literate you dont need higher education you just need the basic elementary education which i believe everyone went through it. If we can read and write properly, studying is the next step to start understanding bitcoin and with time we will all be familiar with it. I dont think there is any excuse that one should give about not able to be a Bitcoin literate. This is because whether you went to higher institution or not it is the same process of learning that we all went before we became a bitcoin enthusiast. There is no shortcut to that.",

There is a saying that Education is the key to success. But people wey no go school dey See who go school  as a waste of time and effort because of hard economy. And tag it \"school na scam\".School no be scam. Who no go school don  scam himself ful time. I dey always talk am say the  C.E.O of Facebook (Mack zugarberg) for don rich pass as e dey now if many people been go school. E dey always hungry many people to join bitcoin discussion or BTC investment and many other online businesses. But e no easy. If you check the rate of illiteracy for my country naija you go see say e plenty. So wetting ona go fit talk for this kind thing my people? Or wetting b the way forward.First of all, school no be scam and it has never been a scam, because even the yahoo boyz wey bring up this slang, if you no go school, I bet you you go fit scam a 5yrs old pikin, talkless of an educated white man or woman. So scam has never been a scam, because despite the economic hardship wey dey this country, you go notice say it's always easy for educated people to fine good paying jobs (either online or physical) than the illiterate ones, and example is this forum signature campaign, whereby it only take an educated person to fit into this kind of job, hereby making it remain a nightmare for those who never went to school. However, from research i'm made to understand that it's only 31% of the total Nigerian population is said to be illiterate, and as such it means the number of educated people are far more than the illiterate onesNigeria’s illiteracy rate is now 31%, says FGI agree with you that school is not a scam. When you have the education and knowledge you are already a step ahead of somebody which is educated and not been in a four building to learn.ans when you talk about opportunities you are already more experienced and exposed to be able to do things in life .but looking at someone who’s educated and rational in Thinkin will be able to advance in about bitcoin knowledge when it first comes out but someone who’s not educated it will take him a lot of time to be to understand what there are even talking about it the bitcoin and any crypto market.thats why even you are educated or have some level of communication skill to write and express your self even the forum will be difficult for you to cope.",
