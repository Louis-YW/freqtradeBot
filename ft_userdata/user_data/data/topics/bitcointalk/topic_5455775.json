  "content": "Not just the ones that the Bitcoin Core client made. listtransactions won't work if I've just imported a few addresses and did a rescan, because no transactions have been made with the wallet and it returns an empty list. gettransaction works if txindex option is set, but I need to get the transaction IDs first, ideally only with Core. So how can I get a list of all txids for a wallet or address inside a wallet?",

      "body": "Have you tried using listunspent instead of listtransacttions? The code would be something like this:Code:bitcoin-cli listunspent 1 9999999 '[\"add1\", \"add2\", ...]'According to ChainQuery[1] that command will give you a list of all unspent transaction outputs for the addresses that you want. The result will be a list that will include the transaction ID (txid) for each UTXO. I've set the minconf and maxconf to their default values, but you are free to play around with those numbers.[1]https://www.chainquery.com/bitcoin-cli/listunspent",

(excluding change for HD wallet)Example command:Code:bitcoin-cli listreceivedbyaddress 0 false true \"address\"(works with imported addresses via importaddress)",

Not sure why this is defaulting to false as it would be really useful behavior to have on. But anyway, the listreceivedbyaddress RPC also works as well.",
