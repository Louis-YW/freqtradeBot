Custodial Trading is preferred if you can bear the network fees, as I will recommend to anyone the platforms that I don't use and doubt for a couple of reasons. However OP, your motive is good as per Binance there are a lot of Fuds and more on the way so better to find alternatives, as per my experience I think Kucoin does provide a Similar kind of service, and a better alternative as KYC free. More on OKX can also be taken into account (Not recommend any centralized exchange as for the Binance fud OP you are taking this into count maybe be similar kind of fud may arise for these platforms as well). A permanent solution is the Decentralized prepertual.",

Does the exchange have a Coin-M futures feature? where can we trade BTC futures, for example if we make a profit then we get BTC instead of USDT.What I mean is as I marked the box in the picture.Or for an explanation about M-Coin, see this link: https://www.binance.com/en/blog/futures/coinmargined-or-usd%E2%93%A2margined-what-futures-contract-suits-you-421499824684903739I will also start looking at the exchanges you mentioned earlierQuote from: Hamza2424 on September 27, 2023, 02:10:15 PMHowever OP, your motive is good as per Binance there are a lot of Fuds and more on the way so better to find alternatives, as per my experience I think Kucoin does provide a Similar kind of service, and a better alternative as KYC free.

What I fear is that something like FTX will happen again, initially it was fine but in reality FTX was destroyed. So I decided not to take the risk too far.I will start considering your advice.

I mean the books showed that Houbi has solvency issues and this news was shared here before the hack occurred on Houbi. --> *warning* Huobi insolvency rumours. I prefer you OP to not use Huobi for any type of trading purposes. Because there are many loopholes in this exchange that not even the team knew about. For example, yesterday, a member made a post about how he led to an unofficial telegram bot where he was asked to give the recovery key of the wallet, while that member said, he clicked the link from the official website of Huobi. Here is that thread --> [Warning] Even the official links aren't safe anymore.. And one of our local community member (Gladitorcomeback) even reported that loophole to the team, and their reply indicated that, they did not know about such an error and the support said, we had transferred the message to the specific team. I mean, they are so lazy and don't know they have a thief in their house. I was shocked.",

I saw news mentioned about binance that sec can put a high margin fine for binance for some of their activity.For future trade bybit is more popular than binance i think. This exchange recently offered spot trading and their service is also good. They are doing heavy promotion about their platform with events. Using it for some time never had an issue. But they are a little bit skeptical about using multiple id so be careful about it.",

You asked if there is any exchange that is safe; then, my dear, in crypto, nothing is safe until you follow the main slogan of crypto, which is \"Not your key, not your coin\". If you are storing your huge funds on some centralized exchange, then you might lose them due to many reasons, like the reasons that occur with MT Gox,  FTX, Huobi, CoinEx, etc. Hacks, scams, and bankruptcies are normal things in crypto.All we can do is take precautions to manage our funds and minimize the risks involved.",

Plus, like I always say, if there is something that you do not know or understand about futures that means you should not be in the futures, that is always a bad idea because it is so risky.The risk could be a bit higher than spot trading and that would be fine, but we are talking about unnecessary amount of risk that should not even exist, like literally go from betting some money to zero from that trade, ZERO, not 10% down not 50% down, ZERO  return if you are wrong. That's a bad move and I believe that everyone should be staying away from that if they still have questions about it.",

But yes, I've transacted before on MEXC and Gate and both have coin margined pairs (Gate only has 2 available while MEXC offers about 6 pairs). But I cannot guarantee you about the security level they've got and how far they can protect themselves from hackers who keep doing their efforts every single day to hack the wallets of these exchanges.",
