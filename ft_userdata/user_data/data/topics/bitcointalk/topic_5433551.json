Any advices how I can do it to get the root key or whatever it is called, that's all i have private key, couple sha256 and i want to finnaly import them into my other wallet. Thanks in advance.I simply have no idea how to encrypt exactly this hashes, should i encrypt them one by one, then add the whole sha for encryption or i should do copy paste them all, then encrypt? And should i encrypt the encrypted sha? Im tired honestly",
