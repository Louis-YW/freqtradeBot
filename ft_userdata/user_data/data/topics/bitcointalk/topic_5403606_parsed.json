I am just unsure what will happened to other business (owned by businessmen).",

Because this could lead to high gambling addiction and misplaced priority since they are government owned they will want to legalize gambling not for the sake of their citizens interest but for the sake of generating more revenues and making their citizens depend on betting for survival",

I am just unsure what will happened to other business (owned by businessmen).There's a possibility that they will have the monopoly of casino online business in their jurisdiction, one example is Macau they have a lot of online casinos based in their jurisdiction, and of course, they will have the whole revenues instead of relying on taxes coming from online casinos which is just a fraction of the casino revenues, but I doubt if they are going to get the trust of the gambling community because we all know governments don't want anonymity and they want to taxes people winnings within their jurisdiction, its a complicated thing, and we have to see one scenario where a government is fully run online casinos.",

I mean, being one of the main countries that support and provide casinos, they surely have a connection to huge organizations and other entities to provide enough support on their transition to an online casino. It's actually an advantage for them to go online and provide their network with enough support and provide the needs of their clients and gamblers.",

That's possible a private company thrives on the support of its customers, compared to a government that will try to sneak into their customer's gambling activity, and will implement laws that they created to check the individual's activity, private gambling company only Terms of service are those on protecting their casino and to some extend their players, while a government are on laws they created to monitor and tax people, so there will be a conflict here, but this is a good discussion to explore.",

Worse case that I could see is corruption not just in profits but also in knowledge about every individual visiting their establishment. But this type could work.

Anything government owned most times to an extent lacks proper management when compared to facilities managed by private individuals. For private individuals, they ensure that the customer experience is top notch so may go an extra mile to satisfy user experience while generating income. But if government owned, their primary objective will be to generate income and may not necessarily care much about user experience, customer reports may not be quickly attended to because there is no public face to save, hence government owned casinos may not be able to attract enough customers and this may result in reduced revenue or fluctuating revenue. To ensure that the amount they receive from these casinos are fixed, it is best to play the regulatory role and collect fixed sums as revenue, rather than dabbling in the business itself.",
