The proof of reserves idea has been floating around for years, they either had it implemented and waiting or rushed it and it's broken (and if binance hasn't changed much since I last used them it might be the second)...",

Nevertheless, when something bad happens in the crypto market, coins lose value. So, at the end of the day, we are in a terrible situation.

For me what happened to the FTX exchange, one of the valuable lessons for crypto users as a whole, for sure I'm not tempted even if Binance publishes backups or hides, maybe Binance currently has 97% collateral, not to mention the ones spread out, believe that that's not a real guarantee for anyone looking to deposit funds in the current exchange.I remember what: @Robert Stevens said about anticipation: Proof of Reserves: Could it Have Prevented the FTX Meltdown?, but what happened to FTX is not about the money reserves they have.This is the most fatal, who would have thought, backup is not a guarantee.QuoteAn exchange may have used your money to prop up its failing trading firm, as happened with FTX.However, a very good and memorable point for current crypto users, as suggested by: @Robert Stevens, at the end of the story.QuoteRemember: Crypto exchanges are not the same as banks. For starters, crypto isn’t insured by government depositary schemes. Accordingly, customers must take due diligence matters into their own hands when choosing where to park their money.This is what needs to be instilled in the soul of every crypto user, we never know what will happen in the future.",

They prove nothing. It won't be long before the first exchange which \"proved\" they were fully backed up goes bankrupt, and takes another few million customers' funds with them.Quote from: Ratimov on December 13, 2022, 12:49:46 PMFUD on Binance continues to gain momentum. Over the past 24 hours, assets have been withdrawn from the exchange for almost $ 2 billion:I'm not sure you can call warnings on any centralized exchange FUD right now, given the events of the last few months. But good news anyway that more people are withdrawing to their own wallets. Although perhaps the outrageous withdrawal fees that Binance charges on $2 billion of withdrawals will be enough to plug the apparent hole in their balance sheet.

The exact pattern of behavior we saw with Celsius. And Voyager. And BlockFi. And FTX. And the dozens of other smaller platforms which have gone bankrupt in the last few months.But sure, leave your coins on a centralized exchange. Maybe withdraw just enough to buy yourself a clown costume for when you lose everything after months of non-stop red flags and warnings.",
