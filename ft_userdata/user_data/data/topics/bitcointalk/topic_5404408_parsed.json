      "body": "I don't have a pick right now. Haaland is currently the favorite to win that award next season. The choice makes sense since he's young and he's already a prolific scorer. I just don't think he'll settle into the Premier League that quickly and score the most goals in his first season. He may win it in his second year.Quote from: Bontexkenzy on June 28, 2022, 07:22:38 PMHarry KaneBraun hallandMo SalahNunezChristians RonaldoIt's kind of disrespectful to include Kane and ignore his teammate Son Heung-min. He shared the title with Salah last season remember?",
