I doubt silicon lottery can cause such a big difference...edit: fixed by updating nvidia drivers",

If there are no miners for AMD video cards, then the profit is very small. There are very few Intel GPUs in mining, and they are all unprofitable right now, so ominized miners will be the last to appear if Intel does not start to change the situation.",
