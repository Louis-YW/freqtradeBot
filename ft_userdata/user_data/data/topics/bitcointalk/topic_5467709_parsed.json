I believe that both of them could be the future goat but if I have to choose one then that would be Mbappe as I believe he's slightly better than Haaland, and I'm sure that I can be wrong with my choice because Haaland can be better in future and may give a hard time to Mbappe to achieve that title.",

Haaland could potentially provide a more robust performance with Manchester City than Mbappe with PSG.I think the clubs now is a factor to compare the two world class players. Manchester city is in firing top form and I think that is also instrumental for the Norwegian striker.  Erling Haaland no doubt has all the potentials including speed, his youthful strength or his placing or positioning and likewise kylian mbappe possess all those too. Maybe we have to give both time to metamorphose into the super star comparison we want to see. Probably they could replace the duo of Christiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi .",

Both of them started their professional football almost the same time but the Frenchman has achieved much more than the Norwegian.  In terms of goals, assists, and trophies,  Mbappe is shown Haaland. The Mancity striker can score goals but he hardly creates goal-scoring opportunities. But Mbappe on the other hand is a playmaker, goal creator, and goal scorer. Mbappe would have performed better or he was in a club like Manchester City. But Haaland is better in terms of character.  Mbappe sometimes feels superior and can be stubborn but Haaland is always well-behaved. If Mbappe gets a better club and works on his bad behavior, he will be the GOAT in football in a few years.",

The current potential is, like you said, Haaland is getting support from his Manchester City teammates. In addition, Pep Guardiola can exploit Erling Haaland's full potential. Pep Guardiola is a good teacher. But for example, Haaland alone carries the whole team like Mbappé. I bet we won't see a trace of him in the match.If Mbappé goes to Real Madrid in the upcoming transfer season, Mbappé will develop more comprehensively. I believe that in the future, he will be a goat. But time is running out for Mbappé, and he should be decisive with PSG and not try to sink deeper into the quagmire.",

      "body": "For me, I think it will be Mbappe based on the current statistics, he has the edge over Haaland and he has better goalscoring and assists record both per game and overall. He has scored 287 goals and provided 117 assists in 396 games while Haaland has scored 219 goals and provided 45 assists in 269 games. Mbappe has spent his entire career in Ligue 1 which is generally considered to be one of the top 5 leagues in Europe while Haaland has played in slightly weaker leagues.https://www.msn.com/en-in/sports/football/kylian-mbappe-the-ridiculous-statistics-of-a-forward-who-could-finally-win-it-all-with-psg/ar-AA12S1Kp",

But time is running out for Mbappé, and he should be decisive with PSG and not try to sink deeper into the quagmire.My concern is whether, should Mbappe depart from PSG, he will receive the same special treatment at another club as he has at PSG. The support for Mbappe seems to be unique to PSG, and if he were to move to another major club, the authority within his contract would likely be more limited, and he would become just another player.It's akin to Messi's move to PSG, where Messi received immense support from Barcelona, but it seems less pronounced at PSG.On the other hand, Erling Haaland garners support because he isn't overly flamboyant. Haaland, regardless of where he goes, is likely to maintain the support of his teammates because of his exceptional qualities from within. That's why I've chosen Haaland.",
