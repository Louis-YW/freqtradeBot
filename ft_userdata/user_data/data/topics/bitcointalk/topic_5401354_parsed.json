  "content": "Opensea | NFTrade | Rarible | Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Telegram | Medium | Web InfoWe have released an NFT under the name Ticket Reward Token using the symbol TRTNFT on the Matic Polygon blockchain network. This NFT will be used as a queue number to get our main token My Bottle Coin (MBC).Everyone has the same opportunity to get our MBC tokens especially for our NFT holders.MBC will be distributed in a unique way, namely using the Block Hash Lottery. We have offloaded our NFT on Opensea and nftrade.Currently we only trade NFT with queue number tickets from 1 to 99, with each NFT having 200 at their disposal. We give everyone the opportunity to buy TRTNFT with more amount owned.For Example : If you have a TRTNFT with ticket number 1 and own about 80 of the 200 available, you will get more of our MBC tokens because it is based on the calculation of the TRTNFT you have.How does Block Hash Lottery work ?You can monitor it live herehttps://polygonscan.com/You can see directly the block number that we will announce on social media or our other channels. Where you will see we will start distributing MBC using the block hash lottery system.When you know the block number that we announced at that time, you will see the 2 digit number found behind the hash of the block number.For example: for block 26923193the result is 0xee61b3a57cf30072ae4a828c1f7204374ad12b59b752e0e721d4c5eab97f4813 , and the last 2 digits are 13but if we find another hash number like this0x5f4626711053a58d2e4a3587c72522e7c3438679ac11aa743cd337b588732d4a , and the last 2 digits are 240x382994a1a3f2cee674167d3b2e568601adfecc3c6f0d82a9ba0ddabaaa0bb1ad , and the last 2 digits are 01QuoteThe TRTNFT holder with the ticket number shown on the hash will get 100k BMC whose result is determined based on the number of TRTNFT owned.
