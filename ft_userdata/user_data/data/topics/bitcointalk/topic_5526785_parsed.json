People who has the fund and the courage to play with the Bitcoin market often times create a strategic selling in order to make more profit.  If you are asking who are selling in time of the bull run, it is obvious that people are taking profit.  For example, when Bitcoin reaches $100k+, traders who bought Bitcoin at lower price is surely selling to take profit.  Sometimes there are instances where huge holder of Bitcoin make strategic sales in order to pull down the price of Bitcoin and later on buy at a lower price to either bag a profit or bag more Bitcoins.About the inauguration of Trump and its effect on Bitcoin, I believe Trump had been one of the icons of Bitcoin since he is so open in supporting Bitcoins and his inauguration will surely give hype to the Bitcoin market.  We have already experience an increase of Bitcoin price while the inauguration of Trump is getting closer.",

Whatever the impact after Trump wins the election or whatever narrative they are trying to convey for now. I agree more with the previous process where we see bitcoin has a four-year cycle and maybe that narrative is much more likely to produce a new ATH, it's just that the timing coincides with the election process that is happening in the US so that a narrative is built that has a positive impact on the journey of bitcoin, even though without this we would still see ATH every time the period has been reached as before.The only thing that makes this better is because Trump considers the bitcoin reserve a strategic step that can be taken so that there is confidence for some people to create a narrative about the possibilities that will occur. That should be good but to what extent can this realization be achieved on his journey because if not it is just a sweet promise that he is trying to express.",

Firstly Thanks for the topic I'm curious too as there's been a lot of news & speculations for Bitcoin to hit a new Peak I would love to see it on 111.11k haha.But as we can see market is already at 105k and now seems like we are getting on the radar of being punished by the market, as everyone is greedy and bullish that Bitcoin is going to hit big and hard soon but it might crash from there on the same day, causing an unexpected turn. My Observational analysis says we are in a good bus to ride till a new ATH but the sixth sense is calling a danger moment going to happen anytime soon and we might get trapped in that range from peak to 87.9k for several weeks or even months.",

Someone had to buy all those coins, right? That's why they sold high during the bull run. They may be just hanging out now, waiting to see if new rules or a rush of investors make them want to make another move. It's mental tension for people. There is excitement about reserves, anger over the steady rise and fall, and confusion when the price doesn't respond to \"major\" news. That's how the market makes us feel. Don't think of us as robots. We might not even care what Trump says or doesn't say on inauguration day if we look at the basics, like how many people are using networks, how open the market is, and how willing people are to hold for the long termWe're still interested. We can tell when the whales are going to wake up and change the market. It could be after the inauguration, next month, or never. That's the strange thing about Bitcoin: it's both a global product and an emotional roller coaster. These waves of thought can control what we do if we're not careful. If we keep thinking, the hype will turn into facts instead of drama",

The short-termism of what happens today and Monday entertains me but doesn't affect me. even when you are strictly a long-term investor, it is usually hard not to get involved in sentiment as this since this current bull has long been associated with trump more than the usual economic concept of bitcoin cycle that is playing its own rule in what we are currently seeing now and yet a lot of speculators are not basing their analysis from that point of view. for us that are investing for the long term, the price increase is just an added validation that tells that one is on track with regard our investment and even though the bull is already telling on our holding for better at the moment, it is still not enough reason to sell yet. like the buildup to the inauguration has caused this bull, there are chances that after the inauguration, some short-term investors will normally want to take out their profit which might lead to a likely correction but in the end, if he finally implements an order that is bullsih on bitcoin, that will cause another rise that will see bitcoin going to the range of $200k upwards.",

In the world of crypto, everything is possible. Maybe it's priced already. Maybe it still isn't and there's still an upside to it.As for the whales, I don't think they need to hide their intention to sell when they feel that Bitcoin has peaked already. The current resistance is at the $108,000, and I will not be surprised if they will sell at that price again. Who's selling? I can only think of 2 types of sellers right now. Those who bought during the 2022 bear market and selling their assets right now for profit, or those who're only buying Bitcoin for the short term, and they're contented with the profits that they got hence, selling it. What I believe is that, when we surpass the $108,000 which is the resistance, Bitcoin's price will continue to go up from there.",

Apparently, a lot are in store for the Bitcoin market in the next days, weeks, and months. That's obvious. Along with the sudden rise in Bitcoin's price, Polymarket's odds of the US creating a national Bitcoin reserve also soared to 70%.

And then the number of states where a Bitcoin strategic reserve proposal is filed has also ballooned to at least 15.",

It does not look like it has priced in at all.  More over, it looks like a great thing whether it is priced in or not.  Think of it this way,If Bitcoin has priced in already, it means it is much less volatile than it used to be and the rally is so smooth and normal we do not even notice any more.  Though this comes with a caveat.  If it priced in already, then the percent it increases by every cycle is becoming so low it may not be profitable for Miners to continue their operations.  In that situation, you have to worry about way more than whether a rally is due or not.If it has not priced in already then the upcoming Bitcoin rally will likely be an incredible ride.  We are past 100 Thousand Dollars a Bitcoin.  These are insane numbers.",
