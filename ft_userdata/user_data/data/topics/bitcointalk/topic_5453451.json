The bad thing about scams is that if only one person falls, it is very profitable for them. Sending one of those emails does not cost them much, and although in this case I don't think anyone will fall, in others there is usually a clueless person who does not realize the scam.

So, it seems the hacker is using the email list from 2015 hack.Yeah lot of things are off about the email like mention of Badbear (who isn't active), the email address from it was sent and the content of it and plus forums not asking for donations so it is someone asking for donation under forum's name. I feel it is likely that he acquired my email ID through the database hack perhaps.

Frankly, I doubt it because of the increased awareness of people and even that these methods are outdated, but in any case, thank you for this topic.Those were the old donations upon which one would get a tag. If memory serves me right then someone actually donated around 10 BTC last in 2016-18 (around). There were lot of questions about 10 BTC-50 BTC donation amount but now it is removed and they are somehow working it out with fee revenue and advertising as mentioned in donations page.BTW its funny that the impersonator is hoping that someone with deep pockets will get fooled easily.  Quote from: notblox1 on May 20, 2023, 11:59:45 PMI think it is good idea for you to change and use new and unique address for your profile to reduce spam emails like this. Good point, I need to check if I had revealed my email-id public somewhere and will change to a new one.Quote from: Husires on May 21, 2023, 01:11:50 AMIt seems that no one was fooled by this scam.I hardly think anyone will get fooled by him. No body in his right mind will go around donating significant amount of money without confirming things.Quote from: Poker Player on May 21, 2023, 02:46:08 AM[...] Only with one person, or a few, falling into the trap they have achieved their goal. And that will be hard to come by. I don't think most people have that kind of amount which they feel free to donate. Still it's true that its only one person falling into trap can make their life. Best we can do is aware others so I just hope nobody falls for this.Quote from: UchihaSarada on May 21, 2023, 05:26:05 AMIf you see donation [dot] bitcoin.org, you must be careful and check more.

If you want to donate BTC, donate it to a charity, or maybe even to your fellow forum members.very clear, important point that the forum no longer collects donations for any reason or purpose.But I will reveal some indications of scammer messages for the purpose of fake donations, phishing, malware, and others, especially from the email message above it can be concluded that there are indications that have been found:1. Check the senders email address, scammers create a new email related to the source name to convince the recipient. Usually scammers will send bulk messages to targeted recipient email lists.2. Narrative, the scammer will gather information from various sources to compose the first paragraph message about the history of bitcointalk, many beginners may feel convinced that way so continue reading the instructions from the next paragraph..3. Purpose and Evidence, the point of the second paragraph is the main goal of scammers, they ask for donations according to the amount of donations on the official forum, but they can change the donation lower to get funds from the victim, they also add proof that the user has donated to the forum so that the victim will be interested in donating to contribute to the forum.So be careful trusting messages from unofficial sources, the main thing is to always check the sender's email address, if it is not an official source email then ignore the message without reading the message content.",
