After all these years, I help some users and maybe there is someone too. I have all the contacts, you are welcome to write me. German Posting in 2019 = https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5136023QuoteGood morning, I am writing with an update regarding the trial of Wybo WEIRSMA which started yesterday (25th January) at Oxford Crown Court. I am delighted to be able to tell you that this morning (26th January) the second day of the trial WIERSMA has pleaded guilty to the theft of the IOTA cryptocurrency.  He will be sentenced by the Judge tomorrow (27th January).  I am sure you will be delighted by this news, which brings to an end nearly six years since the theft and the long and complex investigation. I cannot estimate what the Judge will consider is an appropriate sentence.  The Judge will take into account that WIERSMA has been in custody (Prison) in Holland & the UK since 24th December 2020.The next stage of the process will be working with you to return the seized cryptocurrency which is currently in the possession of the Police.  As I have said many times we were only able to seize a small amount of cryptocurrency that was in the Bitfinex exchange.  If I could ask you to bear with me for a few more days in order to be able deal with the final admin bits for the court case. Kind regardsSEROCU & Thames Valley Police Cyber Crime & Cryptocurrency Unit and DICE: South East.Source: https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/",

Let's see and spread the news, maybe someone will be helped. I am also happy to answer questions or give advice on where to contact me. I have been doing this for over 5 years and there have been many contacts and users that I have spoken to. I also have contact with the police, where the coins are located. I have some more information in the German thread, if anyone wants to try it themselve.
