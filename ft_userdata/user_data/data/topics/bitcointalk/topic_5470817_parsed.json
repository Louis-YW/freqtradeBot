  "content": "Website - Twitter - Discord - Telegram - Telegram ANNsFull LinktreeHYDRANET (HDN)Hydranet introduces a native, private, and trustless cross-chain trading technology facilitated by Layer-2 technologies such as the Lightning and Connext Vector Networks, combined in our very own platform, the Hydranet DEX.This framework enables direct and native exchanges between $BTC and $ETH blockchains without reliance on intermediary bridges or wrapped assets. Through off-chain transactions, users benefit from minimized fees and rapid confirmation times, contrasting with the protracted process of any on-chain equivalents.The Hydranet DEX platform offers a CEX-like experience and interface, featuring not just an order book, but also Single Click Simple Swaps. At the same time, users maintain complete control over their assets. Embrace KYC-free trading and assert full ownership through absolute retention of your private keys!Hydranet Core DEXThe original idea for the Hydranet DEX was to stay true to the decentralized spirit of the crypto movement - Trustless Financial Independence. Hydranet interpreted this core idea as excluding any intermediaries and middlemen, eliminating the last great potential for fraud and deception. This idea incorporates the goal to render bridges and wrapped assets obsolete. A thought that was deemed utopian for years has now become a reality. After years of hard work and showcasing the world’s first off-chain native BTC - ETH swap, the Hydranet Core DEX was released as a downloadable desktop application to the public in September 2023.Download the Hydranet Core DEXHydranet Web DEXIn an environment where Web3 solutions and applications are dominating the industry, creating a desktop client can be argued non-ideal. However, when the Hydranet DEX development was kicked off, this was the only feasible option. Due to the lack of suitable layer 2 web nodes, it was technically impossible to realize a web-based platform. To our excitement, this has since changed!During the recent development of the Hydranet Core DEX, we put considerable effort into researching and developing the feasibility of running off-chain nodes in browser environments using two Spiral libraries called BitcoinDevKit (BDK) and LightningDevKit (LDK)and therefore overcome the major limiting factor within the Lightning Network. On the EVM side, we were also lacking an off-chain protocol that would meet our requirements and simultaneously offer multi-node routing capabilities, so the decision was made to develop our very own project-tailored protocol, named Lithium, which is already running on our internal WebDex test environment.At this point in time, we are more than confident in our ability to mirror the capabilities of our Hydranet Core DEX to a Web DEX version and offer our users private and trustless trading of native coins and tokens within the comfort of a web and mobile-based solution! Hydranet HDN TokenProject Hydranet is a DAO and uses its own Arbitrum token $HDN.HDN is currently being used for voting on DAO proposals, submitted by DAO representatives (known as the Multi-Sig team), but as we are constructing the Hydranet DEX Network, the backbone of the Hydranet DEX, our token will gain even more features and privileges.Our ultimate target is to operate the DEX on multiple Hubs and Watchtowers that will not only decentralize but also guarantee the independent operation of the Hydranet DEX Network. To operate a Hub or Watchtower, HDN holders will need to lock a collateral of HDN. For securing the integrity of the Hydranet DEX Network, these Hubs and Watchtowers will be eligible to receive their share of trading fees, which will be distributed to their respective owners. HDN holders who do not want to engage in either running a Watchtower or Hub will benefit from even lower trading fees, according to the amount of HDN they hold.Further plans are in place, to implement a buy-back system, where DEX fees will be used to buy HDN from the market, thereby creating buy-pressure for the token. Hydranet HDN Token Address0x3404149e9ee6f17fb41db1ce593ee48fbdcd9506HDN on CoingeckoRoadmap and DevelopmentRoadmap ViewOur updated roadmap for mid- and long-term goals is described in detail in this medium article:Medium Roadmap ArticleTechnical Project DetailsThe Hydranet Core DEX uses the Lightning Network for Bitcoin and the Connext Vector Network for EVM-based assets for its off-chain implementation.All trades on the Hydranet DEX are performed off-chain and are secured using Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTCL). The HTCL ensures that either both trading participants or none of them receive the agreed-upon funds.The Hydranet DEX comprises a self-custodial wallet and adheres to the BIP39 standard for creating and securing mnemonic phrases. The Hydranet DEX Network is currently composed of one Hub, which is more than enough to highlight the capabilities of the solution. The Hydranet DEX will be available directly from your favorite browser, with the relevant off-chain nodes running within this browser. The Hydranet DEX will integrate Lightning Service Providers to improve liquidity provisioning and gain access to the entirety of the Lightning NetworkProject Hydranet’s EVM off-chain protocol Lithium is inspired by the Connext Vector protocol but improved in terms of off-chain transaction times, multi-routing capabilities, and Watchtower functionality",

      "body": "Quote from: elmo40 on October 18, 2023, 11:31:27 PMWhy do we need another Dex? There are already 8,000 of them that no one uses...This DEX doesn't compare with any other. Most DEX's run on the Ethereum chain, and are limited to ETH tokens, ONLY. This means, you can't trade BTC, LTC, XRP, XMR, and many other coins, which run on their own native blockchain. To combat this issue, they made \"wrapped\" versions of these, but you'd need to TRUST that the \"peg\" between wBTC, and BTC stays the same. Furthermore, when the Ethereum chain becomes congested, (seen in the previous bullruns), the network cannot handle the volume, which sends the gas fees, through the roof. Hydranets DEX, is trustless, trading between blockchains are near instant (BTC <=> ETH), and the fees are virtually pennies, on the dollar. Uniswap is running through liquidity pools, they don't offer real BTC, transactions aren't instant, (so you can't run arbitrage bots properly), and the list goes on and on. Off-chain trading is the key component here. Try and do 50 trades on Uniswap, and tell me what kind of fees you'll pay, then compare those fees with Hydranets solution, you'll find, that you'll save A LOT of money.  This is a DEX, that gets you the feeling of trading on a CEX. It's superior to ANY DEX's out there.",

They will have a limited quantity and require a significant HDN collateral to be operated, therefore their owners will be paid an appropriate share of the total Hydranet DEX and rental fees.Titans will provide:Run full blockchain nodes and provide blockchain data to the light clientsProvide rental liquidity and run an order-matching engineGUARDIANS:The Watchtowers responsible for monitoring and safeguarding the Hydranet Titans and all users' state channels, will be known as \"Guardians.\" Their quantity will be larger, depending on how many hubs are in operation, but unlike the Titans, they necessitate a smaller HDN collateral commitment. As compensation for their role in maintaining network integrity and security, the operators will be paid a proportionate share of the Hydranet DEX Fees.Guardians will provide:Run Watchtowers for both the Lightning & Lithium networksMonitor Titans' operations and punish them in case of misbehaviorLITHIUM RENTAL LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS:We are currently developing the possibility for users to provide rental liquidity to EVM channels within the Hydranet DEX network. Users that choose to establish these liquidity pools for Lithium will further enhance the overall DEX liquidity and will therefore be rewarded with appropriate rental fees. To enforce uptime, we are currently researching if an HDN lockup might be useful too. Summary:- TITANS (Hubs) will be paid from DEX fees and rental fees- GUARDIANS (Watchtowers) will be paid from DEX fees- Lithium Rental Liquidity Providers will receive rental fee rewardsGovernance, trading fee reduction, maximum supply, etc. will not be changed or affected.More details will be provided in the next weeks and a complete tokenomics proposal will be published soon™️",

Because the available liquidity isn't dependent on the hub anymore, but on various individuals, offering their assets to provide liquidity.On the Lightning-Bitcoin side, it is planned to onboard Lightning service providers, which will basically solve channel rental limit issues there.
