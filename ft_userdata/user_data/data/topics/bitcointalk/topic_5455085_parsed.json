  "content": "Since I still get PM's about this from time to time:This is an updated version of this this post, for clarity and visibility - Lealana 5 XMR Brass Redemption Experiment:This method requires the latest version of the XMR daemon & client software (Gui or CLI) - Get it here: https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/First get your Monero daemon synchronized (NOTE: You can use a public remote node for this, but I highly recommend you sync/download your own copy of the blockchain instead, for security reasons ofc). - It's not very hard, just run the GUI and create a wallet and your node will sync if you leave it open - or if the cli, run monerod.exe in one window to sync the chain, and then use the cli client in another cmd.exe window. Basic steps after getting your XMR node up and running/synchronized (Same as BTC, use a SSD for disk)!:1. Peel the coin - Write down the chars or type them into notepad/whatever. BE VERY CAREFUL. Consult the image below of the fontset used by smoothie (COURIER NEW) for what symbols are what. Just one wrong char can make all the difference here!  https://i.ibb.co/S0GcD6S/0qqWmk9.pngNow you should have the private key in Base64 format.For this tutorial, we will assume the base64 key on the peeled coin is: GVsbG8gd29ybGQ=Note, I don't recall the number of chars on a peeled coin atm, so this is not a working example, it's just made up, not a real wallet/address. 2. Now we need to convert the Base64 key to Hexadecimal - I HIGHLY recommend doing this on a virtual machine or sandboxed, or a machine you can trust!- EDIT 2024 - (see here for a script to do this for you using Windows Powershell 7)!Linux: Here is the command to do the same thing (always easier ofc lol)Replace or set variable $BASE64_STRING with your actual Base64-encoded stringCode:echo -n \"$BASE64_STRING\" | base64 -d | xxd -pThese should both output the string: 48656C6C6F20776F726C64 , which is the hex-encoded private key we need.

      "body": "General Information about digital certs that I'm aware of, feel free to comment if you know moreMost coins were sold in sets. The 3-coin XMR silver sets had paper certs and digital certs (if requested on the latter).The 5 XMR coins had digital certs only. I hope everyone who ordered a roll (Only way they were sold IIRC) got the digital certs, but who knows. Note the 5 XMR digital certs came in one message for all 20 coins, PGP-signed by smoothie. Hence, there is no way to post a PGP-signed cert from smoothie that will verify unless one gives out the whole roll's worth of certs if that makes sense. Instead, smoothie signed the certs using the digital key image: Reflink: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1661961.0#:~:text=all%20coins%20sold.-,The%20digital%20certificate%20has%20the%20signed%20message%20containing%20the%20key%20images%20that%20prove%20the%20coin%20is%20funded.,-View%20ArchiveReportFor the 4-coin sets, it depends on what you bought etc so same sort of applies to the PGP aspect.This is what a digital cert looks like: (with some info changed ofc).Code:HASH:<cx3dddxx33311155f02e8c994eb8c9f532c770e07a604422f17efb72f50x3d2224>- -------------------------------------------------START------------------------------------------------------LEALANA 5 XMR BRASS COIN SERIAL #5XX**FUNDED WITH RING CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTIONS (RINGCT)**XMR ADDRESS: 4XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXmN9M42hXXXXXXXVIEW KEY: 264382a48584837ddkf84843idide96f07411d9fd247exxxxxxxxxxTotal # of Outputs:1************************************INDIVIDUAL OUTPUT INFORMATION*******************************************key_image: ........xxx054163fefa9df1fc3ac20861e3965a3fcc0e8e7c1cf7affda8d83skxxxxtx_id: ............xxxx88ff1b054b5326548530273c6f10b3e2c9df6a6d994443d87594a0xxxxoutput_public_key: xxxx9bdf9b7ef647960dfc7e6efce65cb1f6d5fac16acbd90ef16592b6xxxxxxxmr_amount: .......5.000000000000- ------------------------------------------------END---------------------------------------------------------SIGNATURES:<xxxxxx30e30cbc28ebfd77f60f4febb6eb33dc5c6218d462d0e32b855647a0ef3717e15cccfa2e35ccf80781a4f900750b23ab77f49ce40961950a44cdxxxxxx>On the downside, he never released any kind of software to verify these, so many think the \"View Key\" is enough to determine actual funding.HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT TRUE, The View Key only shows INPUTS, not OUTPUTS. So, that means if the coins were spent, the View Key would not reflect that. Ref:  Quote from: smoothie on October 27, 2016, 01:45:50 AMYou can't prove the balance of a XMR address with just the viewkey. A viewkey only shows incoming transactions not outgoing transactions.You need the key images signed with the private key to prove funding. Hence the digital certificate.This is a common misconception. Note: Sometimes there will be more than one \"output_public_key\" on the cert because it's XMR's basic equivalent of (unmanageable afaik) coin control & change output (Like BTC basically).  More on that here in somewhat of a deeper tech analysis: https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/widm.1436",

It's not something I do often, but I've helped some members sweep 100XMR coins so I got kinda tired of doing it for others, even tho if someone wants me to I will, but for a fee.  As to your question, Indeed there is, but only if you have the \"view_key\" which is on the digital cert because the XMR chain is opaque/uncheckable itself. I was going to update the post above with more info about digital certs and what I know about them and the format etc actually, so maybe that will help more, just give me a while, I need some dinner.
