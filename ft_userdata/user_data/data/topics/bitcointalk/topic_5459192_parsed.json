The first skill set example is for a job which gives income without any investment or risk involved while gambling/trading is a tool to get profit by exposing your investment on risk.Consistency is debatable topci in both gambling and trading no matter how good you are since both involved some level of risk compared to the normal jobs that promised fixed on income per work done. You can gain 10K$ on gambling/trading but I don’t consider it as skills since it’s betting agains people to earn profit.",

      "body": "I agree with AmoreJaz, gambling and trading shouldn’t be in the same mention. Trading requires you to have some substantial knowledge of a thing and putting it into practice that is what a skill is. Although gambling also requires knowledge but right from putting your funds into it are relying on 50% luck but for trading you are more or less certain that you will gain profit at a certain period except an unforeseen circumstances arises,The other skills listed shouldn’t also be in the same category as both gambling and trading because you don’t have to put in your funds into them, which actually eliminates the risk of losing. It is possible for a gambler or trader to actually get 10k profit in a month, some could even be but it is never guaranteed like skills in which you must receive monthly salaries or wages which are fixed. Also the amount invested in both also matters most especially trading",

Gambling isn't even supposed to be considered the same as trading, they're two different things imo.

That doesn't mean that it's a \"guaranteed\" monthly $10k though. Heck, there might even be instances where they lose $10k instead.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on July 09, 2023, 04:28:26 PM• What other skills not listed here, can make one up to $10k a month?A lot?

I don't think so because gambling most of the time are game of chances or lucks especially if you are playing with that kind of gambling.Gambling is gambling and no guarantee to win with gambling consistently and it is impossible to have stable income from gambling. Getting stable profit and income from trading is already difficult but it is harder with gambling.OP listed many job types and I am unsure that one person can have so many such skills to earn $10,000 monthly. Income from trading will depend on trading capital and if a trader has a small capital, even trading result is very consistent good, trading profit value will not be too big.If a trader has like $100,000 as trading capital, it is very possible to get like $5,000 or $10,000 as trading profit each month even that trader only make a few trades each month.",

Meanwhile, more people cannot make such huge profits and still have to look for other jobs.Gambling or crypto trading can be considered a skill but for gambling, I think the skill lies in card games and sports betting, while everything else is based on luck. But a gambler and crypto trader can earn $10k in a month, but it depends on their skills in crypto gambling and trading. But many of us do not recommend making money from gambling because it is not easy and it is better to start with crypto trading or crypto investment.Making $10k a month takes work. It requires effort, study, practice, experience and many others. Only a few people can make that money because only a few can master everything required.
