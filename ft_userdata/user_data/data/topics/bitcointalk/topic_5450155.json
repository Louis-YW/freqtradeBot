  "content": "Today is a sad day for those of us who use bitcoin and value our privacy. Just today, a law came into force in Spain that obliges entities that provide crypto-related services in the country to report absolutely all transactions carried out during the year.This is a direct attack not only on our privacy but also on cryptocurrency users, as no other tax legislation has gone this far. For example, there is no law in Spain that obliges banks to report each and every transaction carried out by all users. If in the course of an investigation there are suspicions, the authorities require the data and the banks give it to them, but they do not transmit all the data by default. This will give the rest of the forum members an idea of what may be coming in the near future in their countries, especially in Europe. I have searched for information in English about this and can't find anything published, although I am not sorry that it is in this forum that we are emphasising the nefariousness of this legislation.I put a link in Spanish and anyone who is curious can use an online translator:Hacienda de España conocerá todo sobre ti si compras bitcoin en exchanges centralizados",

This is why it is advised not to use a centralized system to purchase or sell Bitcoin; instead, a P2P system is greatly encouraged. Since the law has ordered all crypto transaction data to be submitted, except for people who have used a centralized system to carry out their Bitcoin transactions, those who used a P2P system cannot be tracked. You can only see the transaction taking place in their Bitcoin wallet and also see the Bitcoin in the owner's wallet, but you cannot trace the user. So I feel sorry for those who used a centralized platform to purchase Bitcoin; they can be easily identified through their KYC details or log-in IP if the Spanish government wants to know the identity of individuals through the corporation of those entities that provide crypto related service. KYC is an attached to Bitcoin; it's always said in this forum.",

That's one of the reasons I'm always scared of transacting my crypto-fiat deals with centralized platforms that can still be controlled by government. With such information at their disposal, they will be able to track and monitor the financial activities of the crypto enthusiasts in the country which is a breach to privacy. P2P is still the best option or a decentralized exchange.",

If there is a law requiring companies to report transactions or balances exceeding 50,000 Euro, but there is no law that requires people to go through centralized services for transactions in order to legally prove their funds' origin later on, Bitcoin is still good to go for as long as people understand that it is important for the p2p economy to thrive. When the bundle of laws enfold mutual effects such that transactions facilitated by centralized services must be reported and using a centralized service is the only legal way to prove the origin of your crypto funds, it's starting to look worse for the industry. In Europe they initially planned a whole web of laws that would severely undermine privacy and the practicability of cryptocurrency usage, but it seems that they have revised their point of view from what I can tell for now.",

If you're going to insist on that I hope you base it on data and not on a misunderstanding like the other guy.This goes well beyond the EU MICA regulation, which imposes a full KYC obligation for transactions over €1,000, although it requires certain data below that threshold.Quote from: tabas on April 25, 2023, 10:08:51 PMI think that's not even new to the most that have been using centralized exchanges.

I think it is important for the government to strike a balance between regulating the crypto industry and respecting the privacy of its users. Laws that go too far in one direction or another can have unintended consequences, such as leading users to more anonymous and decentralized forms of crypto that are more difficult to regulate.As the crypto industry continues to grow it is imperative for governments to keep up with the latest developments and adapt their regulatory frameworks. We here certainly have the same expectations from the government where we agree that for future regulations to strike a balance between protecting users and supporting innovation in the crypto space.",
