They think that this kind of platform is a gateway in order to absoultey reap rewards after they invested a certain amount of money. But in reality, investing in cryptocurrencies require all the patience, determination, and knowledge similar to your conventional investment mechanisms (e.g. stocks, banks, real estate, etc.).If a person wants to profit in cryptocurrency, then they should treat it seriously- investing without knowing what you just entered into results into loss of your profit in the future.",

Investing in such tokens is like gambling so it is not out of place if he compares his own experience to gambling or Ponzi scheme.Crypto trading involves high risk so it is important to gain knowledge of how it works and always invest what you can afford to lose. If you are not knowledgeable about trading,  you will pay the price for ignorance through losses. Everybody must not engage in trading. If I am a bitcoin investor, I don't necessarily need to spend all my time reading about bitcoin. I just need basic skills on how to keep my hodling safe and keep getting updates from bitcointalk about current developments. I am sure this forum has the information I will always need. You have to also note OP that a few months might not be enough to make a profit from your investment because sometimes it could take years.",

If the token just suffered a little dump and the project is still actively developing, then there might be a higher possibility for him to recover his money. That's only if he did not sell out of panic, but if it was a scam token, then he will have to learn from his own experience and decide what to buy next time. People fail to understand most of the time that not every coin listed on any exchange is actually worth buying; they should learn how to do their own research before they go into buying any token. Some tokens out there don't even have any good use cases, which could be a reason why the token price is being pumped and sustained at the level that it might be, which could be as a result of a manual pump done by the team itself to attract victims who could be scammed. Unless newbies who are coming into the crypto community make time for themselves, learn how to do their own research, and don't be dependent on what people tell them to buy, they will never stop being victims of losing to some random cheap tokens.",

He now said he is quiting crypto and now comparing crypto investing to that of gambling. I know how that feels to lose thousands of dollars investing into one project because I also did that mistake just a few years ago.I will not say the particular project, but I invested IIRC around $2000 or even more on it. It's not a scam token though because it's still running, but I lost a huge amount of money on that project. Do I see crypto investing as gambling? Not at all because in investing, what you need is knowledge, and of course capital as well.  Gambling only requires luck, and a bit of knowledge about the game, but I can't say that investing into crypto is gambling. Maybe it's a gamble for those newbie investors who lost a huge amount of money like your friend.Quote from: odunybiz on July 09, 2023, 10:30:19 PMCONCLUSIONCrypto isn't for lazy people.

I'm lazy so it's not for me then. Kidding aside, I'm really a lazy person, but I found myself successful most of the time in crypto investing. Maybe the only mistake that I did was the one I shared, but all of my decisions are correct most of the time. Yes I did some research as well, but what I focused on investing my money with is the coins that has been there for long time already meaning the top coins are the ones that I'm investing. TBH, I'm lazy enough to not spend many time researching blah blah though I watch some videos at my free time.",

Yeah, we all know that Bitcoin won't make you rich overnight but still buy some and keep if you want to buy any altcoin make sure you don't go for any shitcoin you could buy some ETH and some other solid altcoins, your main aim should be for you to learn how everything works before you can start doing intense research on the project to spot the one that will give you a good return.If you just come into the crypto space because you saw someone invested in a project and was lucky enough to make a profit from it and you thought of investing in some shitty project just because they also promised the same thing the lucky project promised you'll only end up investing your money in a rug pull project.Quote from: SeriouslyGiveaway on July 10, 2023, 02:46:31 AM~~~He should complain with that person, not with you.However, seeking counsel from others is not a bad idea. Let's say that after investing in that project that resulted in his loss, if he returns to the same person who directed him to that project, the only thing he'll receive from that person is a bit of consolation, and if care is not taken, he might direct him to another project, and he might even further explain why the previous project didn't favour him in order to convince him even more.",

He'll see Youtubers say we'll hit $1M in another cycle or two, and when the price goes parabolic, approaching $200K, then he'll buy. And when the price goes down, instead of holding until the next cycle, he will sell at a loss out of panic because he will believe the price is going to 0.Many of today's Bitcoin haters followed that pattern in the past. And instead of recognizing their mistake and buying Bitcoin now, they secretly wish the price would go to 0 to be right.",

I think even in real business where you invest in somewhere like a shop, buying goods to keep, and other things require knowledge before starting, so I'm really surprised when your friend invested in cryptocurrency without the knowledge. However, even the bitcoin we advise people to invest in doesn't guarantee them that they should just go ahead and invest; they must have knowledge about it before investing. But he went and invested in shitcoins. He is not blaming himself for the mistake he made now that the market isn't moving the way he wanted it to, and instead, he is talking about quiting. I quiting will be better for him because he is not yet prepared to learn how the cryptocurrency market operates, he may comeback when his ready to do the real investment in order to learn.",

I have met many people who wanted to invest in cryptocurrencies, but luckily for them they never had enough money for a serious investment, and considering all the projects they had in mind that failed, everything turned out great for them.What I want to say is that some people learn the easy way, and some the hard way, and some people are just lucky at a certain moment and don't make a wrong step. Those who are aware of the risks of such investments should warn others whenever possible, and sometimes even banks that block clients from investing in cryptocurrencies make sense, because they actually save many naive clients from losing their money.",
