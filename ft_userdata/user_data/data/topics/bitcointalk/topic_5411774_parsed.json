I want to believe tthat you are no longer experiencing the depressive symptoms. It would have been nice to know what actually went wrong. Anyways, I hope you have learned your lessons. You should also take caution now that you are back to trading because in my estimation, there are more sophisticated scammers out there in 2022 than they were in 2020. So take care.

Because i understand that trading is all about strategies and before you comprehend the methods you most undergoes the understanding. And secondly knowing the basic things of cryptocurrency you most study the system very well by carrying a personal research.",

Were you buying high and selling cheap, or did you invest them in other cryptocurrencies? Considering that you registered your account in the forum in 2017, you should be able to comprehend how the bitcoin market functions and the challenges of being a trader. You even stated to have experience trading in other markets, such as forex, so you should have credible information to prevent all of these issues.I saw a website on your profile that sells tools for miners, traders, and other areas of the blockchain, why didn't you use the same tools to prevent losing 10 Bitcoin? It should have worked for you if you precisely mentioned it on that pages.",

I advise you don't seek other people's financial advice, you should have your own research to find success in trading.

What I have to tell you is to be more careful and mindful when ever it comes to trading with your assest. I lost $1000 $Matic on Binance exchange around February 2021, I sent the Matic to binacian exchange, waited for hours and It did not arrive, I had to read some terms/conditions I came across and I saw something that almost made me cry, what I saw was \"Only trade your Matic on quick swap\". I had no option than to accept the loss. After everything, I learned how to read terms and conditions/policies of any platform am using. Little guide that may help 1. Always read terms & policy. 2. Learn about the risk associated any platform your using. 3. Limit your asset if risk is too high. 4. Only trade/operate on trusted platforms. 5. Increased you security by adding 2FA. 6. Do not throw all your asset into one place that you are not 99.9% sure. 7. Seek opinion of other investors and pick out the good ones.",

Hopefully you are doing ok now, and have a lot of lessons to share to us specially on how to take care of our Bitcoin because that is a huge amount to lost in trading. Right after the bull run it was obvious that the price plummet and maybe you are doing leverage trading? Anyhow, hope that we can hear your experience so that those new in the game will not have to go to that just to understand how the market works and how you are going to make a lot of profit and maybe learn how to sustain it as well.",

It's great that you overcame the depression and are recovering from it.
