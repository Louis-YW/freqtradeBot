Mempool monitors its view of the mempool and runs a re-implementation of Bitcoin Core's transaction selection algorithm to determine the transactions it expects to see in upcoming blocks (source code here). Since there is a continual flow of new transactions, this algorithm runs every 2 seconds, and as a result, you will see the transactions projected to be in upcoming blocks change in near real-time.At the moment a new block is mined, Mempool saves a snapshot of its projected block template for the next block. We call this snapshot the expected block for the block height in question, and it serves as the basis for the block audit.When details for an expected block and actual block are available, we can compare them. The purpose of block audits is to deduce when miners intentionally include or exclude transactions from blocks they mine. Since this information cannot be precisely known, Mempool uses a handful of heuristics to accomplish this.Block audits highlight transactions in different colors to convey these heuristics:",
