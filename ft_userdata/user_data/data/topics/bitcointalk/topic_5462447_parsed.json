  "content": "Solaris is an innovative cryptocurrency that focuses on sustainability, scalability, and smart contract capabilities. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof of Mesh (PoM) which allows it to achieve high transaction throughput in an energy-efficient manner.Some of the key things to highlight about Solaris:It is eco-friendly and aims to reduce the energy consumption associated with crypto mining through its use of PoM consensus. This makes it more sustainable compared to coins that rely heavily on power-hungry mining.It has high scalability and fast transaction processing enabled by its mesh network architecture. This allows Solaris to scale efficiently as its network grows.It supports smart contracts (in the future), so developers can build decentralized apps on the Solaris Network and expand its functionality.It incorporates masternodes, which provide added security to the network while allowing masternode operators to earn rewards.It enables both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mining, giving miners and stakers ways to participate and earn.It has a fair initial distribution and governance mechanism that gives the community a say in decision making.It prioritizes user privacy through anonymous transactions.It offers easy-to-use wallets for seamless transfers and payments.Overall, Solaris brings together a unique mix of sustainability, scalability, smart contracts, and community governance. It's an innovative project aiming to drive decentralized solutions while minimizing environmental impact. Joining the Solaris community allows you to be part of this movement towards a more eco-friendly and decentralized future.Coin Specification:Coin Name: SolarisTicker: SOLSPoW Algorithm: cryptonight-upx/2PoS Enable Height: 777,600 (May change in the future)PoM Enable Height: TBAMaximum Supply: 21,000,000 SOLSBlock Reward: 1 SOLSDifficulty target: 10 secondsPre-mined: 1% (210,000 SOLS) (https://explorer.solaris-network.xyz/#funds)P2P port: 29000RPC port: 29001Genesis: August 7, 2023Whitepaper:TBABlock Explorer:https://explorer.solaris-network.xyz/Mining Pools:https://pool.solaris-network.xyz/Exchanges:Coming soonDiscord:https://discord.gg/MzCpu8uYecTwitter:https://twitter.com/NetworkSolarisSoftware:Github: https://github.com/Solaris-Network/Solaris/CLI Wallet/Daemon Binaries: https://github.com/Solaris-Network/Solaris/releases (Windows, Ubuntu 20, Ubuntu 18)GUI Wallet: Coming soonAndroid Wallet: Coming soonAndroid MinerWallet: Coming soon",
