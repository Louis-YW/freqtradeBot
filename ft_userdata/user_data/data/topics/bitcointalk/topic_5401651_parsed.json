      "body": "Again, folks, BEWARE!The web address given above is legit  but -- the telegram address is probable scam!Nowhere on Canaan's website do they make any mention of using ANY social media sites for ANY reason.Common sense should tell anyone that if a manufacturers website makes no mention of using social media channels then they sure as hell would not be using them as a sales channel. Canaan even goes as far as to state that they do not have sm channels like Telegram and warn you to NOT use them...When and if Canaan starts using SM channels it's a safe bet they will list the Official contacts/channels on their website.",

I don't have access to my hardwale wallet because it is broken and you know it. Don't put excuses to hold money that's not yours. You think you will steal my money just because my ledger is broken and i need to receive my refund in wallet i have access to ?  If you want me to make you famous scammers, go ahead and ruin your business for 6000$Of course i will abuse and attacking someone who hold my money against my will? I have provided each single verification needed and just because you don't have anything to say, you stick to that you want to refund my btc to the original wallet which you know i don't have access to, because my ledger is broken.Nice excuse, but people are not stupid. You are no one to hold my money. You know i have issue with my hardware wallet but you read and put only things you can twist and go for your own benefit. Your customer service is awful and i won't be surprised if you scam my 6000$",
