      "body": "Not the best season for meme coins, I guess. I mean, ofcourse if you have the resources, trying would be good but if it is limited, try to atleast avoid for now. The market is currently torn between dip and recovery. Big coins are having a hard time to recover which makes sense to think that it would be harder for smller ones. The point is, picking a coin that would give you profit once bullish season starts. At this point huge names in this industry are the ones which are more expected to lead the pump. Usually, non utility tokens only follows the trend. So if the demand in the first place is not stable, I think it would be a risky choice, just at this moment. Wyt?",

So I would say, or at least in my case, stir away from such investment today, doesn't make sense, just channel your funds to solid and top 10 altcoins, just saying.",

Never mind meme tokens, Bitcoin which is the king of crypto needs to be careful to buy. Especially with meme coins that are just someone's sensation in developing crypto. If the market is in a bullrun, if you sell trash on the stock exchange, then trash will sell. We don't need to discuss or promote meme coins for now. This is no time for meme coins. We only focus on the bear market, and continue to monitor Bitcoin.",

Other than that, start buying bitcoin if they can because that's what they need to do. Missing all of the opportunities that bitcoin is making is what makes people regret in the future when the bull run comes. As much as they want to buy at the cheap price, they don't want to buy when they see come.Instead of having a mindset of buying the next meme coin, buy bitcoin and be stable in DCAing it.",

I think though that you should have chosen another topic to write about because honestly if a website or a exchange or whatever gives the advice to buy meme-coins (now or even in general) that would be a big reason for me to not visit that website or that exchange anymore because in the end meme-coin are useless shit-coins that are just taking away attention and liquidity from real projects and i sincerely hope that the time of meme-coins is over.",
