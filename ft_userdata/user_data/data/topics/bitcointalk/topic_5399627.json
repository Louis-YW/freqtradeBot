  "content": "As for improving our knowledge about how to avoid a loss, we should always look at Fundamentals of Crypto. What is Crypto? Crypto is describing a large field of online-based digital currencies where cryptography is used as a technology for each coin. It’s is often referred to as Crypto. But in reality, Crypto is much more different, where each coins is different and based on own tech. It is like FOOD, sure it’s a very large filed but if a food is not nutritious, it doesn’t mean all food else is not nutritious. It’s very similar for CRYPTO. If an Altcoin fails, it doesn’t change Fundamentals of Bitcoin. Important to know to prevent a lossBitcoin has crashed really hard recently but we also need to mention what's important:Bitcoin wasn't responsible for what happened, Bitcoin was safe, working as usual and as usually proven since Bitcoin was started. It was caused by a single, very risky ALTCOIN, where fundamentals of were not proven sufficiently. It was a weak Altcoin causing a huge crash.An Altcoin, where no link to Bitcoin's tech was around. Bitcoin and Altcoins are totally independent, still people are getting FUD and sell Bitcoin causing a crash.People should be aware for a future, similar situation: Bitcoin wasn't responsible for what happened, Bitcoin was safe, working as usual and as usually proven since Bitcoin was started. No need to sell Bitcoin.Bitcoin is technically independent from AltcoinsPeople need to learn to be wise and don't sell Bitcoin when different Altcoins are having techical problems. It will likely happen a lot more because we have a lot of shady Altcoins! A very good recommendation: don't sell Bitcoin when a different Altcoin crashes! After all, such crashes will only re- distribute coins from weak hands to strong hands (HODLers).To be succesful means to understand Bitcoin is independent from Altcoins and to understand HODL.",

Huge difference between technically (tech wise) independent, from being independent market-wise. The case with Terra/Luna is that their LFG group held a good amount of bitcoin (and sold almost all of it to hopefully save the $1 peg), so obviously bitcoin would drop as per typical market forces.",

Bitcoin is also technically independent of the war in Ukraine and the rise in interest rates, and these, whether we like it or not, end up affecting price behaviour. What I believe is that bitcoin is the best-performing altcoin compared to the other altcoins in the coming years.",

Whenever there is a general drop in prices of cryptocurrency, FUD is bound to set in amongst different investors, and this causes them to sell out of panic. Well, for altcoin hodlers that is prolly the best thing to do, altcoins are short term projects, and you should not try to hold them through a bear market, sell them as soon as possible, even if you are at a loss, it is much better you leave with something, cause you could decide to hodl it, waiting for it to pump again, whereas that is the end of the coin.Having said that, Bitcoin investors should know better, Bitcoin is a long term project, and if you want to speculate with its price, you have to expect returns in the long run, people who are usually affected by correction/plunge phases like this are get rich quick investors who aren't quite knowledgeable about the network, another section of people who get too worried are also people who go contrary to the rule of thumb of \"do not invest more than you can afford to lose\", such people can't basically watch their life savings keep dropping, it can do a lot of damage to their health, thus once there is a general drop in the market, they sell immediately, even when they are at a loss.",

But still it's problematic that a shitcoin project can acquire enough bitcoins to severely affect the price, even if just temporarily. To me it's a sign that Bitcoin is still very far from maturity, because mature assets don't crash hard and fast when a minor player dumps them.",

So, any signs of difficulties the weaker hands for a lack of a better phrase, are likely to do the same thing with both; sell. That then might cause panic for a little more secure traders. So, genuinely we do see a somewhat correlation between the two. Although, bare in mind that the phrase \"correlation doesn't equal causation\" is actually quite accurate. As Bitcoin progresses, gets older, has less volatility due to the block rewards decreasing, we should see more stability, and it'll look more like a normal currency. That's when adoption will increase ten fold.",

This is in addition to regular banknotes. If that bank (corresponding to a blockchain community) crashes, the cheque - corresponding to an altcoin - ceases to become legal tender by the other banks.P.S. people who are stock-oriented tend to sell other cryptocurrencies when others fall because they expect most of them to fall with them.",
