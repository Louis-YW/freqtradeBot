  "content": "We came across these on twitter https://twitter.com/noecryptobank/status/1560617977657331712?s=46&t=b7vSGFdbGrgfx0j6NO2JrQThey are a custom privately issued edition and not sold directly from ballet. They appear to be an exchange that accepts fiat and crypto and uses a card issued by mastercard - sounds similar to crypto.com in that way. They do sell these on their site (found in the linked tweet above) in packs 1,3 or 5 and accept USDT only via thst method.I have spoke with them and they agreed to let me do a larger order direct with them.I have a week to place order so please let me know if interested asap.The cost is $40 per walletCan send pymt via the following addresses:BTC: 1GWQHNuVT92nYBS6ALNWUF4mAF9VQaHRBJUSDT (TRC20): TWiivDmm4XGZRTVTHj6iXa3aLXhgmvDzQBPayPal: MoparMiningLLC@gmail.comAny other method - please confirm with me prior to sending pymt.",
