  "content": "Hello guys,After reviewing the announcement topic of the [ANN][SENECA][SNCA] 1st PERMISSIONLESS LAYER 1 BLOCKCHAIN using ZK ENVIRONMENTWhat is Senca?A new Layer 1 blockchain built for the future of AI and applications. Seneca enables, for the first time, full apps to be built and run on a trustless system that requires no sharing or access to data.They launched a Seneca testnet named Zeno in Q2 of 2023. And they are targeting the end of 2023 to launch the Seneca mainnet.-------Seneca's Unique Technologies:* Zero Knowledge Environments* Intelligent Data Layers* Bidirectional Oracles-------Seneca pre-sale is Open now:Current price: $0.03Round target: $100,0001 pSNCA = $0.03* pSNCA itself will be minted on POLYGON mainnet, and they will allocate 85 million tokens in total for the presale, which is 5%.* There will be six rounds, priced at $0.03 USD per token for the first round, increasing to $0.08 for the last round.* A Seneca token will be called by the same name, Seneca, and the ticker symbol SNCA. For brevity, they will call the ERC-20 tokens minted during the presale of the pSNCA.-------These are some of the details I got through this project. I wanted to publish this topic to open a discussion about the Seneca project and the pre-sale event and to see your advice and opinions, and is this project really worth investing in? (This topic is not a paid promotion or invitation to invest) Please share your opinion & Do your own research and invest at your own risk.-------Project links:Official Website: www.seneca.tech/LitePaper: https://global-uploads.webflow.com/63d31392af6acec5e6d03ff0/6494560dfc1838c76b9aa2db_Seneca Litepaper V1.21.pdfTwitter: https://twitter.com/seneca_techLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/senecablockchain/Roadmap: https://global-uploads.webflow.com/63d31392af6acec5e6d03ff0/649446f7fc1838c76b875202_Seneca_Pitch_Deck.pdfToken Presale: https://www.seneca.tech/token-presale",

      "body": "I recently came across several new projects in the cryptocurrency space, and this particular project caught my attention. However, I'm puzzled by the lack of enthusiasm in its crowdfunding efforts. At times, I can't help but wonder if the subdued response is due to the prevailing economic conditions worldwide, rather than the sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. It's crucial that we don't let VCs maintain their dominance over the space and unfairly claim a significant portion of the returns, only to sell off their investments afterwards.",

      "body": "Wow ðŸ˜³ The project plans to mint 85 million pSNCA tokens for the pre-sale, which represents 5% of the total token supply. It's worth considering how this allocation may impact the token's scarcity and potential future value.The price is really affordable and everyone can bag it easily!",

I should connect my wallet on some new site because of tokens could get from trusted sites? Why?If it's a public offering, why not do IDO?But i am intrigued about the project. It's the first crypto AI project that i am even slightly interested to study more, maybe it's because i don't fully get it yet but i am reading more about it later tonight.",

      "body": "Wow it seems this is a fresh meat. Will gladly do some reviews OP. It seems they are pretty smart to launch on zk environment to bring some hype from an initial standoff.The gap on the price too is kinda huge. Ive just seen this today, does the 100k pool size for first round havent done yet? If its about AI related then its a hype one, hope the team isnt using those tagline for visibility and actually building something.",

In my opinion, if AI systems require any kind of financial compensation or transactions, cryptocurrency would be the ideal choice for convenient online payments on a global scale.I wasn't phrasing my point correctly. I should have said that AI doesn't really need their own crypto, because why couldn't do that by just paying them with coins that already exist / using zk projects that already exist? I how ever need to read their game theory about their tokenomics first to understand their goal, which i am doing next week because i don't have much free time.If someone wants to summarize it in here, i wouldn't mind.",
