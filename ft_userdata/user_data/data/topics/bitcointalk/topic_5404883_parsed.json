  "content": "The original and most famous physical version of Bitcoins was Casascius Coin, created by a guy in Utah named Mike Caldwell, which made of brass, with gold electroplating. This coin comes in different shapes, designs and forms. A Casascius physical Bitcoin showing an eight-character code (Source: casascius.com)This physical Bitcoins were pre-loaded or pre-funded with a certain amount of Bitcoin, such as 1, 5, 10, 100 or 1000 BTC. The coin also include both an identification number and a hidden private key.The main reason for designing these coins was: To be used for the purchase of goods or servicesTo facilitate the storage and/or management of BitcoinTo make them available for market transactionsTo act as an investment vehicleTo be used for the purchase of goods or servicesHowever, in 2013, Caldwell had to shut it down. The reason for shutting down was because of the intervention of FINCEN due to lack of required licensing to operate.Certainly, the fact and provenly discussed, Bitcoin is not a thing and will never have a physical form. But what if the world suddenly change and opt to in physical form, are we ready to embrace it?Sources:https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-physical-bitcoinhttps://www.cnet.com/culture/are-physical-bitcoins-legal/https://www.analyticssteps.com/blogs/what-casascius-coin",

Especially knowing that verifiability would be kinda difficult(unless you're using an Opendime, which is like $20 a piece). It's mostly a solution to a problem that isn't that that much of a 'problem' (aside from a few instances) in the first place.",

So why should bitcoin, the currency that was created to be digital from the start, go backwards and have a physical form?!Besides, \"Casascius\" and other similar objects were never \"physical form of bitcoin\" regardless of what they named them. They were clearly a collectible that only collectors or super enthusiasts were gathering as a \"fancy\" object not as a physical currency. Most of the bullet points you provided as reasons were wrong.",

As the world is already minimizing the usage of physical cash with the use of credit/debit cards and mobile applications, here we are reintroducing the old system to the modern people. Casascius coins are a thing of beauty, no doubt, and IMO they should be use more as a collector's item or a thing of novelty rather than a means to pay/get paid. Also, who would be the one who'd issue these physical coins anyway? They won't do it for free that's for sure, so aside from the loaded amount on the coin, you have to pay for the coin itself as well. I'll stick to paper wallets if ever, thank you.",

If eventually we are creating a physical coin that is going to contain bitcoin and we will have to carry it in order to make transactions it defeats the purpose of bitcoin itself. The question itself, therefore, is wrong. The question shouldn't be that is the world ready to embrace such a thing. Moreover, the problem that was there in 2013 will still persist as eventually, some private company will have to do this thing which means chances are it will have a lot of control over it's creation and usage.",

Even if it is fiat, many people are starting to use online payment systems and that is an expected development.Of course we are not talking about how money circulates in traditional markets but it is more of a global market which is expected to be more developed. So the physical financial system and physical money circulation will now be much less so that Satoshi really knows how bitcoin will be a good pioneer as a decentralized digital financial system development.
