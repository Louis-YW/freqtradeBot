  "content": "Hello communityI learn about all crypto casinos from here, I am usually sceptic to use them because most of them are Curacao licensed and that is best way to steal everyone without any consequences (at least for now), but I decided to bet with Playbetr.I opened my account on 16th this month, immediately I did deposit with BTC, deposited 0.045 BTC and placed two bets, the following day or the day after I try to login into the account and I was not allowed, so I basically logged in my account only once on 16th, did the bets (one won, one lost) and after that I was unable to login, I first thought I am putting wrong password, tried to recover password and again it didn't worked. I went to their Live Chat support and I was told to send e-mail to    support@playbetr.com , I did and they didnt respond for two days, after two days I went on chat again I asked same things they give same automatic replies, I asked can you ask your supervisors if my account is closed or something and whats the reason they dont respond to my e-mail, he says I can only confirm your account is closed and I am not allowed to give further details, I asked what to do next to get my money out, again I get response to write to their mail    support@playbetr.com, again I send mail again they dont respond.my username is kaladziski997 I can provide you all the proofs you need, I can send you all the selfies you can imagine just don't try to scam common people, previously I have checked terms and conditions my country isnt restricted area and so on.EDIT: Just forgot to add that now their Live Chat do not respond tooScammers profile link: https://www.playbetr.com/Amount scammed: 0.045 BTC + small won amount Payment method: Bitcoin Proof of payment:    8035a6c4775cc3c5c0b1dde9f03ec135e3208b1170815f5d87e82cb3dfcae4daI have saved just one chat with their LIVE CHAT (I did three so far)ME:Helloi try login and it deosnt allow meChat startedSupport joined the chatSupport:HelloCan you please tell me your username?ME:kaladziski997When i type my login details and I click login it gives me this page https://prnt.sc/wZzvc1f0ziAv and this showsafter that it redirects me back to thishttps://prnt.sc/7cG6_BTVWZZSand I haven't received any e-mail or anything informing me about it.

      "body": "Typical reply by Curacao licensed bookmaker/casino, hope one day they track you all down.Why you don't provide the forum legitimate proofs and everything about multiple account? You can say so about every account on your site that it is multiple account, in fact that is one of the ways to make legitimate scam on all your customers. I am ready to provide you all the selfie and all the documents that you ask for, this is simply stealing. I have only one e-mail address and I have used only one IP and one device to enter to your site and I know that my device never previously visited or checked your site, nor registered on your platform.I am ready to provide here on this thread also all the documents, we can certainly make it public if you want so.I already gave proofs and made everything public, I will post ID front and back, ID Selfie, ID with video, walk around the street for you if you need to identify it on Google maps or whatever, make selfie with newspaper saying it is today's date and I will go to notary, I will post it all just to prove you HOW CHEAP YOU ARE, just to show what all you request/make to steal funny amount of money.There are so many proofs saying that you are scam company, start from not sending \"Welcome mail for registering\" and end at \"Multiple account\" & \"Arbitrage betting\"Do you even have 3rd party who can rule against Curacao licensed bookmaker? But as I told you in the mail , do not worry you haven't dealed with someone like me (not threating or anything) but I have lawyer in Curacao who already won one bookmaker on court, you will be the second one. Ask your bosses about the case Your exciting innovations is exactly this, thinking of new ways to scam your customers   Not trying to spam or anything I just want to give an update here they still have not contacted me by mail or any way so that I can refund my funds or prove my identity, nor have they provided any proofs about their statements that I was having multiple accounts because that is not true and it is impossible to proof because it is impossible to prove something that is false!Also they continue to defend themself by deleting the posts I made in their thread where they are marketing their bookmaker.Also forgot to mention \" He is just trying to get back his deposit on this one, like he did on the previous one. \" This comment made by your side is out of any sense, I do not have any \"previous one\" and I ain't trying to get back my deposit, I want my money!Just to make it very clear, you have not sent one single mail to me about me opening account with you and about you closing my account, do you know what type of illegal activity that is at the very beginning of this case? Of course you do not because you haven't met such opponents till nowYou say me to try using third party, what third party ruling do you accept, does third parties getting involved even means something for Curacao licensed bookmakers? You think you can fool the newbies on the community here by saying this? I am being pro bettor for six years, I made a living of this and you think some two year old bookmaker with fake/shady license, with no number for contact, with no e-mail support can steal me over 800$ (That is your lawyers payment per day). Try googling/asking around what happened last time bookmaker went on court against (pro)-bettor in Willemstad  spoiler alert: they will say me to use https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.curacao-egaming.com who actually is getting paid (money being kicked in from bookmakers and casinos) and not one ruling has ever been made in favour of the player.Also if you reply, provide proofs about your statements as I did and not empty words and speculations like before, those we can read in other threads  Three days you don't reply, @Playbetr so you will just steal the money right? Meanwhile they are succesfuly deleting posts on their Thread where they promoted themselfs. https://prnt.sc/Bi2aQaFuZ6dW[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

This will look much better than the steps you took right now.This is a great discussion, so although we are no longer able to reply to the player, we will place some thoughts here. We cannot provide direct evidence to the player. We have invested countless hours of labor and hundreds of thousands of dollars in tools to detect abusive multi-accounting. By showing these tools to the player, he will figure out a new way to beat them. We have seen this happen many times, based on information we have provided in forums or directly to players. In fact, he is doing that right now, by going to a forum to get his deposit back, because he has seen that this was the standard in the past. We have already provided our evidence to a 3rd party mediator, who he has contacted. It is highly likely that after seeing our evidence, they will not waste their time with this case, but if they decide to take the case or need more information from us, we will cooperate and abide by their decision. When a player is proven to be in violation of terms, we can certainly return the deposit to the first account, at which time they are warned that any additional accounts found will be seized. If we return the deposits to all the multiple accounts, then the user is putting us at risk, because they will likely have some accounts go undetected, while they risk nothing on the accounts which are caught and have deposits returned. The only thing that can stop these groups is by letting them know that they are not welcome and will face penalties for their attempts to defraud us (yes, intentional multi-accounting is fraud, as they are lying about who they are).  In the case of this player, he had his funds returned on another account already. This is not his first account. It is also not his last account. Any legitimate player who is against these penalties, is not doing what is best for the industry. I think the problem here is that people do not realize the scope at which this occurs. These are not accounts which are playing fairly. They are accounts which have their own tools in place so that they cannot lose on sportsbooks. These tools include placing late bets, arbitrage, using valuebet or surebet bots, using forking scanners, corridor betting, match fixing and more. These are people who are banned by every fiat sportsbook, so they create accounts at the Bitcoin ones. For years they have been stealing millions of dollars from us and we have joined forces with other reputable sites, along with the sportsbook odds providers to clean up the industry. Within a week of adding additional sportsbooks to Playbetr, we had hundreds of new abusive accounts. These aren't individuals who happened upon us. This is a handful of professional abusers or syndicates, which create as many accounts as they can, to try and slip as many accounts by us as they can. Again, these are accounts that are using some sort of banned tool, so they cannot lose. We would never accuse a player of multi-accounting or seize funds without 100% certainty of it. We have lost millions of dollars by paying out players who we weren't sure about at the time, but based on further investigation, we were able to determine it. In collaboration with other operators, sportsbook odds providers and security companies, we all continue to progress our skills, with a single goal in mind: To improve the sports betting industry. We operate with complete transparency and are not afraid of the extortion attempts of this and other players, who for so long have been using these forums to gain sympathy and get money. Our reputation is stellar and we have never ignored an accusation. We provide more information than nearly any other site, because we believe transparency is the key to establishing trust, but we simply do not have the time to explain ourselves multiple times. We responded immediately to this accusation. The player leaving 10 additional comments afterwards does not require us to respond further. We told him he is welcome to seek 3rd party mediation. He did. And we provided our evidence. If nothing further occurs, then the mediator has made his decision. We are growing rapidly and paying out far larger amounts than this all day long, often to players from this forum. Legitimate players are always paid. Thanks and best of luck to all!",

IP address match? It could be vpn. Betting pattern match? Thousands or millions of users are gambling, it's very likely many will have similar pattern.  There could be many more anti argument for anything that you will provide until you KYC a user with video conference. Have you done KYC for the first account? If you have then do KYC for the account who is accusing now. See if it's the same person then you can tell it's 100% owned by same person.

The industry needs to work with this limitations forever.QuoteWe would never accuse a player of multi-accounting or seize funds without 100% certainty of it. We have lost millions of dollars by paying out players who we weren't sure about at the time, but based on further investigation, we were able to determine it. In collaboration with other operators, sportsbook odds providers and security companies, we all continue to progress our skills, with a single goal in mind: To improve the sports betting industry. We operate with complete transparency and are not afraid of the extortion attempts of this and other players, who for so long have been using these forums to gain sympathy and get moneySee here is the problem. It's not all transparent unless there are providing blockchain evidences or unbreakable evidences. Did the player got solid evidence? No (I am not saying to give him every bit of information but throw out some definite clue for him, so that he can not argue anymore), in the public place do we know if you are telling 100% truth, you are asking to believe your words (I have no problem considering the years of reputation you have but should we count on this?). Again throw out some clue so that it looks unbreakable. Right now all transparency are in between you and the third party you are using.@b0r0, did you seek 3rd party mediation as PlayBetr is claiming, what is their take on this case?QuoteWe told him he is welcome to seek 3rd party mediation. He did. And we provided our evidence. If nothing further occurs, then the mediator has made his decision.",

Also please use regular text formatting. It's hard to read with the blue wall of avatar like texts. It kind of sounds like you are blaming the victim here. How about people just not create abusive multiple accounts and this won't be an issue? It is impossible to please everyone here. If we give him the information about how he was caught, then he will be able to create new accounts without being caught. If we insist on high level KYC upon signup, then people will not play here because other Bitcoin sites do not require this. Many, many multiple accounts are found and closed, prior to them depositing. But there will always be ways to create new accounts. These abusive players make enough money to where they can pay someone else to do KYC. We have seen it happen countless times, which is why you hear about Skype calls, taking pictures near local landmarks and other seemingly invasive verification methods. There is no way to make everyone happy. When an abusive account is found on the withdrawal review, people ask why wasn't it found until he requested a withdrawal. In this case, we found him before he tried withdrawing and now people ask why wasn't he found on signup. The reason is that these people are professional cheaters and it can take many hours of research to confirm what is happening. This is bad for the industry, because it takes that time and money away from making better products for the vast majority of legitimate players. Therefore, blanket statements like \"That's the way the industry is\" or \" The market is still thriving\" do not have to apply here. We are doing what we can to make the industry better. We are doing it fairly. If players continue to create multiple abusive accounts, that is not on us, and they knew what they were risking when they attempted to cheat. If everyone just got their deposits back, they would be risking nothing. If abusive players know that they will no longer get their deposits back, they will be forced to find other work. In every society, thieves receive penalties for their crimes. We are not to blame, if a thief decides to steal a second time. Play fairly and you will get your winnings quickly. It is that simple.",

You are not taking a stand for 800$ you are taking a stand for 80 000$ lawsuit costs, because after all you can not confiscate anyone's money on your own will. This right here attests to our point. This cheater knows that IP address and KYC are meaningless in this case, so he is asking for those. Hardly anyone is caught by IP address or KYC any more, because cheaters know that people used to be caught by IP address and KYC. Once he realizes how he was caught this time, then next time he does this, he will ask for IP address, KYC and the new thing, which he has now learned how to avert. All he is doing is saying words to get sympathy. This matter is being reviewed by a 3rd party moderator. We have no further comment on the case. If anyone would like to have an open discussion on security, we can do it on another thread. Thank you to all our loyal supporters.",
