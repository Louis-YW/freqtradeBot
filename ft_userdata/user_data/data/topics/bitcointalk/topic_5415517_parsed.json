Email Address: Code:michael-rutkowski@y.kajabimail.netEver since the completion of the Ethereum merge, scammers have been coming up with different tactics to confuse and scam crypto users. I got a mail saying metamask needs to be verify, due to Ethereum merge. Basically it is a mail with a phishing link, never click on this type of mail, because your wallet, computer may get hacked due to this phishing software.After seeing this mail before clicking on the link I understood that it was actually a trap as I was already aware of this kind of scam. So I took the link and did a virus check and my guess was correct.Source: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/07713206761d8604657a7580dc6adeae23c827873c6642b63d3d49881b8fa78c?nocache=1",

We have seen a lot of scams being done near and after the ETH event. Scammers tried every possible trick to get people's private keys by giving them greed to get free Eth coin after the fork and god knows how many innocent people have fallen for this scam.Even these scam alerts are published everywhere on social media, yet people are so lazy and greedy that they will give every information to the scammers.",

But many times they panic and open any kind of wallet related email and follow all the steps, which end up falling victim to the scam. It is not always that these emails are sent to your subscribed email, but sometimes the data of many important websites is leaked and your email is stolen from there too. After that scammers use those emails to spread such phishing.",

But I easily notice that they are scam after seeing the email use by the sender since it was a junk email. The website that direct me when I click the wallet upgrade ask me upfront my wallet private key. I was surprised how they get my email since I only use this email on my online casino account. I'm curious if some casino is selling or leaking my email to this kind of scammer. FYI I have tons of casino account that associated with this email. It will be very hard fr me to pin point whose doing the shit leak. Keep safe!Email Content:",

Keep safe!Email leaks are very common now, it is very difficult to find out from which website your email has been leaked. Sometimes people with bad intentions steal user information from various websites and sell it on the black market. It is also seen that some websites sell user information So your email went to scammers through these ways. Avoid clicking on any links from unknown emails to stay safe.",
