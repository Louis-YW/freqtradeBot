The point is to have a percentage of success which satisfies the gambler and I am afraid this percentage is so low that won't be suitable for the average person.Not even mentioning that this is basically brute-forcing other's keys, which is distasteful, to say the least. Just my two sats.",

This is not gambling at all because this service is offering a hacking service to steal balance on somebody wallet. This kind of game assuming this will become successful will create negativity in Bitcoin since leaving your balance on your wallet address is not safe.Good thing that hacking a certain private key is almost impossible to occur. This is a illegal gambling imho because the user are committing a crime by using such service.",

People are brute-forcing billions if not trillions of keys per second, OP's site is insignificant compared to them.It's kinda funny that the moral aspect of this comes up every time. It's not as if Bitcoin address generation is a secret. If you worry about brute-forcing, you shouldn't use Bitcoin. Or educate yourself.You know who else brute-forces Bitcoin addresses to check for their balance? YOU! Every time you install a new Electrum wallet, it brute-forces 20 addresses, and if they have any balance, it shows up in your wallet!",
