I only recommend that you be humble when you enter the contest, don't influence other people to choose your work for any reason. everyone has their own judgment, and it would be fairer if everyone was given the freedom to choose based on quality, not intimidation.hopefully, we can learn to respect other people's choices to maintain fairness!thanks, and have a nice day!",

And it's not pointless action since a user was banned in past after 4 user report his PM, see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5186601.0.3. If that user actually intimidate you, isn't it wise idea to let other people know?",

I'm not accusing anyone, I'm just thinking logically, given that the voting results can be seen publicly.I also agree with @ETFbitcoin that this topic will have no purpose if you don't do something concrete from what was suggested, and I'm sure you're not the only one who got such a PM from the same member.",

You may be able to report the PM if it bothers you, but if it doesn't, you just need to let the member know it was a bad attempt to win a prize.OP, after all the reputation board may not be the right guide board for the user you think is wrong. Move your thread to the beginners & help boards if your main goal is something like this:Quote from: Ludmilla_rose1995 on November 07, 2022, 06:50:22 AMfor all contestants.

I'm sure there will be many people who support you publishing people who ask for your support.but if the PM form is something simple and does not cause any effect. I guess you don't need to create this thread.although the contest organizers emphasized that no manipulation should be made in the voting (alt/begging accounts). There will be people who do it without us knowing it.Quote from: ChiBitCTy on November 03, 2022, 03:18:51 AMIMPORTANT NOTES:~No manipulation of any kind allowed. If I see you trying to manipulate the votes in any way, I reserve the right to disqualify you. Please no alt-accounts, no begging for votes etc. Â  ~",

Was the pm intimidating or threatening? Was it from a DT member who threatened to tag you if you don't vote for them?I don't think that there is anything wrong if someone genuinely ask for your support. You ought to have replied the pm with these words \"Sorry, I will vote another person whose work I think is better than yours \". You may decide to add these further words \"Next time, put more efforts in the context more than in sending pm for support\"I have recieved pm from users who were banned, that created ban appeal. When I recieve such pm, I will visit the appeal thread, if they have good reasons to be unbanned, I'll support their application, otherwise I'll let them know.If someone can ask for support during ban appeal, they can also ask during context. It will only be a problem if there is monetary inducement or intimidation as Op stated in their post.",

      "body": "I got two friendly pm's from two different users about voting on that pumpkin carving contest thread. I don't think it's an imposition that I don't like, and even I am willing to review their work even though I don't know what decision to make. Like it or not, that's up to me because basically not everyone thinks unsolicited pm's are really bother if they're friendly enough to do.I didn't create thread and didn't even report the pm, it's just about me and two different users sending me the pm. But I really believe they seem to be just asking for support without begging because I didn't see anything pushy from those two pm. But because this is contest for fun for celebration with prizes that don't mean much, then I think the community and users can make their own choices on each user and whoever they are with their best work.",
