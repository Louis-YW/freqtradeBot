I agree with that, bitcoin has redress many times and has proven its capacity to recover to any price whenever you feel that the market has moved against you as an investor or holder, all that is needed is the patience to wait for some time before you see that Bitcoin has recovered and achieved your desired price.This is the reason why I always tell those who think that they have missed out on anything as regards to Bitcoin and are feeling that they are already late to join the Bitcoin holders fold, because, bitcoin will always have a way to reward everyone who endeavours to be patience and wait for long term base instead of giving up at current point if the price of Bitcoin may not be to the advantage.",

However, hodling may not be as easy as others may imagined like you just want to invest and decide to hold it forever with no plans to sell. There are always inevitable temptations in the market and if you are weak, you will easily fall on the market‚Äôs trap and end up selling earlier. Fears and doubts are common for hodlers most particularly for those who have never experienced risk management. This is the reason why one should study its investment first before trying to indulge in it. So that there will be no regretting in the process, and you just stick to your plan and goal which is to invest and hold and reap massive profits when the perfect time comes.",

Cus I rarely see them taunting anyone that supports BTC this days.. and yes ofcourse, most of this maniacs are also HODLers ..shocking right? \"I was running through my cell phone few days ago and I got the update - a mail was sent and an attachment too - about the increase in price of BTC.. 61k is just enough to harvest as much interest as you can folks!!Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

And what you say is true because the traces are like that, and it applies to those who are experienced or who assess or read Bitcoin's movements well, that after a decline, Bitcoin always recovers. And the key is to be patient and calm in waiting for this moment, even though it will take a long time for your capital to return and you will not lose money when selling when prices fall due to panic.And even Bitcoin will not only recover but will surpass the highest price of the previous purchase price if you are more patient, and create good even big profits.",
