You're right it might just be tokens or something else, as usual. Investing in new coins at there is very risky, it is not recommended.

This shitty exchange site will always be repeating to create more and more fork once the old fork dead or has no demand. Yobit is always using this trick to fool its own traders and users. How stupid the people who are still using this garbage exchange site. Just marked this as an exchange site that must be included in your ignore list.

This Yobit in-house shitcoins are even worse than regular scammers who create useless coins and tokens and promote them on social media and forums. Regular shitcoins at least have a blockchain, unlike this Yobit scam tokens. I saw recently that they were promoting the Luna fork, and now they have decided to try the same thing with Bitcoin. They employ the same strategy over and over again. Apparently they are running out of ways to lure new victims into their scam. They even offer a bonus for new registrations of 4700 FUSD (Fast Dollars), but they were actually supposed to say Fake Dollars because this is just another worthless in-hosue token!",
