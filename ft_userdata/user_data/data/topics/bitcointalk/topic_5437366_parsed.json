  "content": "Duelbits.com The Criminal CasinoThe new age of shady mafia run casinos .   Instead of a smoke filled room behind a meat shop. These criminal organizations have gone the route of the offshore unregulated crypto casino.  While looking legitimate on the surface these sites have a nefarious and dark underbelly. Which includes seizing players funds,  rigged casino games,  sport match rigging and much more.  After in-depth investigation and research We have discovered a global criminal organization running the site Duelbits.com.Duelbits.com Is an unregulated crypto casino based out of Eastern Europe .  They allow anonymous deposits and withdrawals In cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to get by taxes and to hide there identity. They have no regulating body and are beholden to no one . All you need to set up an account is a email and password.  Now in my opinion if they were an honest and trustworthy casino paid out with no nefarious activity.  There would be no problem but while running as a normal casino Duelbits.com runs several scams .After in-depth research we have found they run four main scams.The first and most troublesome is they seize customer funds and block withdrawals for little to no reason . There has been over 100 reported cases of this and that was only what was reported . We believe there is many more cases not reported . In  many cases they say it’s in their terms of service that they can seize funds for any reason they deem necessary. And once Duelbits.com Seizes your funds you have no recourse as there have complete control .  While they don’t steal all customer funds to increase their profits they selectively scam people. We interviewed several victims and found that they were mostly new players that had deposited a larger amount. The second scam and most notorious is there fixed table tennis and beach volleyball . Now I’m sure most people would not bet on these two sports . Duelbits.com offers bets on these two sports 24/7 And has thousands of table tennis matches running per day.  They also have beach volleyball running 24/7 . The sports book provider that they have a deal with runs these two tournaments .   The table tennis tournaments is called Liga pro . Their a fake table tennis tournament run by the sports book to Fix matches. If you bet on one of these matches the sport book will directly influence the results causing you to lose. There has been hundreds of news articles talking about this and several legitimate sports books have taken them down . The reason Duelbits.com still runs them is because their sports book provider runs the tournaments greatly increasing their profits by fixing matches and controlling the results.  They’re under investigation by several organizations but because these table tennis tournament  Or run in Ukraine and Russia they’re outside the legal Jurisdiction of the police organizations investigating them. There has been arrests For proven match fixing in Liga pro. The other tournament they run is winners cup volleyball. They use the same scam where they run the tournaments then influence The results to increase their profits for fixing matches.While on the surface Duelbits.com will claim they’re legitimate sports matches there is an abundance of evidence of match fixing and close connections between Duelbits.com and Liga pro and winners cup beach volleyball. The next scam they run is rigged casino games . There’s two sides to this first is they post fake house edge number. They will claim 5% house edge in a specific casino game but the results will show a much higher house said closer to 20% for most games. This is demonstrated by results pulled from over 50 different people that have bet with Duelbits.comOn Slots we have seen the average house edge of 18.6% on their house games such as dice and crash we Have seen house edges 3 to 4 times the. Posted house edge.  Also for everyone out there that doesn’t know what house edge is . It’s the percentile of money you will receive back for every dollar you bet.   So in theory if a game has a house surge of 5% if you bet $100 you should win $95 With the loss of five dollars. But with Duelbits.com Rigged games you will see a much higher house edge . And now to the second part of the rigged casino games  They claim their house games Such as dice and crash. Our provable fair. Which in short means they  can’t  be rigged  because they don’t control the results . The truth is their site is not provable fair . They use a fake provable System to trick customers and Build trust for there casino.  Also when you go to complain after getting weird results they can claim it out of their hands it’s provable fair.  We have tested their system and found there’s many ways Duelbits.com.  can exploit The system to directly control the results. Giving them the ability to increase the house edge and to steal customers funds. And now the last scam this is less of a scam and more of a nefarious  Business practice.  Duelbits.com  runs several fake review sites claiming their site is trustworthy and great. We have tracked them back to Duelbits.com Via their Domain name register And host. We also have seen several instances where they try to get bad reviews and reports of their scamming removed from various sites such as trust pilot. We have also seen several fake reviews on review sites they always come in batches to cover up the several horrendous reviews and reports.  Our conclusion is that while there might be a few trustworthy casinos out there it’s not worth the risk dealing with unregulated crypto casinos.  Duelbits.com Is  a criminal organization that makes millions of dollars. And there’s nothing anyone can do .  We wrote this investigative report in hope So that we can save a few victims from Duelbits.com and other sites like it.  If you’re playing on Duelbits.com right now and have not been scammed yet it’s just a matter of time.  Do your own investigation we hope we have helpedContact us at email below to report more of Duelbits scams we will look into them we are starting website to expose them duelbitsreportteam@gmail.com",

There are 4 main scams, it could be easy to provide the evidence since screenshots can be acquired by the users. Even evidence of tournaments in Ukraine and Russia can also be acquired easily but games being rigged might be difficult to prove. I've seen scam accusations to this casino but if they were proven, they may just have a negative trust by now. Don't get too emotional about this but leaving your email makes it sound like Game-Protect.",

I imagine that you must have noticed that in this forum people value reputation, so I ask you: - you post on this forum all evidence you have of them- you don't post on this forum all the proof you have of them and create a websitewhich of the options do you think will be more effective?if you know that they are a casino based in eastern europe and you say you have a lot of  proof against them and witnesses, then file a case with the police since they are based in europe they would have already been arrestedso I ask you:do you have  proof  against them or are you bluffing?",

I am not familiar with running ones own site for review but almost all casino manipulates their review in different platforms. So if you really need to pull the trigger for this crime then you will need to ban all casinos that exists.About rigged casino games, as far as I know there are game providers. Any casino is just using the providers. It's not just duelbits but everyone.About Fixable table tennis and beach volleyball, don't tell me that they only have markets for these two sports. Everyone has.Seizing customer funds and blocking withdrawals, you need to come up with strong evidences.It looks like you have personal problem with them. Other than that I can not find any reason for your to cry. It's a crypto casino, no one gives a fuck of money laundering and such things. Crypto is open for everyone.",

Sorry if I may offend you, duelbits.com is one of the well known gambling site I have ever seen in this forum with no negative report so far. Besides they have been running a signature campaign for close to 3 years now and is being managed by a well recognized and respected manager @Hhampuz. How come no complaint have gotten to him because I believe if he noticed that the campaign will be paused to clear all doubt and allegations. As long as I know, this site is trusted and have never scammed anyone before, maybe it could be that they are doing better than your casino because what projects owners normally do is to pay someone to post against their competitors in other to drop their trust and reputation.Finally, if such allegations is said to be truth why not make some evidence to prove is legitimate. Btw let's hear from the manager if he has also encounter any hit or complaint from any of his participants from campaign about what you just said concerning duelbits.com",
