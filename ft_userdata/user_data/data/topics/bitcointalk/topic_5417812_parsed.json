At the end of the day, it's always good to explore new things. I do not have much information if anyone has researched on it previously or not. But couple of months back I read something about a society that speaks about a world without border and they also issue their own passports. Their passport is useless but they have a strong league of followers. I am unable to remember now but a Google search may help.",

Different countries could be match based on global values and have laws set that govern them or individual countries or parts.You can't enforce a law that the US and Europe voted for to throttle a cultural ritual of a minority state in Africa or south America. Equally, Indian and Chinese cultures under such system would have half of the voting influence over the world - and foreign entities legislating for something you care about is just going to reduce their power.Several competing systems with 5-30 million people might do better to resolve some of these problems but then do you still want to set international laws on some things: if 99% of the population votes to ban slavery, should it be banned? There's going to be a lot of conflicts in between that and even controls on substances like bans on alcohol, nicotine, caffeine and cannabis.",

I think it's fairly safe to say that such a system of governance would be incredibly difficult to create. In fact, I hardly think such a system would be even slightly possible, given the current state of technology and the nature of human beings. However, even if such a system were created and it worked, I doubt that it would be the best form of government for humanity as a whole. As an aside, I don't think there is such thing as \"the best form of government.\" Each system has its own strengths and weaknesses, and what works for one society may not work for another. Of course, I suppose this is only one interpretation. The idea makes for some good philosophical debates, at least.",

Well, a global government but without the corruption and inefficiency sides.Does anyone know about serious articles, posts, research on this subject? Thought and ideas welcome too.I think this concept is what Gene Roddenberry tried to portray with star trek. The concept of a one world government or centralized authority in a United Federation of Planets. Star wars also users a similar hierarchy with its Republic Senate. Trek tends to take it a step further with the emphasis on wealth, money and credits being deemed trivial issues. The appeal of a one world government is the elimination of borders and travel visas. Trade tariffs, trade wars might be eliminated to a relative degree. Which might allow the efficiency of manufacturing, production and shipping industries to rise. It might be structured similarly to reasons used to make the EU european union attractive to europeans. If the united states functions better as a conglomeration of states than it would with every state being a separate nation, that could be an argument on the centralization side.Its a very old state revolving around concepts like state sovereignty, which used to be discussed and debated to death on forums and message boards across the internet. Its been a long time since I've seen anyone mention state sovereignty.",

If you're planning to use the idea in the creation of a crypto project yes it can work but creating a global government that will be governed in a decentralized autonomous way.

If there is a new consensus mechanism that will be made out of this then I think it will be PoH or can be PoT which means proof of honesty and proof of transparency.",

If there are some scientist working on it, I would expect it to be a very small field. The thing with global governments is that all countries need to agree on it and as long as the world is so divided there would be no consensus. It would make a lot of sense to have a government body that sits above all countries and can help in difficult tasks. Especially in crisis times like we had with the covid pandemic, it would have been completely different. If all countries work together to get the same vaccines, follow the same social distancing rules. We could have contained the virus much easier. Also having Apps that trace the people you come in contact with would have been much more effective globally. And still a global government seems not realistic at the moment. Politicians are so reluctant to give up power that I don't see any majority for it on a national level.",

Well, a global government but without the corruption and inefficiency sides.People have gone overboard with this whole decentralization thing.If you think that works wonder why isn't any real story of success after thousands of tries to decentralize government ar regional levels? The whole thing of having 100 people with 200 ideas deciding on what they do independent from the 100 people in the next village with another 2000 ideas has led to deal nightmares, instead of the whole region deciding on a transport hub with a big airport, for example, each medium-size city has built it's own and guess what, they are all losing money since no city alone has enough passengers to keep it profitable and with enough destinations and because of that everyone goes to the capital to fly anywhere outside Europe.  Transportation, tourism, energy infrastructure everything has become a mess since decentralization, just imagine the whole madness that will start if everyone is allowed to decide on their own on wages, pension, taxes on so on!There are things where decentralization is good, there are things where it will be a complete disaster, just think what will happen if each school decided on its own curriculum? And what will happen if the same school votes to change it while you're in the middle of your studies?Quote from: Zilon on October 21, 2022, 09:04:44 AMWhen satoshi thought of a decentralised currency many must have proposed discouragement but today it is a big reality.

This is a nice research that can have good proceed if looked into. And where is the decentralization there?Instead of 3 political parties, you have 3 pools holding 60% of the hashrate and two entities on ETH holding more than 40% alone.You're mistaking the ability to use a decentralized system with the governance of the said system, when did you last cast a vote on what to change on either protocol? When was the last election of who will be in charge of the future change for both systems?  It's one thing to make use of a system and dump it once it doesn't feel right to you or the changes made by the leader are not the ones you agree like what Buterin is doing to ETH, but that won't be possible in governance, you will have to obey the rules of that country you like it not.",

The people in power and who have the ability to wield billions, if not trillions, are not going to give an inch of ground to you - however noble you might think your idea might be. Governments have spawned and developed over many hundreds, if not thousands of years, to serve the people of their country rightly or wrongly. You could look at the blockchain model as a very effective system for potential transparency in voting but beyond that your idea is neither original or unique. Many people, including hippies, have had these wild ideas over time but it does not amount to anything because there are many vested interests with the ability to either quietly or publicly crush you.",

I did not expect that many.Thank you @Orpichukwu for the links.I will try the write a draft soon to be clearer about the mechanisms of the DAGG.One main critic in the answers is that powerful entities and leaders will oppose this DAGG, in order to keep their power. Quite the opposite, the DAGG will have incentive mechanisms and being a more efficient system, there will be some advantages to plug to it. In fact, if you don't plug, you will eventually lose your power. Some people building layer one blockchains or Dapps on ETH were powerful people in the traditional economy; did they give up their power to plug Dapps on ETH? No, they saw an opportunity and a market, and so will it be with entities plugging to this DAGG. Although it will deal with political and ethical opportunities rather than just economical.Now, it's a Herculean task to design this structure and incentive mechanisms. It's indeed all about the implementation, but I beg to differ with people saying straight on that this idea is never going to work because of powerful people or the issues of current decentralized networks, that's just a lack of imagination about the implementation.Cheers!",
