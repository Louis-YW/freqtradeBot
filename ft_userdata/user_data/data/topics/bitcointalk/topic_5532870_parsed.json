Don't care about it, but it's good if you can do something to expand Bitcoin adoption in more areas including remote areas.QuoteWe encourage Internet business or trading of btc or investment platforms it will help better these lives at rural environment. What do you think?My thinking is startup business can destroy lives of many bussiness entrepreneurs.Trading Bitcoin from Spot to Margin or Futures trading types can destroy finance of many people.Investment in Bitcoin can help, but only if you buy and store your bitcoin safely and by this, I emphasize, don't store your bitcoin on centralized, online platforms.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

They need to find a job first to address that.Although Bitcoin is considered one of the best investments, we shouldn’t assume it will always be profitable, especially if we’re not in it for the long term. If you don’t have extra savings to invest, it’s better not to force it, you’ll just get bored waiting and might eventually panic.Here’s what they need to do:1. Find a job.2. Save money.3.

What do you think?understanding how bitcoin works for people in that kind of environment will appear too technical for them because of there lack of exposure to foundational technological knowledge. there is a level  of knowledge that is needed to consider some form of investment and for people in a very rural part of the world, it is quite understandable that their investment choice will be more centered on what they have been used to.talk investment to someone that all his life has been centered around farming, fishing or one agricultural niche or the other, his exposure would not allow him try any form of investment he is not familiar with. digital divide is what ought to first be treated before introducing them to bitcoin investment. it might surprise you that some of them don't know how the banking system works and if that is so, how then can they understand bitcoin? if you try to persuade them by all means, it will only suggest that are trying to scam them. people in rural area need exposition to basic social amenities like you have pointed out and from that point they can now grow into knowing about bitcoin and make the choice of investing in it or not.",

What do you think?Don't rely to much on it since there's nothing instant or passive especially when you are new. Better find regular job or alternative source of income so that you will never get broke if unfavorable situation occurs.Getting decent or realistic profit with Bitcoin takes a lot of time and if you think you can passively earn money for trading Bitcoin then I'm afraid that what you expect might not came knowing how volatile the price of Bitcoin and there would be unexpected situation that might result to lose everything you have. So settle your expectation and better make Bitcoin as alternative option when you find good asset to invest.",

And the only challenge they might face is the finance. In those areas even though they have the knowledge about cryptocurrency, there is no capital to start the investment so if you tell them and educate them they still need funds to start the investment.",

Hence, rural areas should have quality schools to teach children how to read, write, and understand basic concepts. I also agree that rural dwellers should have access to basic amenities like electricity and internet connection so that they can tap into the opportunities that the digital world offers. I frown at people mostly politicians who always distribute food items and money to the poor people in rural areas. Rather, they should organise training sections where young rural dwellers will learn viable skills that will enable them to be useful to themselves and the society at large.",

Yes, financial support is the main thing they experience because it is different from living in a city where you can easily earn money by working or whatever. And introducing skills to them or improving the skills they already have to be able to earn money, and that is a very good way. Because to be able to get involved with Bitcoin they need to trade or buy it periodically according to their ability and save it for the long term, and after they have income we can introduce Bitcoin to them and buy it after they prioritize their important needs.And I agree with you that more towards long-term investment is a good choice, because trading does require sufficient experience and also sufficient knowledge to be able to become a profitable trader. And what must be known is that their intelligence must be limited because I think trading is not the right choice for those who live in rural areas.",

What do you think?In remote areas where there is no proper system of online services or there is a small scale, it is necessary to develop all those places. I think they need financial development first. Even if a subject like Bitcoin is taught there, they will not be able to retain that education because they are burdened with financial costs. First, it is necessary to provide employment in those places. After employment is created, they will be able to save money. Only those who have money will be eligible to invest in Bitcoin. No matter how good advice I give them, if they do not have money, they will not be able to invest. That is why they have to earn money first and when they are able to live a normal life. They can choose any investment platform to increase their money to be profitable.However, I welcome such a bold initiative of yours. If the awareness of Bitcoin can be increased among the people of remote areas, they will definitely be ahead in knowing about Bitcoin compared to others. If they can afford to hold an investment platform like Bitcoin for the long term, they will certainly be able to improve their financial situation.",

Apart from the lack of internet which I think is too basic to be lacking, their financial strength like you said is another factor that'll limit their interest in Bitcoin if you take the teachings to these areas. Like you said, it's also very much important to try create skills that'll help improve their earnings thereby equipping them financially so those who would develop interest when Bitcoin is introduced can as well have the basic finance to invest by trading or holding. Bitcoin is one of the greatest financial innovations in the history of global finance system and taking the knowledge to every corners of the universe I think is our collective responsibilities.",
