  "content": "What is Bidcent?Bidcent is a peer to peer blockchain game that competes two teams in their bid amount. Players can bid on any team to participate and can also bid on the opposite team any time of the game. After the bid total of both teams exceed the minimum bid total, a countdown timer will start. Every new bid resets the timer. When the the timer goes to 0, the team that has the most bid value wins the game and gain all the bid value of the opposite team. The amount shall be divided in proportion to how much they bid in the winning team.DecentralizedBidcent uses blockchain to store transactions, take bids and process payouts. As such anyone can get the updated game variables, make a bid and participate in the game without restriction nor manipulation from a centralised party. Payout is a fixed process done through an immutable smart contract function which takes no parameter.SafeBidcent has published a verified smart contract and can be audited by the public. Smart contract is immutable and cannot be changed after being deployed. All deposits belong to the respective owners and no other person can withdraw or make bids without the wallet key. Players can choose to cashout their own winnings should they win the game. Players are in control of their funds.UncheatableBidcent is an uncheatable game free from centralized manipulation. Game variables which decide the outcome such as countdown time, fee and min bid total are fixed throughout the game and cannot be changed until the next game. When the server crashes, players can get the updated game variables, make bids and cashout the winnings themselves.https://bidcent.org",

Decentralized gaming platforms are the hardest to trust, the platform might not be regulated or have the access to open the business, meaning running illegally, also this platform has zero reputation and nothing about reputation have been built yet on this forum.For example, where is the link to Bidcent's announcement thread? Words are never enough to make people have your back, your actions should speak louder than these empty words. Please adjust, do create an ANN thread",

I tried accessing your website so I can do a review on it after much activities so as to have a little experience from your website but it was not accessible from my end. Do you have restrictions on countries from accessing your website? If yes, may I know the list of the countries involved and secondly I believe you are the sole representative of your organization here what you are doing here is more of an advertorial job on behalf of your organization so I would advise you to take out time to read through the forum policies so as to know how to navigate through.Â It would be for your own best interest to get registered for a copper member account so you could be able to make pictorial excerpts of your game board here for members to see as that is your catching and selling point not just this write up you have done. As you can see, since you made this post the response was poor due to poor advertisement and publicity as nobody would waste their time reading all these you have written.I will assume this to be your official announcement thread of your presence here on this platform and also I will advise you to seek the expertise of a good reputable signature campaign manager @Royse777 to promote your product which will give you a good boast.",

What I can see why all of them failed to survive is that it is not attractive gambling game and no gamblers want to play it. I dont understand why OP is gambling himself by launching his own gambling site with not attractive/not popular games.Perhaps because this game does not require him to spend a lot of money to start as he does not need to provide bankroll.",

Two things he is not aware that there were platforms that exist similar to his platform or like what you said trying his luck because it's not costly to maintain a platform like this, I don't think he is that serious about maximizing the promotion of his platform, he is not wearing a copper account and the announcement is not well designed, there's lack of competitiveness and motivation to make this platform popular.And I add this kind of platform should not be in this section because it's contract-based it should be in the altcoin service.",

No casino can be decentralized in nature, casinos are business firm that are motivated by the profit gotten from it. And someone must control the database to accept deposit and release payout. Probably they were trying to say that it is fair for everyone not free from manipulation. A casino that is free from manipulation is the casino that has no database for programmers and developers to control. Decentralized does not mean that it is totally cut off from human control but the aspect of human control is very minimal.",

It says the game counter is 600 seconds, so 10 minutes for each new bid. Let's say your pockets are deep on both sides and you keep bidding, after 10 hours or so you'll both be exhausted. If one of you has an emergency at home, loses Internet connection, falls asleep, they lose. The bigger the stakes the more you'll have to lose and the more you'll be waiting for the last second to see if the opponent outbids you. This could potentially escalate to something like a battle for a 1BTC stake where you both don't sleep for days not to give away that money, and at some point one of you gets a power outage and it's all over.",
