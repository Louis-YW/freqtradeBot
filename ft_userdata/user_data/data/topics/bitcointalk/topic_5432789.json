      "body": "Let me say that all this is not necessary because this is the way things play around the world, nothing could change it. Your thinking might be in form of manipulation, but in the real sense, it's just the weakness of the system we find ourselves in as humans, and this is not peculiar to the US only.And for the inability to eat what you like, no one is to be blamed here but for the economic situation of the world. Inflation is affecting everything, and the US people are not the only ones feeling it. The government might help, and banks might help too, but their interest in your crypto concern matters, it is not by force. Note that the situation has nothing to do with the liquidity of the main banks in any way.The US is not even taking nonsense when it comes to investments and finances, they are sanctioning enough that are erring as far as I know.",
