I believe that the best thing to do would be making sure that what we did back in the day is still okay with the law.Pump and Dump was something I never participated or initiated before, but I know for a fact that it was done in the crypto world a lot, and now that SEC is involved with crypto a lot, if you do that then it's illegal and you would be caught like this. So people should be extra careful, and it's good that pump and dumps are prohibited, they were bad anyway.",

AFAIK, they have been actively doing this even on  2017 ICO craze. They have been chasing those promoters that had misled a lot of investors which had included Mayweather and other known personalities.And it is unlikely they won't stop it because big sums of money were involved. It is like they are tracing back those projects and the promoters that have been involved on it.",

These people should go to jail and must be fined millions so as to give a big warning to scammers that the hand of law will one day get them...and they will suffer the consequences of their wrongdoings.",

While I would like for the justice system to get to every single scammer that has ever stole money from people with those schemes I understand that this is something possible to do, but at least if possible I would like for the authorities to begin to arrest the people that are deceiving newbies with those schemes in the market right now, that way scammers will know that they can no longer do whatever they want in this market and that if they do something bad then they are going to end up in jail.",

I believe that the best thing to do would be making sure that what we did back in the day is still okay with the law.Sounds pretty good to me imo. A lot of celebrities that dabbled into crypto have often used their popularity to push some projects into the heavens only to kick them after they're done with them. I'd also blame the parties involved for believing them but that's another thing, influencers doing these pump-and-dump schemes are intentionally baiting these people into believing them after all, so a huge part of the blame falls to them. I don't know what the difference is between the start of the craze to the current state right now though, is it worse or better now?",

SEC is not small so I believe they have the power to make an investigation for all types of cases whether big or small but what they are doing now is also great. They need to catch those big fish first because they are the ones who dealt a lot of damage but small scale scams should also be caught out before they scam more people. If the celebrity or influencer is involved then they are not hard to find because their identities are already exposed in public.I think they are too desperate enough to earn huge money because they are able to risk their reputation but they have made a wrong decision there. Once they are in jail, they still can't enjoy the money that they obtain.",
