In any case, only the \"project\" team will receive a profit, since the main amount of coins is in their wallets.",

There is no formal team or roadmap. the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.This is to warn investors that it's not worth investing in their token, this is very rare for a developer to claim that their token is useless, others will shill to high heaven that they are the biggest thing to happen in Cryptocurrency since they already claimed that their token is worthless we don't need to waste our time on this useless token.",

Greed is the major undoing of many. People want to reap where they didn't sow and that's how these projects get to find those who believe in whatever they're told.Quote from: Adbitco on August 09, 2023, 09:15:09 AMwhat surprises me is how come they had such amount of followers on twitter ...It could've been bought. Don't rule out that possibility. Many projects look for already grown accounts and purchase them to run their newly created businesses. Sometimes they buy old accounts to make it look like they've been old in the business. It's all deceit and those who they hoodwink are in themselves greedy folks.",

Now I see!Meaning before one could go into such altcoin investment some info needs to be digged out to know their origins, ¬†and does it mean they got those old tweet deleted to basically keep their account clean from suspicion and those who go about hunter for a project to double there money may not know what the interior motives of the project owners. Airdrop isn't something to be fully trusted because they are sucking, I could remembered a friend who got piped up though airdrop and till then he promised never to involved with anything airdrop.",

Criminals don't like leaving trails. Whenever you find a trail it could simply mean that either someone in the gang fucked up or the criminal(s) just want to lead pursuers astray. In cryptos, it's the first case. The criminals get hold of those accounts by hacking or buying them and then do their deed. Why do you think old accounts are hacked or bought?QuoteNow I see!Airdrop isn't something to be fully trusted because they are sucking, I could remembered a friend who got piped up though airdrop and till then he promised never to involved with anything airdrop.By \"piped up\" you meant scammed/wrecked? Anyway, the safest way to attend to airdrops is to dedicate a burner wallet for them. No one should use their main wallet for airdrops or any other social media tasks to avoid getting their funds wiped out if it goes awry because of malware or hacks. Anything can happen. Be guarded.",
