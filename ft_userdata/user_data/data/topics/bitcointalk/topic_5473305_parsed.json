Since we normally see some topics as spam or shitposts, those members who're great at such posts can do it on the off-topic sub-board, and it will be the choice of any member here to visit the off-topic sub-board or not. One thing I have noticed on the forum is that spamming and shit posting is something that is continuous, and that's the reason why some members don't visit the altcoins discussion and off-topic board because they believe it is full of spam. The same thing will be applicable to the LB if there are sub-boards. Members of this LB will have to choose their best sub-board to join the discussion, like myself, who is more interested in economics and investment. I have already dropped my comment there, and I believe if we also have sub-boards, then it will be easier to get a moderator if anyone is willing to take responsibility and apply as one.",
