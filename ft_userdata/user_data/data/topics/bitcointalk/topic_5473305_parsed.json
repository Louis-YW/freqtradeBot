But it will be nice if you had actually made comment on your previous thread about this issue and not creating a new thread again as regards this . I guess you know very well what to do as there's no need telling you. I greet all of una wey be oga and una dey try Wella to make the local board look good for us all.",

      "body": "Well, @Agbe, I must say that I love the bold step you took to request the sub-board, and like I commented there, it will be nice that Theymos consider giving the Nigeria LB some sub-board because it will make the board look more clean. Since we normally see some topics as spam or shitposts, those members who're great at such posts can do it on the off-topic sub-board, and it will be the choice of any member here to visit the off-topic sub-board or not. One thing I have noticed on the forum is that spamming and shit posting is something that is continuous, and that's the reason why some members don't visit the altcoins discussion and off-topic board because they believe it is full of spam. The same thing will be applicable to the LB if there are sub-boards. Members of this LB will have to choose their best sub-board to join the discussion, like myself, who is more interested in economics and investment. I have already dropped my comment there, and I believe if we also have sub-boards, then it will be easier to get a moderator if anyone is willing to take responsibility and apply as one.",

African Proverbs in PidginWe can really accept the fact that this threads as been helpful in spam and shit posting.
