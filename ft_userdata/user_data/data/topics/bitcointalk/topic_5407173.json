However if you zoom in you will see it’s not always accurate.If you relied on the indicator whenever it hit a new ATH you would sell too early. You can see a few times it spikes while price still kept going up afterwards.",

      "body": "I gave you +1 as it's an interesting chart, but I don't really understand it to be honest. It looks very bearish, but unless we're about to have a 75-85% drop then I don't see the relevance  I think this must somehow be more bullish than bearish, as I don't see price falling to $3.5K to $5.5K. There has also been big spikes late 2016 and 2020 that were bullish, even if not ATHs.",

      "body": "From what I understand. 0.1 to 1.0 is generally the retail market. And whenever this peaks it means that lots of retail have bought Bitcoin, meaning it will top soon. Which it has shown in the graphs. The issue I find with this is that 1 BTC back in 2014 is different than back in 2021. Since in 2014 when it peaked it was $1000 while in 2021 it was over 69x that pretty much. The value of these bitcoins compared to fiat are much different.",
