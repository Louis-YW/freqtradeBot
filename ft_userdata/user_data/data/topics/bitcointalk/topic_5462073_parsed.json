If you don’t know how it’s on the left bottom of the page.Secondly, what you are offering worth nothing if you couldn’t verify that account that means it worth 0$ and you can’t withdraw the money inside it and instead of selling it try to resolve your issue with BC.GAME as they have great chat support if you are the owner and didn’t break any of their rules.",

      "body": "Lately, there have been a lot of complaints about BCgame Casino. Accusations of scams and neglect. Possibly many people have had one issue with them in one way or another other and there has not been much coming up from them. I was curious when I first saw this thread and I had to see for myself.OP seems to be a newbie that calls for more concern as to why Open is putting up such an account on sale looking at the amount of money the account is holding. So I asked myself what must have been the major reason why OP wants to sell the account. If it takes real account holders time to get customer attention without even getting their problem solved is it an account bought that one would be able to resolve any problem encountered?Lastly, just as one of the previous posters had said, what is the tendency that the account is a hacked account and the hacker trying to lay it off by coming here to sell it? Anybody buying should thread with caution.",

Otherwise  this is not a good deal especially  that you can easily recover  it back!Btw, if it helps open a reputation post about them and see if they can respond or resolve your issue,  goodluck.",

I doubt someone here will be interested to purchase this account while your potential client on this is a whale since they are the only one who can complete the wager requirements for the reward.I too doubt any member from this platform would giving in to this deal of buying an account when it is well known that casino accounts are non transferable and only the seller knows the sole reason why they put it up for sale. I know completing the wager requirements would not be an issue for some gamblers but what if after wagering such an amount and at the entire end identity clarification issues emanates and it happens that such account has defaulted in the past maybe that was why the seller sold it out quick without the buyers knowledge about it.What would the new owner do?",
