  "content": "After the launch of Elizabeth Warren's anticrypto army campaign, I am quite certain bitcoiners and everyone else who are supporters of the cryptospace will certainly like to witness Ron Desantis become the next president of the United States. If you are an eligible voter in America, you know the candidate to vote for hehehehe.Robert Kennedy Jr. is also another presidential candidate who expressed his support for bitcoin. It appears that there is a good chance for America to have a probitcoiner president!Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who launched his presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event with Elon Musk on Wednesday evening, said he'd protect bitcoin if he's elected next year.\"I think people should be able to do bitcoin,\" DeSantis said as 300,000 listeners tuned in. \"As president, we'll protect the ability to do things like bitcoin.\"DeSantis, who earlier this month moved to prohibit any kind of a central bank digital currency in the state, said that bitcoin represented a threat to \"central planners\" that want \"control over society.\" He said any kind of regulation over cryptocurrencies should ultimately be up to Congress, and that he'd oppose any kind of a ban should one ever emerge.Read in full https://www.theblock.co/post/232135/desantis-promises-to-protect-bitcoin-in-presidential-campaign-launch-event",

Because DeSantis has no chance of beating Trump, and Kennedy has no chances against Biden.If I were a l33t cypherpunk bitcoin maximalist ninja, I would have wanted Bitcoin to get banned or at least heavily regulated. Because it would have driven all the \"get rich quick\" investors out of Bitcoin and only people who use it as a currency would remain. People like to talk how government is a big threat to Bitcoin, but Bitcoin was created to be resilient to exactly that kind of threat. The actual threat to Bitcoin is coming from within, if the exchanges and miners can form a cartel and get hodlers onboard (who increasingly only care for profits), then they can get control over the protocol by releasing new Bitcoin software and getting it adopted. They already tried this scenario with SegWit2x and failed, but what if the next attempt will be a success?",

De Santis is from the Republic party and he knows that he must add something into his campaign in order to attract US citizens for the 2024 President election. He knows he must promise something oppositely with what the President Biden and the Democrat party want to do.With recent hearings, testimonies around FTX, SEC, I believe that the core approach of The Republic party is opposite than from the Democrat Party. They want to make big changes that bring more friendly environment for that industry. They seriously want to stop SEC. and its Chair Gensler to do more arbitrary and stupid regulations against exchanges and projects which don't base on existing laws and regulatory guides.",

If we consider his proposal for Bitcoin then it makes sense that the ones who are into crypto-world and into Bitcoin will high likely take him as their savior in such hard times. His chances of getting votes from Bitcoin users is a confirm thing.But still the question arises that how would someone like Ron DeSantis compete against someone like Donald Trump the former president of United States, or Biden the current president of United States? The simple and highly knowledgeable answer should be \"Not even a single chance,\" because the former ones have far more superiority in getting votes from public than DeSantis.However, if we consider the point of view of the Bitcoin investors and its users then the they are mainly in favor of Ron DeSantis because the guy is like a light in darkness, and can be a savior for Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in the New world. His love for Bitcoin and crypto-currencies is so intense that any true crypto-enthusiast would take his side in such situation. Other than this guy almost everyone is somehow trying to oppress or regulate Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies in the United States.",
