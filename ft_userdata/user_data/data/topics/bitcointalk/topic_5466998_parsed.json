  "content": "In the world of cryptocurrency, KYC has become an increasingly discussed and debated topic.KYC policy also known as Know Your Customer is a set of rules and procedures that financial institutions and other regulated entities follow to verify the identity of their customers and assess the potential risks of illegal activities. KYC policy aims to prevent and detect money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, and other financial crimes.KYC policy emerged in crypto due to the increase in crime-related activities associated with the exchange of cryptocurrencies, and  It is important for financial institutions because it helps them comply with international and national regulations that aim to combat financial crime and protect the integrity of the financial system. KYC policy also helps financial institutions avoid legal penalties, reputational damage, and operational losses that may result from non-compliance or involvement in illicit activities.The KYC policy, in as much as it is very important, is also very tedious, hence leading to a disadvantage which includes many others. First of all, the requirements needed before transactions are sometimes extremely long. Though, it depends on the type of account and the level of risk involved. Some requirements include a phone number, passport/ photograph, ID card, address, source of funding, reference letter, and many more. This leads to a lack of privacy as such detailed information about a person is on the internet, prone to risks like Identity theft, data breaches, malware and viruses, phishing and scam emails, and many others.Another thing about KYC Is the disparity in regulatory approaches. This creates a complex space between crypto traders and exchanges as KYC requirements adopted in some countries are stringent, and then lenient in other countries.In response to the increasing need for privacy, non-KYC exchanges like Bitunix have emerged. It serves as an alternative for users who prioritize facelessness and wish to bypass the traditional KYC process.  Although the exchange allows traders to avoid KYC requirements for transactions of over 500,000 USDT, for larger transactions, it acknowledges the need for heightened security and KYC becomes necessary. Now, after spelling out the importance and the problems of KYC, do you see Bitunix's new trading option as its solution, or do you think there may be a better approach to solving the problems of KYC? Also, it's possible you don't see KYC as a problem at all because of how crucial it is , just state whatever your thoughts on the KYC policy are. Thank you",

      "body": "Personally I see KYC as something at parallel with the very essence of Bitcoin. KYC eliminates the privacy and anonymity that Bitcoin establishes and this is the reason we have BTC mixers. The major security challenges faced in Bitcoin are unconnected to KYC. For instance, KYC was not able to stop MtGox hack and FTX scams. I am yet to see how KYC was able to make much impact in fighting money laundering or reducing terrorism financing... maybe it does and I can be wrong, but I have not seen any report pointing to that direction.",

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have not been created before money laundering and terrorism have been existing. All these are still existing on KYC exchanges, but they are hidden. There are still fraud on KYC exchanges.Quote from: Bebe22 on September 16, 2023, 02:05:45 PMNow, after spelling out the importance and the problems of KYC, do you see Bitunix's new trading option as its solution, or do you think there may be a better approach to solving the problems of KYC?

Furthermore, in most cases, it's only a matter of time before a CEX implement mandatory KYC because once they get popular, they'll be on regulators radar.",

Thank you Honestly, it is contradicting to what you're claiming that they're a kyc solution if you're pointing out that there's a certain limit and then once you hit that, you're required still to kyc. This exchange is not even different from the usual ones that we're using that haven't required kyc before but then changes their terms to mandatory kyc. While some are still fine for not requiring kyc but that seems to be the consolation that they're doing for having a limit and then kyc is next upon reaching or going more with their threshold. There's no better approach with that because even the know P2P markets, who knows if soon they're going to change their terms as well. They probably as good as no kyc now but we've seen series of these exchanges changed that policy.",

From their help article: https://support.bitunix.com/hc/en-us/articles/15666657422105-KYC-Tiers-and-Benefits2. From the test account: -- never tested with B's but it's usually enough to peek at the withdrawal page unless the exchange is shady.But yeah, they're just like other CEXs that could request KYC anytime. The withdrawal limits are also inflated and - something typically found on an obscure/lesser known exchange as regulators don't even know they exist.",

When KYC policies are implemented, that is the loophole. This number is no longer a trigger for services to ask for user identity at any time under the pretext of violations and the like. Exchanges will not be able to maintain consistent KYC policies if they are subject to certain regulations.Proper guidelines, prepare for KYC on every centralized exchange even if you only want to trade $1.",

From what I have read, KYC is an attack on Bitcoin, and we should just be careful. There are a lot of these laundrings of money going on underground without the use of Bitcoin or crypto, and they are yet to be caught, so why label all that as Bitcoin?",
