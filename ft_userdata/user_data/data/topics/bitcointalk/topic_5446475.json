  "content": "So what next? After many critics thought that Microstrategy would sell all its bitcoin holding during bear market last year.https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1640325496654143488?t=l8ACl9Bs8iOeNbQdJPRLNQ&s=19QuoteMicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. As of 3/23/23, $MSTR acquired an additional ~6,455 bitcoins for ~$150M at an average of ~$23,238 per #bitcoin & held ~138,955 BTC acquired for ~$4.14B at an average of ~$29,817 per bitcoin.I do not think bitcoin can fall below $15500 again. It may go to $16000 or $17000, but what we look up to now is all-time-high. Bitcoin will be more than $100000 one day. Do you know how profitable institutional like Microstrategy would be by that time.",

      "body": "It really is a good risk / reward balance for them. For the last year or so they have been DCA their cost down. So over time even smaller bumps in price will be good for their balance sheet.If BTC moons they win. If BTC falls for a bit it still looks like a smaller loss on paper. Which it is, because it's just that. A paper loss. Until they sell. If you have enough funding and time you can wait out the dips in price.-Dave",

Millions, maybe even billions from next decades. At some point in the, not so far, future I presume we'll notice an abrupt decline of USD and / or EUR, which will follow with an abrupt increase in demand for assets like gold and bitcoin.",

      "body": "Not too surprised by this, as I know how much confidence Saylor has in bitcoin. Perhaps the bear market period has brought a lot of negative news about the market, but every time there is a positive signal, we will see that the supporters will never leave this market.While there isn't too much speculation on the price, I completely agree with the OP that BTC will have a hard time returning to the $15500 price point. Now for those who are returning to invest also need to do research and develop a clear plan so as not to miss the opportunity in the next bull cycle.",

You know, something leads to another, and perhaps if there are any serious challenges (war, pandemic, economic issues), they can still affect the price, which may drop below expected lines, so we are not just certain with price.",

Bitcoin will be more than $100000 one day. Do you know how profitable institutional like Microstrategy would be by that time.The market does not rely on your thinking for its movements. In fact the market usually moves oppositely to what is thought by majority of the crowd. I can not say will Bitcoin falls to under $20,000 or $16,000 but you should not exclude that possibility.At least let's check the chart and price history. Not too far, in the past bear market and shortly before a 2020 bull run, when most of the crowd thought $7,000 is likely a bottom range for Bitcoin and believed from that it will start its bull run after 2020 halving.What happened? It crashed almost half to below $4,000 as a last massive kill before a V-shaped recovery and started its new bull run.Will it repeat in 2024? You judge it.",

Well on one thing i can agree, which is that dump will make a good entry point for hodlers and for traders to book good profits so overall if we observe the ecosystem then you are right.At the end BTC will improve as more and more trading volume will be added to it. If you have something on your mind let it come out",
