If you really want to sell your company/website, I think that if there's a way to negotiate the price, you can always put bitcoin as a mode of payment on the table, of course some people won't accept but that's bound to happen.",

In this case, I don't think there's a dedicated bitcoin marketplace for businesses and the likes. Another thing to consider is, crypto marketplaces are not as well known as fiat platforms hence less viewers -- makes sense since they've been on business for much longer and fiat is most used. Platforms like openbazaar aren't also beginner friendly.",

Going to be a huge pain in the ass to look for good deals thats actually legitimate and not just people trying to scam you though.",
