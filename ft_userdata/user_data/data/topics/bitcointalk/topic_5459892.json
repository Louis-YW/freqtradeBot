  "content": "with 'BIP39Colors' the seed phrase can be hidden in a rainbow. the new open source tool created by Bitcoin developer Entero Positivo converts the mnemonic bip39 phrase into different colors and vice versa.the technology excites. it could be used to hide your seed phrase in pictures or other colorful artwork, for example. the first experiments are already underway. 'no thief is paranoid enough to try every color combination he finds in your house,' E. Positivo says.the colors generated are represented as a hex color code, a six-digit system that can basically represent any color as a combination of red, blue and green. unlike the word-based system, there is no need to remember the 'order' of the colors to read out the seed phrase.below you will also find further information links to the said tool as well as the official tweet of Entero Positivo https://twitter.com/EnteroPositivo/status/1673041550585069568https://github.com/enteropositivo/bip39colors/tree/main/manualhttps://github.com/EnteroPositivo/bip39colorshttps://enteropositivo.github.io/bip39colors/#bip39tocolors",
