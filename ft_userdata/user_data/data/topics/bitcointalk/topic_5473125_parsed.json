  "content": "Hello, I want to stack 3 Antminer s19 in one box. I started placing the miners on wooden boards and using spacers to hold the weight of each miner. Can I leave the boards off? Can the lowest miner support the weight of two others? Would this be a temperature problem?   I don't want to break themI have a drawing:https://ibb.co/4dcCYBJhttps://ibb.co/hK0L79pI put the ventilation in the side of the box on both sides. Inlet and outletHave a nice day friends",

      "body": "What exactly do you want to achieve?Are you making a box for two miners?If the box in the image is the one you intend to build, you might encounter temperature issues, you need to make sure that the hot air from the unit can go out if not it would lead to high temp.I suggest adding a double fan duct and duct hose and connect it to the exhaust fan of the unit or you can make a hole for a duct hose to allow the hot air to flow freely out of the box.If you are planning on making a soundproof box check this sample below.- https://youtu.be/M7uyV-iLri0?si=SO4ey4QZvHgHKe_X",

I started placing the miners on wooden boards and using spacers to hold the weight of each miner. I don't think this would cause a major issue in terms of weight, I have had up to 5 miners on top of each other (not running) sit there for a while, and no damage accused to the chassis, but keep in mind those were different model and they were not running, so no vibration whatsoeverHowever, May I ask why do you need to remove the wooden plates? I see no good reason for doing so unless you want to have a single inlet/outlet for the whole box, which isn't going to work if say you put them in the middle, the heat coming out from the top and bottom miner will get trapped inside, so the way I see it, those wholes need to be at least the size of the fans and facing the fans for air to move freely, which again, makes me not understand the purpose of wanting to remove those plates.",

      "body": "I want to make a box for three miners. For the air circulation i gonna drill holes in the side of the Box.For every Miner: Two nearly 150mm holes for inlet and two for outlet so the hot air can move out.Thanks for your answers I was not sure if it would be better to remove the plates to have more space for noice reducing foam and stack the miners on their own weight. The problem is that the spacers would cover the inlet and exhaust holes a bit.  In every case i would drill the holes in every miners hight. So the air can flow freely.If you have any more questions let me know it.Thank you alot guys",
