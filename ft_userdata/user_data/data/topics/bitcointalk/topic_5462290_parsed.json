I think other members of our local board can reason the thread too if it means moving it out since the thread is about football discussions it's will more appropriate there than here in the local board.",

Going through the OP's post history, he has not made any comments in the gambling section, which makes it obvious that he might not even be aware that such a board exists.Since there is an ongoing discussion regarding everything Africa football, it will be best for the OP to lock this thread as you have suggested, and then he can copy this and drop it as a comment under the existing thread referencing this one so that the discussion can continue there as there will be a lot of members ready to engage on the women's world cup.",

But  just like NWADA001 said there is always the gambling board which host this particular discussion. So it would be nice if he just locked this one.",
