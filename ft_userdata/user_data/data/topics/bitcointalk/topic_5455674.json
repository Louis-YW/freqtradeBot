      "body": "You asked five questions.1.The SEC believes it should regulate certain things that Binance currently does outside of its regulation. This legal action will force the courts to decide whether or not the SEC can really do what they want to here. That's why the SEC is doing this: to try to get the courts to tell everyone that the SEC gets to regulate Binance (and others) the way it wants to.2. CZ can make arguments about why he shouldn't have to appear, but at the end of the day the court gets to decide who's right and who's wrong. CZ could lose a court case by default, just like a football team could lose a game by default if they don't show up and play.3. You're repeating question #1, we've already discussed the SEC's motive here.4. Binance leaving the US would have a huge impact on Binance. Bitcoin would also be affected, one can only assume. The US is a much larger entity then both, so the impact on the US wouldn't be as great.5.The SEC is not doing this to send a message to foreign jurisdictions. The SEC is attempting to establish precedents in the US court system, as previously mentioned.Of course there's much more I could say on this subject, but a stupid five-year-old like you wouldn't understand.",

Not to mention there is also dissatisfaction with SEC inside the US. AFAIK, they get sued by Coinbase regarding regulation clarity and they have yet to respond. They even get a deadline to respond within a week or so[1]. At the end of the day, they are trying really hard to make most tokens classified as security and sue exchanges left and right. The end goal is definitely to gain control over the market. As others have mentioned, better to be safe than sorry. Withdraw your money if you have any, and use other platforms if you need to trade your crypto (or look at P2P).[1] https://decrypt.co/143673/us-court-gives-sec-one-week-to-respond-to-coinbases-rulemaking-petition",

Do they want to shut down Binance US and Bitcoin?Does the SEC want to push Binance out of the US and convince their allied countries to do the same?What message is the SEC trying to convey to other nations, especially their allies?These are pretty much the same questions.We probably don't know what the SEC really wants, what their ulterior motives are, if there are any, or whether they're just trying to send a strong message. If we assume regularity, then the agency is simply performing its mandate. To be specific, what they're simply pointing out is that Binance has committed violations so they have to be brought to court. The agency is filing 13 charges all in all.Â  QuoteWhat are the implications of Binance leaving the US? Will it hurt Binance more, Bitcoin, or the US?It will hurt all three of them. It will hurt Binance, of course. That's obvious. It will hurt the US as well. We have all been hearing the cries of crypto companies in the US because of how bad the regulatory environment is. And it will also hurt Bitcoin. And, therefore, us. But whatever happens, Bitcoin will recover from this in due time. QuoteWhat would happen if CZ doesn't show up and a judgment is passed? Would they arrest CZ and use him as an example?I'm not a legal expert, but since this is a civil case I guess nobody will go to prison. Heavy damages will be collected, though.If the charges are left unanswered, I guess the court will pass judgement without hearing the side of the defendant. Needless to say, the upper hand will be on the part of the plaintiff, and they will probably win it. And whatever appropriate legal punishment due to the violations enumerated shall be imposed on Binance.",

If Binance and Coinbase do not heed this call (which is unlikely) it will have a significant impact on the crypto market, given that Binance US and Coinbase are large CEXs and their operations could impact the crypto market.As for the US itself, they will also be affected, even if it's not too massive, but it will be quite detrimental for them. Therefore the SEC also gave about 21 days so they could negotiate and explain what these officials wanted. 21 days is quite a long time and it could very well be used to negotiate with the these officials.",

They're simply following their assumption that CZ broke the law or something similar. Now CZ going under would potentially also mean Binance going under, so that's that.Wouldn't CZ lose the case immediately if he doesn't appear? Not familiar with law stuff mb.As for the rest, all in all I think the community is over exaggerating things because there's no clear reason as to what's going to happen. In all honest, Binance shutdowns as the worst case but I doubt its going to give any permanent damage to the crypto scene. Unless, ofc, they finally release a clear set of laws that go against/reject crypto itself due to this case but eeeehhh I think the cases is more about the running of the exchanges itself than crypto.",

They're the leading exchnages in the world and in the states, so it'll have huge implications more like th FTx or more than that.Its not really about causing fear and stuff in the Crypto Currency space but please remove your holdings from exchnages.

(a) if the SEC wins. its not just about requiring international companies requiring to register in the US. its also about setting precedent to allow the SEC to gain a power in law to seize international funds.. calling it \"repatriating funds\".. plus other powers the SEC currently does not have.. but wants to gain(if they win)(b) part of this plan the SEC is orchestrating is setting up barriers of entry to make it exceedingly expensive for international companies to serve americans. this is becasue if/when licenced. the international company has to fund US compliance officers and auditors. which ends up as more expensive than a US domestic company. the game is to either make US domestic businesses have the beneficial edge to succeed.. and to get international companies to set up a HQ in america so that the authorities can then tax the international companyall of this is part of the \"us friendly crypto\"its not make US friendly to international cryptocurrency. its make US crypto currency laws only friendly to the US businesses in the hopes that crypto businesses move to america to be friendly(coinbase threatened to leave the US so the US is fighting back that option to make it a bad idea to leave the US)",

The lawsuit between the SEC and XRP is ending, and they may already have an outcome before us. In my opinion, the results are going in favor of the SEC, and they are motivated to attack us more.What will happen to us if Binance and Coinbase continue to lose the lawsuit?

One is called Binance.com and the other is Binnace.US. The Binance.com is used for global usage and the Binance.US is specifically created for the people is USA. There are some rules and regulations Binance has to follow in order to keep that running in the USA. Binance is told to give a personal wallet to every user of Binance.US. Also, any transaction between Binance.com and Binance.US is prohibited. But CZ let many users of the USA to trade in Binance.comThat is what I heard from the news. SourceQuoteWhat would happen if CZ doesn't show up and a judgment is passed? Would they arrest CZ and use him as an example?Most likely yes. Because they are trying to dominate cryptocurrency for a while now. It will not be a surprise to see that they will do such thing. If the world's most famous exchange face this kind of this, it will obviously have an effect on the whole market. Not to mention that a huge amount of people's assets are in Binance. So if anyone is using Binance.US, it is recommended to move their assets in a private wallet.QuoteDoes the SEC want to push Binance out of the US and convince their allied countries to do the same?I don't think, if the rules and regulations are followed correctly, they will try to push out Binance from the USA. Also, it's all about BInance.us. I have no idea how much it will affect the global users. It will have an effect but the amount of the impact is unknown. And as this is only about Binance.US, I don't think USA can convince their allied countries. QuoteWhat are the implications of Binance leaving the US? Will it hurt Binance more, Bitcoin, or the US?It will hurt everything. But that will be temporary. Binance will lose a huge amount of users. Many will convert their hodlings to fiat out of fear. That will hurt the market and about the USA. Yes, they will get hurt too, but they will understand that in the long run. Bitcoin is a technology. And if one country is left out from a piece of technology, they will find it so hard to regain that and implement that in their system. History tells the tale. The only thing will be left to them is regret.QuoteWhat message is the SEC trying to convey to other nations, especially their allies?I have no idea what they are trying to do.
