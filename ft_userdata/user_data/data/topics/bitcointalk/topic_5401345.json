  "content": "In order to stay calm you must educate yourself how the system works.Also no matter what there is also someone ir group of people specially wall street guys who benefits from all of this whats going on around the world bull market or bear.Learn their knowledge and you have no pointless fear.Lets see some facts: By checking the instutions long term plan the fed rate hike is very dull very questionble look at the one of tge biggest instutions btc plan its said 300-500k per btc price plan.Now we are afraid of war right ? Even nuclear attack , can it happend ?? Off course not not in usa becouse usa runs markets most important locations are in usa world elite never let tpuch or harm those locations wich runs derivates oil futures btc futures and gold futures .....the rumours russia attack usa is just rumours until most important data centers to control deritavetes trading not moved out of usa. If we learn our society very base points on wich we stand on we know nothing happens in terms of things on what we stand on markets are protected all kind of exvhangers and servers what runs the exvhangers and derivates markets are top priority in the world.Also we see insturions plans long term we know btc will stay and according to this we know rate hikes will be working until inflation is gone they run little bit deflation and then they say thats it we can print more again.Every country leaders even putin top priority is not harm markets derivates locations its impossible to russia attack usa becouse it will harm derivates markets servers and world elite can not never put in danger the deruvates locations such us cmegroup and others.Once we know this then no panic just pure clarity becouse derivates and markets runs our world whats good for profit and markets must happening and its protected by all country leaders This knowledge we should teach kids in the school so the kids will learn life all ready in their early age and they will never in the pointless fear and even in economic turmoil and confuse situation they will know exacly whats going on.Merit for sure",

It's not because of what's written there, for sure.He who is in the middle of a war will obviously be tense.In my case, I worry mainly about the things that depend on me. In some moments when it was said that this would end in nuclear war, I was a little worried, but now I am not. If a nuclear war starts I will be dead in a short time, and I was going to die anyway, and since I can't do anything to avoid it, I go on with my business as usual, solving the problems that I can solve by myself.",

USA was hit badly at the world trade causing serious fear and disorganization of world business. If Russia is planning that, they could fail because the satellite image could likely find that out. However you have to understand that the market and stock or derivatives including cryptocurrency are not dropping because of US but because of the situation in the world",

The reality is no matter how strong a country is it will face an economic crisis regardless of having a great strategy to want to tackle every problem as it emerged. Russia is not stupid to launch a nuclear attack without thinking about the backlash. The economy is already bad for every part of the world and doing that will only worsen the situation not just for the target country but for other countries because of the economic relationship.And quit associating the market drop solely because of the war, or have you forgotten this is a circle that usually occurs at certain intervals.",

Investors like Warren Buffett could be hit hard by stock market declines while CEOs earning salaries of $10,000 an hour could see their wage rate decrease in a recession. Already we see the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, unhappy with circumstances in his attempt to buy twitter to effect positive social change. Other one percenters are losing wealth and not happy with the direction of the economy. Those at the top are losing money, the same as those on the bottom.Quote from: 325btc on June 04, 2022, 01:46:00 PMThis knowledge we should teach kids in the school so the kids will learn life all ready in their early age and they will never in the pointless fear and even in economic turmoil and confuse situation they will know exacly whats going on.Many believe it requires less energy, time and sacrifice to not learn things and not develop the mind. This leaves them with more time and energy for other things. Once that belief is adopted it is very difficult, if not impossible, to convince people its worth their while to learn basic fundamentals.",

The entire US would be very grateful to you and would rest assured that Russia would never attack them becouse world elite can not never put in danger the deruvates locations. But please don't let anybody from Putin's teams of spies discover that you're the one who enlightened the US on this.

Yes, the WAR in the Ukraine is a big event, but there has been conflict in many countries in the world for years...and it did not destroy the global economy. (I am in no way down playing the impact of the war, but I am just saying some people are exploiting this to justify certain actions)  The markets will stabilize over time ..as the impact of the \"event\" sink in, so do not panic early and take huge losses, because your emotions took over, just stay calm..... analyze the impact and how you can weather the Storm...and manage the impact.",

I always say we were built differently, while some people were naturally blessed with the super power of staying calm in situations that are troubling, others have to consciously develop this ability. Education of how the system works is no assurance of staying calm. The system itself may even sometimes go against all what we thought we knew, and all our knowledge ineffective, so even without education...someone who has recognised that staying calm is not their stronghold should seek to develop it first, the development of that ability is the foundation of any other toppings in form education to come.",

I always find it easy to manage when I think and analyze the past situations which usually makes up for most of them and these ups and downs are usually short lived and are highly dominated by the outlook of the market as a whole as well. -Follow what you think would be the best option this helps not to ride the blame onto someone else as well. At the same time talking about cryptocurrencies and stock market the idea behind them is very different and some people might not be comfortable with the excessive volatility of cryptocurrencies, and if you can't do it be a holder !",

So every dip people bought it. Many bought at $60K, $50K, $40K…. And now we are around $30K and people are starting to get nervous being down by 50%.They are the ones that don’t stay calm and if there is another dip they will most likely sell the end the pain. This is usually how bottoms are formed. Many whales are calm because they dollar cost average. Look at the Bitfinex whale. Every dip he buys and never sells. Will most likely keep buying until $15-20k or so.",

So many crisis experienced since 2020, its draining everyone's wealth and we have few options only.  Inflation is driving people to spend now while the price is yet not so high since keeping cash is not helping.
