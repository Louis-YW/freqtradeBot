  "content": "My Autobiography won’t be completely done without discerning my Bitcoin journey, more especially the ups and down of Bitcoin, yeah I know it is the volatility nature of the coin and the most interesting part. The revolution of Bitcoin has brought so much freedom to man, has literally blessed earth with diverse opportunities and knowledges. It’s a career path for many, a poverty eradication program to many communities around the world. A decentralized technology that is taking over the world day to day swift transaction, investments, store of value etcThe impact of Bitcoin in the life of a modern man cannot be overemphasized. A Bitcoin enthusiasts is a living legend, in the course of my Bitcoin journey I once worried about what happens to my Bitcoin when I die but now I worry no more because in my autobiography I would be allocating my Bitcoin wallets to my love ones, given each the specific hardware that contains the wallet details and personalized access. For the years of believing in the technology, mining here and there, holding, buying, selling, researching, late nights, risks etc I have come to a realization that Bitcoin is a great spice to my autobiography because of it’s fun filled experience, knowledges and financial leverages.",
