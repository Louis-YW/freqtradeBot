If it were a transaction that you had made with your keys, leaving RBF, you could bump the fee, but not in the situation you describe. Can you share the tx id? Then we can tell you better expectations of when it could be confirmed. The good news is that the mempool unconfirmed txs have diminished and fees have come down. Let's see if it empties out even more over the weekend.",

Your only remaining option is to privately pay a miner to include your transaction if you are that desperate for a confirmation. You can also do this via ViaBTC, but the cost is usually quite high.",

Quote from: thebloodmaster on May 13, 2023, 08:02:22 AMok thx guys  https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/f16ee4c4c5f9faa179ce5a835b48e376326cfb339fa83beb92fc807f4be639ac that would be the txidThe transaction could take up to a day to be confirmed if things do not change. The bad thing with estimates is that they can change. If there is a large dump of spam transactions as there has been recently, it will take much longer, and if unconfirmed transactions continue to drop as they have been lately, it may take longer to confirm. The bad thing is that you can't do much more than what has already been mentioned in the thread.Wasn't there an option in the casino for fast withdrawal?",

But the thing here is, we don't know how long or when it shall reach that fee you've made. There's no option but just to wait until a miner confirms that.Hopefully the fee goes lower with sats/vb and then it'll meet yours.",

Mempool is going back to normal slowly but it will still require good amount of time to get this transaction confirmed.

The chances for this casino support will be slim too.@OP, which one was the site you withdraw the balance?",

The good news is that the mempool unconfirmed txs have diminished and fees have come down. Let's see if it empties out even more over the weekend. Gambling sites as well as centralized exchanges usually use very high fee rates when they broadcast transactions for user withdrawal request and they did not use RBF in many transactions. They believe that with high fee rate, their transactions will be confirmed by miners.You don't control the sending wallet (gambling site control it)or receiving address,  no choice to use RBF or CPFP. You only can wait and hope that today your confirmation will be confirmed. If it won't be confirmed in next 24 hours, last day of this weekend, it is very possibly that it will be stucked 6 more days at least before a next weekend.What is your txid?With this mempoo there is hope that your transaction will be confirmed to day if fee rate is 25+ or better 30+ sat/vbyte. If your fee rate is like 20+ sat/vbyte or lower, your chance will be smaller.",

It is just a rebroadcast. Since OP's transaction is already in (almost) every node's mempool, rebroadcasting will achieve absolutely nothing. Every node which receives the rebroadcast will just ignore it, since they are already aware of the transaction.Edit: It's confirmed.",
