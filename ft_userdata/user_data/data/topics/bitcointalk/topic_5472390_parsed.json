The main advantage here we will have that you guys are providing both casino games and sports events. So people will have both choices here. My only concern is that, are people from all over the world allowed to play on the site? And what about the KYC restrictions here?",

I like the fact that you are active your first day of registration unlike others that just register and get lost without any response to questions from potential clients on their first day. First impression matters here and you have set the pace for your casino. Nevertheless, you have a good user interface and your website is well designed.  I believe you know promoting your casino would call more attention to it so therefore I. Will advise you to make budget for a promotional campaign and seek the expertise of a campaign manager as there are lots of reputable managers here  you can contact Royse777 for your promotional campaign as he is good at servic delivery.",

They should create a whitelisting on these countries that are not included on the restricted list. This might confuse a lot of interested people and cause them to turn back because they think they cannot play in the platform.It's like they're trying to push people to use their recommended VPNs to remove the restrictions. I'm not quite sure about that but it gave me that impression tbh. The site looks nice, but it's only just that restriction that doesn't make sense.",
