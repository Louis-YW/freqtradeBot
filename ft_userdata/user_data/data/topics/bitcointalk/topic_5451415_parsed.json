Unfortunately, your privacy policy page and terms page is not accessible (404 not found). So how can players agree with your terms and policies while they cant even read it? Last but not least, you need to fix your terms and policies page first as well as add a FAQ page in your main page because currently there is no information that we can read about your site.",

I do not see your posts to be good yet until certain things are done right. Either the gambling site should hire someone to do it, or you can do it yourself, to introduce the gambling site to the user on this forum properly.",

However, I have some concerns regarding the statistics that you display on your front page. Is it really true that you have already facilitated over 370 thousand bets and accumulated more than $1 million in total wagers in such a short period? It seems a bit too good to be true, and I am wondering if you could provide more information to substantiate these numbers.Furthermore, I agree with panjul07's comment that you should prioritize fixing and completing your website before promoting it here. As first impressions are crucial, it is essential that all parts of your site are accessible and functional to potential users. On a related note, I couldn't find any customer support contact information on your site besides live chat. While live chat is useful, it may not be the most effective means of addressing issues that require more time and attention. Providing an email or other contact options would be a great addition to your site.",

I never trust a site who are claiming \"No-KYC\" unless is decentralized casino (Non-centralized casino, while everything based smart contract). Casino claims are really tricky, for non-KYC features.They always say this, but the reality there always have some word almost all of them (In-some case, casino have a rights to ask user for KYC). Good luck with the casino, but just want to share my 2 cent.",

We don't know what is inside there so the op would allow visitors to see the content to know what is in the casino. As it is nobody knows what is there. Op said, No KYC and they respect customers privacy but now we have not even seen what is there and you are asking us to register that means, that is no long keeping of privacy but asking of KYC before seeing the features which is wrong.Normally it is not everyone. Likes to register a casino site when they see the features of the site but if the features are good, it motivate people to register and gamble or mix. But now you are forcing us to register before seeing what is inside and as yahoo62278 put it, we don't know whether it is a hot behind the scene. Therefore, I will prefer you open the website features for everyone to see and create sign up and sign in botton at one of the corner in the website. Lastly you are welcome. Op I advice you to meet a manager which yahoo62278 is one of them. And also icopress, Little Mouse, Trofo, sujonali1819, DogecoinMachine, joeperry, irfan_pak10, Hhampuz, worldofcoins, Royse777, Igehhbot, and CryptopreneurBrainboss to manage a campaign for you if you are interested.",

I was also checking to see if there is a customer care service but none. I checked for license and I could not see any. OP is not even active on first day of unveiling their casino Services here. I do not know if OP truly know that little things of this nature matters alot. As such, should be fully active here to respond to questions and enquiries about their casino as that is the only way of reaching out to them when need arises.",

However, as some have already mentioned, there are some concerning details that we need to consider before trusting this site blindly.First of all, the domain is recently registered, which means that there is no previous reputation to go on. The anonymous owner also causes for concern.Moreover, the unfinished website with no Terms of Use or Privacy Policy pages and no contact information is quite alarming. The chat being full of bots and the possibility of fake statistics only add to these worries.Overall, I think it's wise to be cautious with this site until they can provide more transparency and assurance about their legitimacy.",
