  "content": "Neoxa NetworkOfficial Website: Neoxa.net | Twitter: NeoxaNet | Discord: Neoxa | Telegram: NeoxaNet | Facebook: NeoxaNetworkNeoxa is a decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency specifically designed for the gaming community. Neoxa aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing an innovative solution that allows gamers to earn Neoxa while playing their favorite games, such as Minecraft, Rust, or GTA FiveM.Neoxa SpecificationsName: NeoxaTicker: NEOXAlgorithm: KawPow Maximum Supply: 21 billion coinsBlock Time: 1 minuteSmartnodes : 45%Mining: 45%Gaming Rewards: 5% of block rewardDeveloper Fee: 5%Premine: NoneExchangesTXBit.io: https://txbit.io/Trade/NEOX/USDTTradeOgre: https://tradeogre.com/exchange/LTC-NEOXXT: https://www.xt.com/tradePro/neox_usdtLaToken: https://latoken.com/exchange/NEOX_USDTGaming Servers and Earning NeoxaNeoxa is not only a cryptocurrency but also a gaming platform that hosts gaming servers where players can participate in Minecraft, Rust, or GTA FiveM games. While playing on these servers, gamers have the opportunity to earn Neoxa. It's important to note that the Proof of Game (PoG) rewards are separate from the consensus mechanism and are specifically designed to incentivize gamers to participate in the ecosystem.Neoxa PortalThe Neoxa Portal serves as a hub where gamers can connect their gaming accounts and spend their earned Neoxa. The Portal features a marketplace that allows users to purchase in-game items, upgrades, and other gaming-related products or services using Neoxa. All Neoxa spent within the Portal are burned, reducing the total supply of Neoxa and contributing to its deflationary nature.Digital Assets and Utility TokensThe Neoxa platform enables the creation and management of digital assets and utility tokens, which can be used within the gaming ecosystem for various purposes. Utility tokens can represent in-game currency, access to exclusive content, or rewards for participating in events and tournaments. By leveraging the Neoxa blockchain, these digital assets can be securely and transparently transacted between users, ensuring a seamless experience for gamers and developers alike.KawPow Mining AlgorithmNeoxa uses the KawPow mining algorithm, which is the same algorithm used by Ravencoin. KawPow is a GPU-friendly, ASIC-resistant algorithm that ensures decentralization and security of the network. The algorithm is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, enabling a more inclusive and distributed mining ecosystem. By preventing the centralization of mining power, KawPow helps maintain the integrity and fairness of the Neoxa blockchain.KawPow's ASIC resistance is achieved through its adaptive nature. It requires miners to store the entire blockchain, making it difficult for specialized ASIC hardware to gain a significant advantage over regular GPUs. This allows for a more equitable distribution of mining rewards and helps protect the network against potential attacks.The choice of the KawPow algorithm for Neoxa offers several advantages. Since it is the same algorithm used by Ravencoin, Neoxa can benefit from the existing infrastructure and community support that has been built around Ravencoin. Additionally, the ASIC-resistant nature of KawPow promotes decentralization and ensures a fair distribution of mining rewards, aligning with Neoxa's core values of providing an inclusive gaming ecosystem.In conclusion, Neoxa is an innovative cryptocurrency that aims to reshape the gaming industry by offering gamers a unique way to earn rewards while enjoying their favorite games. With a focus on decentralization and a robust ecosystem that includes gaming servers and the Neoxa Portal, Neoxa is set to become a significant player in the gaming and cryptocurrency landscape.",

Proof-Of-Game creates a unique way for people to earn and trade Neoxa. An example that we are looking at right now is Roblox Development, you could earn Neoxa by simply playing Roblox and let's not forget that this is also available on console",

QT was not released because for the first 1000 blocks due to BIP's being activated, we would not release our wallet with daemons not containing checkpoints to ensure no network splits - this is quite common with Bitcoin core code on new networks. There may be coins out there that choose not to do this but this would be reckless.Pool software on release can also cause further issues because this can cause network splits depending on hash rate on solo pools that we are unaware of before BIPs activate, we need to ensure network security on launch before pool releases. Thank you for your feedback.",
