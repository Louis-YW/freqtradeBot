  "content": "Hello everyone!this is Hache from Krater.Krater is building a Marketplace that helps data centers and cryptocurrency miners to connect seamlessly. For this we leverage our SaaS that helps monitor and manage mining operations.Our software enables data centers to become more efficient by automating most of the manual tasks that plague them when dealing with numerous crypto mining customers, including automating energy calculations (either directly from the machines' API or from Smart PDUs) and processing payments for hosting without the need of human intervention (web3 crypto or fiat).It also provides dashboards for customers or investors to keep track on the performance of their machines, and perform management tasks themselves like restarts or pool changes. If you are running a farm and are interested in getting access to our demo accounts or would like to try us out in your farm, send me a DM!Here are some screenshots of the dashboards for both data centers and for mining customers. Happy mining!",
