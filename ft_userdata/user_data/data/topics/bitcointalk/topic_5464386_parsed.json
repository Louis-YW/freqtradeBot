  "content": "There is a new danger lurking around PC users that many may not know about, especially those that store Bitcoin and coins on PC wallets, please spare me a little bit of your precious time. The first set of free softwares we like installing on a PC when we just installed a Windows OS or when we just buy a new laptop or Desktop PC is WinZip and WinRAR, there is something going on lately that I need you to know about, though it's been a month old.It's easier to just go online and search for Winrar, either it's old version or not, we don't care, they all work very well for extracting files.Well there is catch, WinRar software is vulnerable to attacks now, there is a problem in this software that lets remote attackers to execute some codes through the affected version on RarLab Winrar.This vulnerability get your PC compromised without you having a clue.Before you freak out, there is a fix and it's the simplest of all, just update your WinRar to the latest version and you are good.Possible Threats if you leave this unfixed1. Attackers can use this vulnerability to execute codes in the context of the current process. 2. If you don't get rid of left over software on your PC they could be used as a path to get to your files, e.g passwords and crypto-related things on your PC.3. You can be monitored without you knowing, all your typing like seed phrases and co can easily be known by the attackers, and not even your DEX activities can secure your wallet from getting compromised.  Bonus Advice4. 7Zip is open source and it should be your primary choice. The lesson I personally learned from this is to always keep your software updated, and always get rid of software you don't use anymore, since you don't use them anymore it's easier to feel like you don't need to update them, and vulnerability like this mostly happens with old or outdated software, New Patches gets rid of the biggest problems on computers, it's not something to joke with.",

But RAR archives are pretty much only found in private torrent sites and shady download piracy pages.Even the 7z format I heard is slightly more efficient than RAR.",

Windows 11 Insider has native support for working with 7-zip, rar, and more - link.Which calls into question the use of those versions of Windows that have built-in applications, such as an archiver.I will supplement OP's post with a link to an article about fixing a critical vulnerability in Winrar that allows malicious code to run in the system for the sake of completeness - link.In general, ideally, it is strongly recommended (if possible) to separate the computer (have multiple devices) for everyday tasks and work with cryptocurrencies (with a minimum set of programs).",

      "body": "Thanks for the heads-up. I just checked and was relieved to see I do not have any WinRAR or WinZip installed on my device. But I am not sure if they are installed on my second device. But still If I get to open that device, I will try to disconnect from the internet, then try to remove that app totally, and I hope I will be good to go.And you did not provide any of the source links from where you got the news, as it will be good to read the full back story of the case. Otherwise, I still have ways to find the source.And TBH, I did not know 7zip was better than Winrar because anytime I have to download any zip software, I avoid downloading 7zip because of my bad experience with it. But I think now I have to change my priorities.Quote from: Cantsay on August 24, 2023, 10:24:13 AMI have just one question; if I should download the old version that’s prone to attacks from the official website.

Quote from: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/winrar-flaw-let-hackers-run-115315339.html?Venerable shareware archiving app WinRAR has recently been patched to fix an alarming flaw. The update to WinRAR version 6.23, spotted by Bleeping Computer, fixes the vulnerability to the high-severity CVE-2023-40477. In brief, earlier versions of WinRAR were vectors for running a program (arbitrary code execution) if an attacker could tempt the user to open a specially crafted RAR file.",

In essence, malicious zip files were spread through various routes, including trading and crypto forums. These zip files, when opened from Winrar, exploit the said Winrar vulnerability by:QuoteThe cybercriminals are exploiting a vulnerability that allows them to spoof file extensions, which means that they are able to hide the launch of malicious script within an archive masquerading as a ‘.jpg’, ‘.txt’, or any other file format <…>A ZIP archive was crafted to deliver various malware families: DarkMe, GuLoader, Remcos RAT These extra goodies allow scumbags to install keyloggers, capture screenshots, perform remote access and so forth.
