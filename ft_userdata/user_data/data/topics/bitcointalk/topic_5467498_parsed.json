Well so I was thinking how would users feel if actually there was some kind of Voice translation writing mode here in the forum so as to aid those who are not too good at typing or expressing themselves very well through writing to actually speak out their thought and it gets written down correctly for them  .Although I know it's a crazy idea but still it's a free community so I decided to speak out to see how many people actually have similar thoughts on the idea although I have a feeling I would be criticise on this but it's worth throwing the question out there.

I actually was on the idea of user actually speaking there mind and then some kind of software actually write it down as writing clearly just like the Google voice option in the phones.",

Some of the OG members from the forum who usually write mega threads could use these features. If any forum members have any defaults in their typing hands, a build-in feature like this might help them as well.I think this will just increase the work force of the forum development team because of the regular maintenance. This will increase the spam content and reduce the quality of the post because of the grammar mistake and inaccuracy. Also I don't think they have any plans to implement these features at any time.",

Anyone who is having issue with writing technology have now made it very easy for the in the aspect of allowing them to use the voice recognition which usually comes with almost all keyboards for the mobile users they will just have to enable it and do the talking why the keyboard helps them in doing the writing, then they can check it back again to see if what was written is actually what they pronounced, since intonation is really lot of people’s problem. As for those who are using pc, they can also look for such app if they don’t have one on them they can install it from online, if not some pc usually have that option if am correct you just have to locate it and activate it, those who are not good in writing will survive even without the help of the forum activating such in it, as that will be another task added to the todo list.",

LolYour idea is a nice one but I don't think that such feature in needed on Bitcointalk because we can use such features by installing simple extensions. One such extension is \"Voice In\" that's available on chrome web store and it help to write anything that you speak. If we have such speech to text dictation extensions already available then it isn't a good thing to increase load on the Bitcointalk webhost machine by adding such processor intensive features. The forum is working well in its simplistic design and even someone with a low-end system can use this forum without any trouble. I hope that extension will work for you and you will enjoy using it.",

That's the stress...but you gotta be able to form these words and write them during the learning process....so the act of speaking fluently is made simple when there's proper understanding on how to write them words...

And I am willing to bet that there are already many browser extensions or virtual keyboards available with speech-to-text functionality. However, I am not sure how good they are and how effective they would be for forum use. The voice typing feature is already available in your browser and you can easily use it. It has been explained in the above post too. However, as per my experience, you cannot fully trust voice typing because many times it will understand the wrong word and therefore type in the wrong word. You need to manually check the voice written post before you can actually post it.",
