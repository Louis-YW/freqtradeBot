  "content": "WHAT IS RENECRENEC, which simply means Remitano Network Coin, is the native coin of the well known Remitano Cryptocurrency exchange, and also the coin that powers Renec Blockchain. Renec Blockchain is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to enable creators build their experiences that provides to the billions of users in the web 3 era. This is a Blockchain designed to make it possible for users to transact quickly with cheaper fees, secure escrow, and execute complex smart contracts using the RENEC coin. The journey began in 2021, but the blockchain mainnet(beta) was fully launched in 2022. WHY RENEC BLOCKCHAIN?1. SCALABILITY: Renec Blockchain is highly scalable, built with the ability to process thousands of transactions per second, it is faster than most L1 blockchains. Renec blockchain is also scalable in the sense that, it is built to allow as many new blockchain technologies as possible to be added to the network anytime the need arises, no forks of any kind. 2. LOW FEES: On Renec Blockchain, fee per transaction is as low as $0.0002. 3. CROSSCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: Renec Blockchain uses technology that allows users to exchange assets across different blockchains using only a single coin, RENEC. Accordingly, Renec Blockchain will lock many tokens on its blockchain and unlock them on another blockchain and vice versa easy, simple and seemless. 4. HIGH PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY: Renec Blockchain runs on a powerful blockchain protocol known as DPOS technology. DPoS Technology (Delegated Proof of Stake) - is a protocol in the blockchain being used by famous networks like EOS, TRON and Cardano. DPoS is a product born to solve the shortcomings of PoS and PoW protocols, two protocols that most crypto projects are using today.DPoS possesses a technology-based parliamentary democratic way of operation. This approach is intended to overcome some of the shortcomings of concentration.This technology was created by Daniel Larimer, it is a consensus mechanism for shareholders to vote for delegates. These delegates will then be responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the system.RENEC BLOCKCHAIN/COIN BASICSCOIN: RENEC BLOCKCHAIN: Renec BlockchainPROTOCOL: Delegated proof of stake(DPoS)COIN TYPE: Utility CoinSUPPLY: 73,957,475WEBSITE: https://renec.foundationEXPLORER: https://explorer.renec.foundationWALLET: https://wallet.renec.foundationRENEC BLOCKCHAIN DOCUMENTATION: https://docs.renec.foundationWHITEPAPER: https://remitano.com/renec-whitepaperOFFICIAL SOCIAL HANDLESOfficial Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenecBlockchainOfficial Telegram Channel: https://t.me/renecblockchainOfficial Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/renecblockchainJOIN THE OFFICIAL CHATRENEC MARKETS1.

Insert a clown emote right here. You are very funny mate, a simple research would have changed your perspective.Remitano is one of the biggest and most popular peer 2 peer exchange in Africa and in some other notable parts of Asia, they've been in business since 2014, they launched their own coin called Renec in October 2022, and was airdropped to both old and new users of their exchange, Renec was never initially sold to anybody. Who told you they don't have the money to launch their website before releasing this launching the project fully? Ignorance is indeed a disease, you should insert that clown emoji right here.ðŸ“ˆ [RENEC Blockchain Highlight - 19 Dec 2022]- Total created RENEC wallet: 9,117- Total volume staking on-chain: 388,280 RENEC#renec #renecblockchain #renecwallet",
