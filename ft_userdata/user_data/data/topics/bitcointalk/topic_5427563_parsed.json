  "content": "I was just checking what is going on today about cryptocurrencies and I saw this amazing information about bitcoin mining in Kenya. We know this was annouced many months ago, that bitcoin mining was coming to Kenya, but I am surprised that the productivity that bitcoin gives than take was talked about in Kenya. When some countries ban bitcoin mining, other countries are already accepting bitcoin mining.See how bitcoin makes energy generation to a rural area in Kenya and how it make the cost lower:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-project-in-kenya-helps-power-rural-communityQuoteOn Dec. 9, Gridless Compute tweeted photos and commentary on how their hydro-power BTC mining rigs are powering an entire rural settlement while also lowering energy rates for 2,000 people, the equivalent to 500 families. According to the tweet, costs decrease from $10 per month to $4.I am also surprised that bitcoin is trading at a very low price but making energy production to be posible in a rural area.",

Gridless serves as the anchor tenant, financing the construction and managing the operation of data centers in rural communities where traditional industrial or commercial customers are not available.",

When some countries ban bitcoin mining, other countries are already accepting bitcoin mining.See how bitcoin makes energy generation to a rural area in Kenya and how it make the cost lower:This is an extraordinary achievement for Bitcoin mining in Kenya, this is the basis that bitcoin mining does not use large electrical energy which can damage the energy sources used in the future, because these resources can be renewed in new ways and available methods from nature. If it is true that companies do this perfectly, then bitcoin has proved another opportunity for its usefulness for many people.QuoteI am also surprised that bitcoin is trading at a very low price but making energy production to be posible in a rural area. I don't see them trading bitcoins at very low prices, because on the link site that you share, it only discusses the issue of bitcoin miners and the electricity that is given to village settlements, which lowers the energy level of 2,000 people, equivalent to 500 families. But whatever the results of the discussion, this is an extraordinary achievement for bitcoin and its use for rural communities there.",

      "body": "In simple words, that’s industrialisation. One of the greatest revolution which was seen during 17-1800 throughout the globe and mostly in the western hemisphere. No wonder when big powers combine together then they could bring such wealth to the locals. I am sure they might have brought nice employment for the locals along with the energy bonuses. This explains why there is high cost of utility when you live far from the city hubs, in terms of providing services which takes extra cost of logistic, supplies, roads and what not. When you bring the source of utility right at doorstep then it can lower the cost pretty well.",

Obviously, I don't expect these news sources, i.e the more mainstream news, would share this story. Thus, the vast majority continue to have a tainted view on Bitcoin, simply because for the last year or two years we've been subjected to being ridiculed because of Bitcoin using Proof of Work. So, this technically would be a big surprise to most people outside of Bitcoin. We do need more coverage of things like this though, since it shows the benefits or at least the mitigation of the already overblown energy crisis.",

Anyhow this is something good to use the unused electricity. Few months back this was into discussion, and I didn't expect a fast progress on the same in short time period. When more countries are banning cryptocurrency mining, there are countries to welcome. This shows the network won't get disturbed, as there'll be someone to pickup when one drops out of mining.",

At least, not widespread enough. Having someone with money behind them, to push that helps, but ultimately this sort of content isn't going to get the news much clicks, and therefore that reduces their willingness to post something like this.Whereas, Bitcoin melting the world because of how inefficient it is gets views, because of it's sensationalist head line. Unless, the news go with that route; \"Bitcoin SAVES THOUSANDS per year\".",
