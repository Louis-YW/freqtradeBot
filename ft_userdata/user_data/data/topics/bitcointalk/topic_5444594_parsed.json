      "body": "I don't think that the vast majority of poor people would refuse to be rich, or at least to become less poor. Certainly many people don't mind being considered rich financially, if they don't lack anything vital and are happy with the life they already have.This question is a bit complex because:-being rich does not mean being FIAT rich. Having good health, access to water, food, and having loved ones such as family and friends is already a form of real wealth.-poor people by definition do not have the means to invest (real estate, stocks, cryptos etc..). And how to become rich without investment?Each people, each culture has a different and subjective notion of wealth. Each people and each culture has a different consideration of the threshold at which they qualify as poor / rich. The ways to get out of poverty are not the same depending on where you live, there are places where your economic environment allows it, and others where it is more complex.",

Govenment on the other hand is a factor as well because they should be utilizing nation's taxes to give assistance with the countrymen especially to those who are really in need of it. Last is self sabotage wherein an individual has no urge to make a change with one's social status regardless of opportunities around him.",

Main reason why everyone can't become rich is simply they don't know anything about how money works even though they use it everyday, they spent money but not give importance to savings then how they can invest and make returns?",

Formal Education Environment3. Community environmentWill you later become someone who is passionate, diligent, confident, never give up, broad-minded, always optimistic, tenacious and consistent, or on the contrary, will you become someone who is lazy, lacks enthusiasm, lacks confidence, is narrow-minded, pessimistic and easily gives up? .That's just the foundation, not to mention the other factors beyond that.The point is whether we want to be rich or stay poor, whether we want to fight for it or not, it's not easy, but the goal is definitely achieved.",

It is more of a situation thing. some times the situation people find themself in prevents them from achieving what they want. Some people have never left or even had the opportunity to leave the remote location they find themself which also can never provide any better opportunity for them. However, let us not forget that some other people are in the best environment but are still not rich, we could even say it's destiny, If you are not born with it then it wasn't meant for you to be no matter how hard you try.",

In the cultural aspect, people here are not aware of what it is the best for them and even though they live with the barely minimum, still decide to have children, buy alcohol, consume drugs or buy unnecessary things, instead seeking education.",

You need a ferocious willpower to climb out of poverty, family which is tuned to spending won't precisely help. Most poor are born in poverty and to get out is hampered by petty crime, lack of opportunities. All that in general terms, really it goes case by case.",

You have to also get the knowledge that everyone in the world will not be rich or on the other side poor. If you have it that way then nobody would be doing services for each other, you won't have someone called \"boss or servant\" etc. It all existed in the bible, example Abraham was rich in animals, gold and had lots of servants.To deal with your question anyway, the world is not fair. It doesn't present same opportunity, challenges or circumstances to everyone therefore we deal with what is presented to us differently and we can move out or in of different financial status depending on how we handle what opportunity presented to us. Like you know of certain rich person or family in the past that were rich but today they have turned poor either because they didn't manage what opportunity they had very well and plan ahead against different government policies, environment change (world's global changes) while some poor people take those opportunity to be rich. There are different examples you can find, investment in bitcoin at the early stage or now is opportunity, taking advantage of mobile office or online businesses are some of the world's global changes.",

If they only know they will also be doing what the rich are doing.Let's say on the geopolitics side, governments and banks are actually accumulating Gold and Silver since the pandemic. So are the rich people who had already foreseen what is going to happen in the next years to come like war and devaluing of currency and because the history of financial collapse will always repeat itself like the 2008 crisis. Therefore, the rich will be hedging thier wealth and will be buying gold and investing in mining companies. Iff the poor only have the money and idea of what's to come, they will also take this as an opportunity.",

I believe that everyone was given an opportunity to have a better life once or more in our lifetime. People just missed their opportunity to grab them because they are most likely scared or doesn’t have self confidence due to their current situation.Most of the people that you mention is most likely from 3rd world country which poverty is very high. They are just accepting whatever they are since that is the norm in their country.",

They just often fantasize without taking action to make it happen.Talking about, environment, education, parental teaching, and such things from the outside will have no effect if he really wants to be rich and firm in his convictions.I think they just want to fantasize without wanting to sacrifice their time to improve their abilities. because if you talk about information nowadays it is very easy, it can even be found anywhere if he really is looking for information.",

Firstly, bad government has a major role to play to provide for it's citizens and to also encourage and bring out the best from the citizens when they are in colleges. There are some people who are good in skill but when the government see  such, they are suppose to develop the skill in that person but instead they will get jealous and kill your talent,if you are not opportune to have financial assistance from anyone. There are so many unemployed graduates roaming around in this street who can add impact to the country's economy if they are employed but instead Nepotism is the order of the day only the politicians hijack these opportunities and give to their friends and family, leaving the poor ones to ravish in poverty. Secondly, this is what I will call laziness. Some people are contented in their poverty way of life and can't make any move to improve their condition. They don't want to take risky to try something new,instead they keep on hoping that they will get rich soon without working for it,and before you know it they are already old and poor.",

This is what your question looks like, getting rich is not a thing of must but a thing of self disciplines and eager, all less you are tired of your presents predicament you can never make a change to start thinking of being wealthy.
