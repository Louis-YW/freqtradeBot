  "content": "Hey everyone, For some days, I have been meaning to pose this question here, Have you ever thought about what might happen to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies once supercomputers become mainstream? As by 2040, the computational power going to obsolete the current machines, How are quantum computers going to affect the crypto, especially bitcoin and how we secure, scale, and even mine crypto? Will Bitcoin adapt to such computational power, or could supercomputers make existing blockchain security obsolete? What about mining, will supercomputers centralize it and put power into the hands of a few? Curious to hear what you think whats going to happen in 2040, will bitcoin survive or the bubble we are hearing for few years will burst?",

Super computers, quantum computers as threats to Bitcoin security is a long debate but I am not tech guys, my thinking is simple like this. Technologies are created by human and if they can create super computers, quantum computers, they are able to create other things to provide better security against these threats of security.Like some decades ago, computational power was very smaller than in 2024, and technologies for security have been developing considerably over time too.I believe in current security of Bitcoin blockchain as well as capability of Bitcoin developers to enhance its blockchain security against such threats in future.Quantum computers and Bitcoin (2012)I don't believe Quantum Computing will ever threaten Bitcoin (2019)",

If I remember correctly, since the early days of entering the market, I have heard rumors about quantum computers but so far, I have not seen any threat from it to bitcoin or the crypto industry. It's all just conspiracy theories, hypotheses, rumors, nothing to worry about. In the future, if quantum computers can develop and reach that level, perhaps bitcoin developers will also find a solution to upgrade bitcoin to adapt to everything. Quantum computing technology is evolving but bitcoin and the crypto industry are not standing still, everything is still being developed so I don't think they will pose a threat to the crypto industry. But in all fairness, the future is unpredictable so depending on the situation, we should have a specific response plan.",

      "body": "Quantum computers can pose a serious threat to Bitcoin, in particular, to its cryptographic security, for instance, breaking with Shor's algorithm that may expose private keys from public Bitcoin addresses. But the crypto world is already developing quantum resistant encryption techniques with which to protect Bitcoin and other blockchains. While the current security of Bitcoin, such as the SHA256 hash function is somewhat resistant to quantum attacks, further upgrades may well be required to keep up with the development in quantum technologies.Other concerns include how supercomputers could centralize mining in those entities that have access to such technology and may, therefore, undermine Bitcoin's decentralized architecture. With such prospects in the air, there are reports of developers considering countermeasures, from hard forks to quantum resistant algorithms to even a consensus algorithm change to PoS, said to be more resistant to quantum attacks than PoW is. It means that the crypto ecosystem would, by 2040, have adapted to the fact that there is most definitely going to be an improved structure of security or new framework coexisting with quantum advancements rather than a total collapse.",

Don't place hope on another technology battling another. And besides would the government allow the releases of Quantum computers to the public well knowing that it could pose a threat to their security more. Well they can use it themselves for an attack on the blockchain Success is probable but lean more towards failure but it could be used to crack wallets especially for individuals who use same address.",

The Race to Harness Quantum Computing's Mind-Bending Power | The Future With Hannah FryAfter watching that video, I’m convinced that this is the future. The US is pouring big money into it, but according to the video, China’s way ahead, tripling the investment of the US in this field. One thing I remember is that they said it’ll uncover secrets of the world and shake up different areas, especially in research, since quantum computers could fast-track analysis to help researchers hit their goals.Now, if we look at this in relation to the crypto network, especially Bitcoin, it could make mining easier and more efficient, which would be a big plus for miners. They’d probably shift to this new tech since no one wants to be outdated, and staying ahead means higher profits.When it comes to the idea of \"Bitcoin VS Supercomputers in 2040,\" it’s not really a battle. Bitcoin would likely still be around as long as the algorithm isn’t changed by quantum computing; otherwise, this multi-billion-dollar market could take a serious hit.",

Literally just a single code change, we just make it ten times harder to crack, and that isn't impossible, instead of sha256 or anything else, we come up with something harder to do and even super computers won't be able to touch it.So there is really nothing to worry about, I understand people are fearing the power of a computer like that, and they are right, because not everything is blockchain, so we are going to be in trouble without a doubt, but not about bitcoin.",
