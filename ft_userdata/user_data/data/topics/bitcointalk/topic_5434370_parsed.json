      "body": "So this is just a frontend to make an OpenAI lookalike, or you also have the neural network too (considering that you also wrote \"Backend\" in the title)?If so, it would be much more valuable than $250. But in the case that you don't, I guess this could make a decent frontend to access some open-source AI like PaLM-RLHF (assuming you manage to find the training data from somewhere).",
