  "content": "One of the unique advantage with the use of a lightning network is the speed it provides in having transactions done fast and this has brought us into seing what the Titan Mining has for the miners this time.https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-miners-to-get-instant-non-custodial-rewards-via-lightning-network/An offer was made by a non custodial Bitcoin Mining Pool otherwise known as Titan Lightning, which are committed in giving bitcoin miners a direct access to claiming their mining rewards with the use of a non custodial wallet, instead of a total dependency they used to have on a custodial mining pool which causes delay before their rewards are being received after every successful block mined as disclosed by the Titan Lightning.https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-miners-to-get-instant-non-custodial-rewards-via-lightning-network/They go further in explaining that this will be a general approach they are using to benefit any miner across the world with the use of Titan Lightning, this will help them have more quick  access to their block rewards than when they are getting it from a different means which is under custodial, though they also made mention of their collaboration efforts with Lumerin Hashrate to further increase the service satisfaction of the miners in preparation for this coming halving.",

      "body": "If a mining pool finds a block, it will get block subsidy and transaction fee from transactions are confirmed in that block. Rewards from block subsidy and transaction fee are good enough for the lucky mining pool.I know no single (solo) miner will get all reward from the block and the mining reward distribution through Lightning Network is good enough for miners in that pool. Anyway I think it is not a big issue with Bitcoin miners but with non-Bitcoin-miner users.",
