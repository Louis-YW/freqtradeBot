I am still wishing for it to go back to $16K zone because that is where I sold my little BTC but I think I am in for some more pumps in here. So I am a little bit frustrated for myself but am happy for Bitcoin.",

We haven't enter 2023, so there's a big chance the bottom of Bitcoin is still not yet happen. But Bitcoin price definitely will recover on 2024 and would make new ATH on 2025.",

If you are trying to figure it out because you are not sure whether to buy bitcoin now or wait more, I would advise you to try DCA. That way you will stop trying to time the market (which is impossible anyway, unless dumb luck) ) and instead focus on acquiring bitcoin.",

It's not necessary to buy only at the bottom since it's very to predict and determine unless the price is already on the bull run to confirmed it. There’s still a lot of uncertainty and doubt on crypto which means there's still a chance for a possible price downfall. If we can analyze carefully the price history of Bitcoin. Another strong bullrun will occur right after the strong bearish market occur because people will always be scared on buying if they can't see the price suffer terrible loss. The current price loss from ATH is still not enough percentage wise compared to the last cycle when covid hits.",

Don't just because of a small rally, bitcoin only increased by more than 4% and we rushed to celebrate and believe that bitcoin will not fall again. I know we've had a bad year, especially for those who haven't seen a market crash in previous bear seasons and we eagerly await a bull market to quench our thirst, but we need to be careful not to be fooled by the price trap.",

According to previous bull runs and also corrections than btc has been corrected for than 80% and still it needs to correct more of almost 20%. So it can go upto 10k dollars and we do not in what time it will come but for sure it will come. And also you can buy at any time and hold for longer term to get maximize profits.",

There's no guarantee that it will be staying at the top like now because we're seeing that it's starting to increase again.

Then let me tell you mate that you are making a huge mistake. I mean if you greed for more and wait further, then definitely you gonna miss the best price segment to buy the Bitcoins. Then you gonna really regret on this decision. If you are able to purchase Bitcoins anywhere below 20k usd, then consider yourself lucky. Don’t think of anything else and buy as many Bitcoins as you can in this cheap price. Once Bitcoins start pumping, it won’t stop. So buy now and enjoy profits later on.",

I would not be surprised if by the end of the year the price is even $20k, but also if after that a new crash of 20% happens again. Everyone has the right to wait for the price they think will happen, even if it's $10k or some other low number. However, considering that the last ATH was around $70k, anyone who says that it is too expensive to invest in Bitcoin today has problems with elementary mathematics or some more serious problems. I think that all of them always have some kind of regret in their subconscious that they are not some kind of early adopters, but what is the use of that?",

If the price turns green and gets higher, that is time to sell.I agree with you. It is better not to think about where the bottom will be and buy if possible. The price has been falling for a year now and even if it continues to fall for a while, it will not happen all the time. Now everyone has a good opportunity to invest and profit in the future.",
