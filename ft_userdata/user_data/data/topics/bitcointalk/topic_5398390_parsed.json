  "content": "QuoteHome values in 97% of U.S. cities are overvalued, and real estate in some of the most overpriced regions could fall by 10% over the next few years, according to Moody's Analytics.The pandemic has boosted home prices in parts of the country far beyond the typical coastal hot spots, Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi said in a new analysis. The most overpriced city in the nation is Boise, Idaho, which became a magnet for technology workers who wanted to relocate from pricey California cities when their offices shut due to the pandemic. By Moody's reckoning, Boise's homes are 73% overvalued, making it the most overpriced city in the nation.The analysis may raise concerns for homebuyers, especially in regions where real estate prices have enjoyed rapid gains during the pandemic. At the same time, buyers face a double-whammy of high housing prices and rapidly rising mortgage rates, with the latter adding thousands of dollars to the annual cost of a home. Cities in the South and Mountain West, which have seen an influx of buyers during the pandemic, could suffer a 10% drop in housing prices during the next several years, Zandi predicted.\"It probably makes sense to wait a year or two if you are able,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"House prices will be lower in the most overpriced markets, and there will be more housing inventory to choose from.\"Zandi added, \"Of course, it won't be a slam-dunk better market to purchase a home if you need a mortgage, as mortgage rates will likely be higher.\"The economist said a given housing market is considered overvalued if property costs in the area are \"well above\" the historical relationship between home prices and incomes, rents and construction costs. That may explain why smaller cities like Boise are at the top of the list of overvalued home markets, rather than notoriously expensive cities like New York. Housing may be pricier on a per-foot basis in New York or San Francisco, but workers there typically have higher incomes and can support higher costs. Locals in Boise are now competing with buyers from San Francisco and other big cities, who often have more money to spend on housing. That is driving up prices beyond the reach of many people earning a typical salary in those regions. Nashville, where Moody's estimates homes are 48% overvalued, is one of those cities experiencing the pain of rapid price escalation. Realtor Shane Tallant told CBS News that new property listings under $700,000 generate frenzies, with often more than a dozen offers within 24 hours. Soaring real estate prices in Nashiville are forcing out some businesses and consumers. The Little Pantry That Could, which provides food assistance to people in need, was forced to close because its five-year lease wasn't renewed in a neighborhood where investors are buying properties. \"I don't feel like it's my fault, but yeah, of course, it's clear we're letting them down,\" Stacy Downey, the executive director of the pantry, told CBS News. \"Rock and a hard place\"The nation's most overvalued cities aren't the usual suspects. After Boise, the second-most overpriced market is Sherman-Denison, Texas, near the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where homes are valued 60% above what fundamentals would suggest. Its population has grown by double-digits for two decades as people relocated to Texas from other regions. The third most overpriced city is Muskegon, Michigan, where housing is 59% overvalued, Moody's found. Homebuyers are \"stuck between a rock and a hard place,\" especially first-time purchasers, noted Jeff Tucker, senior economist at Zillow. On the one side are surging home prices and mortgage rates, but on the flip side are skyrocketing rents, he pointed out. The monthly rent in the nation's 50 largest cities rose an average of 14% in 2021, adding to the financial pressure facing many Americans. That's fueling an interest in buying because purchasers can at least lock in a stable monthly mortgage payment, even if they'll be paying more than a year ago, Tucker noted.The nation's high housing valuations are raising questions about whether the housing market is facing another bubble, like the one in 2006 that fueled the Great Recession. Yet such concerns are likely misplaced, Tucker said.\"There are a lot of stark differences with the mid-2000s,\" he said. \"For one thing, rents are rising very rapidly, and the credit of all the recent homebuyers is really strong.\"That might protect against a repeat of the housing bust, but it may not assuage homebuyers' fears of overpaying. House-hunters should examine their budgets to figure out if they can afford the purchase, with the guiding principle being to spend no more than one-third of gross income on housing costs, including mortgage, property tax, insurance and maintenance, experts say.Tucker also recommends asking whether a prospective buyer would be happy to live in the home for several years. \"The classic rule of thumb is five years\" to hold onto a property, he said. \"If the answers to those questions are yes, then I think there is a good argument for forging ahead to buy that house.\"He added, \"The other important question is 'Where else would I be living, and how much would that cost?'\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/home-house-prices-mortgage-rates-moodys-mark-zandi/....There is a school of thought which claims real estate can serve as an inflation protected asset due to market prices scaling to match or exceed inflation. The APR on home loans can also appreciate at a rate slower than inflation if 8% is maintained. Which could actually make the loan cheaper over time.Moody's by contrast is bearish on real estate and recommends waiting a few years before buying. There was also a big property tax hike for the united states in 2021, which makes buying and HODLing real estate more difficult. Immigration numbers suggest demand for living space should continue to increase, which could drive markets higher.Its difficult to get accurate predictions and information, in ways we're in uncharted waters and no one is really certain what to expect.",

Most of the time people tend to move or reside near to the existing colonisation or to the costal areas. This creates more and more demand in that area leading to hiked prices. Definitely, they might be little over the government valuations but market rates will always demand far more because that’s also one sort of business. We know that already inflation is at its peak, that affects the whole market stream whether it’s health care or real estate!",

American real estate used to be the original HODL.   Prior to the 2008 subprime mortgage crash, many believed the price of real estate could never diminish. Due to no one in the industry remembering a time when prices declined.They call it a \"real estate crisis\". But the actual issue has much to do with lack of wage growth making it difficult for consumers to afford becoming home owners. It may more accurately be defined as a crisis of wealth and wage inequality as CEO wage growth has consumed the pay raises which would traditionally go to average workers.Quote from: davis196 on May 13, 2022, 10:58:23 AM I also don't think that illegal immigrants can apply for a mortgage.There are government programs which offer home loans to those who cannot qualify for a typical mortgage.Government student loans were offered to homeless living on the streets to inflate the earnings of for profit universities. (Part of how the student loan bubble became so big)There are many immigrants in the country illegally who work and pay taxes sufficient to qualify for a home loan (I would guess) although I haven't seen stats on it.",

Yes, this isn't with USA alone. It is an universal problem, every cities experience similar problem. The major reason why properties were overvalued, all because of the demand. Almost in every country the development is stagnant over the cities.Stagnant development makes people from the rural regions move towards the cities for employment and other needs. This makes the increase in demand for the limited availability of living space. This should not happen, corporate networks should widen the employment opportunities to the rural regions. This will make people to be in their homeland than moving to cities.",

The well developed countries are seeing such problems but the countries which are still developing are not seeing that much increase in the price, therefore I do think it might lead to reverse immigration because having a house is important for some people, this could create probelms not just for us but for the future generations as well if not resolved on time.",

So, when the building of a new one is costly, that means the new homes will cost a lot more, and that makes the people who own older ones increase their prices as well. Combine that with the fact that majority of the houses are owned by people who own 2 or more houses, that means people are buying houses even if they will not use it, even if it means they won't rent it to someone, they just do it as investment and hold it there.

They're giving out offers above the market rate to incentivize people to sell their homes all to a single buyer. Not that it would have any relevance if there were multiple firms buying up all these homes from the perspective of the seller; the issue that arises is the monopoly that these firms have on the housing market. They have the ability to create a permanent class of renters with complete control on the price with no one to compete with them.That's on top of the housing bubble they might create by paying above market prices.",
