Whatever it is, false bull or false breakout, doesn't matter specially for those who are continuing to accumulate, and specially looking for long term investments. TA can do as much for us, but there could be time that it might break.And remember that we are around this price prior to the FTX collapse, so I will say that we should be where we are months ago. The real bull market should happen though after the bitcoin halving, so that is still very far. So just continue to monitor the price and adjust your investment pattern. Or better yet, do DCA if you really want to buy bitcoin and HODL.",

What I can see in all this is just inpatient from bitcoin price, speculators who are just too quick to declare a market state so seeing that bitcoin touched $23,000 in the present time doesn't really mean much as long as the price has not persisted on an uptrend direction for a period of 3 -6 months to complete a full cycle. What I will say about all this is that we should be more holistic in our analyzes and we should be ready to give some time before making any Bitcoin market predictions.",

So people think every new year must be a bullish year. Despite the fact that historically the cycles are tied to halvenings and large bull run start after them and explode around 1 year after the halvening. People need to learn to manage their expectations. Assets that go only up and fast and always don't exist. Assets that consistently go up do it slowly. Assets that go up fast also go down fast. Or eventually stop going up fast. It's already a miracle that after 14 years Bitcoin still shows tremendous growth.",

We know we are still in a bear market because we haven't crossed the threshold of the resistance level. If we break the level, only then we can say that this is the indication towards the bull run. And as you mention that everyone was expecting the pump from the beginning of this year, what if the bears are thinking the same and trying to put you in a trap? So the safe decision is to do your own analysis to come up with the best possible outcome and if you are really thinking that this is a bull run, then why not just wait for the market to cross the level and then invest?Greed is bad and leads to emotional decision. Every pro knows that. It will be a very interesting battle between the bulls and the bears to watch. Let's see what happens.",

Simply, we will return to the support level at 18K, and we may continue until March.Geopolitical changes and the global economy will severely affect the coming months.",

There is always risk and many are still hesitant because they are afraid to make mistakes especially when they will buy during this pump because this can still be a trap not unless there’s already a confirmation about the up trend. There are ways to make profit out of this and it takes a lot discipline. Its good to be more positive about the trend, just stay within your limit and be more realistic, don’t be greedy when it comes to profit taking.",

It is too early to tell either way, however I suppose those which claim this is a fake bull run or a bull trap do it for several reasons, the first one is the bull market is not really expected to come until much later so they think the timing is wrong, another reason is simply about probabilities, as there are many more fake bull runs than real ones, so they simply estimate this growth in the price is temporary and at some point the bears will retake control of the market.",

Fake bulls can indeed be created by a group of people but I don't think that it is being created now because I think the increase now is a very clear and genuine thing from the demand that is in the market.If indeed the Bitcoin boom thing is now to be dismissed as a sham, why is the price drop always considered to be so genuine? Meanwhile, decreases and increases always occur in the market over time every year. So it wouldn't be logical for upgrades to be seen as fake now even though some people already think it's fake, but I don't care what other people think of this.",
