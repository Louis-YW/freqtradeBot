But always do your own research because there cannot be 100% certainty when money is involved. Never mind me. Is it not a stupid research to be looking for the exchange to keep your coins? Get yourself a reputed open source cold wallet or a open source hardware wallet while you can use online wallet for small amount of money. It should be to 'research on which wallet is better' rather than an exchange. Exchange means to trade, not to hold. Never trust anyone of them but yourself, hold your coins yourself.",

I mentioned in my post that sometimes we need funds on exchanges for things like doing future trading. You mean future trading, or ven if someone is a trader and trade often like in minutes, hours or daily on an exchange. That means you have to look for one of the best exchange.Do you know that Binance has been hacked before in the past? Any exchange can be hacked. You just have to know that anything can happen that you do not see coming when using a centralized exchange.There are other exchanges too, not only Binance is providing the excellent service, but you can go for it while knowing in mind that it is not your coin once it is with another party and not you. Also some people are not convenient with KYC.Some people can prefer to go for a no KYC required exchange like Kucoin or OKX, but still knowing that they are centralized and coins can also still be freezed and KYC can be forcefully demanded for. But just that no KYC reqesuted for when you registered and I think some people are using such no KYC exchange like Kucoin for long time now, but few people complain of freezing of coins or account while KYC was demanded for.",

Don't be fooled by them. Withdraw regularly, don't store your money there if the amount is too large for your risk profile. Try P2P if you are not day trading so you don't have to expose your funds to a third party. Bisq is quite decent if you're doing DCA. Anyone who plans to hold their crypto for at least a few months should never put it on exchange IMO.",

FTX was safe until it wasn't. Mt. Gox was also safe until it wasn't. The same is true with Binance. It seems safe today; tomorrow it might not be the same anymore. But, again, if you are looking for a platform to actively trade, then Binance is probably one of the good options.

Often Binance are the best, but in any case, withdraw your money directly when you finish trading, and do not put large sums in the trading platform.It is good to withdraw after you finish traidng, but some traders can leave a position opened for more than a day to a week and we do not know when an exchange will disable withdrawal and later said they have been hacked and money was stolen. The way I do it now is that I use more than one exchange, I have four now, but actively using two, dividing the trading fund to an amount I can afford to lose.Future trading is not good for newbies traders and I can not advice anyone to use it, but it is an advantage for traders to further reduce the money they have on an exchange. Assuming I have $500 as trading fund and I can only be able to risk $100. I will deposit $100 each on two exchanges, the two exchanges can not be hacked at once, or the possibility is very low. I will leverage each $100 on the two exchanges with 2.5x for any position I want to open. This makes the liquidation price to still be very far.If I leverage the $200 with 2.5x leverage, that will be $500 in total, but I hold $300 dollars on a noncustodial wallet while two exchanges can not be hacked at the same time or the chance is very low.Quote from: hugeblack on December 02, 2022, 08:43:46 AMThe more transparent the platform, the better the trust score.Which site is recommended for checking trust score? Binance is the owner of Coinmarketcap, Binance is not the first on Coingecko, it is in 12th position with a score of 9.https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchangesBinance is the first on Coinmarketcap but I will not go for their rating because Binance owns Coinmarketcap.",
