I have been using Binance and OKX now very well and incan recommend both. For future trading, I think Huobi global is good as well but the fee for spot trading is huge. I have Huobi global account but not that active. Other exchanges I have heard about: Kucoin, said to be recommended but I have not used it before.Always know that some exchanges are shady.",

Didn't you learn anything from recent cases of Celsius, Voyager, and all other centralized exchanges like MtGox? Read this carefully, ALL centralized exchanges can go bankrupt, be hacked and die, and sending coins to them you are officially not owning those coins anymore.Exchanges are used for trading and exchanging coins, not for holding, so I am not going to recommend any centralized exchanges, but best ones probably have biggest volume.I would recommend using decentralize exchange Bisq, so you don't have to make compromises or to worry about bankruptcy or kyc.",

Nobody knows the answer to this question.There are some who vouch for x or tell y is better but nobody here, absolutely nobody knows their financial status, nobody knows how deep in debt or how many reserve funds they have, nobody knows the level of security they have or how bad or inexistent those are in reality.All you're going to get ar the name of the largest and most known and that's it because something if this exchange has lasted for 4 years then it's trustworthy which can' be more false. If I were to ask what makes Binance or Huobi so secure the only answer will be that they have money and CZ said funds are safu, nobody knows the true situation as they don't have access to that data.So bottom line, you're going to have to gamble on this and maybe in one year see that all top ]3 exchanges have been hacked while some no-name ranked 300th is still up and running.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 22, 2022, 10:03:19 AMI have been using Binance and OKX now very well and incan recommend bothThousands used MtGox, hundred recommended it too as it worked well for them, till it didn't.Binance was hacked once, can you say it will not happen the second time?",

Yeah, it might be one of their marketing strategy but it works as it is just like what binance did on its previous hacked incident. Yes, it was small-scale loss, but the thing is they did reimburse the affected accounts. Why it wasn't an insurance while it works like insurance? Of course, what do you expect from an insurance company, they won't give you the total 100% of the funds lost but they did reimburse some, and insurance work like that either it's a life insurance or accident or etc. And that's the risk of using exchange which everyone of us here knows already. What I'm talking is use the trusted of them all (exchange) and those exchange that had allocated funds when something hacked happened, lesser evil (just like mentioned above) because using DEX isn't for everyone especially newbies.",

Of course, what do you expect from an insurance company, they won't give you the total 100% of the funds lost but they did reimburse some, and insurance work like that For this, we look into the user agreement/contract which details what is covered, what is not and up to which amount. Depending on one's situation, it's possible to not assume any loss e.g. when a bank files for bankruptcy and your deposit does not exceed the max insured coverage (from where i live).In binance? there are only tweets that says \"your funds are safu\" in case of hack and few articles.... which isn't surprising! they are merely relying on their own set money pool which will be shared by everyone. In the worst case scenario, it wouldn't be surprising to only get bits of your total cryto out of it, hence saying funds are insured seems wrong and sends the wrong message. plus this is all supposing that their safu jar remains untouched and CZ keeping his word-- to use them all for their users.I agree with the lesser evil point but I would never think I'm insured just because the exchange has set aside some funds that they also control.",

Yes, it's centralized and regulated I just recommend the safest one and there is no 100% safest option hardware can be still hacked physically but it is less exposed to any online attacks.I still choose the hardware wallet for holding coins for the long term but since he doesn't want to lose his investment due bankruptcy and hacked exchange and due to the unstable price of Bitcoin Paypal would be the best and safest option with instant exchange. You just need to sacrifice a bit of your documents ID and selfies to verify your account.
