      "body": "The complication of mining a new coin is, the more people start mining the harder it gets to make good numbers of coin every 24hours, this this have a good impact too, it makes the coin more scarce, there was a time where a Pentium CPU can mine Bitcoin when it was still very new, with increasing of mining difficulty, old machines won't be able to keep up.If your asic isn't making any more profits mining Bitcoin it's because you are using a old asic miner, you can't compare today's Bitcoin value to it's past 10 years value, and the more the numbers of miner grows the harder it will keep getting.To keep up, you need the latest Asic miners, and as time goes by, new Asic miners will be built from the Innosilicon company or Bitmain company.",

Now nearly all miners use specified hardware, since the amount of money generated by simple personal tools doesn't even cost the electricity spent for mining. So miners now have to be up to date, and have to buy much equipment.",

      "body": "The increasing mining difficulty for many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, is a direct result of the work of more and more people getting involved in mining. As the number of miners and total computing power in the network increases, the difficulty adjusts to maintain consistent block generation times. As a result, older mining hardware, including older ASICs, may find it difficult to remain profitable as mining difficulty increases. Also factors like electricity cost, efficiency of mining hardware, current mining difficulty and market value of mined cryptocurrencies are affected. Therefore, it is necessary to invest in new and more modern technologies to be able to compete with others.",

You need to put in computational work to get the reward. If you cannot compete with other miners, try buying bitcoin directly from an exchange.- Jay -",

      "body": "The Bitcoin mining actually began with weak Pentium computers and in those early days there were few people who were truly interested in a technology like blockchain and Bitcoin. Once the people started adopting this amazing innovation the miners were also increased because in initial days people were earning this precious digital gold with mining only and there weren't any good exchanges in those days.Those people who started mining earlier got their greed and intelligence up and they started building their mining farms with multiple CPU's and later on with multiple GPU's and because of that the mining difficulty started increasing. At those times the ones who had so many CPU's and GPU's in their farms were mining so many Bitcoins but still the ones who were having few CPU's and GPU's were still able to mine some Bitcoins.The companies soon got awareness that Bitcoin is something special and there should be some special hardware chips to mine more of it. In year 2013 worlds first ASIC miner was introduced which was later named as Avalon 1, and that changed the game of mining. Now the ones with so many CPU's and GPU's were unable to compete with the ASIC as the processing power of it was way higher then many CPU's and GPU's.Soon after that ASIC miner people gave up on CPU and GPU mining and adopted the new standard equipment for mining purposes. As the number of those ASIC miners increased the difficulty increased once again and that ASIC miner wasn't profitable as much as it was in its early days. There was need to create more powerful ASIC in order to earn more Bitcoin with less energy expenditure. The companies started releasing more and more power ASIC's year after year, and they are doing the same even this day.The current fastest ASIC miner is Bitmain Antminer S19 Pro and it has hash rate of 110TH /s if we consider it to the ASIC miners of those early days then it provides more than 100x the hash rate of those earlier ASIC miners. Now, in order to compete this thing the companies will have to create more powerful ASIC chips and then this miner won't be profitable like the way it is right now.",

You'd like everyone to be the same and have the same incentive to mine, receive the same rewards and all that. What's next? We'll equalize bitcoin and make all the big wallets contribute to small wallets? It's completely normal for companies to seek better and faster miners. Competition is good as it fuels innovation and paying more to those who are the best, the fastest, the most innovative, rewards them. If you give everybody the same reward, you'll reward laziness. Why would I rent a warehouse to have enough miners to compete for block rewards if I can get a USB asic miner?",
