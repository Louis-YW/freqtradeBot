Superpicks.com My question is can it still be called gambling if it is not played with money?I think yes as you are predicting the future and predicting the future it is called gambling because no one can predict the future correctly always,sometimes we see and choose the favorite team to win in a sport event but most of the time everybody is on a losing run.This can also increase your desire to start real gambling with real money once you get used to it so even if it is not called gambling in the beginning,it has super high chances leading you to gambling so I would put this in the gambling category.",

What makes gambling ,\"gambling\" is the lsck of assurance with the outcome either you lose or win. To some people, gambling would be only categorized once there's money involved but technically, money is just the usual mode of payment and not the bottomline, it is rather the thing that would be an exchange of your bet. It could be in form of favor, other object and such as long as there would be a player to lose something while the other one is gaining or celebrating. In platforms ofcourse currencies would take place as long ws risk is there, with profit in return.",

If you play game for free to win something without anything used that can lead to loss, you are not risking anything, which just means that it is not gambling. But it can be a strategy you can be lured with by a gambling site for you to join the gambling site and begin to gamble.Quote from: Stedsm on April 20, 2023, 07:21:48 PMIt's showing \"Access denied\".Is it a country-specific website?

QuoteSuperpicks is an exciting product of the giant broadcasting company SuperSport and the Nigeria betting company Betking, whereby you can make a prediction on football matches and win amazing prizes. SuperSport is available in several African countries but SuperPicks is only available in Nigeria. source  Maybe if it turns out successful for the companies involved, they may consider extending the service to other countries, and some other gambling companies in your country may adopt it.",

Here's what you can see when you get access:\"Correctly predict the score of 6 soccer matches to win up to N100 million!\" So, you can win $200 in Nigerian currency if you pick 6 scores in a row, which is pretty hard. Anyway, if they're for real, people might want to play. They aren't losing anything by doing it. I feel like playing for free isn't gambling. The way I understand gambling is you're risking something to potentially win more. With no risk there's no gambling. If you play mortal kombat with your friends and the person who beats all the others gets free beers paid by the losers, it's not really gambling. It's more like a good idea for a party",

We gamble from a young age, and we are not even aware that we are thrown into this game off chances and odds. If we risk something (anything) in the hope of a desired result we are gambling... doesn't matter do we risk our bodies or souls, we risk something to gain something more, and that is gambling. As I wrote many times...If you are not risking anything, then you are not gambling! Simple as that... you can't gain/lose anything, you are just killing the time with something you like, and that is far away from gambling, and those feelings that gambling (risking something to get something else or more) can produce!Good luck all gamblers!",

It is just a prediction game after all, the wrong answers are sure to not lose anything except to not win. I believe one can also try as much times as they want to unless if there's a limited try. Anyone who goes into gambling after trying out this prediction game, simply wanted to gamble all the while.",

Gambling (also known as betting or gaming) is the wagering of something of value (\"the stakes\") on a random event with the intent of winning something else of value, where instances of strategy are discounted.[1]Wikipedia stated that gambling needs 3 elements to be present which areconsideration (amount wagered)riskand prize. In the given situation of @OP where there is no consideration (amount wagered) and risk involved only prize,  the action won't be considered a gambling.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling",

This cannot be considered gambling as there is nothing at stake. I’m very skeptical of freebies, I believe there is a gambit somewhere in all of this. The website is relatively new and hasn’t got much of a reputation compared to other gambling sites in Nigeria, I suspect this is their own way of promoting their casino and trying to get people to create an account.",

Answer=NO, because gambling has to be involved with taking of risk and predicting an unknown outcome with a possible result of you losing something that is involved which is the risk so even you predicting games with no risk involved is actually not gambling.",
