  "content": "Hello there, so this person on Twitter, Daniel Batten 1 assertion that bitcoin mining has a new all time low. He went further to provide a historical chart and a source 2 for this assertion. According to him, QuoteFor the first time ever, the Bitcoin network has dropped below 300 g/KWh emissions* It's taken just over 3 years to half its emission intensity* No other industry is reducing its emission intensity at such a rate.For comparison, as of January 2020, the mining emission intensity was at 601g/kWh. Personally, I am thrilled about this, considering the backlash bitcoin mining has been facing. But what I find odd in all of this is that no other person or news/crypto sources are talking about this. Also, I have gone through the research article  provided to support his claim, but I am finding it difficult to understand what is written. I'd appreciate if someone confirms the validity of his claim. -This is source article -  http://batcoinz.com/BEEST/Thank you very much. 1 https://twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1663005438303166475?t=LyYAzlJe89BwPvRegG4P-Q&s=082 http://batcoinz.com/BEEST/",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing. I looked at the article, and in general what they write seems reasonable.However, there's a tiny amount of doubt one could cite. Most of the increase in zero-emission share compared to the CCAF study, which greatly influences the \"carbon intensity\" figure, is due to off-grid mining operations. The figures are based on the hashrate share of some off-grid mining providers:QuoteThe Zero-emission off-grid portion included Cleanspark, DPO, Terawulf, Blockfusion, Aspen Creek, Bitfarms, Gryphon, Soluna, Hive, Cowa, Sato, Genesis, Iris, Hut8, Northern Data, DMG Blockchain, Cipher.(Source: BEEST)Are these figures trustworthy and how are they collected? Do they also take into account that perhaps some stats about ZE share in countries already take into account off-grid figures?I would have to look deeper into the sources - as I wrote it's only a tiny amount of doubt. But in general, I approve the methodology.The other point of criticism is that the figure \"emission intensity\" is of course not taking into account the hashrate itself. From January 2021 to today, this figure has been slightly more than doubled (from ~150 Eh/s to 300-350 Eh/s). This means that the total emissions of BTC are about the same than in early 2021, perhaps slightly more.However, Bitcoin's price is also lower (currently a little bit, but hashrate generally recovers slower than the price due to inertia - mining operations have to know if their hashrate/reward equation is sustainable or not to finance operations), and the price influences hashrate. So if we see late 2021 prices again, hashrate could grow slowly but quite a lot.The interesting take on all this is that to lower emissions we need to reach a point where extreme events like the China ban don't have such a large impact on emissions. For now the China ban explains most of the ZE share increase. However, in the graph the late 2022/early 2023 values look quite good.In general I'm optimistic - ZE share is growing at a steady pace all over the world, so Bitcoin's emissions will eventually reach the desired tipping point and lower.@Yamane_Keto: I absolutely don't agree with your first paragraph. The thread moving to Mining would however be an ok decision.",

How come it is reducing if the mining operations are getting more and more difficult and also at the same time various mining farm companies are getting established over the period of time. The proportion is extra ordinary after pandemic and more player jumping means more miners getting fired up. Not just that, the entire mining farm now a days use completely different cooling methods. Such as sink tank, heavy industrial coolers and AC's. This put more burden on the electricity grid. Let us not forget the law, energy can not be created and nor be destroyed and it can only transformed from one form to the another. So to keep the miners cooler, AC and fans release the heat in environment and rest is the story. Connecting all the dots together how is it possible that emission intensity is actually dropping.

That I will tell you. By making such situations for them that they have to adopt the green energy. Like by making electricity more expensive or by creating funds against miner so that the reward could be decreased for them.In these situations, miners always want a peaceful way, like I have seen a video that many prefer to have their own energy source, like one have his own wind power energy system but they are not useful for everyone as wind is not same everywhere. So most preferred Solar panel energy system and the adoption of solar panels is increased so much that I think it would be enough to back up the claims made by OP's post.Well, I also have seen a person made energy by cooking oil, well it watched the video on tiktok quite back so I found it difficult to get the video's link now.",

Corrected.Yeah I think what you are pointing out is that naturally ASIC miners get more efficient over time. Hash power and electrical use are not parallel lines.When new ASIC machines come on the market they are generally not going to be using significantly more power than older miners, they are just going to be more efficient and therefore have more hashing power with roughly the same electrical consumption, in general. The mining industry is adding more miners over time, but those miners are getting more efficient over time as well, so hash rate increases a lot faster than electrical consumption. Throw into the mix the fact that plenty of people in the bitcoin mining industry will naturally feel both their own moral as well as external political pressure to use clean energy rather than fossil fuels. The percentage of mining done with clean energy will naturally move toward 100% over time.Of course it is somewhat bounded by the electrical industry energy mix itself, since more renewable resources used by the world will make it easier for bitcoin miners to use renewables. But the good thing is bitcoin mining has for a long time been well ahead of the world in general in their energy mix, using much more renewable energy than the world in general.It's not surprising if in fact the carbon emissions of the mining industry is in fact going down even as hash power increases fairly quickly. Also some miners are using wasted fossil fuels (like there is at least one company in the US using flare gas to run miners) and while this produces carbon, that carbon was being produced anyway, its just the energy was being wasted, and I'm sure this is not accounted for, that an operation such as that is actually producing zero carbon even though they are using fossil fuels.",

Correct. This is a major point of disagreement between the studies. According to the BEEST method linked in the OP the amount of mining in the Texas region (which has a high degree of low-emission electricity) was underestimated. The biggest point of divergence however was the inclusion of off-grid mining, which is based on data from the mining companies themselves, and gave a difference as big as 10 percentage points in low-emission/emission-free electricity usage percentage.Quote from: thecodebear on June 27, 2023, 03:19:15 AMAlso some miners are using wasted fossil fuels (like there is at least one company in the US using flare gas to run miners) and while this produces carbon, that carbon was being produced anyway, its just the energy was being wasted, and I'm sure this is not accounted for, that an operation such as that is actually producing zero carbon even though they are using fossil fuels.This is actually accounted for in the BEEST estimation (which gave a minimum of 52.4% renewables), but not in the CCAF study (which gave 37%). The impact is however relatively low, it gave only an increase of 1 percentage point.Regarding your last point (world moving towards clean energy) the BEEST study, if I interpret it correctly, calculated a global increase of 2% (not the same than 2 percentage points!) in the share of clean electricity (including nuclear). We're now at 38%-39% according to their data.The increase from 2010 (when \"clean\" share was at 32%) doesn't seem that big, but this is actually because there was already a big hydro/nuclear/biomass share in the late 20th century (and above all nuclear is decreasing in importance/share), while only in the last years wind and solar are growing at an accelerated pace. This growth can even be seen in countries with very low electricity prices like Argentina (see Cammesa). Due to the extremely low electricity costs from wind + solar at good locations and scale effects I expect that these two clean sources will accelerate the \"clean electricity\" share growth in the next decade, and I could imagine a share of 50-60% around 2030 (and mining using at least 70-80%, if not 90%+).There's one BEEST finding I've not 100% understood:Quote from: BEEST– The Bitcoin network uses +4.49% more zero-emission power each yearThis figure is not explained: is it clean energy usage in absolute numbers (so we would have to compare it to fossil usage growth)? In this case it doesn't seem that impressive, as Bitcoin's general energy use grows almost every year. Is it clean energy share, in percentages or percentage points?",
