Your signature space (which you can’t do because of your rank) it will be okay, or if you just put it in your profile “website space” that will do too. But if you’re talking about including it in your post and spamming the forum with it, that’s not accepted and it will lead to your account getting banned.",

It's a simple concept really that everyone here has to follow. You could also look into advertising your site through signature campaigns in this forum which you could check here bitcointalk services tab. Once you're done with checking, gauge your choices and decide whether cut and dry advertising is what you're going for, or you wish to make this into a full-on career for other people with the guaranteed benefit of getting clicks and backlinks to your site.",

You can make a detailed Ann thread about the site depending on where it is best suited for what you want to advertise, and as long as you are not going to include a link that has a virus on it or can steal other data and is not also proven to be a malicious scam website, I think you are good to go and you can advertise here on the forum. I also think referral links are not allowed, which I think might affect your promotion because people with whom you are sharing their link might not know when others click on it from here.",

The other way to advertise your link is to run a signature campaign on the forum so that the members will apply your link's signature on their profiles and you'll get exposure to your site. Another way that you can use to advertise your link is to make a proper announcement thread in micro earnings board and share details about your faucet there.  You can also launch a review campaign so that the users can learn about your site by reading the honest reviews of the reputed members of the forum.",

I think that Op is not talking about advertising a faucet site that he owns, advertising any site is allowed within the services section.But he talks about putting a referral link to some of the faucet sites he subscribes to in the posts. By posting the referral link he will get more coins if someone signs up through his referral link.Placing referral links in posts is prohibited.",
