  "content": "It is a common saying that “cryptocurrency is the future” but one can categorically say crypto is the present. Many big corporation now accept cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange and that is how it begins.We all know the history of fiat money, how it was first the merchant receipt of deposits in large commercial transactions.Paper money was first introduced in the 7th century during the ‘Tang dynasty’ in China but it did not appear till the 11th century during the ‘Song dynasty’. It was not introduced in Europe till the 13th century by European explorers like Marco Polo. in the early 1800s, Napoleon issued Paper notes.The essence of the history lesson is to illuminate the similarities between the introduction of paper money and the introduction of cryptocurrencies. If you also look at the introduction of credit/debit cards you'll see a whole lot of similarities. The point is, these mediums of exchange/payment don't just get accepted overnight. Just as it took paper money centuries to be accepted globally, so did it take credit/debit cards, electronic bank transfers, to be accepted globally. We can see cryptocurrencies following in these exact steps but better, more transparent and easier to understand. Governments, businesses, individuals around the world saw the benefit of accepting paper money and keyed into it. Centuries later, they saw the benefits of adopting credit/debit cards and they did. Today governments, big corporations, individuals are seeing the importance and benefits of cryptocurrencies that is why they are adopting it. So why should the small scale businesses be left behind?If you still need more reasons a small scale business should adopt bitcoin, these are a few;1. Low transaction fees and Quicker transaction:     It is relatively cheaper to carry  out transactions through cryptocurrencies than electronic bank transfer. It's also faster2.  High Security and reduced transaction Fraud:     Every transaction is stored in the decentralized blocks, once the transaction is made, it cannot be reversed or canceled.      Since no central authority oversees the operation, customer confidentiality is maintained.3.  New Customer acquisition:     There are hundreds of millions of people all over the world who trade in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In fact      according to Zippia, there are about 36.5 million American crypto user and 300 million global users as at 2021. So if you      accept crypto as payment for your business, you will have more people who prefer to transact in crypto and you have the      opportunity to expand.4.  Access to world market:     Unlike the stock market that has an opening and closing hours (working hours), crypto markets don't have specified      working hours. It operates 24/7. You can take advantage of this and work around the clock if you want to without any       limitations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote#:~:text=The%20first%20known%20banknote%20was,coinage%20in%20large%20commercial%20transactionshttps://yourstory.com/mystory/impact-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-small-scale-business",

It can't be concluded at this time that the purchase of goods and services with bitcoins has already accounted for at least half of that figure.Another issue, I'm afraid that as the bitcoin price increases it will shift the goal of just being an absolute investment asset even though regulations allow it.",

You are very right.I failed to add that this was for businesses that are in countries where they are allowed to used bitcoin. Also it has to be business that are online because small scale businesses that are not online or do not offer services online will find it very hard to venture into crypto because most of their target audience do not use crypto.",

The very factor that everyone understands and knows about the bitcoin: Volatility. As far as small business owners are considered it would unrealistic for them to rely on the currency which is highly unstable and they may end up loosing their so called \"small\" profits over the time and could go bankrupt. Well we dont want that kind of first impression to the small business owners. As far giant business players they can hold up that much investment for very long terms and hence they are adopting it at faster rate as compared to the smaller one's. We might have solution in the future but for now \"comparative\" supply is huge and with increased difficulty it would be even slowly minted. Hope so soon, if may be government interfered but keeping it decentralized?",

Quite a few of them do not have the cash flow that a company like microstrategy has to hold some of their revenue in bitcoins. They have the option of using a payment processor to convert the bitcoins to fiat immediately, which presents them with exchange fees for each transaction.",

Hence, in the event of a bear market, your small holdings which is also your capital from accumulated purchases could reduce in value and you'll be in a lose as commodity might maintain its standard price.A side to this might be a usdt conversion to provide a hedge against devaluation but then, the crypto acceptance becomes you just providing another means for your customers and that's not bad though.",
