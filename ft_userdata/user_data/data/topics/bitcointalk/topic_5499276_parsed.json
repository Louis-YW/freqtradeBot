  "content": "Many folks in our community cannot afford fancy food from fancy restaurants. Not that they do not like them, it all boils down to having the money. And I've really been thinking... why can't there be fancy restaurants in our neighborhood since all these people can't afford what's only available downtown and in rich neighborhoods? So I got this idea of setting up a fancy restaurant with good food right in the ghetto, though I didn't have much money. This is the story of how Bitcoin is helping me do it.Last year, I was close to getting broke when the idea of starting some offline businesses came to my mind. Inspired by hunger, I was sure I'd set up a restaurant so that folks who don't have a lot of money like me can also get good food. Personally, I wasn't really eating good food and sometimes skipped meals. There's this friend that borrows money from time to time. At a point, he started showing some attitude, so I realized I had to buckle up and make some more money for myself by quitting neighborhood influence. I started thinking about what I have to sell to start the business but found nothing - had sold them all when I had no idea. I realized that I could rent out my place, and that's what I did. However, I made sure that I located a spot for the restaurant before renting out my place. After I did, I paid for and moved into my proposed business place after screening it. I used the balance of the money I have to buy a few things for the restaurant, though there is still a lot to do.Words soon went around that a \"standard restaurant\" is about to open in our neighborhood. Expectations are quite high. Nevertheless, I made up my mind to open a place that would wow the people. With the help of God, it's possible. That's why I started an article-for-tip service in this forum.  I've been earning small amounts of bitcoins, and spending them on my restaurant project. Folks on Twitter think people like us selling BTC at $70K are idiots. I wouldn't know about that. I ask for tips after writing. It doesn't matter how laborious the work is. They just tip, and I feel every satoshi is worth it. Soon, folks in my neighborhood would know with pride that there's a place where they can eat good food without going downtown or visiting rich neighborhoods. Hopefully, then I'd afford to rent my own apartment again. After all, I'll be selling the most expensive food in the ghetto. My vision though is to make the breakfast affordable so to the poor.  I wouldn't have this dream without Bitcoin. Anything is possible if we believe. At least, I eat better at the moment . Thanks for reading and do give me some advice on how to realize my vision faster. Do not forget to hire me if you need something written for just a tip.",

You have to open a restaurant to earn money, the food quality is not that good, or the service is not very good. I also want to have a restaurant in the future where poor people can eat two handfuls of food for two meals at a low cost. You can earn even through such good deeds if you have such a mentality. Through this, people's prayers are accepted, and serving people is also a kind of service. Thank you again for taking such a nice initiative.",

Actually in my country this is a very common business idea.We have food stalls just around the streets that serve very affordable food usually with huge proportions and very delicious taste. They tend to do well as more people will opt to buy in here instead of in fast food restaurants or fancy ones they can barely afford.

I understand that some people pay more for the whole experience, so it's not only about the food, but don't overthink this \"fancy restaurant\" thing, focus about giving a great product to your customers.",
