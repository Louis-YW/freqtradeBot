  "content": "Here's a quote from the mail I got from Coinbase QuoteEffective January 9, 2024, Coinbase will no longer support Bitcoin SV (BSV).Users are able to withdraw BSV funds until support for this asset is deprecated on January 9, 2024 at or around 12pm ET. If you fail to withdraw your BSV funds, Coinbase will liquidate any BSV remaining in your Coinbase account. Upon liquidation, your BSV will be converted to the then-equivalent market value of another supported digital asset and credited back to your account, minus any transaction costs. Please note, after accounting for transaction costs, and subject to market fluctuations, you may not receive any compensation when the remaining BSV in your account is liquidated.If you do not withdraw your BSV by January 9, 2024, you may incur tax liability or have other unanticipated tax consequences as a result of the liquidation or conversion and you are solely responsible for any taxes associated with transactions on Coinbase.If you do not want your BSV funds liquidated, you must withdraw your funds by January 9, 2024.Trading is not enabled for BSV and you cannot deposit BSV funds into your Coinbase account. Attempting to send BSV to your Coinbase account may result in a loss of funds.If you have any questions about how to send your BSV out of Coinbase, please visit Coinbase Help.",

However, why did exchanges list this BSV? It is head shaking because everyone knew already that it is a scam. The listing might have given it an appearance that it was being supported in the community. This is how scams trick people.

Among the major exchanges that exist, some of them won't classify a coin that is even questionable as a scam as long as it has the potential to make them a lot of money once the trading is active. To find out the income opportunities come from it own supporters, they usually conduct a poll on whether it should be listed or not. That doesn't include other traders who will come over time.",

Many of their users had BTC deposited back when BSV was \"airdropped\" to every BTC address. Coinbase had credited bitcoin holders with their BSV but a long time has passed since. I'd stil however venture to say that it's certain that even up until now many Coinbase users probably still have BSV deposited thinking it might be worth something in the future, or perhaps entirely unaware that it's still in their account.",

The founder is telling everyone he is the inventor of bitcoin and many people trust him hehehehe.

It appears the big exchanges' aggressiveness for collecting trading fees might have made them blind and not see what types of problems this might cause.
