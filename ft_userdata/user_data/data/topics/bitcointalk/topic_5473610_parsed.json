Thanks again for all members who responded to  my previous topic.Your plan isn't too bad, but you still have a lot to learn to be able to hold onto your bitcoin investment until it becomes profitable. So in addition to focusing on accumulating bitcoin every month, you need to continuously improve your knowledge so you don't have to panic every time the market has Fuds or negative news spreads. Also, Electrum is a reliable wallet but if you have more bitcoins, you should consider a hardware wallet which will be more secure.",

But the most you should see is that the wallet is open source and non-custodial if it has both properties then you can prefer it over custodial wallets like CEXs.

Thanks again for all members who responded to  my previous topic.I saw your thread a few days ago and I see you also got a lot of useful advice and I'm glad you decided to choose bitcoin over altcoins. The strategy of investing little by little is wise, but I need to remind you that investing in bitcoin still carries certain risks, so invest with what you can afford to lose. Also, as some people mentioned, you should have a hardware wallet that holds those bitcoins instead of using Electrum, it's also safe but a hardware wallet will give you more security.",

Thanks again for all members who responded to  my previous topic.I will suggest you not do DCA here because the market is in a bullish cycle which means we might see BTC go up not go down as the DCA technique is beneficial when there is huge doubt in the market like we don't know whether it will go up or down.So to manage the risk we buy in parts at equal intervals of time with equal money. But if you will plan to invest $100 to $200 in a monthly timeframe then you might miss the opportunity to get BTC at lower rates.You should focus on getting more BTC while you can because it is the accumulation phase and the sentiments of the overall market is to hold more BTC which means the lump sum is the best option for you instead of doing DCA.",

As i heard exchanges is not safe for storing purposes.Electrum is a good wallet. Just as others have said, you need to be careful when making use of online wallets to store large amounts of money. For example, if you want to start a weekly accumulation of $100 worth of BTC, it will be safe for you to use, but you should be very careful about the kind of links you visit online with the device on which you have that wallet installed. And if you are to use mobile, it's not always advisable for you to carry about bitcoin holdings on your mobile device. Things happen now that only the ones we are willing to spend on a daily basis are expected to be kept on mobile wallets, which we move around with for security reasons. While you think about the best hardware wallet to buy, try protecting the phrase of the electrum that you have chosen to use, and don't use any cloud storage as a means of protecting your phrase. The old, traditional means of saving phrases are the most recommended. (Paper and pen, and keeping the different locations that can only be accessed by you and those you share access with.)",

      "body": "Since you already decided to invest in Bitcoin, I will advise that before investing in Bitcoin, you should invest in a hardware wallet. It doesn't cost too much lately, and you must choose an open-source hardware wallet. No doubt Electrum is a safe wallet, but we experienced some hacking issues through an update pop-up. So it's less secure than a hardware wallet. And more importantly, you are going to invest on a monthly basis, not once. In these circumstances, I feel you must buy a hardware wallet. You may face any issue at any time, like losing a seed phrase, and at the same time, your device may crash somehow. If something happens like this, you have to struggle to recover your funds. So to avoid hassle, a better practice would be to use a hardware wallet and keep storing it. In case you need to store some altcoins, Electrum won't help you, but the hardware wallet will keep supporting you.",

They were also a big supporter of AOPP, which was a protocol designed to make you KYC your own addresses to centralized exchanges before being allowed to withdraw. They only pulled their implementation of it after huge community backlash. The argument against these facts is always \"Well, you don't have to use these 'features' if you don't want to\", but it shows their underlying morals and ethos are very much not what they once were. I don't want my hardware wallet designed by people who are so pro-surveillance.I also take more issues with their approach to the seed extraction vulnerability rather than the seed extraction vulnerability itself.

But going on with the topic, it's true that exchanges aren't a safe place for storing our cryptos, especially BTC. Electrum is a good choice and starting with the use of it, you can plan the purchase of your hardware wallet in the nearest future. I am guessing that someday you'll think of having it and that's where you're going to store your Bitcoin purchases and with that $100-$200 per month plan, you really need to have one of those.",

You can also try out the new passport hardware wallets. Another way to safely store your bitcoin on offline storage is using an airgapped device for storing your bitcoin. This doesn’t require any purchase of hardware but the device that is to be used for offline wallet creation with electrum should be one that has never gone online before And will never go online. Your monthly purchase of bitcoin is certainly one of the best idea to accumulate bitcoin, it is just like you’re doing monthly DCA, this will help you minimize the risk of losing and also maximize the profit.",

It’s basic and yet something that you’d easily be able to follow and fall through if you were to take this into the real world.DCA’ing your investment strategy (what you’re doing right now is practically Dollar Coat Averaging since you’re practically allocating a pre-set budget from your money for bitcoin, which enables you to have a stake at bitcoin and crypto regardless of the price action). And since you’re using one of the most secure digital wallets on the market right now, pretty sure you’d have enough safety to get by. I would suggest setting up another wallet however, where you would transfer and park funds if you were to convert them into fiat. That would ensure your main wallet’s not getting touched nor given access to the internet and if worse comes to worst, your hot wallet is the only thing that’s affected.Also check your PC by running an antivirus scan, check if you have malwares that are active or trojan softwares and whatever. Just to make sure that your PC is secure from stuff that would risk your walletMs safety is all.",

Since you plan to use a secure wallet to purchase your bitcoins, this is definitely the right thing to do. If you use Electrum wallet for bitcoins then it is best and safe for your money is not likely to be hacked.
