All you have said is true, as everyone here on this forum already know about it, so I don't see why you aren't telling us something  we don't know.Of all the existing cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has shown to be much more profitable with a market cap over $ 580.02B USD  and most people would usually invest in it. Other cryptocurrency or rather altcoins are still in the early stages of development, and their long-term success is uncertain.  Quote from: Assiduous on July 23, 2023, 07:28:32 AM .Again, if its value suddenly decreases, there is a possibility of loss.Not just Bitcoin all cryptocurrency.

Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin price will increase, but you can't hope your $1,000 would turn become $1,000,000 after 4 years, you're need to make money because you need to feed yourself.",

The convenience offered by Bitcoin has increased people's interest in Bitcoin, one of the advantages that Bitcoin has is being able to send money across countries without having to use intermediaries.When a family of yours studying abroad needs money suddenly to pay tuition fees or pay hospital fees, you can immediately send them some Bitcoin to pay for their needs in a matter of minutes anytime and anywhere. The fast transactions that Bitcoin offers is another advantage that fiat money cannot do, besides that Bitcoin can also act as a long-term investment asset to store value against inflation.",

If they invest $1000 in Bitcoin and then sell it for $1,000,000, the profit might be huge. But the profit will not be huge if they only use $ 100.The profits they earn will be by how much they invest. And investing now is not just buying Bitcoins and done but they have to try to buy Bitcoins regularly over a certain period. That will make the Bitcoin continue to increase until the time they want and then they only need to wait until the Bitcoin price increases and then sell the Bitcoin.And if the current Bitcoin price drops, it is a good opportunity for them to buy because, for the same amount of money, they can earn more satoshis than their previous purchase. But what attracts people to Bitcoin is that they can expect to make a profit in the future.",

Your topic says reasons to be attracted to bitcoin but you failed to highlight those reasons in your post. For your information, there's no major reason people are attracted to bitcoin because every individual reason differ and to each person, their reason is major. Bitcoin doesn't offer huge profit with low investment, It's not ponzi or gambling. However, some people are attracted to bitcoin for financial gain, while some are attracted because of its decentralized nature and to some because of its peer to peer transaction devoid of government control. Bitcoin also offer anonymous and privacy which may be the reason why some people adopt it. There'll be lose if it decrease below your buying price normally and vice versa.",

It is like buying a fake global brand. It is true that it is cheap, but it will not be at the global brand price. You will find that the owners or sellers of that brand claim that it is original, but all they do is deceive investors to steal their money.Therefore, the number of real cryptocurrencies is less than 100, those that have fundamental differences, and the rest are worthless duplicates.",

It’s the freedom that they get from Bitcoins which binds them with the coin. Yes you can get huge profits from small investment, but the main reason people are investing in Bitcoins because of its decentralised nature. Bitcoins cannot be controlled by any government or governing body, hence people are saved from paying unnecessary taxes and fees. When people store money in bank, then completely don’t own it.

I really love the concept of Bitcoin that's why it attracts me more. People are now much conscious about their assets and they even now don't believe the Banks as many Banks have gone into bankruptcy. And just reserving your assets will not make you beneficial rather than inflation problem. So they are eager to have a secured way of investment which have a huge potential for the future and it's already proved. Is there any other reason needed to be attracted to Bitcoin? Obviously this is just a part why people like it and there are many more advantages to be discussed and why Bitcoin should be accumulated. It makes transections faster, easier, anonymous and obviously Decentralized. I love almost every properties of Bitcoin rather than it's manipulation problem or negative volatility.",

I totally agree with what OP said, crypto and bitcoin market attracts investors because of the huge profits it brings. We only need a small amount of capital to still get a large profit, and that is the advantage that attracts investors compared to other financial markets.",

Profit from investment in bitcoin is one attractive quality that bitcoin has, but it is not the only thing that has made people attracted to it. Read well and search for the other functions that bitcoin can serve, they are all very attractive in their own way and will attract different people based on what it is they need. Some very wealthy people will not see any need to invest in bitcoins, but luckily because that is not the only benefit of bitcoin, some rich people still have it for other uses.",

Another member said that the real coins are less than 100, but it may be more accurate than the previous observation taking into account that he was speaking about the ones with fundamental differences.It is true that in the past many people got rich with a very small investment, but as the market matures this is more and more uncommon, and the number of people left behind by dead coins, pump&dumps, etc. is increasing (especially in bear markets and accumulation phases), so be careful and inform yourselves well before entering the markets.",

The main reason that greedy people are attracted to cryptocurrency is because of the potential huge profit that they perceive. The main reason that people use Bitcoin and stay with it in the long run is because:- It is censorship resistant, nothing can entirely stop your access to it. Entities such as banks or governments can not ban or block access to it or your holdings.- It is private (unless privacy is willingly sacrificed by the holder by using identifying services)- Fees are lower for international transfers in most cases and you aren't charged to have a wallet (like you are when you use a bank)- The reward for holding for a long period of time is not only historically high, but better than the devaluation that would occur by holding fiat in the long term.I would call all of the reasons listed above as more valid reasons that because \"people want huge profits\". Generally those who have entered Bitcoin or cryptocurrency with that mindset have been burned, for better (learnt for next time) or for worse (now call crypto a scam because of their own greed).",
