  "content": "PC Gamer: Valve is dropping local currency support for Turkey and Argentina amid 'exchange rate volatility,' moving to 'regionalized USD pricing' for 25 countriesQuote\"Exchange rate volatility in Argentina and Turkey in recent years has made it hard for game developers to choose appropriate prices for their games and keep them current,\" Valve explained. \"We have heard this loud and clear in our developer meet ups and round table chats. In addition, we have had a hard time keeping Steam payment methods up and running in these countries/territories due to the constant foreign exchange fluctuations, fees, taxes, and logistical issues.\"Pricing games in USD for Steam customers in Argentina and Turkey will help us provide greater stability and consistency for players and partners, while also enabling us to continue to offer a variety of payment methods to Steam users in those countries/territories.\"\"Volatility\" in this case appears to be a polite way of saying that the currencies in question have all but collapsed. The switch to US currency in Argentina and Turkey will see them included in a new \"regionalized USD pricing\" bloc that includes 25 countries across two regions, Latin America and Middle East/North Africa. The other countries included in the new pricing regions did not previously have local currency support.In the past Steam dropped the option of paying with BTC via BitPay because of customer complaints over high fees, delayed transactions and problems with the processor, and Steam never had intention of accepting Bitcoin directly. Now we see that fiat currencies are not immune from getting dumped by global corportations either. Perhaps when Bitcoin will become stable and LN will be ready for mainstream use, Bitcoin will take its place among the strongest global currencies. But for now the similar argument of price volatility can be used to reject Bitcoin from being adopted by a lot of merchants.",

These companies of course have to maintain their business composure and despite that they've got players from these countries or regions, they need to prioritize the goal of the company. I just wish that Valve would recognize bitcoin again and as well as other cryptocurrencies as an alternative for these regions. They have a pilot run test from these countries to start and have it back with the crypto support and see if it's going to work on the people there so that they won't just have a few options but they'll also have a lot of options to make to pay for the games that they have. Anyway, despite the drop of support for these fiat currencies, gamers will always be gamers and as long as there are other payment options available on them, they'll use that to purchase games, in-game items and other Steam products.",

It is about the fact that Valve couldn't (or maybe didn't want to) provide a service for its developers to automatically convert the price of their products into other currencies and they had to \"hard code\" it It is possible that as an American based company didn't want to go through the process of exchange the other fiat currencies they receive to their local currency, dollar. They are jut cleaning up by removing \"extra\" options. Just like they did with Bitcoin!P.S. After some google search I'm willing to bet that the fact that Turkey and Argentina combined didn't even crack the top ten countries in the list of top sources of revenues of Steam, played the key role in excluding their currencies. Percentage-wise these two countries combined won't even reach 0.1% of the total revenue So yeah, it definitely had nothing to do with volatility...",

Companies, including MercadoLibre, Argentina’s largest tech company, increasingly are acquiescing. Most landlords in Buenos Aires now only accept payments in dollars. Ditto for Airbnb rentals. And the list goes on and on: musical instruments, divorce lawyers, imported leather — you want it, you cough up the greenbacks.But some fools still believe in de-dollarization!",

Regarding the dropping of Turkish Lira and Argentine Peso, I think it's a good news and probably a good way for Turkish and Argentinian players to make money selling stuff on the Steam market since they're going to get paid in USD, am I wrong that it's a good thing or not? Because that's what I take from this news.",

It's probably more correct - its instability is the most acceptable, plus it has a lot of other advantages and the rejection of local currencies, which degrade greatly, is quite understandable and logical. The company is conditionally \"doing business in dollars\" and it needs the sale of the same service in any country to bring the planned profit in ... yes, dollars. If local currencies are stable (+/-) then the sold service in local currency can be easily converted into the planned price in dollars. And vice versa - high volatility - and you will receive today for a certain service not 5 dollars, but 2.... And this destroys all the planned indicators of the company, why do they need such problems?!  Therefore, the measure of value becomes the dollar, which by paying at the current exchange rate in the local currency, will give those very 5 dollars",
