I haven't heard about the casino either but it's a good thing you where able to reach out to the support, I think there's little or nothing the forum can do to help you retrieve your the account, so if you say it's calling the support is the only way then try to do that as early as possible, just figure out a way, if you have a trusted person in your country you can talk to them and make them call in your behalf.",

I am not going to name the casino as it doesn't mater in this discussion. The problem wasn't in a new BTC address or a different IP, they noticed I logged in from a new device, so they temporarily blocked my withdrawal. I needed to contact them over my registered email for them to know it's really me.I was certain they would ask for KYC, but that wasn't the case. I used a different laptop, the system noticed it, and halted my withdrawal. I actually didn't mind it. After 30-40 minutes, the case was resolved and my withdrawal was processed by them. The only thing that was weird was their suggestion that I enable 2FA, which was always enabled from the day I signed up. Probably just a mistake on their side.",

If there were some other means of communication, maybe a better solution would have been found on the matter. If you can contact them and if they take that step it would be better otherwise i can consider this kind of behavior as a scam. They should have at least mail communications system that you can keep as evidence. I have never fallen in such a situation where only direct contract number is given to solving any issue.",

I don't really believe to any kind of review site, because still can be faked by partnership (paid) review with the site. Example like \"TrustPilot\" there has some service to boost a fake testimony.So, never take any advice/review from a review site.",

I have tried to find out about it for a long time but it is not possible to do so. Because toll-free numbers cannot be called from outside the specified area. If you are outside from the US, you will not be able to contact this number. You must use an alternative method of communication, such as email, social media, or Internet-based communication services. I tried to find a contact number from their web also.
