So, don't go easy on it while we've got still time, there's a tendency that the market won't be ending up with this turmoil that we're seeing. The bears are there and you'll have to be patient at most times until we see those signs. Mostly thought that when bitcoin has reached $21k, it's likely the end but no way. It's a cycle and typical cycles of the market takes time and it's going to be a long way ahead.",

Based on precedence, we tend to have a longer period for the bearish trend as compared to the bullish market. It would be awesome to have the bull run commence as the bear market has been up for a while now.",

It's a cycle and typical cycles of the market takes time and it's going to be a long way ahead.I think the market has been bearish for a long time and it will probably last even longer. But even if bitcoin bounces back to 21k soon, that would not indicate a reversal. Remember how it used to be when some people thought the bears left and got caught in a bear trap. It was the same recently when bitcoin bounced back to 21.5k but then fell to a new bottom. I think the reversal will happen after another halving.",

But we all do agree that the next bull run will come after the halving on 2024.That's what cycles are for and we've seen it come and go and the beauty of it is that we're about to see this year end. And that counts less than 2 years, and we're nearing to it. Time is so quick.",

Think of how many crypto investments would die by waiting. If the increase would happen next year, that would be better ofcourse because halving MIGHT prolong the run, if ever. And if not, same thing would happen just like in year 2018 wherein market was stagnat for almost two years, and that was a horrifying experience 'coz many people have lost fauth in this industry that time.",

A bit difficult to know that caused by so many bad incidents have been erasing the trust from so many investors. The crypto market can perform good against once there will be something big that can trigger investors to believe in the crypto again. The market seems try to do side ways once more again. This gonna be the most difficult thing to leave from this cycle. Quote from: Famous Grouse on November 15, 2022, 01:45:26 AMWill the bear take control long-term?It will. There's no reason bearish trend to stay for short term. So many bad things have been making so many people stay away from crypto. The liquidity in the crypto was also become even less than before cuased by so many people rushing to take out their money from the market. That's the main point for bearish trend to stay for long term but none knows that's gonna happen for sure.",

Bitcoin & crypto moves in cycles, we currently, since the inception of bitcoin, move in four year cycles which are around the halving. Sentiment can change a lot & very quickly during the four year cycle but overall it swings from bull to bear market & even has a sustained period of sideways action, low volatility. The best way to win in this game is just to buy & hold for many years. Nobody ever loses money this way in bitcoin. It takes a lot of patience & isn’t much fun but dollar cost averaging over years is fool proof. You will make much more profit this way than in any traditional bank savings or investment vehicle.",

At some point the market will turn to growth. When will that happen? In my opinion, when the Fed announces that it will stop rolling back liquidity or something like that. Without monetary initiatives, the market will not be able to recover. In other words, the crypto winter will last exactly as long as the recession will last.",

While usually, the bullrun will happen 1 year after the BTC halving. So, 2025 is likely to be a bullrun period.The bullrun time seems to happen in less than 4 years. Don't forget that we almost passed the first year of bearish season.However, it is only my prediction based on the previous bearish-bullish seasons. Since crypto market is sometimes unpredictable, the next bullrun may have a different scheme.DWYOR",

Even though that sounds like a bad news if we could make some accumulation for long term holding it could gives so much return eventually. Moreover, honestly bullish run could comes quite literally at every moment so I think even if there's so many things affecting the value of many coins in general, they could still make some recovery even in the middle of the current trend, basically making their own moment of bullish.",

And that's also made the price of bitcoin decline. We've seen it decline rapidly. But the bear market will not last forever because sooner or later, the bull market will come and replace the bear market. And that can help us to be able to see big profits again from many coins because almost all coins, especially potential coins, will start increasing rapidly. If that happens, we will experience a bull market phase and must be prepared to take advantage of that.",
