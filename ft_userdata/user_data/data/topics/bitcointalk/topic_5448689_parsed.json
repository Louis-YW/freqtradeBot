      "body": "As mikeywith said, the risk would be to make some serious damages to your hardware with this strategy.You could power on your ASICs during 3 days per month, you would have the same number of shares submitted, and less risk, less things to do yourself like that.Or you could just mine with 10% of your S19s h24. In general my ASICs need 5-10 minutes to mine at their full potential after I've power them on but it depends of the firmware. Â Sometimes, some pools need some more time to show the shares submitted and the real hashrate you are sending to them. Even if the shares are ok and still accounted, it shows some low values during the first hour.With stock Bitmain firmware it takes a longer time to run stable and at full hashrate, than with Braiinos for example. But Braiinos is stealing 2% (not sure about this number but it's the one I think I remember) of your shares as a dev fee...",

They aren't stealing anything, it's the fees they take for their efforts, it could only be called \"stealing\" if they did not inform you about it beforehand, however, it's clearly stated in multiple places that they do indeed take x% as firmware fee.",
