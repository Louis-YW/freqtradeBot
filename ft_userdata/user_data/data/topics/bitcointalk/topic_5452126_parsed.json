  "content": "I'm looking for the second issue of the Very Much Wow magazine (June 2014) to read electronically on my PC or phone.Here's how it looks like:I've been looking for it all over the web without any success. There was a link on Isssu sometime ago, but the publisher deleted it for some reason. The link was the following: http://issuu.com/verymuchwow/docs/vmw-issue2_junI already own a physical copy of the magazine, so there shouldn't be an issue reading or downloading it online if it's available. Does anyone know where I can find this? Your help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
