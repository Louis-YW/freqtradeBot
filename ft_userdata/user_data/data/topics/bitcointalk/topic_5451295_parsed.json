  "content": "Land Base SlotThis type of slot is perfect if you are searching for a real entertainment since most of physical slot offer a flashy and addictive games. IRL casino typically has a lot of fixed expenses compared to online casino. They need to hire staff, security, electricity for all the machine, flashy lights air conditioning, etc and taxes. This is the reason why the casino usually charge this extra cost on slots RTP since it‚Äôs the most popular game in the casino. RTP can go as low as 75% while the average RTP is +-90% which is far lesser than the online slot games.Based on other user experience, Other casino put a 99% RTP sign on one of the machine to mislead players that all slots have same RTP while in reality its only that single slot have high RTP in the row and the rest has low RTP.Online SlotThis is perfect for gamble that doesn‚Äôt have enough time to go out and play in physical casino due to work and other things. You can experience the vibes of playing slot while using a hand held device. Although physical slot is still the best for gambling experience but still this is good if you are a busy person since the huge win is the main source of entertainment here.Online casino has lesser operating cost since they don‚Äôt have the physical casino. This is why most of the online slots offer high RTP with up to 98% RTP. Online slot can offer high multiplier because they have lesser operational cost and this is their main feature to attract more players since they lack the physical experience. Gambler will not be interested on playing a slot game online if it only promises small grand prize like IRL casino offering.Conclusion: Land based slot is only good to play if you only want to become entertained since their RTP and max payout is ridiculous. Online slot on the other hand offers high return since they have lesser operating cost and high payout is there main attraction. People should stop hitting the land based casino if there main purpose is hitting a jackpot because it‚Äôs really not worth it. Land base slot has a low jackpot prize and you need to bet high amount in able to have a chance to get it while online slot can give you the chance to hit that kind of jackpot with lower bet amount.Reference:https://www.bigwinboard.com/land-based-casinos-vs-online-casinos/https://www.jackpotfinder.com/news/rtp-for-land-based-slot-machines/",

Sometimes he do 100$ per spin and guess what, A win above 1000$ will need the casino staff to manually give the cash prize.

These slots have more physical engagement and great atmosphere of the environment, thus playing just hits differently.Such lowness of land-base slots' RTPs does make sense, as what you said, given the high operating costs. Gladly, there is good news for operators who are looking to cut operational costs ‚Äì a new trend that's worth exploring, migration to online casino business. While online casinos offer convenience and accessibility, many players still longs the unique atmosphere of traditional casinos. Online casinos are convenient, but some people still prefer traditional casinos. Both should continue to exist for different kinds of players to have their preferred option.",

      "body": "+20 years ago we had just a few similar \"fruit\" slots and video poker, at least in my city, and not-so-fancy casinos I use to hang out. With time the choice of available slots was bigger, but except for trying some slots here and there, I didn't play them much. Only with crypto, I discovered online gambling and some awesome providers, and even more awesome slots with crazy bonus rounds. Since that time I didn't step a foot in land-based casino and who knows if I ever will... I simply enjoy online gambling, no hassle with going out, at home I have some peace and quiet, and drinks are cheaper!  I knew that land-based slots have lower RTP, but I never saw the actual numbers... thanks for sharing, another good reason why playing slots is better online.",

      "body": "Not only do the land based slots cost a lot of money to maintain but those costs are obviously going to affect the RTP. Casinos are not going to accept paying for the costs out of their own profits. Obviously the casino is going to use misleading marketing tactics to make both kinds of slots to seem amazingly profitable but that is to be expected. So, I would rather expect the unexpected: When comparing the land based slots and the online one's RTP, I am certain that both are regulated and controlled heavily to ensure fairness but the offline, physical ones are easier to manipulate, I think. You can call me paranoid but I would rather trust slots which are coded and the code can be checked at any time to ensure the fairness and security.You cannot take apart the physical ones to make sure there is no tampering to the RTP, just for a check-up.",

Comparison on which platform would be more addictive is no need to debate. The only thing which would seprate player is convenience in terms of general accessibility of the platform. If you don't have the energy to go to land based casinos for sure you'd be eyeing to online platforms not to mention bigger bonuses with online gambling. While playing on land based casino would give you more entertainment. Both are addictive if I would be asked. Both platforms would as well generate profit if you are lucky at that moment you are playing. RTP on the other hand is a variable players has no control with. RTP would vary not on the game or platform but to the gambling provider.",

They still use electricity for their servers, and also for the games they are offering. They also pay workers too. But just that online casinos see more traffic than land based casinos. It is true that online casinos are for those that are unable to visit land base casino, maybe because of work or other reasons. But in today's world, land based casinos are shrinking while online casinos are increasing. Many people are becoming to prefer staying where they are to just gamble instead of visiting land based casinos. Although I understand what you are saying, it is fun to bet on land based casinos than online casinos.",

Online casinos are also great because it is mobile, hence you can gamble anywhere. Online casino services are also twenty-four hours making them very attractive. Setting up a standard online casino is not cheap because the best technological tools are expensive. Land casinos are mainly patronized by the older generation because most of them are used to the casino and some have refused to embrace change. Land casinos offer physical assistance to the older generation so they like playing offline, unlike online casinos, which have online customer care service that is manned by untrained personnel or even bots. Land casinos could also serve as an avenue for socialization. One can meet friends and acquaintances in land casinos and have a good time with them. if you want to hear the best sports or gambling analysts and forecasters go to a land casino.",

Since there have already been a lot of crimes linked to actual gambling, I believe it is safer to gamble online from the comfort of our homes.",

I don't know what it was, maybe the sound of coins being thrown out by the machine, or the fact that you could buy beer at these joints so they were all sitting there drinking, smoking and pushing buttons for hours. They looked like zombies afterwards and usually had weeks of losing streaks and then 1 win that would make them come back on their feet and there was another week of losing. They never made it out with any significant win, like 2-3x of what they lost. The machines always kept them on edge, so not very deep in debt, but just a little to make them keep playing and drinking there. The RTP is probably why these slot joints are slowly disappearing. Nowadays you can only find drunk and/or poor guys playing there. The rest plays online.",
