Simple, Trust no one here! This is the best method to avoid being scam by scammer here since you have less knowledge. Do your own research by browsing on useful threads hre in the forum before you interact with someone for discussion.During my newbie days, I didn't trust anyone despite I’m doing a p2p trading of altcoins here inthe marketplace section. I use escrow or transact with small amount only to those user that I think as high risk. I grow my knowledge slowly by trading on many user here. There are times that I experienced being scam with small amount but I take that lesson to become more cautious on my next transaction. My experience is much riskier than newbie nowadays since Centralized exchange is now reputable compared to my newbie days.You can use the link I attached for list of good threads here related for security and privacy.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5239098.msg54186093#msg54186093",

My advice to you is to never rush any serious decisions in your life, and investing in crypto is just such a decision.Before thinking about any investment, you have to learn and analyze a lot.Also, you should be aware of your personal situation and accordingly make a clear investment plan, after thoroughly analyzing and researching the market.You must have a clear investment strategy and exit strategy and stick to your plan until the end.",

Some scams are just because someone is greedy and not have knowledge about how scam is and not thinking deeply but only considering the benefits the scammers are using. Example is to pay an amount of money to receive double in just a day, or to receive 10 times more in a month. You do not have to do research before you should know that such is a scam, but some people are just ignorant until they are scammed.But in order to avoid scam, you need to make research about it because scammers are advanced than each other. That Coin_trader link would help you to know how to protect yourself from scammers and hackers.",

Do trust anyone in this forum who doesn't have a reputation. Check their trust feedback page. Still, If you want to make any deal with forum members, Use an escrow service. If they do not agree to use Escrow service, you can assume they are potential Scammer.Now, Let's talk about outside forum scams. This also belongs to the forum as well. If you see some attractive offer, Do not fall for it. Do research. If you see someone Selling a Miner for $2000, but the current market price is over $3000. This is maybe a potential scam attempt. Do not trust Ponzi schemes. Every Ponzi schemes are scam. Do not trust Cloud Minings. Do not trust Bitcoin or whatever doubler website. Do not pay upfront. Do not invest in Shitcoin ICOs/IDOs. Not sure what else I can say. That's all I have in my mind.",

Just because you read something here or someone recommended something or someone doesn't mean that is fact or the best option for you. By carefully considering who you trade with and always using the escrow service in Marketplace, your risk can be greatly reduced. In the end, you have to find a method that works for you. There are plenty of ways to protect yourself from scams out there, but keep in mind that scammers have come up with increasingly elaborate schemes to get your money. Don't fall for it.",

Data, personal info and funds have never been safe with them, and isn't still safe with them right now. Hacks still happen and centralized exchanges are still going bankrupt with many people losing all their money they kept with them and their private data is also published to the public. We may think this or that centralized exchange is reputable until something goes quickly wrong, and their users now have to worry not only about their lost funds, but their safety because their personal data could then be in the hands of anyone.",
