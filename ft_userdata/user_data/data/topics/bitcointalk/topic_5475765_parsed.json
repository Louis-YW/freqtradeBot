      "body": "The fees are a bit high compared to other cards but - How much are the daily usage or withdrawal limits, and can you refill the card or does it come with a fixed balance? - Are you sure that there are no restrictions on use, whether restrictions on location or services, such as not being accepted in some services?I did not find any legal data on the site. There is no mention of the registration number, the company that issues the cards, or the money-back guarantee or these cards are legal and not stolen.BTW YOUR WEBSITE ---> https://adsplus.partners/QuoteExpires On2024-11-24Registered On2023-11-24Updated On2023-11-24hhmmmm",

      "body": "Your fees are way too high. You won't manage to beat the competition with that kind of fee. $20 for card production and then another 5% deduction on each deposit, not forgetting  $5 monthly charge… damn!We don't know if you might charge transaction fees tooAlso, you talk of no KYC but this talks of countering money laundering. How are you going to do that without KYCing your clients or do you plan to ambush them?",

How are you going to do that without KYCing your clients or do you plan to ambush them?Good point. I was looking for terms of use and did not find them.I quote this part from it:QuoteWhen joining the Foundation's Partner Program, the User is obliged to provide all necessary, truthfuldata. data.3.6. The Foundation may request that the User provide documents and information necessary for thepurpose of running the Partner Program, fulfilling obligations related to counteracting moneylaundering and terrorism financing, and verifying the User's identityThe registration data indicates that you are from Poland, and therefore there is a regulatory framework to which the service will be subject, and you mentioned that in the text here.So your statement that No KYC Crypto Debit Cards is a lie.",

      "body": "I could be wrong, but I think that this is just one more service that uses AlchemyPay system, but they are charging much higher fees, $20 for card issuance and 5% charge on deposits.They have similar interface and they the same cards like other services, but ADS Plus is asking for phone number and other personal details!I would be very careful with this service.",

I will choose to go with negative trust. @OP has edited the post without adding any details, without respecting the questions that were asked and trying to hide parts of the topic. All of these behaviors belong to someone who is not trustworthy.He seems to have learned from the comments here to scam others on other platforms.",
