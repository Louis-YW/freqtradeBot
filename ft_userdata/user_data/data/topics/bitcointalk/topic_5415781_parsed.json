  "content": "For long I read bitcoin isn't environment friendly and the cost of bitcoin mining is exorbitant. This is the main reason why many organisations and governments are criticizing bitcoin.However i feel defferent.I feel bitcoin can become a great tool of creating a much cleaner and greener environment. We should come together and work to create a better future world.Most of the cities around the globe produce tons of waste and that waste end up in landfills, garbage hills, drains and so on.Civic bodies don't really have capability, resources or even will to address these problems.I feel if we allow bitcoiners to set biodegradation plants  for waste treatment. Such plants which decompose these waste and generate bio-gases like methane and other which can inturn generate electricity sufficient for running their bitcoin grids.This will be a win win situation for all.There will be cheap electricity for bitcoin mining , there will be biodegradation of waste as needed by civic bodies.There will be greener and cleaner environment.Overtime  an international  network or a global bitcoin grid, where citizens can invest for creating waste biodegradation plants and the bitcoin mined will be their reward in proportion to their investments.I think bitcoin is an opportunity to bring together world and achieve the mammoth goals of environmental protection, poverty eradication and bringing prosperity and equality in world.Please express your thoughts on this.",

That being said, at $400-2k a miner and $3-6k a wind turbine to power it there's probably a reason there aren't that many people doing it. I believe it's not only about cheap electricity.. it's also more about creating a sustainable system.A system which can address not only out current waste management and energy needs but future needs as well.Tons of waste end up in sea, microplastics have already made their way to human fetus.My point is if make our waste useful, we will have a sustainable and clean future and bitcoin can be a great tool to do thatQuote from: Mate2237 on October 03, 2022, 02:10:06 PMThere are some questions or threads we see here mables me.

I am a biological scientist maybe i don't understand bitcoin as good as many here, but i understand 2 things. The biggest challenges of our generation is environmental issues and much of it is human waste and emmisions.Currently there is no real rewards for waste management and and secondly bitcoin mining..( not trading or transaction)needs lot of energy.  If we can club them together can't we mine bitcoin using otherwise useless waste..Thankyou[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If they can reduce waste while producing usable energy or electricity which can be sold at a profit, then why do we not have more of them already? Why would sticking a bitcoin mining operation on the side make any difference?",

Mining is an expensive process and big miner farms use a big amount of electricity and when you put it all on paper - Bitcoin uses as much as electricity as some countries, at least that what most articles about this matter claim. I think it's more of a negative comment on Bitcoin than an actual worry about the environment since there are much bigger threats (as you have mentioned) to it than just Bitcoin and they haven't been questioned for a long time now because it isn't anything new, but Bitcoin is.",

The idea you outlined is great, although its implementation would require shaving tons of resources from these mining firms. Perhaps some of them can start a movement, but I doubt that they'll ever do that. Recycling waste and turning it into energy is a good thing, but would the energy generated be worth the hassle anyway? Would it remove their 100% dependency on the grid? I don't think so.",

People don't need those, they use lots of power. Why not computers in general? Or Ford motor company, or air conditioning, etc. To single out bitcoin seems strange. Lots of stuff uses lots of power, and yet this one thing is singled out. I think it has more to do with the traditional banking system putting out negative stuff about crypto, although I don't know how I would prove such a thing. But, many media outlets are owned by just a handful of people. Technology in general is creating more electricity demand. Look at the insane policy in California, where they want all cars to be electric? But where will this electricity come from? They already have rolling blackouts in the summer. The electricity prices, already some of the most expensive in the world, will become even worse. But that's just an example. In general tech will require more energy, so I think we need better ways of making that energy. In the usa we still use some pretty old school stuff like coal power. Time to invest in new power, rather than attacking a particular technology.",

Bitcoin is always a suspect when it comes to global warming.Cleaning the environment from waste pollution is not the task of bitcoin, it is not completely related because bitcoin only uses a few percent of energy.
