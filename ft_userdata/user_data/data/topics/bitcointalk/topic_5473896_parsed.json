I’m looking at the second chart where India seems to have lot of wealth until the mid-years when they came and looted it inside out until slavery became thing of daily routine.  Wel it seems they are back on track after that loot. They say what goes around comes around, that’s best example. By the way you made a point about bitcoin and its importance in the future. I am not sure how strong bitcoin would go but it’s definitely gonna last for very long, but not sure if economist would be able to plot a graph of 2000 years. Bitcoin will only hold importance for us, the decentralised lovers.",

Because in over 500 years alone which is shown in that chart, they all didn't rise. in the 1500s, it was the start of the fall of China's wealth and dominance and was also the rise of the UK.Economies rise and fall just as the major powers. Some fall already in a short period of time not even getting to the top. In the 1500s, the rivals were Spain, France, and UK. And China at that time was already on the decline and it was always technological advancement and major wars that brought down major powers regardless of the wealth growth. It's just unbelievable to see China rise again to 86% since 2010.",

Bitcoin will only hold importance for us, the decentralised lovers. You are right, the point he mentioned is a good one but the GDP of the USA or of any country listed on the graph can increase if they leverage the BTC technology, but BTC technology doesn't play the important role of increasing the GDP solely, there are other factors too which increase GDP.But I have seen that, the USA never left any earning opportunity whether it's about Oil, Gold, or any other valuable assets they have done everything possible to achieve that thing like (well, I think I should not mention the examples, as many might not like it). It's not that I a against the USA or anything like that <-- just clearing the doubts.Actually, I don't like their ways, overall we all have our own opinions and IMHO USA is going fast but China is giving solid competition too, After 2000 the era of technology started and I can say that till 3000 this era will be the main character to increase or decrease the GDP of countries.",

IMO a more interesting chart was the other one that you didn't post. Pretty sure that's what they meant but whatever, these countries have been going on since the antiquity only to be conquered under a single banner, and then from there be emancipated once again, just like what happened to Turkey which was once a nomadic state before being fought over by the Seljuk and the Ottoman empire, so the validity of this chart at some point is still high. In any case, this pretty much shows how cyclical the power is when it comes to these countries. US for one have been in the top of the game for decades with historic lows every now and again. China has been steadily increasing in GDP but with what's going on in their internal economy I doubt they could hold this setup for long.",

You chart alone explains it all that there were other world powers with significant GDP in those present time's but  were of course later succeeded by another nation sliding down to the USA. What makes you think the slide can't be conceivable in our generation.There has been larger empires before the USA  yet power changed hand. Centuries previous the contention was predominantly for geographical occupation, in the 20th & 21s  century it's about nuclear power making any \"change\" a critical one the world have never experienced.

That empire included large areas and Asia, including the entire Arabian Peninsula, parts of the Sassanian Empire (currently Persians or Iran), all of North Africa (today's Maghreb), and parts of the Balkans.I support Pooya's observation that these charts cannot be accurate if they include a historical period dating back 2000 years.

Only in 1721 after weakening and loss of authority Moscow ulus and Moscovia became independent formation. The name \"Russia\" has been \"invented\" by Peter 1, together with borrowing of idea of the state flag.  Many years, after Moscovia was invented the name \"Russia\". this country was then ruled for many decades by German appointees. Under whose rule Muscovy captured and enslaved many peoples. Which then turned into the republics of the USSR. And which at the collapse of this lousy country, gladly threw off the shackles of Kremlin power.Just a history, since the clarifications about the countries went PS I highly recommend to read the history of origin of the name \"Russia\"!
