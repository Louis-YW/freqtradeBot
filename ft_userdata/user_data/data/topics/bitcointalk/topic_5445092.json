Usually, the first thing is altcoins will get big pumps, while bitcoin has increased but not too significantly. But it is also possible that the bitcoin price will increase first to a certain level then the altcoin season will come and make many coins experience a price increase.It looks like the bull market is getting close because the price of bitcoin has started to get a price reversal which is indicated by an increase from the previous lowest price. But it seems we still have to wait some more because the bitcoin price is far from the previous ATH and needs to break every high.",

It's only a matter of time until we learn enough from the lessons.Correct, there are instances in which the price can move up really quickly, but we know this is the result of FOMO and such a movement cannot last for long.The halving so far has been the main signal that tells us a bull market is forming, this does not mean the price will move up the very next day, but as miners get less bitcoin for each block then they need to sell for a higher price to remain profitable and this drives the price of bitcoin upward.",

Bitcoin's recent rally has been a leading indicator that the bear market has ended and a new bull market has begun;2. There are several top 10 cryptocurrencies that could potentially lead to the next bull market;3. The last one, I think, is the most awaited moment, namely the Halving Bitcoin which will come in 2024, which is expected to be a catalyst for the next bull market.To be \"ready\" for the next bull market or any market for that matter I haven't made any investment decisions yet.",

I believe that's always better than a unrealistic bull run and a collapse afterwards. I would guess that the reason why the traditional markets go up or down matters to crypto as well. When it was a global pandemic and printing of a lot of money that was a good thing for stock owners and the bitcoin owners because fiat going down in value means these assets would go up in value.However when it is a stock market crash, like what is happening right now to the banks, that means crypto would go up since it's not having a crash like stocks. This is why it's quite important to remember that you should be having a bit of a good result in the end and have some sort of big profit depending on why the traditional markets move, not which direction but why.",

Actually am not so sure if we are already in the bull run but there is no question that there has been a surge for the past many days and that can be good. However, the surge can be due to the downfall of some regional banks in USA which lead to many to question the viability of the banking and financial system of the country. Now, we have to remember that eventually the banking system will recover as this is not 2008 again. The government is doing all it can with its muscle to contain any possible contagion. Now, the question is: Once the dust settles...will cryptocurrencies also go back to where they were before this problem?",
