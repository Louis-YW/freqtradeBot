Crypto is banned in your country, but why are you talking about it if it is totally banned? See how China banned bitcoin several times but it turned out that their citizens can still hold bitcoin as property, bitcoin is hard to ban.",

Im just curious that they banned bitcoin inspite of heavily adoption going on. You could still teach them anyway, maybe the ban isnt forever and your government will realize later on that its still worth to utilize blockchain for finance and payment protocols.",

Do you think you can get in trouble knowing that idea? Would you want to bear that with your children? I don't think it's a good idea knowing that it's banned. Yes, you can educate them about it, but when you are talking about the legality and how it would work, it's definitely going to be a battle.

Should we educate young children about Bitcoin or introduce them to Bitcoin?If the children in your family have started to be interested in Bitcoin and their age has started to move into the teenage category. So it won't be wrong if you want to teach these kids about Bitcoin as long as they can take very good care of themselves for things that don't need to be spit out to other kids around them. After all, they also won't be guilty after learning about cryptocurrency and Bitcoin from you as long as they can use that knowledge in a better way.QuoteMoreover, another important thing is that in my country cryptocurrency i.e. Bitcoin is a completely government banned currency. So should we teach our children about the banned currency?This is something that everyone needs to understand and understand because it is clear that not all countries have legalized cryptocurrency and Bitcoin as a means of payment. However, this is not a barrier for any teenager who wants to learn more about Bitcoin because they need to know new things that can change them for the better in the future. For countries that haven't legalized this, I think it's only hindered by rules made by the government and you yourself know how to use Bitcoin so it doesn't conflict with state rules.QuoteMoreover, as time progresses, the interest of children towards Bitcoin is increasing day by day.  Would it be reasonable to keep young children away from Bitcoin in the context of my country?Actually that is a very good thing because they themselves already have an interest without being forced by other people or you. So that you yourself will find it easier to teach them gradually and in my opinion that is a very reasonable thing because they have their own desire to know. So there's no need to worry about teaching them about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as long as it's within the scope of your own family.",

QuoteBut the problem is that my family's younger children all study in primary label. Should we educate young children about Bitcoin or introduce them to Bitcoin?There is nothing wrong with learning about Bitcoin and gaining knowledge about Bitcoin. But if it interferes with their obligatory subjects, it is better not to involve them in them for the time being.But if learning about Bitcoin doesn't have any negative effect on their primary level education then you can definitely tell them about Bitcoin.  Because they are still children, it is important for them to get a minimum education before researching BitcoinQuoteMoreover, another important thing is that in my country cryptocurrency i.e. Bitcoin is a completely government banned currency. So should we teach our children about the banned currency?I don't know what country you live in but if Bitcoin is banned by the government in your generation because your sons and daughters are too young.  So it's true that in their generation bitcoin will play a big role in worldwide  and  Bitcoin will be used as a legal currency all over the world including your country.",

This constitutes a potential risk if there is any penalty for circumventing the ban (or even from a simple security point of view), since kids tend to be rather loud mouths (i.e. my father does this or that, has this or that).",

Why ? You said that you and your family secretly involve yourselves into bitcoin because it is banned to your country. Don't you think that your family has taken enough risk to break the law,which will be a big problem if caught. Secondly, you want to involve children who can't keep secretes because of the anxiety that they have learnt something new and might tell their friends outside your house and from there,the government might be aware of the cryptocurrency activities going on secretly in your house. We should obey government laws and teach our children to do the same and not to teach them to go against the law. If they are adult and feel that they are big enough to make their decisions, its left for them to obey the law or not. Assuming btc is legal in your country, I would have say that you should teach them with videos from YouTube to make it more interesting and easy to understand.",
