I mean sometimes in games that I fully understand ? i use my own interpretation of Odds , and not even seeking for contribution where and when to bet .But in other time that I am interesting to bet but does not have a complete understanding of the game? then I visit some groups or ask some friends if whos team/player is best to be part of.",

I am also fond of checking reddit every now and then for sports betting tips and some online predictions hub to learn more info that I may have missed in getting my picks. I don't follow blindly, and obviously don't fall into herd mentality, but I do use what I gained from them in order to make my own path. You can say that I'm a mix of both, though with a much more leaning towards being a lone sports bettor.

They're just a source of info so to speak. I think it counts if it leads to you locking bets because you and your mates have discussed the sport. But if it's just a simple discussion then it's just another get together or just one of those conversations that you may have with your friends.",

I don't see something wrong with it though, it's better if you will do your own analysis and if you follow the sports that you have been betting then for me you are most likely the experts, more that this so called tipster.",

I enjoy them both to be honest but I just play the same sports as with NBA so maybe that is why. When it comes on winning bets in sportsbetting, I guess it is harder to predict a winning bet on lone sports such as with UFC and boxing because anything could happen in an instant. There are no underdogs and such 'coz fighter perform differently on every match. Unlike with team sports wherein most of the time (not always) dominant teams are constant with winning over other teams which makes it, I guess, easier to win on.",
