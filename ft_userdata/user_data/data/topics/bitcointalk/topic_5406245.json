This smells very fishy...",

Why would he send you a screenshot? This nice guy wants to exchange his BTC for ETH and pay you 20% because he is afraid of these exchanges. He could lose his entire fortune, which is why he wants to trade it in for just 20% off. Be thankful that people like this still exist. I would love to help him, but unfortunately I don’t have any BTC or ETH at the moment, only UST",

Funny that even in a feedback you have to make up a story, just like in your scams attempts on this forum. Please share a screenshot of a PM I ever sent you, haha.\"Between the vulgar PMs and many public meltdowns when someone disagrees with him or points out an obvious flaw in his logic, this user appears mentally unstable and someone I would recommend avoiding doing any sort of business with.\"Read your own posts over and over again.
