By the way, investing in bitcoin depends on how much money you have available to risk and can afford to lose. Some people are happy to own just a small amount of Bitcoin and some others aim to own a larger amount. It's really up to you to decide what's best for your own situation. If you can afford more than that, then you should go for it.",

At the moment, I don't possess a satisfactory amount of Bitcoin from my perspective, which would be 1 Bitcoin, but I have a strong desire to acquire it soon. As soon as I accumulate enough funds, I will make the purchase and add it to my wallet. I will feel satisfied and secure once I have this goal amount of Bitcoin.",

So the vast majority of people in the world have zero Bitcoin, and even those who have very modest amounts are in this small minority of less than 3%. And I'm sure that out of those who have some BTC, the majority don't have as mush as 0.1, so yeah, it's already an extraordinary amount by all reasonable calculations. When spending a lot of time on this forum, the bubble of people who largely own Bitcoin and care about it can be misleading, as it might seem that most people own BTC and many own big amounts.",

I thought you would elaborate on what you meant by ordinary people. Does ordinary people mean non celebrities or or it means low class person?Even some non-celebrities and low-class persons own more bitcoins than the celebrities and high-class people because they have chosen to invest in bitcoins strategically, and by use of their strategy, they have been able to gather bitcoins in small quantities over a period that is now accumulating to something big, and more than what a celebrity who has not invested in bitcoin has. It is a level playing field in bitcoins, there is opportunity for everyone which is not defined by your financial level before investing. If you earn little and is able to still find a way to invest well in bitcoins, you will profit better from it than a rich person who has not invested or invested well enough in bitcoins.",

So ordinary people prefer to cultivate as much fiat as possible and that for them is the easiest way to solve all their needs. However, globally, if averaged out from the total human population on earth, they have at least 0.02 Btc, making them one of the rarest people. That was my spontaneous assumption and could be said to be an example of how to illustrate to ordinary people that they must have Bitcoin in their wallet.",

I'm sure they mostly will say no because they're really don't have it, most people don't really care with privacy, so it's safe for them to only say yes or no, than answer how much they have.Quote from: puradak on November 12, 2023, 07:54:27 AMWould it be a satisfactory quantity if I had 0.1?Base on statistic, if you had 0.1 BTC it means you've joined the top 10% in BTC.",

If you are satisfied with it, then that is your goal for investing with that amount of Bitcoin. Everyone probably has different satisfaction levels when it comes to investment, but I think having 1 BTC is quite significant. For the average investor, holding it for the long term could bring happiness. One day, if Bitcoin reaches $1 million per coin, you'll be a millionaire at that time.",

From my own understanding of what you meant, the ordinary people should be those who are just able to afford to invest in Bitcoin. Just as we know, Bitcoin investment is not restricted to anyone. But there are even more richer investors in Bitcoin and a lot of persons will say Bitcoin investment is much profitable for the rich. 0.1 for many of us here is a huge amount. But that won't be our satisfactory quantity. The idea is to accumulate as many Bitcoin as you can and while you still can.",

Many definitely want to hoard Bitcoin but the quantity they get can be somewhat discouraging (for some people, not me). There's no specific amount one should have, and there is no satisfactory amount. Every amount is valid starting from the smallest bit (0.00000001 BTC), so just have what you can.",

Bitcoin is the future and it'll be great if we can accumulate as many as we can get our hands on but you shouldn't invest more than you'll be willing to hodl when the market is experiencing a correction as when you invest more than you'll be comfortable losing, you won't be at peace with yourself when the market is declining and that can influence your reaction by selling too early and miss out on the gains you would have gotten if you were patient and held through the corrections. QuoteHow many bitcoins do ordinary people have?We have more people having none than people having the least 1 sat. We're still early in the adoption of Bitcoin so many peoples don't know about Bitcoin yet or they do but don't believe there's any future for the currency. Some know about Bitcoin but consider it a scam due to the way Bitcoin is been presented by their government and other critics. Don't let the percentage of people having Bitcoin or not having Bitcoin determine if you'll Invest into Bitcoin or buy more. Use every opportunity you have to accumulate Bitcoin but while doing that don't invest an amount that'll make it difficult for you to hold and always reverse fiats for emergency and other expenses.",
