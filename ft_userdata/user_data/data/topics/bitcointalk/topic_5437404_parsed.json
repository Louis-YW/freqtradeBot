There is no one shoe fits all. How about Reddit, Slack, or forums like bitcointalk?",

That's currently good, right? Or have i missed some news? Anyway, i technically enjoy telegram and it's sleek and very irc-like. But it suits better for smaller groups. Soon those groups often blow up and get too confusing and big to moderate. Binance telegram is a good example of confusing and too hectic telegram group. They are too hard to follow or moderate.I personally haven't found a better free place for community to talk then Discord. You can compartmentalize conversations and organize information easily. It's already widely adopted so you don't need people to install yet another program to chat with each other. Important links, news and everything else stays neatly organized and i don't know if any free program even does such a good job at creating communities.",

There are trusted service providers through telegram groups and YouTube. I've been following few YouTube channels and have seperate telegram group connected to the channel for discussion. This makes way for discussion based on the contents broadcasted.",

Yes I've read of those. Some people did lose money on that which is why I understand your concern. The problem is that those scam links are present in almost every social media platform. Scammers can slide into your DMs or in a chat group.Maybe check out Slack as well.",

Specifically in regard to the communities, if the participant is wary and has discomfort toward any particular application, then simply raises a new issue to migrate into something better. One of the alternatives I know is Matrix. So, it is up to the community whether it is worth it to migrate or not.",

The most valued are community built around specific topics such as game communities and tech communities. I have found that the most engaging platforms are those that allow for both real-time and asynchronous communication, such as Discord and Reddit. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are great for building brand awareness and reaching a wide range of people.",

That's why if you want to grow your community, you need to be genuine with what you're trying to do with your community.It's not just all about the platform or whatnot but it's about the community that you're building because if you become establish, you can simply just go anywhere and your community is going to come with you.",

Definitely not Discord. Twitter is now number one in terms of project promotion. Many people analyze projects based on Twitter and its statistics regarding followers and mentions. At the same time, most of the popular chats on cryptocurrencies in telegram and it is convenient to communicate there, there are no restrictions, like, for example, in twitter. Telegram began to actively implement innovations that will also affect the growth of the number of crypto users, such as the creation of separate chats within telegram groups.",
