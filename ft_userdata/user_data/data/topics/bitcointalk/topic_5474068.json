  "content": "One of the most difficult parts of any journey in life is the ability to decide to \"start\" doing something. So many people have great ideas and plans but they never execute a bit of them because it all ends just in the mind but they cannot bring it out to becoming a reality. If you're able to overcome this stage, you then realize you wasted a lot of time waiting for the perfect time to start and that it isn't all that difficult after all. The next huddle is now on how to continue doing what is expected of you for a long time. You might get bored along the way, results might not be coming In as planned and you might start losing interest in what you so longed for. sometimes you might feel that you overhyped the stuff (just know that familiarity is what is speaking in your mind). For some, because you've been in the system for a long time, you might be tempted to feel too comfortable and the initial energy you had put into your work at the onset will gradually die off and you might not see any reason why you should develop yourself to becoming better.If you read through this, you might find this applicable to our journey in the forum. Some of us begged our friend to introduce us to the forum and when we came in, at the onset, our energy was high and we actively participated in the activities in the forum and made sure we followed the rules in the forum and ensured that we are practicing all the guide we receive from the forum But after some time, the energy dies down and the quality of our threads and replies starts dropping. It becomes very boring reading for the sake of knowledge and for some that have discovered the importance of merits, they might just go after merits rather than the knowledge that initially brought them to the forum.I created this just to encourage myself and as many as will find this useful, to keep following the right part, keep learning, practice the little you've learned, and don't wait until you know everything about Bitcoin before you start applying the knowledge you've received. The process might get boring especially when you aren't getting the needed result but just keep trying and moving forward taking a step at a time.",

The phobia to fail in the in the midst of concomitant thoughts ringing in the head that you can't do it, you may not succeed, those voices are there to make us believe we are less of what we are.And this is not just about the forum but life in general there are achievements we dare to achieve but we somehow grow a low self-esteem feeling making us look unworthy of that which we strive to achieve. Moreso, a lot of us are afraid of challenges forgetting that they are there to make us stronger and better in each we conquer along the way. And time is of the essence, whatever you fail to do today you may never have the chance to do it maybe after learning how it could have created a positive impact for you life.",

Focusing on the aim is the best, when you do that and contribute back to the forum, your rise in the forum will become more imminent because you’ll be appreciated with words of encouragement and merits. If you get both, you’re super good and if you get any one of the two, you should continue to strive for more and become a better version of yourself in the forum.

Here in this forum and life in general I know there is no time but everything has time. If anyone is not getting any of the rewards mention by OP at this time should not worry about it. In a personal level I just read alot and contribute where I know I'm making sense. I don't strive for merit or to rank up I just focused on knowledge, I read people like JJG's thread and many others who are impactful and shape myself to impact on people not just being a regular person here. I believe making impact is the real success if you do something very well and your known for it the journey here in this forum won't stress you. Do something different and focus on knowing more that you speak, i also discovered that most of us new here try to teach when we should learn and that is where we face challenges. You may be making merit and ranking up but at the same time you may not be making any sense. Infact just do what you know how to do best. If I keep writing I might end up writing more than a thousand words because I have more to say but let's cut the grab. Be a positive vibe ~MAKEIMPACT~",

Isn't important for me IMO to become better, joining in a healthy discussion and share ideas is an ideal and a good start here in the forum.Forget greediness because that will put us down.",

You will see that some have all the money they need to get started about life, some of them half little and some have nothing at all but for those that have nothing and later have something in the future all plan along despite not having all, crypto is the same about that too.Some people want to have bitcoin like some of this influencers when they are showing off, I'm not even motivated about them. My own is to have the amount I can afford and if time permit, I can buy more as it goes up and may not but the main thing is you should be able to buy something when you have nothing, even for those who don't understand crypto, they need to start from somewhere and with time, things will improve.",

The next huddle is now on how to continue doing what is expected of you for a long time.

Diminishing return occurs in every aspect of life. And one catalyst to it is slow results. Most people who lose their momentum in the forum had lesser results, for reasons best known to them, especially members seeking to rank easily. When the ranking don't  quickly show up they'll definitely stop posting since it seems like their efforts are not being rewarded. It's similar to building a site and having no traffic to attend to, the webmaster won't stick around any longer. Most people here got to the point they're today; in rank. Because, the quality posts they made got merited by other members. It pushes them further to do better and present more quality contents. It's normal to have such a reaction as humans. Staying in a system for a long time can be tiring, that's why people move on to find other things doing. Paving way for new bloods or talents to replace them in providing quality. The journey is never easy. Newbies shouldn't stop showing up on daily basis. The more they're seen the better their visibility. Thereby, creating a rapport amongst other members who wouldn't hesitate to reward their consistent effort in making the forum a clean place. And helping in providing quality, over making spam responses and threads. Every thing requires time and the better we acknowledge this, the more we'll gain knowledge and dig further to find the interesting parts or aspect of the work we've found ourselves into. For instance, reading about bitcoin opens our mind to the greater possibilities behind bitcoin. And presents to us more ideas of what we can do with bitcoin to generate income. Other than that, we can also generate enough connections through the bitcoin community at large. I must commend the OP for crafting out this interesting thread. Keep it up!",

      "body": "Like the saying says \"a journey of a thousand miles start with just a step\" that step has been the night mare of many people as they think what will befall them if they adjust from their comfort zone while facing the reality of life. Many have been afraid as a result of their predicament and the challenges they have been through. Some are just bothered  of the uncertainties of life while some are just too naive to take a step forward. Some to are just waiting to see who could push them forward as a means of aspiration or support to getting there in life. All still points down to the growing process in life which one must be able to encounter and overcome so as to stand firm and standout amongst the masses. At this point, what most people need is good cheers and encouragement to standout. So if you are in the position to do that better still help because people are really putting efforts to take that step  but what is holding them back is what they can not comprehend.",
