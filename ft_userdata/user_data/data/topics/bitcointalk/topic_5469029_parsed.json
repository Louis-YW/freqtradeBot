  "content": "The way hunger dy land don double, price of rice is now worth more than the minimum wage of the country and people they really suffer, and by suffer I mean things they very hard because since in the past administration, we don dy complain say things don hard but as e be now, e be like say past government that we thought was bad is now fair as compare to wetin this government don showed us under 6 months wey dem don do for office.This suffering reach everybody including people wey gather before, no citizens is left on this. Wetin I wan share with una be say na him be how we go take cope with wetin economy don be. As we fight back the government to make things better, we self go make sure say we get energy, dy Kampe ready for them because na who dy alive na him see tomorrow.How can we adjust as a citizen of this country, here are my takes:Go for quality and less cost products: The advantage of this is that it keeps you within your financial budget and the best way to go about this is to make a scale of preference when you want to buy something, make a list about quality products you want to buy and go for the one that is cheap in price. For instance, we know that the when it comes to electronic product, LG and Samsung product are very cost in this our country but there are more even high quality brand but because we always care about buying higher brand, we don't patronize the other brands. If you give some other products a trial, you will forget to use those most sort out brands, same with food products and other things we use at home.Make you double your husle: Things no funny, I think practically everything wey dy this our country don double for price and if you must survive this and want to stay ahead of this prices, you need to also double your income. If you dy rely on source of income for this naija, e no go take you far, you need to look into other place to be able to overcome this cost of living.Buy your food items in bulk and cook for yourself: Food vendors wey I know almost all of them has increased the price menu list of their kitchen and the other ones wey never increase has reduce the quantity of their food, so buying food now sef dy expensive and the only way to balance well for this time of economy na make you dy cook your self. Even if u no sabi, start am one day, you go improve with time and YouTube sef dy or make you invite your friends or babe to arrange am for you. You can buy food once in a while and be doing the cooking most of the time, this way, you go fit dy save money.Make use of public Transport: This one na for them ogas wey get Car, to fuel car now to go out is now like buying a goat to slaughter especially people that are use to fueling tanks and others that use high end engine that consume a lot of fuel, the only way to cut down expenses is to go for commercial or public transport which are cheaper compare to fueling a complete car.Keep your savings off Naira: We want to help the economy by keeping our life savings in our local currency but it has been unstable for a while and as price of things increase, the purchasing power is coming down everyday; instead of keeping your money in Naira, convert them to foreign currency like dollar instead of leaving them idle. It's better they are converted and appreciate in value than doing nothing or decline further.Above all, make sure you take care of your health, there is hard times for everyone because of bad governance but na our responsibility to stay health to see another bright day.",

I no see reason to dey cry and blame the government all the time when we fit apply wisdom to take survive, the way the country dey go even me sef no understand but, we fit dey help our self with all this kind of idea to take survive for this economy.I for like add to watin you don put for ground to help us survive for this our economy situation Buying from 4-6pm for market: though some persons go think am say na left over from watin other people don select for market go remain by that time of the market period but, trust me if u go market by that time you go still see product dem wey dey in good conditions. Normally thing for market around this period dey cheap pass for afternoon Because many marketers dey rush to close and dem no go like to carry any product go back house.NOTE this logic dey mostly work for clothes and perishable product like pepper, okro, meat, fish, tomatoes etc.Small farm: just as our forma presido been dey talk say make we go into farming, no be bad idea be that oo, u fit get small farm for ur back yard wey go relief u the stress of buying some kind things for market, and u fit sell some if u like to make extra money, so some kind farm wey u fit do for ur backyard wey nor need too much space na:Pepper farmOkro farmWater leafOrgu leaf (aka fluted pumpkin)Cent leafBitter leaf etcAll this farm go make u spend less when you go market to buy food stuff.",

To survive for this contri no go only take these measures you outline because you fit dey hustle pure but if you no get self control, all go be waste.Â QuoteGo for quality and less cost products This one you mention get small comma sins as contri don hard, in order for sellers to meet up, them dey introduce fake things and while others dey kind to point out say nah fake some no go tell you nai make I buy into the idea of @Makus wey suggest the idea of getting a small farm to plant. This go go a long way because wen things begin scarce for market, you no go dey forced to buy at a huge price for market when you go get am for you garden.",

      "body": "Di situation of Nigeria, now no be joke, our currency just de devalue everyday. Di purchasing power of naira don reduce drastically, even di salary wey government just increase sef no help matter, because di extra money no fit make any impact for di lives of di recipients. So di matter now be say everybody wey de Nigeria, suppose plan dem personal income by cutting cost of expenditure, because if you de spend according to your income, di way wey you de spend before, you fit run into dept.As e be for di economy now, e go help if people get alternative sources of income, because di income wey dem de get every month, no go fit carry di purchasing power again. Who get savings fit to invest am instead to leave am inside bank, examples na to invest in bitcoin, just get di wallet, hold some coins inside, if e appreciate you fit sell di profit and leave di capita there. You fit learn one skill join di one wey you get, like tailoring, berbing, plumbing, electrician, cable installer. I get many young guys for my area wey de into online marketing, website and artistic designs for computer and internet. Person fit start any of dis works on a part-time basis, to escape poverty for di country. Even as Macus, talk, if person get land for di back of im house, im fit plant things wey go grow and im go consume and even sell some wen em harvest di crop, dat na alternative source of income too.",

It's better they are converted and appreciate in value than doing nothing or decline further.Having dollar does not mean your money appreciates in value, but just that dollar did not depreciate like naira. Fiat generally are depreciating assets in design. The government created fiat from tin air, make it valuable and controlling the value towards the depreciation direction in the name of inflation. Although, we understand, for economy not to collapse, there must be inflation.In time like this, holding bitcoin is better. Bitcoin is a store of value over a long period of time. But fiat is not a store of value. All of them including dollar, sterling and euro, they are not store of value.You can also buy land and properties which are investment.",

Because of the incessant increments of goods and commodity, it has even made it more complex for the common man.To navigate through life this period requires versatility like you need to be skilled in different things so that if one side isn't working then you turn to the other skill you have. Gone are the days when we depend on only one skill or profession although our lifetime. These modern days now require to be skilled in different areas of life before success can be achieved.Again like a saying that goes \"cut your coat according to your size\". Don't involve yourself in an extravagant lifestyle that will drain up your income. Don't buy things that you don't need at this particular time. Then emulate a saving lifestyle as it is gonna aid you during hard times when maybe you don't get jobs or your income is coming is less quantity.Also reduce your liability, like don't get involved in things that won't earn you income and don't except responsibility that are more than you. Furthermore, give birth to less children as these will lesson your expenses and will even aid you to take care of the ones you already have properly.",

But I would like to add something for that side way you talk say make we save our savings for dollar, me for like add say make we divide our savings into two part, one part you fit dy save with dollar make that one help you control inflation so that anything you want use am do anytime e go correlate with way tin price go be for market, and the second one make we save for Naira too because na Naira we dey spend for this our contri, you fit just wake up one day say no means to convert usdt to Naira. Make we get alternatives for savings too.",

      "body": "Due to the economic hardship in the country, I will advise that the fast and immediate means of getting money now is transportation business. Irrespective of the hike in petroleum pump price, I still think that transportation business is very good because all you need is know how to drive then even if you don't have a car, you can hire a car from someone and settle them at the end of the day. Like for instance this Bot or Uba transportation business, like you can just stay in your house and get booked instead of driving along the road looking for passengers or staying at parks waiting for passengers to be complet before you can get a ride.This transportation using this platform call BOT have been a very good idea that have made transportation business easy for transporters, you don't need to waist your fuel as you can just stay in a station and get booked for a ride.Transportation business is very good because no one can request for a ride on credit as all passengers pay in full before they're giving a ride unlike so other businesses that people will purchase stuffs on credit and refer to clear the debts later or on month end.",
