Never keep all the eggs in the same basket. In the same way you can have with fiat one wallet with you everywhere and the rest is safely stored, you can have the same with crypto.3. You can keep the seed of your wealth in a safety deposit in bank or buried in your garden.4. A good bitcoin wallet offers the choice of plausible deniability. I expect people will learn to use that.5. Be your own bank is not for everybody, whether we like it or not. There will always be crypto services that will act like the banks = private businesses happy to hold the coins for you. Now they're less regulated and the money is not safe there, but this may change in the future.",

If you want to be bankless, you can certainly do that. You have full control of your money, unlike with fiat currencies, where you have no choice but to trust a bank to keep your money safe. But, it's up to you to take precautions and protect yourself the best you can.The unfortunate truth is that nobody can protect you from your own stupidity. So, we are likely to see more scams, thefts, and a whole host of other problems. For now, there are a few things that you can do to protect yourself and your money. Protect your private keys, understand where your crypto is going, and take steps to keep it safe. However, as Bitcoin matures and expands over the next 10 years and beyond, I'm sure we're going to see plenty of advancements in the arena of cryptocurrency and banking.",

You're making yourself an easy target for these criminals and no, it is not just the criminals that we're talking about here. We're talking about doxers as well. Just keep a low profile and you will be just fine. I had some friends that I had cut ties back in the days when they backstabbed me about my crypto-related stuff.

Make sure you hold most of your coins on hardware wallet and never link it to anywhere (e.g. exchange, unknown server, casino etc). Let's say the worst thing happen when the robbers force you to give them your private key, you can give him the smaller amount you have. They will don't have any way to find if you have another one.Another thing is don't let anyone know if you're wealthy e.g. wear branded clothes, bought luxury stuff etc.",

Being anonymous is important, and dont let your close friend to know that you got some heavy asset cause who knows they could tell others and so on and those people might get the impression of stealing from you.",

So I think crypto robbery incidents would rise as adoption also rises. So if everybody is already his/her own bank, then it is indeed easier to rob a bank. This is the reason why I now prefer not to discuss about Bitcoin with other people, even friends and relatives. When the day comes that everybody uses Bitcoin and keeps their wealth in Bitcoin, the question will always be, will you be a good bank? How safe of a custodian are you?",

What happens is that banks will modify their operations to soothe the crypto standards. I think they are doing already in CBDC and when they do this, exchanges also exist and bew technologies will also emerge by then to handle the situations. But for now no need to brag that you own large bitcoin. Even as you are using bank presently, criminals will also hold you at gun point and ask you to transfer all your money to their account number.",

I say this because if you consider other financial institutions like the regular banks you have, you would agree with me that the level of sophistication security-wise that they have today, is not the same level they had some years ago. Having faced some security challenges over the years the regular banks although not yet perfect, have become more developed to address security issues. When bitcoin goes mainstream definitely some people will first be victims to theft but I believe that in the long run any security challenge that will arise will also be addressed and tackled. Your target as of right now should be not to be among those first persons that will fall victim or even fall victim at all when bitcoin goes mainstream.",
