Or it depends on what the wallet is offering, for example new crypto wallet that's fully open source but not popular because its new, is this a good reason enough to start using? There are people who use Guarda wallet, Atomic wallet or Exodus wallet the same year of release before they become popular, what could possibly prompt you to start using a new crypto wallet today? I also want to know if Guarda wallet is better than Trust wallet, I read that the Guarda wallet was released in 2018 but I've never used this wallet before, I just want to here from users if any is on here.",

Even if a wallet is open-source and is secure enough, it will take some time to be trusted by the community.",

Example of that was blockchain android wallet I used in the past but after constantly having issues with it I switched to Electrum years ago and I can't complain about it. And no, I wouldn't be interested testing wallet that is new on the market no matter whether its open source or not and I would rather leave that to people that are more knowledgeable than me to thoroughly check it out.",

I want to make sure that my assets are well-protected from hackers and other malicious actors and I always check the reputation of a wallet before using it. I also want a wallet that is easy to use and navigate.I do not like it when a wallet's user interface is complex, or when there are too many steps involved when setting up the wallet. Overall, I want a wallet that is easy to use, secure and reliable. I am not always the most tech-savvy person in the world, so it is important for me to find something that does not require a lot of technical knowledge. When it comes to trying out new crypto wallets, I might give them a spin out of curiosity or to explore new features. However, I would never entrust them with significant amounts or use them for important transactions if they don't have a well-established and impeccable reputation.",

Don't trust, verify.Point of the open source wallets is that you don't need to trust anyone if you and other developers can verify the code and don't find any hidden backdoor.Any newly released wallet needs time  but at least for open source software everyone can identify and help fixing them, that is impossible with bunch of closed source black box wallets.

I don't like any of this wallets and I don't recommend anyone using them, but Exodus is probably better option from all of them.Best option for dealing with shitcoins is hardware wallets like Trezor, Keystone or Bitbox, that are all open source and much better than ones you mentioned.",

Even if the wallet is an open source and its newly created  that even make its more vulnerable to some flaws and i personally feel anything new needs some time to be properly check and verified by top developers that the software is safe enough for use. If you are using any other wallet and its working fine for you,  i feel there is no need to try any other new ones especially now the web is flooded with crypto and wallet theives waiting to steal your coins and changing of wallets can just make you a victim of such scam project. For me i will recommend you just go with electrum wallet which is very convenient and the charges are way less per transaction in the wallet",

For example some who is using Electrum and has some difficulties with the wallet file (ie. when the file gets big the software slows down) would love to use another wallet that doesn't have the same problem.Of course the replacement has to still have the main principles needed for a good wallet. Two main ones in my opinion are being 100% open source so that you can verify the code and being semi-popular so that enough users have used it that most bugs have been found and fixed.",

While in android version, Trust wallet was never being fully open source! so Trustwallet is actually a closed source wallet. You can prove me if I'm wrong to say Trust wallet is closed source if you're really sure Trust wallet is fully open source and there's no any  suspicious code If you only believe with the developer and the site were claim Trust wallet is open source without verify it yourself, you must start to learn from the basic thing.",
