Do you have any details on what improvement we should expect besides that will gove more user friendly?I just notice that recent bet win histpry is not updated. I see same user and bet record in there for over a minute which is unusual because it should be changing every seconds since it tracks every bet on the casino. Will you mind sharing how many active user right now playing in the casino?This was a minor bug, will be fixed soon.If you update the website it will update the list as well.We have many updates coming with V2 and i will inform more about it here soon. I will also be updating the thread with proper information and a banner.Many thanks",
