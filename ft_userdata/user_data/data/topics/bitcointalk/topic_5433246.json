  "content": "Heatbit Is the First Space Heater That Mines Bitcoin, Founder SaysThe newfangled device looks like a high-end space heater but uses integrated circuitry to process bitcoin transactions.That heat, according to the official Heatbit site, is enough to warm 500 square feet of space. The kicker is, if you run the heater 24 hours a day at a bitcoin price of $20,000, the device will put $30 back into your pocket every month to help cover your electricity bill. Given the jump in energy costs last year, that capability may offer consumers some incentive.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/03/heatbit-space-heater-will-also-mine-bitcoin/Since some will ask: still not sure if we broke even, net of electricity costs, on the box. But ended up w/ about $2K+ worth of crypto for a $700 box.https://twitter.com/adamnash/status/1569486065026879489?",

The other way would be for the difficulty going down, but I don't see that coming, and not by a percentage to offset the above by much!",

But the surprising thing is that the room heater is not only used for heating the room but it is used for various multipurpose purposes.Heatbit normally power consumption 1400-1500Watt . The power consumption of a mining rigs is the same, the advantage is that you need exactly the same amount of electricity as a mining machine in a heatbit heater.  Apart from heating the room, you can also do bitcoin mining from the heater.A heatbit Heater Mining 1$ bitcoin per day and $30 bitcoin per month.

I don't see any mention of that in this thread except for your edited post. I don't even see that on the official website. Even if it is true, why would that be an upside if you can just use a regular coffee/speaker that cost less and probably more reliable? At the end of the day if you want to buy something like this your goal is probably to mine BTC, not for owning an all-in-one electronic device.What the manufacturer stated regarding the future of these devices is about upgradability[1]. They claim the plan is to make new and old devices upgradable with new ASIC, but the details are unknown. Other than that, there's no mention of expanding the functionality of the device unless I missed it.[1] https://www.heatbit.com",

You believed this would be cool so you decided to add them on your own, just as there was no comment, you didn't commit any crime by photoshopping that and you don't need to find some alibi for it!  Quote from: joniboini on January 07, 2023, 11:22:10 AMEven if it is true, why would that be an upside if you can just use a regular coffee/speaker that cost less and probably more reliable? At the end of the day if you want to buy something like this your goal is probably to mine BTC, not for owning an all-in-one electronic device.I would say that the goal here is to offset power costs, more like getting cheaper heat than actually using this to mine bitcoins for your won stash, although in my opinion it quite fails even at this. As for the other stuff, of course there is no upside, we don't have right now a heater that makes coffee and has speakers that sells in thousands, right? So if this kind of thing is not produced it means there is no market for it, and adding a bitcoin miner on top of a product that doesn't sell won't make it more attractive either. That's why they aren't planning on doing it either.",

Just one board would do 31-32thpull 1100 watts. set it to 800 watts use brains it would get 25-27 thor use one s19 pro 110th board set it to 800 watts it would do 32th on low rate firmware.I would think someone would simply use an s19 pro controller program it for lower hashrate and put it in a nice case.",
