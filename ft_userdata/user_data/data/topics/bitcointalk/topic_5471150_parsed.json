That being said, it’s also important to note that if you don’t have knowledge on a subject being discussion, it’s better to scroll and read instead of typing. You don’t need to know it all, a little knowledge and experience on bitcoin is enough to have an opinion on various subjects relating to the bitcoin ecosystem. Partaking in discussion with other members increases your perspective and is also a way of learning and unlearning concepts. Criticism and corrections are welcome and should not break your spirit, in fact I think you learn more from “harsh” comments, they tend to toughen you up.",

      "body": "To be honest, I do not like being wrong about stuff.  Especially when it is something technical or exact, like with Bitcoin or other complex or technical topics.  I have certainly been in situations when I thought I understood something, only to find out I was wrong or didnt really get it when I tried discussing it or starting a thread. But its all part of learning though.  When I realize I messed up or someone corrects me, I try to see it as a chance to improve.  I appreciate peoples input and try to acknowledge mistakes and correct them.  But usually I avoid getting into talks about stuff I have no clue about.  Its different from just sharing opinions on general things - if you give bad info to someone's technical question, it can really screw them over.",

First of all no man is an island of knowledge which means everyone is bound to make errors and since there’s a constant evolution and advancement of technology it will be impossible for you to keep track of things going on and even the current knowledge you have now that’s accurate might later become obsolete and when shared with others it becomes a misconception/ false information.So whenever I am corrected I always make sure I read more in that topic so as not to make the same mistakes the next time I come across similar discussion and also to correct those that are going to make similar errors like I did, so there’s nothing to be ashamed of or scared of.",

How did you really feel about those subject matters and what was your approach towards the observation and correction made by other users on your thread.The bitcoin ecosystem is ever-dynamic. There are discoveries and developments every day. When researching a topic access mainly current material. There have been times when members use outdated information to create a thread. There is nothing bad if you are corrected when the information is not correct. After all, we are all here to learn. And in the process of learning there will be mistakes and corrections.

Members will be attracted to your thread if it is educative. You will only receive corrections and in some cases criticism when you put out a low-quality post filled with wrong facts.

Because there will always be more educated people to correct your mistakes. In addition you can send your thread to the archives if you think it is too bad to be read. So people, especially newbies shouldn't hesitate to talk, to ask questions and to expose their issues in order to learn.",

Of course, sometimes, we tend to omit some things or to get some points wrong, and that is where the well-informed members of the forum come to the rescue. There are still some people who know more than you, who will correct you and also highlight various additional points you must have missed. Others may have been spurred to research on the topic in order to make useful contributions to your thread, all thanks to you. Furthermore, you must have created an avenue for others to learn things that they have not known.So in these cases, you need not be troubled cos you've done much good to the forum by bringing an opportunity for yourself and others to learn and improve. that's the notion I have anytime I experience such.",

There's no time limit when it comes to learning bitcoin. Research does not only happen for several hours but you have to research and continue learning everyday not only from your own perspective but also with how the other people have perceived it.  So learning bitcoin is limitless, because you get to learn on your own studies as well as with other people perception about bitcoin. And the moment I understood the topic well, that's when I decide to make a thread not just to ask the other forum members opinions and ideas but to share my own idea as well which I think a lot of people will learn from it.And if ever my own assumptions are not true and correct based from what others have perceived it, then I'm always open for corrections and better ideas. This forum is not limited for only single idea but there should be vast ideas coming from different members and as long as they are valid, I think that will be a lot better knowing this forum do not tolerate wrong and inaccurate ideas but only facts and legit ideas.",

Some people create topics because they do not understand much about the subject, so they want others who have more knowledge on it to share their thoughts so they could learn. But before creating a topic, the poster should know what they want to share, and the idea or theme should be clearly communicated to the audience so that they would know where and how they can contribute. You cannot just confuse your readers and expect them to understand what is not clearly shared. It's best to study first, and if you understand what you studied, then you can share it in the forum if it will benefit the members. Also, while studying, if you do not understand some things clearly, you can share it here and specify that you do not understand one or two things. Those who have knowledge about it will help you out and provide the right information for you. These are the two ways I think are best to post a topic here.",

This is how people relevant to old discussions especially when certain old events has been brought up to link it on same scenarios happen on current time. People should really accept any criticism and corrections then don't feel bad about it since this can really be a great help to anyone who's starting up to learn something.

While it's impossible to know every single detail, having a solid understanding of the subject matter is crucial. I usually spend a significant amount of time researching, reviewing, and understanding the topic at hand. However, the time spent can vary depending on the complexity of the topic.

Most times I usually had some negative replies from some higher ranked members, but I was never bothered because I was here and ready to learn. The whole idea about creating a topic of discussion, which most newbies now are missing because they probably are after getting merit is that you want to learn from the community. When many people share different idea about a particular discussion, you get to learn from many perspective. This makes you even better than them. That is if you actually read their replies.While constructing a new post.
