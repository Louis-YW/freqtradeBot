  "content": "I got this info from the Tiktok video on my homepage, I don't know who it is because it's not clear but his twitter name is @adyingnobodyHe claims that he has a full transcript of the conversations on telegram about crypto influencers discussing those indecent scams, rugpulls etc by defrauding the community from 2019 - 2022.However he will publish on a persistent basis from June 15, June 30 to the end on July 7th gradually.He will release all with 137.21GB of data.So can this be called a warning whether later never to visit what is given, including downloading files when they share, that sense of curiosity must be endured because it could spread the virus.Source: https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1ss24a6",

What that person might do is that he may spread some virus which will steal your wallet's important information such as seed phrase and more or just exposing those people who have done the things that the person is saying. We don't know for sure until we found out that it happened.",

Maybe this is just a scam I guess. Because if nothing is released and the account just become inactive ever again, that means the donators into that ethereum address have been scammed. Secondly, it is good to be careful of malware which is what people are warned about, it is better to just stay away if you do not know how to avoid malware because this can lead to a spread of malware as people are really waiting for the released of the promised information which may not even be real and may contain malware.",

There are a lot of cases in which that's the case. The whistleblower's identity should also be protected if that's true. The best way that he could expose them would probably be a website that could tell the whole story, nothing more, nothing less. It could be easily faked, but still, there's a possibility of it being authentic.",

Besides, if you aren't planning to check out the \"evidence\", why download it in the first place?I would be careful trusting random people on social media making big claims. If they wanted to post some proof, they can do that already. Post a few screenshots to prove that they have the data they claim they have. Anyone thinking about downloading and inspecting the files should probably do so on a virtual machine and a secondary device that you could simply reformat without fear of losing anything of importance.",

Not saying this guy doesn't have any transcripts, but presenting it in the aforementioned manner is suspicious at best. Honestly, I don't trust anyone who just randomly contacts you, in this sphere, it always indicates that it's some kind of scam. And yeah, the advice of not clicking on random links received in messages and e mails, I thought people learned that 20 years ago and that scams like that are fairly rare. As for scams mentioned in the message, It's not really a shock, and coming out with that info would really not reveal or solve anything.",
