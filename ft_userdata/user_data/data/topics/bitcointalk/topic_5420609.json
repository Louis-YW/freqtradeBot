  "content": "According to JPMorgan experts, Bitcoin might tumble below the $13,000 mark as a result of the FTX disaster. The American banking behemoth also stated that the market will suffer \"a torrent of margin calls\" in the coming weeks as a result of the collapse of one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges. Another forecast given by Fundstrat's Mark Newton is that Bitcoin will go below $10,000. Meanwhile, the king cryptocurrency fell to a fresh two-year low of $15,632 on Wednesday, Nov. 9. According to CoinMarketCap statistics, BTC has recovered and is presently trading at $17,322, although many analysts anticipate the largest cryptocurrency will continue to fall.",

      "body": "Falling even further than the current price wouldn’t be something unusual. To match previous draw downs in bear markets (from ath to cycle bottom) we could even dip below $10,000.You don’t need to worry though, bitcoin will recover & smash new ath’s. It's just a matter of time. You need to be very patient but it will recover.Now is also a great time to buy, good luck.",
