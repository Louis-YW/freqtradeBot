It's easy, fast and reliable setup.For a beginner who's either tech-savvy or tech-savvy wannabe, I'd recommend Raspibolt or Raspiblitz. Note that Raspberry Pi 4 is not for very convenient uses, due to 4 core CPU (the minimum). You should also avoid 2 GB RAM model.",

If you run your computer 24/7 and have more than 1 TB of Free space, You can run a Full Node, which will slightly help the Bitcoin network. Quote* What type of Tutorials should one learn from? Follow tranthidung's post Above.Quote* what kind of software installation recommended to download and the link? The latest Bitcoin Core 24.0.1 was released. You can download it here https://bitcointalk.org/bitcoin-24.0.1.torrent. It will download a torrent file, and you can download the official Bitcoin Core using any torrent software. Quote* what's the best network device or PC is convenient for it?  If you follow the mentioned thread, You will get all answers. But, From my experience, I would recommend using at least 8GB of Ram and 7-8th Gen Processor with multiple cores and 1TB of HDD (SSD if possible) and a fast internet connection to download the blocks quickly.",
