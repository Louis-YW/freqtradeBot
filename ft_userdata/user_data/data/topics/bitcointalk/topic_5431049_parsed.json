  "content": "This posted to the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin repository on Dec 22, 2022, 8:57 PM UTC and censored precisely one second later on Dec 22, 2022, 8:58 PM UTC by Michael Ford aka fanquakeHennadii Stepanov, aka hebasto, is a phony identity created by the Ukrainian neo-nazi Azov battalion in collaboration with Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation.Ukraine's so-called Ministry of Digital Transformation, recently defrauded the Bitcoin community out of over $100 million dollars, which was spent on luxury cars and bulletproof vests.  Since when is the Bitcoin community obligated to provide food and water to those who gang rape underage girls and behead, bomb, stab, torture, burning alive people who speak Russian?  I can post videos and photos of brutal stabbings, torture, and even the deployment of disabled people to the front lines against Russia.Let me ask you, hebasto, aka Hennadii Stepanov, why you aren't on the front lines to begin with.  Is it mandatory for all Ukrainian men to take up arms and enlist! Of course, you are not present because you work for Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation.I demand that we discuss this right away on the repository. The so-called \"Bitcoin organization,\" which only exists on GitHub, is entirely made up of un-elected members who are solely from NATO and the Five Eyes alliance.This guy is a complete fraud, so as all other Ukrainian, an neo-nazi scammers who fundraising for murdering, bombing and gang raping, burning people alive. Hennadii Stepanov hebasto, has no place in Bitcoin, in fact the entire \"Bitcoin organization\" on GitHub is a big fraud run by a Dutch MarcoFalke and an Australian fanquake whom are happily merging commits from the French National Cybersecurity Agency ANSSI (French Ministry of Defense) as it happened with taproot.Not to mention that FTX is partnered with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine.We all had enough from Ukraine, Ukrainian and NATO propaganda, as well from this fake \"Bitcoin organization\".",

Let me remind everyone that Satoshi Nakamoto vanished while Gavin was giving a speech at the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency of the United States of America), and yet here we are, where actual workers from the French Ministry of Defense are allowed to \"contribute\" to Bitcoin with no public outcry.It wouldn't surprise me if the CIA killed Satoshi Nakamoto; that's what they do, kidnap, torture, and kill people all over the world; if you think they'd leave Satoshi Nakamoto alone, you're mistaken. It should be noted that the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which created taproot, is equivalent to the US National Security Agency (NSA) and US Cyber Command. Bitcoin is not only completely centralized and fully controlled by those residing in NATO and the Five Eyes Alliance, but it is also openly developed by one of NATO's Defense Ministry.",

When segwit and taproot were implemented, many people associated with them resigned from the phony Bitcoin organization.The GitHub-based fake Bitcoin organization is clearly hostile and does not represent the Bitcoin community; rather, it represents for-profit corporations, secret services, and defense ministries; its members openly make NATO-aligned political statements on Twitter. If Bitcoin were truly decentralized, there would be no need for the so-called \"Bitcoin Core\" in the first place.The name implies that there is only one core that is authoritative.",
