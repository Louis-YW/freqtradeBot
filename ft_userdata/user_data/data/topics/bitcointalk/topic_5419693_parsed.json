  "content": "We all have different occupations and work for different companies. We work hard and keep improving ourselves to show our company owner how good we are at our work and how efficient we can be in growing the company. But all we are doing is helping grow someone else's companies. All our talent and struggle is to help someone else earn more money. What are we doing for ourselves? At some point in our life, we must grow our own businesses for our own safety.The title \"Do your work\" refers to growing your own business. We all have some skills in different sectors and we use all of our energy to work for a company and get a monthly salary. But we are not supposed to work for that company till death. so how will we bear our living expenses after retirement? Most people do not think about that. You can say yes they do. They do monthly savings for their retirement plan. But this is not savings or investment. Your fiat currencies lose value every year. So Your 30 years of saving will be the same in numbers but not in values. So what can we do then? We have so little to grow a business. Invest your saving in precious metals like gold and silver or digital assets like bitcoin, or it can in some potential stock or it can be in real estate. Invest your money where ever you want. Just do not keep it in a bank. The Bank interest rate is not higher than the inflation. You are losing money not gaining it. The point is to invest even if your saving is negligible.",

Well almost everyone already aware and know that, but they're just feel more comfortable to hold fiat in banks rather than precious metal or Bitcoin. This because they think precious metal and Bitcoin has a volatility that would make their investment value decrease. They're just scared, but we can't do anything since it's their choice. At least I'm the one who hold most of my money in Bitcoin rather than fiat and precious metal.",

I just expressed what I feel for myself. I valued your opinion and criticism. We have different points of view and lack of knowledge so there is always something to learn from a veteran like you. I am still learning.I agree upon \"the world needs wage slaves\" but there is no shame in trying to get out of the rat race. The word business in OP refers to investment also not only for a traditional business like being a company owner. A few months ago I read the book 'Rich dad poor dad\". I saw myself in that book. I can see why I am from a middle-class family and my father has never been able to get out of the rat race. Actually, he never tried to and most people do not.I think sometimes we have to repeat some topic because of its importance. People forget these over time. So it was just a reminder for everyone to do their work.",

It is natural to see because some are born with silver spoon in wealthy homes or royal family and others in middle income families. This continue as natural, and few move from middle class to upper class while some rich families who didn't manage the wealth very well can find themselves back to middle class or poor/lower class. This circle will continue that family move from wealthy to down and down to up.Quote from: The Pharmacist on November 07, 2022, 06:29:53 AMJust keep in mind that there's much more to life than work and money.  Yes, fulfilment is part of what is much more than money. Some person doesn't have the strength to go over the stress of owing and running their own business. The people will be fulfilled working for others and this is natural, everyone can't own a business because some will be workers and some owners that will make up the society and make it balance.

Invest your money where ever you want. Just do not keep it in a bank. The Bank interest rate is not higher than the inflation. You are losing money not gaining it. The point is to invest even if your saving is negligible. It's a good idea to invest your money instead of keeping it in a savings account, but the investing needs to be done in the right way to avoid losses. It sounds a bit like you promote any form of investment over saving at the bank. The main feature of parking your money in cash or moving it into bonds is that you can't lose money there. If you look at gold for example, it was the best asset in the past to protect us from inflation and hold it's value during a crisis. But this year gold lost 8% of it's value while we face inflation rates of 10% and are in an energy crisis. With stocks it's even more problematic, most of the stocks this year lost money, so holding cash would have been the better trade. For 2023 things could turn worth, there is no end in sight for the high inflation rates and in Europe we are going into recession. With this in mind we are probably not yet an the turning point for stocks and I would be very cautious which to buy. Real estate is another issue with the rising interest rates, it's a good idea to invest some money into it, but financing cost are going to rise even more next year which should lower the price of real estate eventually. Buying right now could still be expensive compared to next year. In my opinion the best would be to add in crypto currencies to avoid holding larger amounts of fiat cash.",

The first preparation must be done since we are still working.that is how we should be able to earn income from outside the current job and without leaving the current job. namely building a passive income. passive income can be built even while we work in other people's companies. like starting to invest. or even in installments to buy a land that we can later rent out and we get money from the tenant.",

I just want to address the first thing, about growing your business. It's extremely difficult compared to just doing a regular job and getting a monthly paycheck. Becoming an entrepreneur is like your life's calling, your passion since the stress is so high, especially if you are just started. It's not for everyone and there's nothing wrong to be a salaryman if you have a decent job. You should realize those successful entrepreneurs are (probably) 1% of the population, so that's why the 99% won't have the same level of income and should be grateful for what the universe provides.Anyway, if you think you are special, you can always quit, create your own business, and compete to be the 1%. I used to think like the OP, but after I tried and realized how difficult it's to be the 1%, I understand why people don't mind working for someone else's business.",

And returning to work for the company again won't be possible. Building and managing a business is not for everyone.The population of digital assets is growing every day, while Millennials and Generation Z have ideas about how these assets work as well as how to manage and keep them secure. It's hard for Baby Boomers and Generation X to comprehend how digital assets such as Bitcoin work.So, they can only settle with the method they feel comfortable with and that includes keeping their funds in the bank. You can't expect old people to be keeping seed phrases, which they can forget in a minute. Also, they can easily fall to scam. This might gradually change in the future as civilization continues.",

Invest your money where ever you want. Just do not keep it in a bank. The Bank interest rate is not higher than the inflation. You are losing money not gaining it. The point is to invest even if your saving is negligible. In principle, I agree with you, because considering the interest rates on savings offered by banks today, money saved in this way only loses its value over time. Investing in precious metals has always been a good option, especially when it comes to gold, which is still valued around the world, but for the common man, such a way of investing always represents a security risk because gold is something that bad people can always try to steal from us. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a relatively new way of investing and the majority is still very distrustful of it, and the volatility that accompanies it definitely does not help to assert itself as an alternative to gold.On the other hand, although fiat loses its value due to inflation, in some countries it is still the first choice in which people keep their savings because they consider it a safe way, given that savings deposits in banks are insured by governments up to a certain amount (EU to 100k EUR). This tells us that people prefer the safety of their assets more than to protect themselves from inflation in some alternative way.",
