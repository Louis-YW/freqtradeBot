In this case, when I look at your demo exchange, we must register to try the demo which I think is not necessary because is still beta, In my experience when try the demo, we don't need to create an account, they even give free testnet coin to try the exchange. so, the experimenter will be free to find any bug.",

      "body": "Hello Â , first of all I am sorry for the confusion that the message itself could have generated. Actually what we offer is a white-label script that allows users to launch their own cryptocurrency exchange, we are currently working on launching a new demo with new themes available and we will take very seriously the consideration of creating and offering a TEST account. Although currently there are two buttons that say \"log in as Admin\" or \"log in as User\" thank you!In the next few hours we will launch the demo of the new theme that you can see in the link https://demo-light.exbita.com/market/BTC-USD (currently blocked and limited by a firewall)",
