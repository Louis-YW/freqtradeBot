I don't keep records either because if I do or anyone else that does that means only one thing,whenever you will be back reviewing your spreadsheet with your win/loss data you will think not twice but more than that before you gamble.It is true that when you don't keep it you only tend to remember your big wins but if your lost sessions are consecutive you will remember them too so I don't see any real benefit of keeping track,in order to avoid this use a preset budget for gambling every week or every month and stick to it,you will know the data without keeping a spreadsheet.",

I know that the money spent for gambling are more like money spent for entertainment purposes, but it still kinda sucks, when you see how much you have spent on such unproductive hobby as gambling. Viewing my losses every day would make me wanna recover them, by gambling more and trying to get bigger profits. This leads to bigger bets, taking bigger risks and it seems more like a downward spiral towards developing gambling addiction.What gambling games are you actually playing?",

Do you keep a record of all the pennies you use to gamble and also the result? Nah, it's hard to record the number of wins and losses, unless you bet on a online platform. But if you go to land case casinos, then there's no way you can track of everything. On the other hand, why do we really need to know though? I'm just curious. Because for me, if you gamble and that money is allotted for that, then win or lose, that is going to be ok.Quote from: Z390 on October 10, 2023, 06:22:21 AMSomeone whom we both have this discuss yesterday said this is a good practice, I still don't see a reason why because I don't keep record of my losses, I tend to only remember when I win a certain amount, if its good enough you won't easily forget, but apart from this I don't care.

Perhaps if he had records though, maybe it's one reason why he will quit specially if he see the records and he is losing big amount of money. Something to pounder upon maybe when you are alone and think that maybe it's time to really stop this gambling for good.",

No of course not, just because you don't record how you spend your money doesn't make you a bad gambler. As long as you are enjoying yourself and gamble within your means I don't see any problem with not recording all your gambling wins and losses.  There are some benefits for keeping records, you always know how much money you spend this month or this year on gambling. For me personally it's quite important to keep at least small records, because I have fixed limits on how much money I spend on gambling each month. Without using records it would become hard to stay on top of my gambling budget and I would be more likely to spend more than I wanted to. It all comes down to how much money you are willing to spend and if you can remain in control of your gambling habit without keeping records. It's a preference thing, like some people keep records for all their monthly purchases and others just spend the money they have more freely.",

So Famz, is there any benefits when one keeps record on their losses and wins? Is there any thing to gain when you write down all the money you spent in gambling and also how much you have made so far? Not keeping records, does this make me a bad gambler? Gambling is not a serious part of my financial activity so there is no need to keep records. I keep financial records of things that take a substantial chunk of my income and not gambling. Another reason why I don't care about keeping records is that it can also be complicated. I have a gambling budget but sometimes I can gamble below the budget and sometimes slightly above the budget. In most cases, I can't track my losses and wins because I might immediately use my wins to solve some needs and will also use another part to gamble again. Also in some cases, I receive cash from gambling firms for my wins and also use fiat to also gamble. In fact, my gambling activities are just complicated. The only way I can track my gambling life is if I move around with a gambling record book which will aid me in recording my activities, but this will be impossible. Another pattern will be to keep all of my fiat gambling slips safe and do my calculations periodically. But for me, it is unnecessary since I gamble responsibly and hide my gambling activities from some people. Keeping these records can expose my secret to the wrong people. An irresponsible gambler is one who is suffering from a gambling disorder and not people who don't keep records. I you keep records but don't control your gambling life, you are a bad gambler.However, keeping records can be a good way of controlling your gambling activities especially if you don't have a gambling budget. It could also be a vital means of evaluating your gambling life and making amendments where it is necessary.",

Same as the post above mine stated, I don’t keep record either and neither have I encountered anyone that does so i don’t really know what’s like keeping records.Most of the times what I do is to go back to my previous game history for a specific time period and check how much I lost and how much I won, but for me to be keeping it documented seems like something that will take a little of my time. And for something that’s meant to be for fun I don’t really see any point of keeping record of it unless you’re becoming an impulsive gambler that no longer has control over how he/she goes about his funds when it comes to gambling.",

It all boils down to having self-control on your gambling activities by using only the amount that you can afford to lose and don't chase your losses.If I want to know how much I do use for gambling annually, it is easy to know because, I have a weekly gambling budget and is a specific amount, so I will just calculate it. This is how I plan my gambling budget at the end of every year, towards the beginning of a new year. I make sure that I do this often so that I can know if the amount I will be setting aside for my weekly gamble is high, and I will cut it down.",

I don't do it, because in my opinion there is an easier way to find out how much money we have spent and whether it gives a profit or not by checking the deposit and withdrawal sections and doing the calculations. If the deposit is bigger, of course, we won't make a profit and vice versa. because recording it is not that important, in my opinion, even in trading, it is rare for traders to take that action to record it, especially in gambling, and I am sure that out of 1000 gamblers, maybe less than 10% record every win, the rest prefer to forget and stick to a weekly budget or monthly if it exceeds then stop playing until a week or month has passed then make a deposit again to plays.",

Of course, keeping track of gambling expenses by recording them will help calculate expenses more easily but this doesn't apply to individuals who gamble at certain time intervals.Especially if such a thing were to be done, recording the current winnings and losses for each game would be a complete torture because creating an income-expense statement after each game is a difficult process and takes a long time. If a person wants to keep track of the amount he/she spent and won in gambling, the most logical option would be to keep records of the money spent and the money earned and transferred to his/her wallet. To get a more detailed record, the gain and loss amounts can be noted on a daily basis or only the daily balance change can be followed by tracking the daily balance.In addition, although it is not a perfect calculation method, it is possible to track gains, losses and balance by following the statistics provided by the casino.",
