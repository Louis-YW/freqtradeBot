      "body": "Simple, just buy 2. Load one, keep one unloaded. Boom.  In all seriousness I know that people feel differently about this for various reasons, just like which is more valuable, pre or post-fork satori. Hard to say objectively, so feelings get involved. I personally have not loaded mine for many of the reasons you mentioned. I don't have the spare BTC to lock up into a collectible that I would have to destroy to get back. If I had BTC coming out my ears then the load cost would not be as hard to give up. Others feel that the \"art\" should be untouched. So if someone releases a coin, or a card, or a Kialara unloaded, they keep it unloaded so it is always in the condition that the maker made it in. In my mind peeling a coin is different than destroying a Kialara. You still have the peeled coin in effectively similar condition that can be preserved, etc. To \"peel\" a Kialara, you literally have to destroy it, not as desirable in my mind. Also a future funded item may be harder to sell simply due to the increase value of BTC. A loaded 25BTC Casasius coin has tremendous dollar value now (compared to when they sold) and this potentially limits the possible buyers today, simply because of price increase of the load. I know of some collectors who do load them and other \"buyer funded\" items. The idea that these are meant to be loaded and are denominated makes them want it to be \"complete\". This requires TRUST in the maker and the spare BTC.  In the case of Kialara there has not yet been any issues with trust or key compromise. I believe that in the community Max has established a very strong reputation and to date has not or does not want to tarnish that. So if you choose to, the Kialaras are at the moment safe to load. But (as always) gotta put trust in the maker. I don't think either answer is right or wrong. This is why it all depends on what you want, can afford, and prefer. Curious what others think. Let us know what you decide and why!Geo",

      "body": "AFAIK general consensus here on this forum was that collectibles should be kept preferably in original state - i.e. if it is sold as loaded by the maker, keep it loaded; if it's sold as buyer funded, keep it unfunded.Of course it all depends on how you think of them - as collectibles with a possibility of future sale or as your personal artisan cold wallets.",

      "body": "This is definitely an answer of preference versus right or wrong. Identify what you want and go for it. I personally like to keep a piece as received from the manufacturer/creator. So in the case of the Kialara Messenger series, Max required buyers to load. In other series he has not. Both are amazing and I just like to go with the state it is delivered in. For me, for some reason, it seems like a complication to the collectible when the original state is altered after the fact. So if I could only buy one, either a loaded 'Buyer Funded' Lealana or an unfunded 'Buyer Funded' one, I would buy the unloaded one. However, it's not a big deal. I would have no problem buying a Kialara loaded by the buyer. .",

Obviously, if I had the means, I would definitely go for that answer though!Quote from: geophphreigh on January 02, 2023, 03:57:04 PMAlso a future funded item may be harder to sell simply due to the increase value of BTC. A loaded 25BTC Casasius coin has tremendous dollar value now (compared to when they sold) and this potentially limits the possible buyers today, simply because of price increase of the load. This was probably the argument that resonated the most with me.  Even in a bear market, 100 000 bits is no small change. While I do not plan on ever getting rid of it now, I know only fools never change their minds too. It would make it much harder to find a potential buyer at higher bitcoin price.The simple thought of someone destroying this piece one day just to get the sats buried under is enough to convince me to keep it unloaded for now.  It is truly a masterpiece that shouldn't be destroyed.  However, when talking about loaded/unloaded items, does the time at which it was loaded matters?  Or is it only for potential forks associated with it?",

If you wanted at least BCH coins/the first major fork, it would have had to be loaded before August 1, 2017. BCH then went through another fork on 11/15/2018 - When #Faketoshi Craig Wright split Bitcoin SV  https://www.investopedia.com/news/all-about-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork/QuoteThe simple thought of someone destroying this piece one day just to get the sats buried under is enough to convince me to keep it unloaded for now.  It is truly a masterpiece that shouldn't be destroyed.  Good choice, I agree! Kialaras are all way too beautiful to be smashed with a hammer for funds at any time IMO ...",
