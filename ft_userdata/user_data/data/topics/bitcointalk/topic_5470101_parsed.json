I reported them, thank you.When you're buying a domain you will not think that your domain will be targeted by phishing your primary intention in buying a domain is to brand your platform and have a unique identity online,  so we seldom see top projects domains on their initial only they want people to know what their platform is all about on their domain name.",

If we are not careful, of course we will fall into a trap.a slight difference in letters sometimes makes us unwary. This is what makes many airdrop hunters complain that their wallets have been hacked and the assets inside have been drained.",

No wonder people who are buzzing with the currently shiny things thinking them as fool's gold, run into and get scammed. Much to the delight of the scammers, these types of scams rarely get reported unless someone from the forum or somewhere else digs in deeper and tries to connect the dots.Hence for anyone who landed on this thread through a search engine, the above sites are fake clones of a legitimate project and you should be careful which one you click on.",

Especially new networks like Arbitrum and ZkSync (ZKS) that are likely to have huge airdrops.Unfortunately many people are too lazy to do their own research before connecting their wallet to these sites, especially bounty hunters who are only interested in getting airdrops and never care about safety issues so they lose their money instead of earning airdrops.",

Although the expectations is that they should be at least $1.00 by now, but it hasn't reach that price.Nevertheless, it's good that we have this kind of warning to all, because this scammers are not going to stop just because they haven't got anyone to scammed yet. They will continue until someone got caught.Reported it already:QuoteReport SentThanks for sending a report to Google. Now that you've done your good deed for the day, feel free to:1. Take a second to rejoice merrily for doing your part in making the web a safer place.2. Call/email/write to a neighbor/friend/relative and tell them what phishing is and how they can protect themselves.3. Learn more about malware that can infect your computer on Stopbadware.org.",
