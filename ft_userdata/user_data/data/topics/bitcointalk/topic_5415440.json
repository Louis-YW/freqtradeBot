Just need to have Internet connection, a non custodial wallet (should have it, rather than custodial wallet), you can use Bitcoin.Can use means you can receive and send it to others. Next, get accepted as a payment method locally is different; get legal tender is more different. If you use Bitcoin for illegal things, you will not have or have less issue with government even Bitcoin is not legal tender in your country.It is totally free, portable and no central control or censorship.",

You say El Salvador and the Central African Republic are experiencing financial freedom? LOL. El Salvador remains about as poor as it was and Bitcoin adoption has been rather low despite government promotion:Everyday Bitcoin usage in El Salvador remains low despite government push, US academic study findsMost of them, when they receive a payment in Bitcoin, immediately convert it to USD, especially with the downward trend of the Bitcoin price for many months. Users in El Salvador, the vast majority, if they use Bitcoin do so through Chivo Wallet, which is centralized and with KYC. The financial freedom thing in those countries can only be understood as a joke, and you are going to reaffirm this, I hope that you will provide arguments to back it up.I don't know much about the Central African Republic but I imagine it will be similar.So the parallelism with respect to Palestine I don't know where you get it from, unless it is because of the logic that from a false premise you can deduce anything (incorrectly).In this forum we are biased about Bitcoin and we tend to see it as a solution to the world's problems, but you have to get out of the fishbowl and realize that there is a whole world out of water.",

The first challenge is converting any cryptocurrency raised into fiat money—traditional government-backed currency—a significant barrier since major cryptocurrency exchanges do not operate in Palestine.Nope, there's an another article who discuss Palestine isn't directly accept Bitcoin payment, but they're need to convert Bitcoin to fiat which is that's not what to enjoy a complete freedom. When you need to convert Bitcoin to fiat, you're using exchanges and you will be asked to complete your KYC first. There's no countries right now want to pay anything in Bitcoin equivalent since they're scared of the volatility, but at the same time if they purpose is to get complete freedom, you must not link your coins to any exchanges.",

The currency they are currently using doesn't matter. If you are poor and you are using crypto, you would still be quite the opposite of financially free, because you are poor.

That's the beauty of bitcoin! So if any country adopts it as a legal tender, they can indeed use it towards their best belief. However, there is a risk element to everything and bitcoin is no exception here. It can be used for criminal activities as well it's very very difficult to track for the enforcement agencies. That's one point which is acting as a bottleneck for a lot of governments. Also the price volatility is another challenge. El-Salvador is definitely experiencing it in a hard way. So every government that are planning to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender. needs to have risk mitigation plan ready. Scraping their own currency is not good. Bitcoin can be simultaneously used alongside their own currency which is better and there is a fallback point. Completely depending upon bitcoin can bring disasters!",

The country is facing serious economic blockage from another powerful nation that is strangulating the financial sector of Palestine. Yes Bitcoin can give them access to cheap and reliable international and also national transactions, but investment in Bitcoin would be very slim because the nationals are only focusing on meeting their basic needs. Also, because of political instability and constant military attack, investors in the Bitcoin space would not risk their funds in such a nation.Quote from: Lewan on September 30, 2022, 05:15:00 AMEl Salvador made bitcoin the official currency and I'm guessing they're regretting it now. Yes, bitcoin offers you a lot of freedom and space. But unfortunately, it can make your economy weaker with its variable price.It might be too early to measure the impact of Bitcoin on the economies of both El Salvador and the Central African Republic because they are longtime investors in Bitcoin. The President of El Salvador is enduring a lot of criticism because of the bearish market. Although we have heard reports of more revenue being generated from tourism in El Salvador due to the adoption of Bitcoin and the SANGO project of CAR is barely a few months old. Let's just be patient and believe that something positive would come out of this nation's bold steps.",

It really depends on how the country is going to used it, and if they it can be their currency of freedom then so be it. And it will really take years before some nation will adopt it as legal tender or alternative to their local currencies, and so it will be a big challenge and there are going to be obstacles along the way for Palestine, not be easy and so only in the future that we will know if they adapt this idea of bitcoin being 'currency of freedom' or not.",

All it comes to money to armed your militia, to defend yourself or whatever you stand for and are willing to die for. Like you can preach about 2nd armament all you want but when you don't have enough money to buy a gun (or two or maybe a lot of it just for safe) to defend your home, all was just talk.I say Bitcoin has a chance to debut in Palestine as a currency for black market dealing. Less fiat money trail for Mossad to track and intercept or prevent it. Rich Arab dude might feel empathic to Palestine's cause and send Bitcoin for them to buy guns and missiles. Less chance for the intelligence agency to find and flag it as terrorist funding. off-topic, with Israel and UAE's normalization relationship, even trying to buy each other weapons (Israel's SPYDER ADS for UAE), the chance for Palestine to count on the Arab brotherhood's support is slim.",

The ongoing war between Russia-Ukriane can't be handled with bitcoin although people are using it.Like in the case of El Salvador they have adopted bitcoin but still the crime rate is high and you can check on it safe countries list ranking very low so you can't confuse bitcoin with these political agendas as it's not capable of solving it.",
