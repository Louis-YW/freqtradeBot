When a new campaign comes up, he delete that signature and apply for a new campaign. Such kind user is liar and can't be trusted, now it's proven since the @OP got scammed by this user.I think @OP should increase the requirement for user that want to ask no collateral loan, receiving few merits doesn't prove he will care about his account, maybe the neutral tag make him insecure and think his account completely useless. I wouldn't surprised if he would join 1xbit scam campaign.",

What for? Now the same campaign is asking for accounts without red tags to join. It's an irony they don't want tagged accounts any more even when those accounts got tagged because they joined in their campaign.OP, you did well by calling that user out. I think I've seen one or two accounts with neutral tags for loans they've not repaid (I'm not sure it's from you though) even after several months they collected it.

There reputation is already is tainted so they want there promoters to become clean as much as possible to cover there rotten reputation. Only bought account is the only one that will be joining there campaign in exchange for a few bucks with there limited campaign.@edgycorner probably get tired already on joining in different campaigns since most of the open signature campaign when he was still active here was only have a low duration. Probably he will came back again soon since his account is already involved on this kind of shit before.EDIT:Told ya",

When I told you after this post that you could earn more you become interested to pay but I can't believe that until I get repayment at least repayment of the interest.

I hope you will be serious about what you said and send @Shasan the amount of the loan and the agreed interest. It was a matter of your respect and appreciation to respond to his messages and tell him about your personal stuff. He waited for you for nearly 3 months. Anyway, Shasan is an understanding and trustworthy person. When You return the loan money to him, he will close the topic and remove the flag, but next time before you get a loan from another person, you must commit to paying it on time without any delay.",

Why taint a spotless account because of mere pittance? To be candid, I don't think 1xbit will ever resolve its issue to get all tags removed here in this forum. It's now sour grape type of situation with that company for allowing the issue to linger unnecessarily without resolving it at once. Its reputation is in tatters.",

Just because they responded now does not indicate they would pay back in time.Flag supported for now, if the accused pays back the loan + interest and compensation as declared by in this thread, I would withdraw my support of the flag.",
