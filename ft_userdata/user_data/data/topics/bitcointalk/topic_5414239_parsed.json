  "content": "Two weeks ago,I posted a thread on the forum about spreading Bitcoin awareness in my area and my place of work,which I shared flyers to people in my area about teaching Bitcoin, so that anyone interested can easily contact me. This innovation has started yielding good friuts. One evening I received a call from a lady I don't know,she asked if she was speaking to the person that his contact was on the flyer,I said yes. She introduced herself to me as Mrs Susan Wilson, then said she will love to see me so that we can discuss. This woman is a proprietress  to one of the private schools in my area called Legacy Comprehensive College, we booked an appointment to my own convinent time which she was OK with.   The next day I went to see her in office, to my greatest surprise she told me to teach her students in the senior secondary school about Bitcoin. I was astonished and marvel on her initiative for her students to learn Bitcoin in school. I then asked her about her knowledge in bitcoin, she said it was her husband that told her alittle about bitcoin. After much discussions she concluded by saying, she wants the best for her school and to create a difference in the area by teaching them more about reality of life than just books. She also asked how much will she pay for the class and I told her that its a voluntary service.   We fixed a date for that class but because of my busy schedule with work,It didn't work out. On Sunday evening Mrs Susan Wilson called again, saying that hope I will be able to come the next day which was yesterday for the class that she has already informed the students. I thought of it and told her that I will come on Tuesday which is today. Yesterday I met with my boss and told him I will becoming three hour late to work today which he permitted me.   Today being Tuesday 20th of September is my birthday so I voluntarily taught the students of Legacy Comprehensive College,SSS2 class Bitcoin, as my birthday gift to them. It was really a wonderful day, teaching these lovely and brilliant students  about bitcoin,even a staff of the school also joined in the class, he said he loves to learn something new as a teacher. A lot of questions was been asked by the students,a girl even asked how can you own a bitcoin which I told them all they need to know about bitcoin excluding the investment aspect, the class lasted for one and half hour. This is my first time to teach Bitcoin in school, after the class I saw that the students were so excited learning something new.       Mrs Susan Wilson is the lady beside me, she pleaded with me to come back and take them the practical class on Bitcoin that the school has a computer lab.My birthday was fun teaching these students,I had to take this pictures for remembrance and to also show to forum members to update you about  this. I need your contributions or observations,advice to my passion of spreading Bitcoin in my locality.",

It is very nice to know that there are altruists like you in the world who donate their time to children for free. Nowadays, when the world counts every second, you take time off from work in order to educate children about Bitcoin for free. I really hope that you were able to interest them. But I want to believe that your lessons will not end with an hour and a half of lectures. Children are quickly distracted, and if their interest is not maintained, one lesson will remain one that can be forgotten. I sincerely wish that the younger generation starts looking to the future with the confidence that they can achieve the best in their lives, and thank you, OP, for taking such kind steps. Happy birthday!",

I can see from the photos that you seem to be a great teacher. You look bright, confident, lively. Hopefully, you'd get to engage with people by teaching them about Bitcoin more. Since it's a private school, though, I think it would be alright to take some money out of it, so that they don't feel guilty you did it for free and so that you get a little treat out of it. But volunteering it also a nice thing to do, so I guess it's cool you agreed to do it.",

Country like El Salvador has introduced Bitcoin textbook to their students so that they will not find it difficult how to make a huge amount of profit from their Bitcoin investment in the future. Since many countries in the world has started making Bitcoin legal in their land, show that very soon they will like to follow the steps El Salvador government took to make Bitcoin textbook available in every area of the country for their students to have knowledge of Bitcoin.",

I am really happy to see the pictures which OP shared. This also shows that people are willing to change and move towards the digital currency adaption.",

This shows that they have good intentions for the students and would want them to be updated with the new innovation and technologies evolving. If schools could take such step , I think there would be fast and rapid adoption by the citizens of each country and that would create room for easy integration of Bitcoin into every nations. You have done well and it would be nice you take this step forward to other schools within your region so other students can easily assimilate as this is the prime age for them to quickly get the Knowledge of blockchain and Bitcoin as a whole.",

Since many people have started to develop the interest of spreading Crypto-currency knowledge to their community I think it's time we had a discussion on what really need to be taught to kids about Crypto-currency.I was recently in a soft argument with someone about teaching the younger ones about crypto-currency but he asked why teach something to kids when they aren't of the legal age to even own or perform crypto-currency transactions, although I have been in Crypto for a while now but I have not really thought there is any age restrictions to that, I don't know if the restrictions is different in other countries. I think educating the younger ones about crypto-currency should not be extensive, I think just like the OP has taught those kids we should adhere to it by teaching them the basis, personally I think anyone else teaching kids about owning a wallets, performing transactions on exchanges and even trading is leading them astray going by their age.",

What do I mean, you said you thought them about the investment aspect, I do not agree with that aspect. The basic knowledge of bitcoin is good for them. Majority of the students are below 18years and would not be able to take responsibility of the consequences of investing in bitcoin. Most of them could risk their school fees in bitcoin and thereby stagnate their education. If you will teach them again, don't teach them about investment yet.I observed where you mentioned that one of the disadvantages of bitcoin is volatility and you also said one can earn a living by trading bitcoin. It is a big contradiction. Volatility of bitcoin is more of an advantage than disadvantage. If bitcoin was to be a stable coin, majority of us wouldn't be here.",

Good initiative and something recommendable on what OP have done on here.This is something  that not everyone would be doingand this is purely a voluntary action just to spread up awareness.

This may not be easy and may not be able ti implemented in any country. In my country, it is like impossible to bring or teach cryptocurrency tot he school because of the very tough regulation and curriculum. Moreover, cryptocurrency is still debatable and causes pros and cons. That is why commonly it is not, except that it is for college in the campus with certain program study. Or this is done for a certain program, an extra program of a university or academy, to have a certain seminar or workshop about it related to crypto. That is why I really appreciate and feel so happy to see how many more people are able to teach others and introduce them to Bitcoin. I know that this may not be easy moreover if they are really not familiar with the technology. That is why it mayneeds certain continuity for the teaching process.",

You spent your time teaching your student about bitcoin and applause you not only explain with advantage from bitcoin but also you explained about disadvantage side with bitcoin. I think become alternative side job by your student later after graduate because they have know with bitcoin and get chance how to earn money with bitcoin trough as investment or trying become influencer and adapting bitcoin as payment currency transaction. Little suggestion maybe you can teach them using computer and show directly with exchange market how to withdraw and deposit bitcoin trough cash money. You can recommended for your student about which one recommended exchange market for registering.",
