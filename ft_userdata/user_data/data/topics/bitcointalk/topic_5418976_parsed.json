  "content": "I stumbled upon a story on social media and while it was quite hilarious, it dawned on me that we all could fall victim to such a situation but it would take a lot to look past what we see on the surface and study it further. This brings me to understand the saying that goes thus: do not judge the book by its cover. Let me give the summary of the story.  A man was given a packet of sugar and $10,000 in a church and was instructed by the giver to give the pastor the pack of sugar and take the $10,000.Dutifully he went and did as he was asked but got rebuffed by the man of God and he instead took the cash and gave the member the pack of sugar.Upset, the member went home and wanted to use the 'sugar' for tea only to discover $100,000 inside. What should he do? Will he be sinner if he holds the money or should he send it to the rightful owner. Being a Christian with morals.",

      "body": "That's a nice story, but this thread should be on the off-topic board IMO.I'm not going to comment on the religion (well maybe a little bit), but it seems that the courier should keep the $100,000, and it's the pastor's loss. The pastor shouldn't exhort the courier to give money to the church and violate the agreed terms.Other than a good moral story of \"don't judge the book by its cover,\" this is a fine example of how religion operates nowadays, or maybe they are always like this. It's all about money and lesser moral standards since everyone there, whatever their religions, are still a bunch of sinful human beings.",

I don't think the man acted immorally if he decides to keep the money because it is now a gift that was given to him by the pastor. But it might be proper if he informs the person that gave them the package about what transpired so that he would not be blamed for the pastors greed and misuse of religious authority.",

Being a Christian with morals.Feedback is usually expected when go on errands, As a Christian with morals the best action is to report back to the individual who gave you the $10000 and the pack of sugar for the pastor, and tell him what transpired between you and the pastor and how he greedily took the 10,000 dollars and give you the pack of sugar. From the amount of money he gave you, it shows that he is a generous individual, and may either increase the amount he gave to you or tell you to keep it for being credible and transparent and accountable. He will regard you in high esteem for being truthful.",

Money is their major concern for opening churches and not soul winning anymore. If we take my country for instance, every street has at least a church on it. It is about the offerings and tithes. Money lovers everywhere. No, the messenger will not be a sinner for not returning the cash to his greedy pastor. I will not return it and my conscience will not feel bad about it.",

And he did right by delivering the sugar now what pastor did is his intention and his action. Did the courier mention this infront of pastor that this sugar is for you and cash is for me.

Its no fault of his that the pastor rejected his box and chose to bully him for his $10k. If it were actually sugar, he would have have left with it anyway and so the outcome shouldn't change of it is $100k.",

This boy humbly obeyed instructions to submit what he was told but the greed of the pastor make him to lose what package that came to. If he didn't go to the pastor then we can say he did wrong but he didn't. This may be how God want to show favour to the boy",
