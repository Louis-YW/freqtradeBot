  "content": "This summer, I'm working on my own version of the Trezor One DIY. I've redesigned the board to include a USB-C port and a larger 1.3\" screen (although not visible in this photo, the one shown in the photo was taken from an Amazon breakout module and it's 0.95\", the same as Trezor One). All the components are situated behind the screen, and I would say the result is a similar size but with a different appearance.I've also designed a small and simple case, although I haven't printed any yet.It seems like all the hardware is functioning perfectly. I've tested a couple of units, and they're working flawlessly. Currently, I'm using the official .bin files from the GitHub repository.What I do is simply download the bootloader and the firmware, the latest version, V1.12.1 for both. I combine them using the utility and flash them onto the microcontroller.This works, but once the microcontroller is executed, it becomes protected and can no longer be updated with the STLink in a definitive and irreversible manner. The upside is that it becomes a production Trezor, and any application will recognize it as such. The downside is that you can't tinker with it anymore.I've tried compiling the firmware and the bootloader with PRODUCTION=0 and MEMORY_PROTECT=0 just for the sake of having a non-production Trezor, and compiling is easy, but I'm stuck in the process of signing the bootloader and making the firmware accept the bootloader and such.In any case, right now it's fully functional, just like a Trezor, which was my goal.https://i.ibb.co/KjF28sz/pcb2.jpghttps://i.ibb.co/ZKMnDp9/pcb.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/V6LM40p2/1.jpghttps://i.postimg.cc/fy19w2yh/2.jpg",

Regarding yours Trezor One DIY,  in my view it would be helpful for others enthusiasts to have instructable pictures for both  PCB schematic and  board layout  of your redesigned PCB with USB-C port and a 1.3\" display. What are the exact specs  of the screen used in your design?",

All the components are situated behind the screen, and I would say the result is a similar size but with a different appearance.Cool project, but I would love to see someone doing something similar for Trezor Model T, or adding different chips that has larger memory than in Trezor One.I think microcontroller used in Trezor One is STM32F2 and in Trezor model T it's STM32F4, that is small change but it makes a big difference with RAM and Flash.Bigger screen and usb type-c supporting is nice to have, but beware that Trezor announced they will stop manufacturing model One soon, that usually means less updates and bug fixes in future.Quote from: DIY-HWW on August 30, 2023, 10:05:13 PMI've tried compiling the firmware and the bootloader with PRODUCTION=0 and MEMORY_PROTECT=0 just for the sake of having a non-production Trezor, and compiling is easy, but I'm stuck in the process of signing the bootloader and making the firmware accept the bootloader and such.How did you fix this, and did you talk with Trezor team about your DIY device?I would like to see refreshed Trezor One device, maybe renamed to something like Trezor 1.1 or Trezor 2",

      "body": "hello dkbit98it's a bad idea. The Trezor One is straightforward; it's a simple piece of hardware.As for discontinuing the Trezor One, that would be a shame. I actually love that device. It's minimalist, and I appreciate that it doesn't have a security chip, just a simple microcontroller.Regarding creating hardware compatible with the Trezor T, I'm not ruling it out. Maybe an STM32F4 or something similar could strike the right balance.Speaking of alternatives, there's an intriguing project called the Onekey Touch. Essentially, it's a Trezor T with a larger screen. In their repository at https://github.com/OneKeyHQ, you can see they've forked the Trezor monorepo and adapted the code for their device. The Onekey Touch connects directly to the Trezor suite.The only drawback is the lack of hardware detailsEDIT: There are a old repository but they look like designs from the beginninghttps://github.com/OneKeyHQ/firmware/tree/bixin_dev/docs/pcb",

      "body": "dkbit98 and SFR10,About 3d print:The material type is nylon, but this is SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) printing, already available in gray color. I order it from a local supplier. I have a couple of printers, but in the end, it's more convenient for me to order the parts. For these small parts, it's very inexpensive.About USB-C:I don't see changing the USB-micro connector to USB-C as feasible because USB-C connectors don't have the same footprint; they have many more pins, and you won't be able to fit it. Someone, built his own trezor one with USB-C modifing only this form the original PCB project: https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR/comments/ieb4vv/trezor_one_with_usbc/About screen size:The 1.3\" screen is exactly the same with the same SSD1306 controller as the original 0.95 screen of trezor one. I think there's even a 1.57\" version available. As long as it has the same controller and resolution, it work with the original firmware. I ordered the 1,3\" screens from AliExpress, and they are supposed to arrive this week. I will solder and test it as soon as i receive it.The Onekey Mini is essentially the Trezor ONE with minor changes and features a 128x128 1.44\" screen. I'm leaving this as an idea.",
