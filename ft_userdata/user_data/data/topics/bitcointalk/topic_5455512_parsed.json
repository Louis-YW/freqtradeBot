They sued Coinbase today but the price rebounded to $27k.Link below includes a short video interview with Gary Gensler. Bitcoin rallies above $27,000 after SEC sues Coinbase, alleging its an unregistered brokerhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/06/bitcoin-is-little-changed-after-sec-sues-coinbase-.htmlQuoteCryptocurrency prices rose Tuesday after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto services provider Coinbase.Bitcoin climbed 6.3% to $27,155.16, according to Coin Metrics, recovering its losses from the previous day after the SEC sued Binance. Earlier, it fell as low as $25,368.57, its lowest level since March. Ether gained nearly 5% to trade at $1,896.19.On Tuesday, the SEC filed a lawsuit in New York federal court alleging that Coinbase has been acting as an unregistered broker and exchange. The agency demanded that the company be “permanently restrained and enjoined” from continuing to do so.“If there’s a real value in these crypto tokens then compliance will build trust and the business model might change,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” “What we’re doing at the SEC is pro-innovation because the capital markets really don’t work.”“There’s a lot of work here for the crypto field but we stand ready to work to get them into compliance,” he added.",

      "body": "I’d also add that it probably reflects the content of the action and that there is not some clarity from the SEC even if not “do what you want”. Much of it - IMO - is bs, and perhaps this shows that others agree. The fact is that they don’t like money being outside of their control and the Keynesian’s monetary policies serve the powers that be and they will try to stop it, delay it, or confuse it (with CBDCs).",

We need positive news going forward not this, what a drawback SEC  You can't really get them off crypto's back unless we're talking about creating some underground, alternative, decentralised economy. The moment you want to legally exchange cryptos to fiat (real, not stables) is when you are at mercy of the regulators.Some say all this is a part of the \"choke-point 2.0\" crackdown, but on the other hand, it looks like the SEC (at least for now) targeted only some specific coins, and hopefully others (including BTC) are safe, meaning things could go starting going back to normal after the dust settles.",

I think that this event had no effect on the market, and most likely no one heard or cared about it, especially since the authorities in America have returned us since the beginning of the year to pursuing all service platforms, and Coinbase in particular has been being pursued for a while, and it was certainly preparing itself to complicate matters more. Perhaps if the platform had been declared bankrupt or collapsed in any way, the price would have been negatively affected, but I see that what cnbc went to in its opinion is greatly exaggerated, and the price of bitcoin is considered stable.",
