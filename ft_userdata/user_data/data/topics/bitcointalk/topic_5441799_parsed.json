Great combination of skills and experience came together and raised 30 mil dollars is i think not a wonder. Well after reading news i was urged to see what skill is it they acquired that could let them raise 30 mil from podcasts. Well no doubt i have seen many other fund raising schemes but this is just trio. So i dig.David Hoffman  is a experience layer and blockchain based smart contract developer and makes such great contracts. In fact he is the founder of Eth based prediction platform \"Realitio\" and worked as chief law officer at \"MakerDao\" well these platform has its own fan base.Ryan Adams has a creative mindset and he comes with the greatest decentralized and web3 SaaS and ideas. He is YouTuber and podcaster. Which means he manages all the work of podcast and YT like social media etc. (Just assumption) He also has great expertise in marketing nad ideas so he built his own investment firm known as \" Mythos Capitol\" David Lakoff is the developer of blockchain and has great expertise in developing complex Blockchain based platform. Talking about experience, he is the CEO of \"Kyber Network\"well i provided the links too for better accessibility. Maybe this trio deserves this.",

It is obvious that we are going to get web3 companies a lot higher in the end when they build something great. Hell technically speaking we do not even need crypto for web3 companies to grow big too but it is a good addition without a doubt.I think it is important to realize that we are in a world that keeps on growing and improving and even if you mock the VC's for investing into something, when it is obvious that you should be investing into them as well, it is wise not to miss that chance, it would be a shame if you just mock about it and not take advantage of it. If I had any money to invest like this, I would look for web3 as well since it is looking like a near futures big deal.",

Social media is biggest influencer in the current era. While podcasts are one way influencers but they are directly affecting the listeners mind in the long run. Let‚Äôs just consider this as positive news for crypto maximalist and these fund raisers would go through. At the end of any raise, only concerns are it should be used for the right cause and not something else.",
