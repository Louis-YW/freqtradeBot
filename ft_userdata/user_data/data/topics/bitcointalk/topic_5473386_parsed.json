We were scammed by a Turkish marketing team and have not received the support we hoped for from the community. Many are labeling us as scams and rugs, and people are cursing us in our inboxes. We have lost the motivation to proceed. As a result, we will be withdrawing liquidity from Uniswap and closing LuxChain. If you are a major holder of $LUX, you may consider taking over the project.\"https://luxchain.io/",
