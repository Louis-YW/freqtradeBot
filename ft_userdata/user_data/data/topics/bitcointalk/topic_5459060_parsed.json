Was this helpful?I do not believe that learning stops; either you are pursuing a career in education, medicine, law, engineering, crypto currency, digital marketing, comedy etc; irrespective of your field; LEARNING never stops; even in our day to day activities. This coined the word \"we learn everyday\"What stops is your passion in a respective field; so instead of diverting your attention to different areas when a particular niche bores you, i would advise that as an individual, you need to find and figure out what works for you. When you figure out what works for you; you will have no troubles learning, mastering and improving on it.BTW: i am someone who believes that everything is easy; if we want it, we can to achieve it.

For me, learning will stop at death, not only about cryptocurrencies, I mean, but in general. Another thing is the intensity. Many topics, such as those related to Bitcoin can be difficult to understand at first but if you are willing to learn, with time and habit you always end up knowing more. Although age is a handicap in certain aspects. For example, if you start learning a language, playing an instrument or programming when you are over 50 you will have a hard time reaching a proficient level, but you can always learn.",

This saying is applicable to every aspect of life, whether academic, ways of life, finance, etc., in whatever we find ourselves doing today. As we keep on growing, that's how we will keep on learning and discovering new things (new innovations, new ideas). To me, I believe it's only the dead who have no room for knowledge expansion; as long as we are all living, we keep on learning. Quote from: Truthlovecoins on July 08, 2023, 11:46:17 AMWhat do you think? Was this helpful?Yea, it will be for some people who need motivation to keep on pushing in whatever they are doing. It's just a reminder to me of how I was finding it difficult to find myself around the forum in the beginning, but consistency brought me this far, and I will never allow my fear to stop me from achieving something. Anyone who is determined enough can do it; the only sacrifice that's required is time to learn and to take correction when they find out they have made a mistake.",

There must be a loss too. and as you said revisit the subject. Btw, To stop there must be, There is a time to stop and you can feel the code.

Some are well known while some are hybrids that have been developed from personal experience. We all have the one that works for us. From personal experience, the best way I learn is through a compact method. If  I were to learn about Bitcoin, I would start with the introduction and pick one aspect of Bitcoin that I feel I have the closest knowledge in. Then when it comes time, I found that I assimilate better when I study in the early hours of the day before when my mind is at rest before my body, soul and mind gets occupied with the world's problems. This is my own method. It works perfectly for me.",

But people can stop learning skills and as time goes on they become dumb about trends or outdated people. but generally, in terms of learning things, there must be something one would learn each day of his/her life you haven't known before because no one knows it all.And the only person that stops learning is a dead person.",

By education, we mean a certain degree which completes our educational qualifications but if we want to continue in real life, we cannot go according to any degree. Cryptocurrency is no different if you think you know enough aboutCryptocurrencies, but I will tell you that you have a lot more to know than that. Education is something you can learn from anyone younger or older than you. You may not know a thing but you will find that someone younger than you is quite experienced about that thing.

For me, these are obvious things.On my own behalf, I can add that in the process of any learning (new information) it is more productive to alternate training with physical activity (any). Even if it's just walking. But in general, switching from I can add that in the process of any learning one information to another in order to get distracted is quite a working scheme. This allows you not to get hung up and stop getting stuck on one topic that arises with prolonged concentration. Simply put, it is impossible to study continuously and pauses are necessary. Such as rest or change of activity. This works not only when learning new information related to bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, but in general with any.",

When you get stuck in boredom somewhere and try to divert your interest elsewhere it doesn't necessarily improve, but all you need to do is stop for a moment and do something else to stimulate your initial interest. Everyone has a way of killing boredom and talking on forums may only include self-development stages in discussion skills.When you are bored stop for a moment and don't force yourself to engage in endless discussions. It's easier to learn something light according to our interests because when you force yourself to learn a lot of things that's where boredom will arise. Reading will provide broad insights and this is where the key to success in enhancing self-development.",

Was this helpful?I haven't thought much about it, but I think feeling stuck or losing motivation while learning a new skill or achieving a goal is a common experience for many people. And I think you're right to suggest trying something new in order to reignite the passion. Exploring other things can indeed be good when faced with a mental block while learning something new, and I have experienced that myself more than once. But I guess everyone's experience is different. Some may find it helpful to shift their focus to something completely unrelated, allowing their minds to refresh. On the other hand, some may prefer to dive deeper into the problem, persistently seeking a solution until it is found. Regardless of the method chosen, I believe it's important to take occasional breaks, give your brain some rest, and engage in physical activities or relaxing. These moments of relaxation can recharge your mental energy and provide a fresh perspective when you return to your learning or problem-solving tasks.",

I agree with you, if a skill is hard for the brain to comprehend at all, the person can pause it, and practice what his brain is capable of learning. Once he begins to master his new skill, It'll create the self trust and confidence that he can achieve something and anything they focus on doing.
