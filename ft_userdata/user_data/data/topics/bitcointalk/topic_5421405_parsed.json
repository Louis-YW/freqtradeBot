There could be the hype that has successfully made it $0.7 and it's almost there but, it's still not $1.Considering that with the help of Elon and shilled Dogecoin and some other meme coins, it has really made the price for those coins to pump really that much. But to say that $1, it's all another speculative price and no TAs or what but another push will certainly make it through hype.",

There may still be a possibility for Dogecoin to reach $1, but who knows when that will happen and no one can predict it. But with so much circulation of Dogecoin already circulating in the market and still in the wallets of many whales, we really don't know when that will happen.",

Elon is way too busy nowadays with twitter, we are long away from another massive bull run and the eme craze is ded.  That coupled with a constant mint of 10k new coins a minute is gonna burn doge up.",

Though Doge has its own big backers like Elon Musk, so it is exciting to see what's gonna be the future of our beloved meme coin in the upcoming years.That phrase is overly used here in cryptos. It can act to motivate or demotivate someone but before we use it on some coin, I think it would be better to make a research first so that you can at least make your predictions correct. Dogecoin is a meme coin but unlike a typical meme coin, it is already popular and being accepted on many platforms.And like you said, doge also have big backers so I think it's safe to assume that 1 dollar for this coin is possible and in fact we are already close to that price if there are no negative events that happened last time but we can always try again. I think it's more possible this time now that Elon already owned twitter and everyone is expecting that they will use doge as an official currency inside the platform.",

This is a meme token, always expect for a hype and manipulation, DOGE can work more in short term but I doubt on this if you will hold it for long term. If DOGE can reach that price, then many will become millionaire instantly, just buy what you can afford to take risk.",

The doge itself can go up caused by elon but since bearish trend is here and that's impossible for doge coin to take off right now. people must also aware if this time doge coin is still doing steady increase despite the dump that already occured to the market but doge coin would still able to go up. $1 might become a new ATH for doge coin. The previous ATH was not even touching $1 and so this posible to happen as long as the doge coin will be getting a very big hype at this moment. The only key is to be patience with it. The good news may come anytime soon. I think that anyone here who has been holding doge coin know about that. doge coin worthy to be used as long term investment.",

I highly doubt Doge would ever reach $1 even Elon Musk makes a tweet about Dogecoin. Sure many people waiting for that, but it doesn't remove the fact that it's just a meme coin and $1 price of meme coin is too good to be true.Quote from: shinratensei_ on November 17, 2022, 10:51:03 PMThen wait bitcoin to be bullish and you may see that happens.When Bitcoin was its ATH, Dogecoin wasn't even close to $1, or I would say it's close because the ATH for Dogecoin was $0.63. It's pretty difficult to reach that anymore with the whole cryptocurrency issue currently we are facing. The reason why it blew up because Elon Musk's tweet, not because Bitcoin bullish.",

(for bluetick, ads, etc)However, if at any time Elon Musk stops supporting it, it could return to its old value of $0.003 - $0.002 or maybe below. Reason unlimited supply without any use case.",

The only one who could answer this question is Elon, because he has put Doge in the position that it is today. For a coin meme, you don't have to look at the total supply or the utility it can bring, you just need to see who is backing it to get it to that price. Doge's ATH is $0.7, which means it's not too far to hit $1, if Elon continues to shill the doge in the next bull season, the possibility of Doge hitting $1 is possible. But if he stops shilling doge, it will be the end of dogecoin.",

Dogecoin is just like the Bitcoin of the meme industry as if dogecoin was to fail or not reach it targeted price then other meme coin has no chance of succeeding unless they changed targeted audience. Looking at dogecoin current price it won't take more that 10-12x for the coin to reach the $1 mark and with dogecoin such gains can be achieve quite easily Dogecoin would definitely touch the $1 price in next bullrun most especially as the number one fan now has control over the most popular social media platform for cryptocurrency. During the bull market, it'll take just one announcement for dogecoin to go skyrocketing.",
