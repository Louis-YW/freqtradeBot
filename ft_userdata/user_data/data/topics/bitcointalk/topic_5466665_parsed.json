You need to cram everything in its whitepaper despite knowing you're going to end with a copycat of a copycat of a CEX and a shitty token.QuoteThe order finds that although Opyn took certain steps to exclude U.S. persons from accessing the Opyn Protocol, such as blocking users with U.S. internet protocol addresses, those steps were not sufficient to actually block U.S. users from accessing the Opyn Protocol. Completely decentralized, permissionless and censorship resistant also I assume!  Quote from: joniboini on September 15, 2023, 01:50:26 AMI guess the profit outweighs the cons since they just get fined for less than $1 million for now. I don't think that's the case for all of those platforms:QuoteDeridex was an Algorand-powered derivatives platform. However, the project abruptly shut down in February, causing its TVL to fall from about $150,000 to $133 as of Sept. 8, according to DefiLlama.So this one went bust before even being fined, the other one is powered by a token with $400k in market cap, so hardly affordings millions.",

      "body": "Defi is a marketing keyword. It has no relation with the decentralisation. So anyone can use the term Defi but it doesn't necessarily have to be decentralised in any way. So I think CFTC is just doing their job. I foresee an increase in such kind of regulatory actions in future in the crypto related companies. It could be anything but many governments have now understood that they can't stop cryptocurrency. So now their focus is to control them.",
