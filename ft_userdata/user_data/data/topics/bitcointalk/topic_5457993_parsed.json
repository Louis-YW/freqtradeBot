      "body": "Am not raising a counterfeit efforts to your contributions but i think this has been recently posted as well as been discussed over time, there's no doubt that we have a lot of terms in which you yourself isn't aware of them or included them on the list you presented but i can tell that there's more to expect than this and you have taken much of your efforts on this aspect that needed less, I believe you're still learning and will improve more better with time.Here are few additional links to already created threads on terminologies.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364986.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3469416.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4958338.0",

      "body": "The great compilation you have made here, I get to know a few new terminologies which I could use to save my time. Which are:OTC, CT -- Fakeout, Retracement -- Degan. I am amazed there is a difference between Noob and Degan's terminologies used in trading. As I thought Noob means no knowledge about crypto but never thought there will be another term for those who have no knowledge but try to do trading too. BTW, I like the term, Degan, hehe it looks more professional than calling someone a noob and there is a pro to it too, which is another person whom we are going to call Degan will never mind it but mind it when we call him a noob. I read many other threads too, before reading this thread and after reading this thread (provided by other members). And i can say that knowledge is everywhere and you can get it from anyone, but you prefer only one among many. Why? Because of great representation. And i can say your way of representing and creating excitement about the topic is great.",

      "body": "This is a good move mate. I actually like the fact that there are lots of good stuff like this coming up every time for newbies to see. It looks more interesting as you have cited more examples to your own write up which makes more sense and I must say if you had done a good research on this platform, you would notice that there are lots of such threads already existing. I think it would have been better to add it to there or possibly cite them here too to add up to their own write up adding yours to the number of posters that have been able to do such tasks by themselves.I think it would also be of help to others too who are fresh and still having to go through the platform looking for things themselves.OP, I would suggest you also include a source from where you copied so as to facilitate further research.",

The scam is kept going by pretending to pay returns, but using invested money instead of actual returns.Bitcoin itself cannot be a ponzi because it does not generate returns, nobody is running it, and it is 100% transparent.",

However, based on my own experience, I didn’t put an effort studying all these terminologies because you will actually learn them as you keep on experiencing trading and investing in the market.

Exactly. But it’s not surprising anymore as we often have newbies entering the forum so they will ask the questions again and again even if we are tired answering of it. Nevertheless, these terminologies are quite helpful but for me, I don’t think we’ll put high consideration on forcing yourself to learn from it since we will get used to it and be familiar about it once we stay long term in the forum.",
