      "body": "You seem to get thigns wrong here, no one has such plans of holding bitcoin forever without selling or wants to die with their bitcoin, the caught here is to hold your bitcoin long enough for you to get some compounding effect on it, you know historically bitcoin has proven to favour long term holders more than short term holders and that's why most people teach to hold bitcoin for long cause its more safer and more profitable.You know big companies like MSTR by Michael Saylor that said its better to sell his company shares than to seel his bitcoin, these men understand the value of bitcoin and hence wants to continue accumulating it. I don't believe anyone is investing in bitcoin without any reason, or is holding for long without having any goal on what to use his bitcoin for maybe to buy a luxury car or a lifestyle, but to achieve such profits you must have a very reasonable amount of stake in bitcoin as it grows, so you should not just be holding bitcoin indefinitely but you should be thinking about accumulating and adding more bitcoin to your stash, so if you really want to hold for longer you would have a much better reward for your holdings, I recommend using the DCA strategy cause it helps reduce the impact of market volatility on your Portfolio and you can be very flexible around it, yeah if your someone who has a busy schedule and want to but on dips then DCA would also make sure to have some of that intervals bought on dip prices.",

I find it so confusing that after investing so much in Bitcoin for years we won't want to sell our bitcoin till we die. Do not get yourself mixed up, their is no correctness in all what you said here. We priorize ourselves into investing our money into Bitcoin not with the aim of staring at it in our wallet for ever probably till we kick the bucket, we did invest with the sole reason of making profits and living the life we hope for but still on the long run before we get the desired return of investment it is expected of us to hold for a long time.

I would not emphasize on how and when you should sell your Bitcoin, it's something personal which you should decide by yourself. You can initially take part of your profit but not sell all, so you can experience another all time high after another cycle must have happened.",

Some people want to keep Bitcoin for retirement, others for the well-being of their children, and others who plan to spend. After 10 or 20 years, if you have a stable job and life, you will rarely try to sell your Bitcoin.",

They don’t actually mean they are never going to sell it but rather this kind of expression stems out from the belief that bitcoin is going to continuously grow hence the saying that they will hold on.They will hold on until they die is kind of saying that no matter what happens, no amount of fud can make them sell their holdings. At least that’s what I think. I do not know any person who plans on never selling their coins.",

On what principles guide your actions in the realm of Bitcoin (BTC)?You are taking it too literal, when people say they will hold forever this is just a figure of speech, they just mean that they will either hold their bitcoin for as long as they can afford to do it, or that they will hold bitcoin for so long that by the time they want to spend some of it, they will spend bitcoin directly without the need to sell for fiat.However it is up to each person to decide for how long they want to hold their bitcoin, so if you have a figure in your head at which you want to sell, you can do it as at the end that is your bitcoin and you can do what you want with it.",

On what principles guide your actions in the realm of Bitcoin (BTC)?I mean these are just subjective so anyone can do whatever they want to do, There were just some traders that HODL Bitcoin until the day they died, probably because they wanted their sons and daughters to inherit it because probably they believed that in the future Bitcoin is going to be in a much higher market price for sure, and nothing is wrong about that I dont really believe that they just want to hold it for long term and not use it at all but they just doing it so that someone could inherit it, a lot of people have different takes on this, personally I wouldn't really want to Hold Bitcoin for a very long time or until I die because it just didn't make sense to me not using that money that I invested my self, so for me its always a wise way to always take the profit if you could because the market is a cycle so there are always a opportunity to reinvest it and make a profit again, we could probably say that its a chill way to investment if your just doing it long term and just waiting for something to happened.These long-term holders are people who already have a huge amount of money, I mean for someone who doesnt have a consistent income I wouldn't really recommend it, I mean at some point you gonna need to sell that Bitcoin if you just don't have the financial foundation so I could always recommend sell at your target market price if you can and not just holding it for life. As long as you're selling at a much higher market price and taking your profit you're not doing anything wrong. It's still subjective so if it's your investment you can do anything you want to it.",

It won't make you rich but you'll always have some exposure to crypto.Capital management is first important thing. How many percent of your capital is your favorite to assign for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, will decide whether you stay in the market, hold your cryptocurrency or will take profit all and exit the market, or just take profit partially.Assume you want like minimum 20% of your capital in cryptocurrency, if your portfolio is up 100%, it is not bad to take profit most of it to have cash in your capital drops back to 20% or higher.Your portfolio can be change with time, capital distribution can be changed with time but if you get profit, re-balance your capital is good practice.",

On what principles guide your actions in the realm of Bitcoin (BTC)?Let me ask you, what is your goal the first time you invest in Bitcoin? It is to earn a profit with your investment, right? In that case, you don't need to hold your Bitcoin forever, think of a price target and if you think you are satisfied with your earnings, you can sell anytime you want as long as you have a profit. Don't just invest, learn to make a profit. Remember that you can reinvest anytime if we enter again the bear market, the bull market is the season where we should be enjoying our profit and not just holding our investment. Withdraw a partial of it if you don't want to leave without any investment, at least you can enjoy and feel the success of your investment.",
