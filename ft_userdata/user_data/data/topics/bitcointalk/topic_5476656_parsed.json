Gives me a smirk and goosebumps because of my points plus, but what left me in disbelief is that an NBA team hasn't scored in 6 minutes. What do you guys think about this one? quite sus for me",

What do you guys think about this one? quite sus for me Yes, that was amazing feat, but I remember the match, Golden vs. Dallas, two years ago, where Golden didn't score a point for 9m 38sec! After check was run 28-0 for Dallas, which is simply impossible with Curry in starting 5!",
