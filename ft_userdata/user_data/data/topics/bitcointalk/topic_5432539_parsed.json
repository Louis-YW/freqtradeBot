  "content": "\"Giant Earthmovers Left Abandoned And Now They're Mine!\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpZXl4DnMx0Above we have an example of how to acquire assets valued in excess of $50,000 for \"free\".There are abandoned bulldozers, excavators and construction equipment in a remote location on a mountain. Which the legal owners are willing to part with for free, to anyone who is willing to haul them away. The catch is the scrap metal value of the construction equipment isn't enough to make the project feasible. To turn a profit, everything has to be repaired and restored to be fully operational and sold at market value. There are probably plenty of abandoned vehicles and motorcycles which might be acquired for free, which fall under a similar heading. In many cases, the cost of parts and repairs could be valued more than the vehicles themselves are worth. But of course, there can be exceptions as illustrated in some recent discovery channel reality shows revolving around buying and selling used goods and building junkyard empires.Are there good methods of legally acquiring free assets people would like to share? In crypto, we have airdrops and faucets which have somewhat fallen by the wayside and become forgotten it seems. Is there a way to revive interest in faucets and airdrops? How could it be done, how would you do it? Mining also used to be a good method of acquiring free assets. Is it possible to revive crypto mining?",

Is there a way to revive interest in faucets and airdrops? How could it be done, how would you do it?  Airdrops and faucets are still around i guess, just that people don't see it as being worth their time, it is still along the lines of something that is free would prolly not be worth anything for you. Many of these airdrops also request people to submit their data, thus exchange of ones data for worthless coins is never a bargain.Quote from: Hydrogen on December 31, 2022, 05:43:30 PMMining also used to be a good method of acquiring free assets. Is it possible to revive crypto mining? Do you mean cloud mining? Turns out it is mostly a scam nowadays to enrich the scammer running/providing the service.",

      "body": "One day my uncle told me the following story.  He (the general director of a limited liability company) sold the production shop to the buyer (joint stock company).  The buyer's lawyer included a condition in the contract that the production hall must be completely cleared of industrial equipment at the time of transfer to the buyer.  For violation of this condition, the seller organization had to pay a huge fine.  After signing the contract, my uncle realized that he would not be able to clear the production hall of industrial equipment by the appointed time.  What to do?!!!  Suddenly, he had a great idea....  He posted an ad inviting other city organizations to buy this equipment from him.  He set a low selling price, but set one condition - the buyers had to dismantle the equipment and pick it up from the production shop on their own (on a self-delivery basis).  By the appointed day, the workshop was completely free of industrial equipment.  Uncle sold the production shop, avoided a fine and made money selling industrial equipment.",

Thus i don't think you are even getting them for free per se, because you are definitely going to put in time and resources into something that might turn out unsuccessful.There are assets that fall under the \"low supply\" and \"low demand\" category that can generally yield a good profit if you hold onto them for a certain amount of time or find someone with a good interest in them. Two examples of these could be vinyls and grand pianos - but it doesn't stop there - there's many other items that can be resold for a higher price.I've seen huge victorian writing desks (that look like they're made similar to antique grand pianos) get listed for between $4000-$16000+. Grand pianos themselves (and organs) are either worthless or worth thousands (and sometimes both at the same time).There's then the opportunity of transforming things into other items that are either usable or not. There's a decent number of old busses that get turned into campervans, a few airplanes that get turned into hotels. If you make something saught after and turn a profit, you might just be on to something.",

Just as in competitions/celebrations that are broadcast on TV/social media on weekends which give away prizes for free, we can get free assets in the form of vehicles or money or anything else by simply following the easy requirements steps.In my opinion, this depends on whether the owner of the goods/assets wants to give it or not. By law, if the owner of the goods has released the goods from their status of ownership, both junk and good goods, then anyone who wants them has the right to get these assets for free.",

Is it possible to revive crypto mining? Nothing is forgotten, the faucets still exist, the numbers have changed, and the rewards of 5000 satoshis that were before, are now 5 or 10 satoshis, with the fact that every faucet has at least one short link that you need to pass + captcha + antibot links before you get award. In addition, such an activity only seems to be free, because you are investing your time, which is extremely limited and expensive.I don't know what kind of crypto mining you are talking about, but it was never free because it always required a device + energy + time, and nothing has changed in that regard until today. Do you want us to somehow shut down all BTC miners and have everyone mine again with their personal computers - or do you think we should somehow tokenize crypto mining since you think every problem can be solved with a token?",

Depends on the coin that you are going to mine. If we are talking about BTC then yes because the difficulty have increased through the roof but back in time, they say that we can mine a BTC even using only a simple computer and even a USB miner. I think even a powerful smartphone can also handle it. Imagine that? We can also disregard mining but faucets alone can already give us a good number of BTC on the same date where BTC is still not popular but now the faucet rates are reduced dramatically. About the abandoned vehicles.I think these will depend on the locations. If you are on well developed countries then you can easily get these for free but it will be hard to hunt one in a poorer country.",

Also, the rule was that you can return such packaging only in the country where you bought it, so tourists leave behind a lot of plastic packaging that means nothing to locals. However, in my country, all waste has been sorted for years, so we specifically collect plastic, paper, glass, biowaste and other mixed waste - which results in a much cleaner country than 10+ years ago.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 01, 2023, 10:11:02 PMAnd that's great the EU has adopted the \"bottle bill\" model, because not only does it help the environment, but it actually redistributes wealth to a small extent.  As I said, many homeless folks (and people with homes as well) can make enough to survive in the US states that have bottle bills.  Unfortunately, it's only a small number of them.You have to take into account that each member of the EU can have its own specific laws, and given the language barriers, I cannot say what is happening in Romania or Spain in this regard - but I think it is similar with all federal states in the US, except that you perfectly understand each other because you speak the same language. There are many stories in my country about how people managed to educate their children by collecting such packaging, and how it is still an additional source of income for them today. I personally know a man who has developed a unique method in this matter, which is that he is well informed about when a celebration is happening somewhere (birthday, wedding) and offers the service of collecting all plastic, aluminum and glass packaging, and rich people usually agree because they don't need that money anyway.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on January 01, 2023, 10:11:02 PMOh man....whenever anyone mentions faucets my mind goes back to when I first really got into bitcoin.  There were tons of them, and that's how I acquired my first few satoshis.  I'd still consider what you get from them \"free\", even if you're spending a few seconds going through the motions of the captcha, ads, and whatever else is required.That's how I earned my first Bitcoin, but it wasn't that hard considering the price was around $200 and the fact that compared to today it was very easy to collect satoshis through faucets. A good faucet rotator and a few referrals could generate up to 500 000 satoshis in one day. Of course, from the perspective of that time, it was very little in fiat value, but in later years we all know that this value increased to unprecedented values.",
