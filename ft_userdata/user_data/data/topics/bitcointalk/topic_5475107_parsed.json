Yes positive affirmation is a good habit that every trader must inculcate in their daily exercise because it has it's way of impacting on how we make trading decisions. Trading success does not come by chance, it is a deliberate process that involves both technical and psychological preparedness.  First step is to believe that success is possible and achievable.",

      "body": "Since there is a section to discuss trading matters I think this post should be transferred to that section.  The first thing a trader needs to do trading is the right mindset of trading and the right understanding of trading. When a new trader has a clear mindset about trading, he can make different plans about trading. A true trader's job is to have a sound understanding of trading along with risking some money and analyzing the market in the right coin at the right time. In the beginning, a trader's patience to risk money is a bit difficult, but later, when the new trader continues to trade gradually, he will become more skilled and adept at trading. Apart from deciding to trade, a trader should regularly try to keep an idea about trading and try to learn about new things only then a new trader will be successful in trading.",

That's the common thing and dream that everyone is sharing. We trade because we've heard and seen it to the others that did it and they became successful. But that's not the actual thing there, we don't see them struggle and people only think of profiting which is right. And when they go to the actuality of it, the problem goes by that they're having problems of accepting the behavior of the market on how hard it is and it's unlikely to survive if you come unprepared.Quote from: sotelorene on November 22, 2023, 08:31:06 PMSome of the spirit of a trader or invest is \"I can make it mindset, resilience... These are the traders or investors that have a long term goal on what they have entered. They know that this is a game that's not for the less patient people but it's for the people that have understood that it's going to be a long game for them. Resiliency is also one thing that shall developed for most because it doesn't come by easy when you trade. It does comes naturally and gets along with your goal of how long you would like to stay on this market.",

Really? I haven't heard anyone claiming that. I am not sure where you encounter these people. I even tried to see if i find anything like that from the internet by googling \"trading is easy\" and all i  got was articles claiming that trading is hard work. But if you have heard someone, influencer, or anyone saying that, unsubscribe and don't listen. You have probably been part of some weird echo chamber and need to revisit everything else you have heard. There are way more ex poor traders than there are successful ones, because trading, especially day trading is hard. High frequency trading is done by bots so fast that no normie would have an access to that kind of tech. It's a game of probability, patience, math and luck. It's time consuming and so stressfull that i can't put a figure what would compensate the work.Maybe some people are build to take that kind of stress, and sleepless nights. But i don't think many relationships survive that kind of need to be able to act fast and trade at all times. So i really don't know where you heard about this sunshine, but either you were lied to or they don't know anything.Just hodl and you can have a satifying life while doing it.",

As a trader, you will have losses (even professionals have losses, let alone someone at a beginner level), but all of that counts.

That's how it goes, and it has been like that. No one can predict the market perfectly all the time without making some errors.",

Patience is a virtue that is important in any business, not just in trading or investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Many people lose money because they are not patient enough to learn about the business they want to invest in. Trading is a complex and dynamic sector of the crypto industry, this entails that traders will have to spend time to learn about the rudiments of the sector. Impatient people cannot invest in Bitcoin because sometimes takes more than your predicted time to make a profit. Most people had to sell off their coins even at a loss because of impatience. Bitcoin investment is not a get-rich-quick scheme and it's not also a Ponzi scheme so there is a need to have a long-term investment mentality. Many people have lost money in the sector due to carelessness, ignorance, or scams but it didn't stop them from investing again. This is why every investor needs to be dogged and persistent.
