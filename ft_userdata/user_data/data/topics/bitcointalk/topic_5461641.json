I'm someone who has never been a fan of controlled environment especially if it I'm not the one controlling my situation. For instance, If I have some money in the bank and they lock me out of the account or something shitty happens, I'd be in a situation where I can't control what happens next. Other reasons why I love Bitcoin / Blockchain / Crypto: The thrill: As someone who loves innovation and technology, its thrilling to know how distrubuted systems like the blockchain work automously and still reach consensus. Amazing stuff. Permissionless Identify and activities.Money as motivator   - there's ton of opportunities in the space and it's permissionless to participate. Of course, there are other reasons but I'd like to keep the list short here.",

It is such an effective investment that the possibility of gaining a huge profit is huge in the next few years.

Bitcoin needs altcoins too even many altcoins are scam. The cryptocurrency market should not have only Bitcoin and altcoins are necessary for the market.QuoteMy reasons for adoption of bitcoin is that.1. It gives financial freedom and can be used across boarders without a third party.People will have control of their bitcoin if they use non custodial wallets. If they use custodial wallets from like exchanges, gambling sites, they will not control their bitcoin.No control, no chance to have financial freedom because they can lose their bitcoin, capital anytime.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsQuote2. I also use it as an investment and a store of value. As an investment, you will see it that bitcoin is the most valuable investment that one can make a good profit from, if you can hodli you bitcoin for a long term. For store of value,because fiat is depreciating in value daily due to inflation but bitcoin is inflation resistance.Consider Bitcoin as an investment asset and as a store of value is the same. You should not invest in Bitcoin if you see it is not a store of value. Bitcoin itself is inflationary because new bitcoins will appear with each new Bitcoin block.There are already 19,444,675 BTC mined by miners and already exist in Bitcoin circulating supply.The curve starts to be flattened out and not many bitcoin will be mined from new blocks in future.Quote3. Bitcoin is the future gold because soon people that have bitcoin will be the richest or most wealthy people in the world as long as they only keep on accumulating their bitcoin.Not all people who have bitcoin can become rich, millionaires or billionaires. It depends on how many bitcoins they have.",

A system that gives you an alternative to traditional fiat and has a chance to be big in terms of speculative trading, caught my attention. It's main reason why I feel it's useful is it's borderlessness, censorship resistance and decentralisation. These factors make it more attractive to clear the cons of a fiat currency. There are many other altcoins out there but there ar no real alternative to bitcoin itself. It is one of a kind and hence I adopted it.Although chances of using Bitcoin in any specific sector is less. We can assume it to take over the economy in future and thus accumulate it for now from providing services and work.",

Over the years my reasons have changed, early on I was just impressed with the technology and being a newbie back then I did not knew much about the extreme movements this market can experience from time to time.However as time has passed, even if I am still impressed by the technology behind bitcoin, my main reason to hold bitcoin became self-preservation, even if the fiat system could last way past my life expectancy at the same time it is already showing worrying signs, and I do not want to waste all my efforts by keeping my savings in a currency that losses value every day, and as such bitcoin is one of the assets I decided to hold in order to preserve the value of the money I have saved over the years.",

While it is true that Bitcoin was not originally conceived solely as a medium of exchange akin to traditional fiat currencies, in my country, using cryptocurrencies for day-to-day transactions like fiat is strictly prohibited. Consequently, I am unable to utilize them for purchasing goods or food as doing so would violate the law.Though I could resort to clandestine means, there still exist traditional, yet effective, ways to procure essential goods and basic necessities. Therefore, my adoption of cryptocurrencies is primarily driven by the hope of reaping future benefits from the purchases I make using them.",

Actually, make a profit is the most important one, because if Bitcoin were constantly making losses, and eventually went to 0, all its essential attributes, such as decentralization or limiting supply, would become useless.But profit aside, I only hold Bitcoin because it is a way of storing and transferring value that does not depend on a state or banking institutions.

Cryptocurrency is a lasting trend that'll proceed to supply advantages for individuals and businesses into the future.   A major reason for my adoption of cryptocurrency would be the aspect that it isn't managed by a national government unlike the fiat currencies and the low risk of mishandling cryptocurrency as there's no paper version.
