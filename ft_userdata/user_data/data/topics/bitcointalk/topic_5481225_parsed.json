Although, if you know a mining pool operator, the person can help you to include your transaction into a block. There is free ViaBTC accelerator, but people that wants to submit their transactions every hour are many, taking up the 100 transactions within 1 or 2 seconds, making it not impossible for most people to make use of the free accelerator.",

Look, nodes validate BTC tx's and keep them in their mempool, waiting for miners to pick up this unconfirmed tx's and add it to their block, nodes have always stored uncomfirmed tx's in their mempool. Mempool has nothing to do with speeding up BTC tx's or high tx fees, if you are talking about bigger block size, then it makes more sense.",

Bundling multiple transactions into a single batch allows them to be processed as a single unit. This lowers the mempool's overall transaction count, improving space efficiency and reducing congestion. Algorithms can rank transactions according to their size and fee. Prioritising and managing high-fee, low-size transactions can help the mempool clear quickly over time and potentially reduce overall congestion.Viabtc is a cryptocurrency exchange and mining pool that was established in 2016. A variety of cryptocurrencies, including Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bitcoin (BTC), are supported, and this Chinese company provides services. Because of Viabtc's dependable infrastructure, reasonable fees, and user-friendly interface, the cryptocurrency community has grown to love it. Its mining pool and exchange services make mining operations easier and give users a place to buy, sell, and trade digital assets suitable for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.Recalling that improving the mempool is an ongoing project requiring a combination of technological advancements, community consensus, and coordinated efforts from network users is imperative. The strategies and tactics employed by different blockchain networks to deal with mempool congestion may differ.",

First there is no general mempool but rather each node has its own mempool. It is were transactions broadcasted are first stored in before each nodes pick those transactions and include them into their candidate block and subsequently to later to the blockchain. It is not it that stored on the blockchain but the transactions in the block, it is just like a waiting room first for transactions before they get selected into the block by each node.Now if there is anything that needs to be improved for transactions confirmation it is the block that actually holds the transaction in a blockchain. If the size of the block is increase then there will be more transactions included in a single block and it will in turn increases the number of transactions getting Confirmation.",

      "body": "There isn't a way to improve the mempool. It's a single feature that all nodes keep a copy of for themselves once a transaction is broadcasted to the network. The term you're hearing about mempool being clogged is because a lot of those unconfirmed transactions are stored in the mempool, until such time that a miner decides to include these transactions in the block that they mined. You don't improve the area wherein broadcasted transactions are stored. The high fees are causing all of these unconfirmed transactions, and the mempool has nothing to do with it.",

There is no single node nor a global node that represents all the transactions. Do you know what happen when a transaction is broadcast?It gets rebroadcasted across all the nodes of the bitcoin network and before each node accept a transaction into their pool, they validate it and confirm if it was a authentic transaction(meet consensus rule of bitcoin transaction) and then rebroadcast the copy to another nodes until the transaction is broadcasted to all available nodes on the bitcoin network. This is where they stay until a miner take them, mine them before included in the next block and they can contain as much as many transactions depending on the size of the mempool.The question is how should a bitcoin block size contain more transaction so that the we don't have to experience more transactions waiting on the mempool, that has been an unending argument by developers, everyone has different opinions regarding this but just mote that the each bitcoin block size can accommodate a maximum of 4 million weight units.",
