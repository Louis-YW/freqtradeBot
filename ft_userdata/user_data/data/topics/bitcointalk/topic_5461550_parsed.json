Pi coins cannot be sold?the mined pi coins can not be traded in exchanges because no exchange has listed Pi yet. What you are seeing trading on Huobi are not actual Pi coins, and you can not withdraw them once you have bought them.What you see now is people buying the coins on p2p level but at a much lower price like this guy",
