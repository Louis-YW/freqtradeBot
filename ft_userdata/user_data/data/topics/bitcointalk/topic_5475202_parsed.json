  "content": "BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed complete support for bitcoin, stating that it is an \"international asset\" that can be used as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. This is an important development because BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, and its clients could potentially invest billions of dollars in bitcoin if the bitcoin ETF is approved. This will surely lead to a huge  increase in the price of bitcoin.The next bitcoin halving is less than 10 months away. This event, which occurs approximately every four years, reduces the amount of new bitcoin that is created. Soon, the Federal Reserve is likely to be forced to cut interest rates and start printing money again at some point in the next 18 months. This would make bitcoin even more attractive as a hedge against inflation. However, I believe the next two years could be very bullish for bitcoin. With the combination of BlackRock's support, the next bitcoin halving, and a potential return of QE could drive the price of bitcoin to a new all-time highs.You can agree with me that;BlackRock's CEO has expressed support for bitcoin.BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager.BlackRock's clients could potentially invest billions of dollars in bitcoin.BlackRock is considering offering a bitcoin ETF.The next bitcoin halving is less than 10 months away.The bitcoin halving will reduce the supply of new bitcoin.The Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates and start printing money again.QE would make bitcoin even more attractive as a hedge against inflation.",

You just have to understand what are the narratives from behind his entities like BlackRock and why he made that statement and why they are looking for a Bitcoin Spot ETF approval for their clients. It's because the massive profits that they are going to make if SEC will allow it. And with that kind of influence they have as they are trillion asset company, we should not be surprised of their positive support to BTC.",

A next halving is only about less than six months from today. It is estimated to happen in April 2024. It is about 152 days from now.https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/QuoteThe bitcoin halving will reduce the supply of new bitcoin.This is true but it is not something really new. People know about that but they just ignore the fact and only recognize about it with each Bitcoin halving.QuoteThe Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates and start printing money again.QE would make bitcoin even more attractive as a hedge against inflation.It's true but effects from FED and other national central banks usually need a lot of time, months and years to be shown at national scale and global scale. Their citizens will very slowly realize effects from inflation or hyper inflation by central banks.",

But this is just my opinion; I'm not sure about this yet. But when that is actually approved, it will also be favorable to Tin for sure in the end because there will be many profits on the day of the bull run.",

He's not the first one who said those words and probably won't be the last. Sure thing, he can use his influence as a known person in investment industry firm just like Saylor of microstrategy. While they both talk much more bullish about bitcoin because that's their platform, because sure their business will benefit the most.",

The crypto market is now spread across every country and BlackRock fully supports Bitcoin assets now. The upcoming bull season will be even stronger.It could be, the main purpose of what you say friend",
