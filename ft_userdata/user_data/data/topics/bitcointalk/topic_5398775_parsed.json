      "body": "If the wallet is password-protected, and this will not be the case if its from a *very* old Core version before this was implemented, you will need to pass a particular password argument to pywallet so it can decrypt the encrypted private keys.I swear I saw that option somewhere, but now I can't find it anymore in the README. Else the private keys will all be encrypted with an AES256 intermediate secret contained inside the wallet (also) that can only be decrypted with the wallet.dat password.",
