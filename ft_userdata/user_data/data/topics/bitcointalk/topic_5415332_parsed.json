Plus they have always \"liquid\" markets, that allow scalpings or easy cashout at any time of a game. In the past I have used other bookie with exchange but the game experience was definetely different",

Some of these brokers are legit, but some are scammers who scam some of their customers in smart ways. For example, some of my friends had issues with Orbit, Bet in Asia etc.Am not really sure about the clone sites option which could be a decent solution, but I never tried accessing them for various reasons.",

It would mean that lay bets are not provided by real users but by the platform itself, don't you think? When I look at oddschecker.com, odds from betting exchanges listed (Betfair and Smarkets) are usually not the same as the ones from other sportbooks, especially the higher ones. To provide a lay bet with an high odd you need a large bank roll because you'll need to pay X times the stake if you lose, that's why high odds are usually smaller than ones offered by bookmakers.",

The gambling site has rules that have been followed by members, if you are forbidden to play there, don't continue it because you will have the problem in the future.

Then you could use an API from betfair and then cast it in a white label construction and then without value of course. I think it is possible, but we have seen few successful betting exchanges focused on crypto. Fairlay was also quite successful for a while, but I have to say that I don't like the interface and it is also very unclear. I hope that one day we will see a kind of similar layout from Betfair or another provider but for crypto market.",
