Results are thru algorithms and if most if not all players would win on a single day, then there might be a problem with the system but by anyhow, the online casino should be responsible enough to pay those winnings whether it would result to bankruptcy.Quote from: Oshosondy on June 21, 2023, 03:11:08 PMIt is very possible that can happen to a new casino.But the chance that a punter would win a huge amount of money to run the casino down is very low.

Gambling sites are paying huge amount of money to run their platform and they are simply paying professionals to handle things and avoid such bad scenarios. Also, before a platform is released to public, there'll be and should be a pilot testing if they are really serious of prolonging the existence of their site, not unless they are after with bad intentions toward their players right from the start.",

And, you answered your own question to be honest. Most often that people misinterpret is that if casinos go bankrupt they are thinking it's out of money (that's just partly true) but to be honest, it's already out of customers and the causes might be poor management, doesn't go with the trend, more to be paid on services than what is earned, etc.",

Having that kind of huge jackpot is very rare for a casino to experience a multiple hit like that that will destroy their bankroll.Problem is not all gambling sites are having good systems to have such feauture, unfortunately. I'd also say this is possible with both small and big platforms as long as their system is not monitored to avoid such problems. Indeed jackpots are a bit of a percentage, most of the time, of the total platform's fund and this is already one way to avoid bankruptcy. No gambling site in their right mind, would put all of their funds in a single winning. This instance just sounds impossible because it rarely happens, but not because of that, casinos would be too comfortable. We are in online platform and glitches maay happen in a sudden.Quote from: ralle14 on June 21, 2023, 03:45:38 PMCasinos don't need an algorithm when the house edge is there for them to do the work.Algorithm, I think, still matters. If there's no such thing their edge would be overpowered by continuous winnings of the players, especially if it won't be a single gambler who'd be in such place. Edge of a casino works with the majority's transactions and losses, but if the other way around, that is pere problem would more likely arise as in line with the topic.",

There might be some cases/reasons that can make a casino bankrupt because of players get big win. One example is that a casino that do not know how to set their max winning per bet, it may make players take all the house's bankroll. Lets say a casino has small bankroll at $100k but the casino allow win per bet up to $10k or even more.",
