      "body": "Those active groups and channels on social media are mostly paid services, where they offer you a few free predictions that might not all be correct and want you to pay for their service in order to add you to their main prediction group, where you can get real signals, which are not 100% guarantees that the trade must always be in your favor.Sorry to say, there is actually no way that I have known of earning from crypto without any form of investment. Investment might not just be your physical cash on funds; you just need to invest something, either your time, attention, or money, and sometimes both. You can actually give a try to the bounty section, where you can see a few bounties that you can participate in, but the payment is not highly guaranteed, even if they end up paying a lot of them, sometimes they always end up completely worthless.Another form of earning from or with crypto is to advertise your skills and services, which you can offer to both the community and outside community members. You will be paid for any form of service rendered based on your specialization, which might be design, development, etc.Another way you can also earn is from the signature campaign aspect, which is not possible for you right now based on your rank. You will need to be at least a member rank before you can see the signature, which might have an open slot for you to apply for and start rendering your posting service.",

Most of them are just giving you off some lousy chart and copy cat gain photos which arent from them. As a newbie you should be focusing more on learning here in forum and avoid such shortcut to earn bitcoin easily. There is no way to earn that fast aside from learning to understanding it first.",

Please Don't believe in investment advices because no one can garantee that you will earn from buying any of the cryptos you see in he actual market.Weekly income of 20-30$ isn't that much. You can earn 4-5$ daily if you do freelance jobs but it always depends on the skills you have.

But if you want to participate in signature you have to rank up first, if you are making positive contributions to the forum, then you will definitely be receiving merit, if you are after merits that's when you won't be getting it and you might endup going against the forum rules.",

I don't believe in any signals because the majority of groups that provide signals are simply also  predicting as we also doing, and the few groups signal that actually provide signals are merely using their subscribers as a means of profit because they never provide the optimal selling window.I think they are all scams, there is no guarantee of generating any money via groups signal.

Once you can provide good service here you may be able to start earning without having to invest any amount. However, before you can do any of this, you must learn things from the forum first, especially becoming familiar with the site's basic regulations which I can see that some member have provided you with the link that will guide you.In a nutshell, let me just say that you can be earning money in Bitcointalk here by joining Bounty which is by doing advertising about some new projects, so tasks will been given to you and once the the manager in charge is satisfied with you work you may be rewarded with usdt or tokens but no guarantee that all project you work for will pay you after completing the tasks you are given to, another one is signature which you can't join currently because of low rank, ranks that do get the opportunity to join the signature campaigns are ranks start from member rank upward.",
