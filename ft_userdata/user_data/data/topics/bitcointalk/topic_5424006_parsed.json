Huge number of people find it as an investment and not as an alternate to the traditional fiat. Based on that, there is less chances of bitcoin getting used as regular transaction asset for the reason more software developers work from their homes.Adoption rate increasing at 50% won't happen. Such thing could happen associated with some special events. The next special event is supposed to be on the year 2024. Maybe by then such a massive adoption could happen.",

We're sure that the adoption will increase but I just don't know what the percentage will be. Since the pandemic started, the setup of working from home has been in demand and this makes it easy for those that still not aware of what bitcoin is to have that idea.And that is because they'll be focusing more on the web and it's very likely that they'll research bitcoin. But, it's not just going to be limited to software developers, it's for the most that has the access to the internet whether they WFH or not.",

The rate of adoption is growing each year, this is something that we know it is happening but an increase of 50% in a matter of months seem like a huge increase if you ask me.Besides this is something difficult to quantify, as not only we cannot tell how many of the addresses which present activity for the first time belong to new investors or simply to someone that creates a new wallet, and if we were to make a survey the results will be useless as a lot of people will refuse to reveal they are holding bitcoin at the time as it is simply not a good idea to reveal that information to anyone.",

Its possible that Bitcoin usage would keep increasing every year if people are becoming aware of it. Bitcoin has so many benefits that I think most people would like to enjoy if they are aware of it. But a bullish market or price seems to be the biggest form of attracting for Bitcoin investors or users. Most people don't like investing or using Bitcoin when the price is dropping because of the fear of the unknown. They prefer buying it at a very high price hoping that the price would keep increasing. Developing nations that have a high population of unbanked people might be a very good target for Bitcoin education or awareness. But these individuals also face other challenges such as lack of access to electricity, mobile phone, internet, and some of them are suffering from poverty. But i am sure that Bitcoin awareness and education is one of the most potent tool that would help in the increase of Bitcoin adoption.",

While we’re all being optimistic about the growth and adoption of bitcoin, we should be also be realistic. I doubt the rate of bitcoin adoption would increase by 50% more than what the current percentage in the current year. I wish it were so but sadly, I would disagree with you. 50% is a pretty much high percentage. Perhaps you know something everyone on here don’t. You stated that you know from the second quarter kit the year 2023, a lot of software developers would be working from home. Why is that? Would there be another pandemic that would make the world shut down again? We recently just got out of a pandemic where we had to shut down business and most people had to work from home and that didn’t increase the adoption by 50%.",

From the way the space is, many individuals manage multiple wallets that are created and destroyed on the fly, money sent to and from them for the sake of obfuscation, and even exchanges trading crypto within artificial accounts between each other to display false volume.The way the world is going now, people are going to dump their fiat for crypto. That's the way I see it. The number of bitcoin wallets vs the balance on the network and also miners' hash rates are all determinant factors to point out the level of bitcoin usage and that being said exchange and other services are just one segment of the entire network, when the numeric is accumulated in total then the can conclude the level of adoption. And considering the level of Bitcoin adoption in terms of usage and also the network engagement we may see a rapid multiplication in volume in the Bitcoin network.",
