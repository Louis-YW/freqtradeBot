This decision paves the way for the US government to move forward with selling the $4.4 billion worth of BTC.The decision effectively upholds a 2022 ruling by the US District Court for the Northern District of California, which ordered the government to liquidate Bitcoin under existing laws.The case, brought by Battle Born Investments, argued that the company had acquired rights to the Bitcoin through a bankruptcy estate connected to the Silk Road. Battle Born claimed that the Bitcoin was stolen by an individual known as “Individual X,” who allegedly took the funds from Silk Road.Read in full --- https://cryptobriefing.com/supreme-court-silk-road-bitcoin/",

A warning to leverage enthusiasts is, with such news, now and in future with actual sale waves, price will be very volatile and if they use leverages with open positions in such time, they will be liquidated and lose money.I don't know when they will start their sales but if it is after the President Election in USA., something can be changed if Trump get elected.

      "body": "This sale of $4.4B of Bitcoin may temporarily shake the price action of Bitcoin but is highly unlikely to wreak havoc for the long term. Looking back when governments have sold large quantities of Bitcoins, for example by the US, the market somehow always manages to absorb the additional supply after a period of time. Demand would remain strong in Bitcoin because the institutional interest and adoption by large players is still prevalent. Of course, there might be some downward pressure at this point in time, but overall, demand would remain strong.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/us-government-preparing-to-sell-30000-silk-road-bitcoin-on-chain-data-showsBesides that, Bitcoin's current price level is holding up above $62,000 amidst the uncertainty. I think currently key support levels seem intact, and unless something drastically shakes market confidence, a slide below $60,000 isn't assured. While some short-term volatility is possible, I believe these sales as a positive, that even after government auctions, Bitcoin continues to retain value.",

The short-term negative effect is definitely here but if they decide sell, it's a very good signal for holders to sell Bitcoin immediately and wait for the dip because there should be a good deep and recovery will definitely be fantastic because the post halving effect will be in action in a few months.Btw I bet that their CEX of choice will be Coinbase.",

Back in the day when they had coins, they'd put them on auction and people would simply send them a million OTC and get the coins to their wallets.Nowadays suddenly everybody is selling on centralized exchanges, the way Germany recently did. Why impact the spot price by selling a large % of supply and get less money when you can make people bid for it? Makes no sense. I don't think it's going to be a big deal because we've been dealing with these seizure sales for years, but the market is over leveraged now, much more than it used to be 2 or 3 years ago.

In addition, I think that about $4 billion worth of BTC will not have any significant effects on the price, because not so long ago we had $3 billion worth of BTC sold by the Germans and no disaster happened.Quote from: shield132 on October 09, 2024, 07:02:57 PMBtw I bet that their CEX of choice will be Coinbase.Very likely, it is no secret that CEX has very good relations with the US authorities.",

Our supporting and voting for them is just exchanging benefits with them, that's all. If you think Harris's policies will make your life better and vote for her, that means you and she are exchanging benefits. She needs your support to get elected, in return for voting for her, you have the opportunity to receive benefits from her administration's policies, we all have our own goals behind what we do. To me, elections and voting are like an exchange of needs and benefits.You don't need to guess or have a hunch, what Trump does is just want to get more votes from voters. Many will call it deception and lies, which is true but that is the nature of politics and how politicians get votes and Harris is no different than Trump. That is not new and there is no need to speculate. Voting in elections is like gambling and betting, we bet on where we think we will win.",
