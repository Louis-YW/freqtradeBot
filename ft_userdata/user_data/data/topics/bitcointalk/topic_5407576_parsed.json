  "content": "It seems that the crypto hardware wallet industry is growing at a much faster pace than cryptocurrency exchanges, according to several studies.This is likely due to the current bear market, which has accelerated the development of cold wallets, while many centralized crypto exchanges had a tough time maintaining operations.For example, a report by business intelligence firm Vantage Market Research showed that the revenue of global crypto trading platforms amounted to only $330 million in 2021.  This is quite a modest number compared to the $1.1 billion value that the hardware wallet industry is expected to reach by 2027.These findings suggest that  the main reason for the lagging growth of exchanges is the lack of trust in centralized platforms, as users are increasingly looking for ways to store their digital assets in a more secure way. With the rise of DeFi and the growing popularity of non-custodial crypto services, it is likely that the industry will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years.Check out our newsletter at https://ambire-newsletter.beehiiv.com/",

On exchanges, you do not also have full control over your own coins. Some people can also be afraid of exchange bankruptcy and inability to pay customers funds on their exchange.Best to lock this thread and post on the already existing thread to avoid duplication and repetition.",

People pay much more money in trading/widthdrawal fees than in a hardware wallet, which is a one time payment of 40-50 usd.",

Expecting crypto exchange revenues not to grow by more than 4x by 2027 is probably an underestimate (even if their incomes are a bit sporadic afaik).",

Of course, the report not being open to scrutiny without paying a pretty penny does not allow us to see the methodology, but both the above post by @bitmover and this data seem radically different from Vantage Market Research’s, which is something they should address and/or clarify.

And a user can buy more than one hardware wallet, just think about it.I don't see a point of comparing these 2 though. You can't create exchange easily and survive this market. So definitely, only few have the capability to sustain this kind of business and maintain it thru ups and downs of this volatile market.",

Obviously centralized exchanges Even with the current risks that centralized exchanges have, most common users still foolishly use them as their wallets, and I don't think such a habit is about to change.People even ignore decentralized exchanges in favour of exchanges and wallets that are custodial. For some reason, most people just don't want to take control of their funds.",
