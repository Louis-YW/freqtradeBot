Governments were not going to allow Bitcoin to reach the degree of adoption it has today as conceived by Satoshi (as a person-to-person electronic cash in which centralized institutions had little or no influence). What we must do is resign ourselves and prepare for a future with little to no privacy. My wishful thinking says 1) but more realistically I am for option 2).

Exchanges are centralized, carry out the whim on regulators and track our funds, nonetheless we cannot deny they play an important role by providing an important percentage of liquidity within the market, so finding a way to replace them would not so easy, I think.Preserving our privacy is difficult but not impossible and we should not forget that having privacy does not mean we are commiting a crime, that's why I believe that the second option is not the suitable for us as crypto-user and perhaps as society as a whole.One of the things I find most appealing and interesting about cryptography is the fact it provides protection to our identity and data, not matter whether it is a single person or a big company which is trying to break into to take whatever they want, the mathematics treats us equality to all of us, this means we do have the tools to protect ourselves from an authoritarian eye looking over us, we just need to get out our comfort zone, learn good practices and do not allow politicians to make the term \"privacy\" a synonim of \"crime\".",

But for the individual there will probably always be tools and possibilities to atleast have a private stash somewhere.I think the only way for the masses would be privacy by default solutions, because they won’t go out there way now, to go trough the process to gain privacy themselves.",

(alcohol trade analogy) if your caught selling alcohol privately and not following the alcohol rules.. you can be fined and banned from doing it again or worseEG if doing to much fiat transactions on a personal account to complete strangers via wire transfer, the banks will want to question if you are a business and if that business is in facilitating 'money'(currency) transfers for customers.(this is still a problem for the altnet and de-fi people running small exchange businesses locally but not declaring themselves as a business.. banks dont like a business being run on the terms of service of personal accounts)again this requires to avoid central exchanges. and avoid the bank questioning wire transfers privately.. having to have local towns people do local face-to-face meetups/conventions/ community outreach, coffee/lunch parties to trade 'off the grid'.. here is the thing though. (message to all forum readers the \"you\" is not just the topic creator but all readers)bitcoin is not a business that can set up offices in YOUR town to do meetups. it has no arms or legs to organise things for YOU, there is no central lobby group or central consultancy  team to fly into YOUR town and organise how a meet-up should work in YOUR town.. if YOU want off the grid transfers. YOU in YOUR area need to play YOUR part.so find out all the people in YOUR area that are interested in bitcoin, find out who are the regular bitcoin buyers.. and who are the bitcoin holders regularly wanting to sell.. and let them meet upto buy and sell between each other over a beer or coffee",

They make us imagine, innovate, think and do beyond the limit. What used to be unimaginable and unbelievable were conquered, discovered, even surpassed because of ideals. Bitcoin itself is made out of ideals. Privacy, just like liberty, freedom, independence, equality, and so on are ideals that make us live and fight. Without which, we are no different from soulless automatons. It's going to be a struggle, but, last I heard, privacy is still a fundamental human right recognized by the UN, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and countless other declarations. It is still defended by constitutions. Acts impinging on privacy are still frowned upon and remain appalling to majority of the people. So I believe there's no giving up on this.",

The problem is that, eventually you will have to deal with centralized services, when spending or selling your Bitcoins-crypto exchanges and the payment gateways, like Bitpay, are pretty much centralized, so the avoidance of such services in the crypto world is questionable.80-90% of the Bitcoiners never truly cared about privacy, all they care is the price. Complying with the rules and regulations means less privacy, but more adoption, which might lead to a higher price in the future.Privacy is important, if you have something to hide, mostly the criminals/scammers care about achieving almost complete online anonymity(which is close to impossible).

      "body": "We must think about this from a strategic point of view.If we lose the privacy (and specifically the fungbility) that Bitcoin provides us, then what is going to stop the precedent that it starts?What will happen if police start arresting individual BTC users because of suspicions of \"tained coin posession\"?What will happen if entire countries start banning the \"possession of Bitcoin wallets, and the running of Bitcoin software\" because of tainted coins?What will happen if Microsoft, Apple and Google decide to proactively block the installation of Bitcoin software because they believe it is going to be outlawed?What will happen if ISPs are required by law to block port 8333, the Bitcoin P2P communication port, because it believes that bitcoin software is dangerous and should not be used by normal users?Is the BTC community really going to succumb to all these measures without a fight? And I mean put up a genuine fight, not a \"phony war\" or half-hearted struggle.Do you guys remember when the US government tried to outlaw PGP by classifying it as \"export-restricted software\"? And then droves of people came out and copied the source code of PGP into books, other pieces of media, even on T-shirts. It was something we'd classify as a \"popular movement\" - a mass protest by ordinary people against the restrictions imposed by Big Brother and his henchmen (the corporations who dilligently enforce those policies).So you want to save BTC's functionality? Then everyone should run CoinJoin nodes en masse. Replace zkSNACKs with 3rd party coinjoin nodes and share them on reddit, bitcointalk, and other places.Want to accomplish big things? Then decompose it to small steps and accomplish those. Wasabi's, and specifically zkSNACKs, initiative can be thwarted by the community by running independent CoinJoin services on random leased servers.But it will *only* work if dozens of people do this. Perhaps even one person running multiple nodes. So people must symbolically take back their privacy (to use Wasabi's words) by running their own CJ nodes and putting them inside Wasabi.And if they try to change the source code to forbid this, then we shall fork it to preserve or enable that functionality.Privacy is a fundamental right, and we can't allow govs and corps to take BTC from us by making it more restrictive than cash and bank accounts.",

Exchanges of some sort are also required if you can't use Bitcoin directly and need to sell it for something like fiat first. By compromising I mean lobbying for reasonable legislation: for example, for low income taxes and no VAT, for KYC only after a certain threshold ($5k, for instance), for environmental legislation to not target crypto miners specifically.
