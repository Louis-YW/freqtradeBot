He only paid 10,000 BTC for it   So, yes it is Bitcoin Pizza Day, but probably not a descriptor needed here on the Bitcointalk forum  Steeley",

The sad part is he bought Papa John’s pizzas..some of the worst pizza on the planet. However I’m not sure if Papa John’s was his first pizza /bitcoin purchase as I know he made several of these deals with somewhere around 35,000 bitcoins in total. Crazy stuff. Thanks for the raffle !",
