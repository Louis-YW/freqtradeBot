  "content": "As a Bitcoin enthusiast, I want to say briefly that you shouldn't sacrifice simplicity for technicality. You are more likely to lose your bitcoins because of too much technicality than to scammers or hackers. An example of keeping things simple is that instead of storing your Bitcoin in a multi signature wallet that you do not understand how it works or have no experience in setting up, store your Bitcoin in a soft like Electrum wallet where the process of setting up is pretty straight forward. Another example is using simpler and recommended ways to protect your seed phrase instead of some ways that has too much complexities and technicality to it any mistake can result in its loss forever.In summary, it is more practical to stick with user-friendly options that you understand well than advanced options. Simplicity and a strong foundation of knowledge are your best allies in safeguarding your bitcoin.",

Wrong. If you can not go for multisig or wallet on an airgapped device, you can buy a hardware wallet. It is worth knowing that wallet like Electrum can be used for multisig setup.To learn about bitcoin wallet is not what is hard. I prefer multisig than single signature wallet on online devices. It is safer.",

Storing your Bitcoin in multi signature wallet is actually not too complicated. I think if you don't have the ability to assimilate simple things like this then I fear in general for the person's safety in crypto-currency. But out of preference and not complexity I use electrum because it has been what I started with and it's work fine for me. I believe it's all about individual preferences, how I would choose to save my seed phrase may be different from how you would choose to save your and so is the same with how I choose to save my Bitcoin. But this factors should not be overlooked and that's it must be safe, easy for you to access and private to other people.",

I would rather lose my funds in my wallet any time I find my pass key hidden than have it stolen due to scamming. Even in the trust wallet class, you can be missed, until now I still use hardware wallets from Trezor and Ledger.In my opinion, security is more important, no matter how complicated we access it, the most important thing is that the investment we protect is safe from threats.",

Bitcoin is a complicated tech  Satoshi tried as much as he could to simplify using things most people are familiar with, like the word \"mining\". That's how you know developers who really care and know what they are talking about... Others are deliberately making things complicated for certain people/competitors to understand, or they just want to \"sound\" technical, or it's really too complicated for them to simplify. Besides, Open-source and Community-run Projects aren't supposed to be complicated so that everyone is carried along and help secure them from attacks from minority who understands how things work",

The most simple solution is to store coins where you bought them - on exchange, and we all know how bad it is. A little bit more complex option is a hot software wallet, and we also know how risky it can be. A simple cold storage or hardware wallet setup is providing enough security for nearly all users. There's indeed a danger in overcomplicating, especially by making custom encryption or encoding algorithms, using layers of encryption, splitting the seed and so on. All of it will increase the chance of losing the key while the security benefits are an overkill.",

People who do not have sufficient knowledge of wallets that are considered somewhat complex, a multi-signature wallet or the like, are better off using simple wallets, but of course on the condition that they stay away from web wallets or central wallets. As their knowledge improves, they can move to safer wallets.",

Simplicity and a strong foundation of knowledge are your best allies in safeguarding your bitcoin.Simplicity is no doubt better than technicality, but depending on what factors you call a method, thing, or strategy, a simple one and a technical one Because, in your sight, or according to your knowledge, you found \"X\" things simple, while the other person with lower knowledge will find the same \"X\" thing technical. The level of simplicity and technicality depends on the knowledge one has.If you don't know about multi-signature wallets, then learn about them, up your level a bit, and set that standard as a simpler one for you. Then proceed to more technicalities and make them simple for you. If you do not leave your comfort zone, either in the context of wallets, blockchain, or any crypto-related technology, you will not find new ways and will be stuck at levels that, in your sight, will be simpler for you, while moving up will look like a burden to you. So change that.In simpler words, we should improve ourselves with modernization and how hackers and scammers are finding new ways to scam us. In the same way, we should improve ourselves and keep our education up-to-date, and that's the only way to avoid complexity. Then start with less, or first just test the options, then proceed with real funds.",

Their threat modelling is different, surely, we should not advise a user who wants to store a gigantic amount of bitcoins on a hot wallet, instead, we suggest to them the cold wallet options. It also applies to multi-signature wallets, if there is a requirement, it is applicable even if we sacrifice simplicity slightly.Generally, I understand and am aware, that even the basic sense of how we operate a wallet is still far from convenient. So the best way to advise someone is to adjust their needs and threat exposure, how likely and how bad the consequences are if they did not secure it properly or what if their funds got lost. A complex way may be unbearable, but if that's the way to go, educating how to operate it would be the surest decision.",

If you have 0.5 bitcoin and above, you can get yourself a hardware to save you the stress and technicalities in setting up a multisig wallet. I think the multisig wallet comes very handy especially in holding organizational funds or family inheritance.

But we should also note that the more complicated the higher the security. A house that has two or more gates or some security device will be more difficult to access than a house that has just a single lock.

And in that process, he wrote down the seed phrases on paper and then lost them. And in other cases, those who have kept it saved on online place or on a mobile or laptop, might not lose those seed phrases. And in another case, one might save the seed phrase at different locations. But you are not totally right, because, if you think the multi-signature security level is some technical shit then you are wrong, because setting multi-sign wallets is too easy and you mentioned Electrum and we can easily set a multi-sign wallet on that too. So, why we should not test it out and learn about it?Instead of giving up, by saying, this shit is so technical and I want simplicity so I will not adopt the new technology, these people are always at a loss in all fields of life. If we do not learn new things and remain aware of all the new scams and hacks then we can easily be hacked. So technicality does matter but simplicity also.",
