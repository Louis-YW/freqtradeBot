What's your take, guys?You can not force anyone to embrace bitcoin, people have to discover why bitcoin can benefit them if they buy it. And that is not all, they also need to know the right time to invest and not invest at the wrong time when bitcoin price has increased significantly.We like or we do not like, people will invest in bitcoin. More people will know it and buy it and the price will continue to increase after long period of time. Some people may not like bitcoin and remain to be bitcoin critics, but if I can invest and make money, I do not care. That is life, everybody can not be on the same side",

The limited supply of bitcoin makes it not available for everyone because as time goes on the poor ones will not be able to buy bitcoin due to the high price of bitcoin. It is just like gold that the poor ones knows it is expensive and base on their little income,they will not be able to buy gold. Bitcoin price is based on demand and supply,the more people keep buying,the lower the supply. If almost half of the people in the world own bitcoin,I guess that the price will hit 500k-700k which will become a problem to an average man to buy. It is only the interested ones that knows the potential of bitcoin or that loves decentralization that will adopt bitcoin, some people still believe that without the government nothing will survive,such people wouldn't adopt bitcoin.",

It's better to forget those who don't like bitcoin, explaining to them will only waste your energy and mind. There is nothing to argue about, the world has many financial systems and all of them have their own communities and values. So just let them hate bitcoin, bitcoin can always make history with its highest price, even though many hate bitcoinIn my small village, maybe only I know bitcoin. I briefly explained bitcoin to my friends but they weren't interested. So I left them and I was fineMaybe we can't force people who don't like them to like them. But don't worry, the bitcoin community is getting bigger by the day, it's only a matter of time until people who hate bitcoin regret not buying bitcoins a long time ago.",

I don't like how they corrupted and became richer while their citizens became poorer by inflation as well as how they failed to keep their promises from their propaganda to be elected by citizens.However, I see we still need governments to keep societies in orders. I don't want to live in a country, a society with an anarchic status because my life will be in danger.

They will see it as a safe heaven to avoid inflation from central banks.",

It sells itself.

What's your take, guys?Trying to convince people about bitcoin when they don't know anything about it can be a wasted effort because some people won't accept all  you may say concerning bitcoin. And if eventually you succeed in convincing them and they buy bitcoin in haste to invest without the knowledge of it, if the market and it volatility in nature does not go well with them it can destroy relationships because they will sure put the blame of their loses  on you. No need to force or convince people to invest in bitcoin,  people should see reason by themselves why they need to invest in bitcoin .",

What's your take, guys?Just like in all aspects of life, you can’t please everybody. No matter how successful are you in life, you can’t expect everyone to be pleased with your journey. Everyone has their own reasons behind it, but we do not want to focus on that. Let’s just focus on what we believe in like Bitcoin.It has been a roller coaster ride for me though. At first when I believed in Bitcoin, not all have been pleased. They say I am now promoting a scam, etc. There’s even a guy who spread in all of his group chats to start “unfriending” me years ago because of being into Bitcoin rather than continue to being a failed network marketer.But I still believed in Bitcoin and it paid off very well in the end and I have no regrets going into this crypto and Web3 industry. It’s all thanks to Bitcoin.",

What's your take, guys?It is pointless to expect everyone to embrace bitcoin. I doubt that bitcoin will become a world currency that will be used by every inhabitant of the planet. It seems to me most likely that bitcoin will remain an investment vehicle that will be used, just like stocks in the stock market, such as stocks of technology companies. For example, Google or Apple. Not all people own these shares, right? Moreover, many people have no idea about the stock market at all and have no experience of investing in it. The same, I suppose, will be with bitcoin. There will be people who invest in btc, will own it, and there will be those who are far from all this and, accordingly, will not have a bitcoin.  Here it is impossible to make everyone equal, as under communism, and the market itself will regulate the situation.Everyone is entitled to their opinion. If a person is not interested in topic of bitcoin, then you should not continue imposing it. If he showed interest, then you can tell in more detail. There is no need to try to recruit everyone you meet as new adherents of the bitcoin, as if into a sect. Whoever needs it will himself look for ways to obtain information about bitcoin. If you find yourself with him at such a moment and tell him - this will be your best contribution.",

What's your take, guys. I don't think there is something that will waste someone's time, like when you teach people something and they don't understand all you are saying or they don't even listen to you as well, I believe it will be very painful for the person teaching them. However, it's the same thing when you teach people who don't know anything about bitcoin that they should embrace the currency. The only person I can teach bitcoin to is when he comes to me and says he wants to learn some aspect of bitcoin, I think that is the only thing I can do for now.However, the truth is that the majority of these people today view this online activity as a scam, or perhaps they have already fallen victim to one and don't want to do it again. You can see that these individuals won't pay attention to you since they will believe the same thing will happen to them, but I think that explaining bitcoin to someone who has no prior knowledge of it can persuade them to comprehend what you are trying to communicate. You know, when you persuade someone to do what you want, you won't tell them about the risk involved, and with bitcoin, you need to be able to understand the risk before investing, so if you accidentally persuade them and they lose, the fault will be on you.",

What's your take, guys?Forcing people to be part of Bitcoin makes you the same thing we're trying to get away from. The government and other centralized organizations force people into doing specific things even if it's not necessary. You can't send money direct to another country without a third party, you can use a bank account without paying unnecessary charges, and many other things we are forced to do.These are all the things Bitcoin stands against, so if people begin to force people into using Bitcoin, how is it any different?
