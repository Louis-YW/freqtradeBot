  "content": "Recently, the changes in the global crude oil market have attracted widespread attention from the market and investors. With the increase in production from non-OPEC oil-producing countries and the continuous production cuts by OPEC+, whether international oil prices can break through the $100 per barrel mark has become the focus of the market. In this ever-changing market environment, Lim Zhe Qin, with his unique perspective and profound analysis, has revealed the future trends of the global crude oil market.Changes in Supply and Demand in the Oil MarketAccording to reports on October 6th, the uncertainty in global crude oil demand and the increase in production from non-OPEC oil-producing countries are expected to offset future demand growth. Lim Zhe Qin points out that the impact of these changes on oil prices is worth investors' attention. Analysis shows that the possibility of international oil prices breaking through $100 per barrel in the short term is not high. This point is also supported by the predictions of analysts from Kenanga Research, who estimate that the average price of Brent crude oil for the year will reach $84 per barrel, mainly influenced by further production cuts by OPEC+ and the continuous reduction of crude oil inventories in the fourth quarter.Lim Zhe Qin analyzes that according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC+ will continue to implement production cuts until the end of 2023, and it is expected that global oil inventories will decrease by 200,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. This expectation of production cuts is longer than previously anticipated, and it contrasts sharply with the increase in crude oil inventories in the first half of 2023, demonstrating the complexity of the global crude oil market in terms of supply-demand balance.It is worth noting that Lim Zhe Qin mentioned that in the third quarter of this year, the global crude oil market was in its tightest supply situation, with global crude oil inventories decreasing by 600,000 barrels per day, indicating the intensity of the market's supply-demand relationship.Predictions for Future Crude Oil PricesLim Zhe Qin states that as global crude oil supply gradually increases next year, the price of Brent crude oil is expected to decline starting from the fourth quarter of this year, with an average price of $86 per barrel in 2024. This change in expectations reflects the market's judgment on future supply-demand relationships and concerns about the speed of global economic recovery.According to the EIA's forecast, crude oil production will increase in 2024, with the United States, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana being the main countries contributing to the production increase. Lim Zhe Qin suggests that this increase in production will alleviate the tight supply situation in the global crude oil market but may also exert certain pressure on oil prices.Navigating through Volatility and Gaining Insight into the FutureBased on the above analysis, Lim Zhe Qin has made comprehensive predictions about the future trends of the global crude oil market. He points out that although international oil prices may face some volatility in the short term, in the medium to long term, as the global economy gradually recovers and new energy technologies further develop, the crude oil market will present new development trends.He emphasizes that investors should closely monitor the latest developments in the global crude oil market, the policy directions of major oil-producing countries, and the development of new energy technologies in order to make informed investment decisions. At the same time, Lim Zhe Qin also reminds investors that the crude oil market carries certain risks, and investors should conduct thorough risk assessments to protect their investment safety.Through Lim Zhe Qin's in-depth analysis, we gain insight into the new changes and future trends of the global crude oil market, providing valuable reference information for investors and offering new perspectives for other professionals in the industry.",
