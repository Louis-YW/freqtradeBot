  "content": "I think it worth a little discussing.It's known for everyone that Jake Paul's lawyers made an All or Nothing contract and Jake asked Tommy Fury to sign it. The term of contract was following: - [Jake] If I win, I take all the money you're being paid. If you win, I double it up.During that moment, John Fury interfered and told Jake Paul: You've got my word as the head of the Fury clan, he will definitely sign that. You've got my word on that.After saying that, John Fury shook his hand, as did Tommy too.Here is the video: https://twitter.com/i/status/1629291192306532352But Fury didn't sign the contract. Later then someone asked him about the all or nothing contract and you can clearly see what was his response, he was always trying to get rid of it: https://www.tiktok.com/@betr/video/7204576968606485803?_r=1&_t=8aJ73JIpOsbAfter the end of fight, Fury comes and asks Jake Paul for double money because he lost the fight. Here is the video: https://twitter.com/i/status/1630943761739010048What do you think about this? Isn't this a shame from Fury to ask Paul money after wining the match without signing a contract? If they lose, they would then say that they haven't signed a contract and Jake Deserves no money.",

The offer was fairly clearly made and it was his idea. This is probably free advertising for him now though and presumably the \"he shouldn't have to pay it\" sentiment is part of that if it's a majority view because it makes him look better when he does.",

If there was a gentleman's agreement though then JP should cough up, it wouldn’t make him much of a man if he doesn’t.Of course this could all be WWE style pageantry designed to stir up beef to create excitement regarding a potential rematch. Let’s sit back & enjoy the show, pass the popcorn.",

Fury didn't hold up his end of the gentleman's agreement by not signing the contract. So he shouldn't be paid double, even by the terms of the handshake.Tommy Fury being a boxer from a famous boxing family, I think there was a tremendous amount of pressure on him to beat the \"youtuber\" in Jake Paul. This caused Tommy Fury to fight below his normal level. Jake Paul might also have been sick. Not certain, still need to watch the first 5 rounds of the fight which I missed.How many pay per views did the fight sell? That will be the main question going forward. Jake Paul hasn't sold many PPVs since he began making gay innuendos to market his 2nd fight with Tyron Woodley and done other things which may have alienated the fight world against him.",

So only the drama continues if they fight for the rematch promo, maybe fight part 2 will be announced soon.",

If they lose, they would then say that they haven't signed a contract and Jake Deserves no money.I think John Fury is trying to play smart here by asking for double payment when initially he didn't sign the contract in the first instance, because I'm sure he must be regretting now and wishing he had signed it, because in as much as he never presented the contract in public signed just as Jake Paul did before the fight, he has no right to ask for double payment. John Fury lacks confidence about himself which is why I he failed to sign that contract, so it will be better he just forget about it and stop creating a scene on social media",

If he is a man of his word, why didn't Tommy signed that? Conclusion: John Fury, the head of Fury clan is not a man of his word, the same applies to Tommy but I hope he won't be dumb enough to demand for money from Jake.Quote from: Hydrogen on March 02, 2023, 05:47:53 PMTommy Fury being a boxer from a famous boxing family, I think there was a tremendous amount of pressure on him to beat the \"youtuber\" in Jake Paul. This caused Tommy Fury to fight below his normal level. Jake Paul might also have been sick. Not certain, still need to watch the first 5 rounds of the fight which I missed.Tommy Fury was saying that Jake Paul is not a boxer, he is just a kid who plays with old people. Tommy said that he himself is a real boxer who will destroy Jake Paul and show the world that Paul is a clown and his place is not on the ring.Whaat? Just whaat? It turned into 50/50 match. Tommy Fury was training into boxing since childhood and training hard every day and Jake Paul was training for some years and guess what? He and Paul were on the same level. This only shows that if there is a rematch, Jake will beat his ass. Statistically, Jake manages to improve a lot in a short time-frame compared to Fury.",

I'd feel like a cheater. Fury should know this is going to make him more enemies than friends. We can all see that old man is all about money now and gets angry when they ask him about it. He knows it was a bad choice on his part and doesn't want to admit it because he's stubborn and grumpy like most old guys. Does it really change anything about the fight? I think it doesn't. They both got their respective shares of the money and should leave it at that.",

They had the opportunity to sign the contract but clearly didn't have enough confidence to do it before the fight and judging by the final points score they were very lucky to walk away with a win anyway. The whole Fury clan might be able to fight, but they are pretty rubbish at PR and have very little decency among them, as has been witnessed by numerous events over the years. Some top fighters, even after all the crap they have to put up with between media stories and fans, still manage to present a good appearance - but not these clowns.",

A verbal agreement is considered to be a stickler for fury's side because they are greedy to demand double pay, but if fury loses they will say there will never be a deal from jake's challenge, so all the old man talk is a joke because fury has won and they are like humiliating themselves in the interview, so stop begging for double pay because there is no provable contractual agreement to public, even take it to court but the report is invalid and does not meet the violation of law. So enjoy your share of money each and have fun after the fight.",
