They block client's money if a client refuses to pass KYC, they don't make a refund and keep coins to themselves. They just don't have KYC / AML policy on their website but they have KYC in fact. Check their reviews: https://www.bestchange.ru/fixedfloat-exchanger.html. The reviews are in Russian but you can use Google Translate. They block money and Bestchange's admin closes disputes and makes them gray instead of red without getting resolved. So FixedFloat keeps people's money and disputes are closed. Please check my topic about Bestchange: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5423039.0. It's also in Russian but I'll translate it and post on the English forum in a few days, just hadn't time to translate it yet. I think Bestchange's admin shares profit with such scam exchangers because he keeps them and closes almost all disputes while clients don't receive any refunds.",

From recent developments it's very important to apply caution while trading on any exchange and if there's no kyc then there would be some certain amount you could deposit inside which they might likely seek your identity otherwise would result in long stories. So using p2p to trade any currency you needed would be the best at this current situation. Note! not your key not your coin.",

If you prefer privacy and anonymity when using exchange platforms, the choice is yours. There are many exchange platforms that you can use without KYC, such as the ByBit platform. You can easily create an account on ByBit and trade currencies comfortably, and you can withdraw a maximum of 2 bitcoins per day, Also, on the PrimeXBT platform, you can trade on it for many trading pairs that are based on Bitcoin. The last exchange platform, CRYPTON EXCHANGE, is a good platform and will help you with instant deposits and withdrawals with no limits or restrictions, It still has a limited number of currencies, the most important of which are Bitcoin, USDT, XMR, and DAI.",

Hitbtc is actually an exchange and the wallet is need to have verification process as stated on their page. The thing is this exchange is known has a problem and there's many users create accusations thread against this exchange.There's other non custodial wallet that claim to not have any verification process, but actually it's wrong since when you installed the wallet you need to perform KYC or at least the wallet will monitor your activity since you're using their server.Quote from: https://hitbtc.com/walletHigh-level securitySecure your account with 2FA &identity verification, and manageaccess from other devices",
