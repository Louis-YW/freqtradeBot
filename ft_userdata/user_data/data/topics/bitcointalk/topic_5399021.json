Gold is a physical asset, a metal, and used for a lot more things than bitcoin is, such as use in cars, electronics, jewelry etc. And gold being physical is more of a flaw than an advantage, imo (security, portability, divisibility, etc) — and I'm pretty sure a lot of the more younger folks would agree. I used to think that gold being physical is a huge advantage, until I became more and more financially literate throughout the years and I want less and less physical stuff and I'm more interested in digital intangible stuff(bitcoin, stocks, etc).Quote from: Charles-Tim on May 17, 2022, 01:03:11 PMThis is just like the Peter Schiff argument.

As for selling gold, I personally have no problem with that, there is a physical store on every corner that buys gold, or I can even sell gold by sending it by a special courier service to a company that buys gold.Of course, I have no doubt that Bitcoin has its practicality when it comes to storage and transfer, but not everything is so impractical when it comes to gold. Still, I speak from my personal experience, it may be really difficult for someone to buy or sell gold, but for some, the problem is how to buy or sell Bitcoin - I have witnessed this many times.",

The return on gold has historically been low. This story also shows how inconvenient it is to have a large amount of gold:Quote from: =https://www.norges-bank.no/en/news-events/news-publications/Press-releases/2004/2004-01-28T09-11-39fgenhtml/Excluded from the sale are seven gold bars that have been used for exhibition purposes and a large number of gold coins that were transported to England when Norway was attacked in 1940.There are countless of examples of how inconvenient it is to transport and make sure you have real gold instead of fake gold:Quote from: https://decrypt.co/34033/chinese-firm-dumps-83-tonnes-of-fake-gold-on-the-marketOver $2bn of loans may have been backed by fake gold, finds corruption probe.

I guess we would have seen musicians with them BTC teeth.  Well, BTC and gold have got lots of differences and similarities too. More notably, we could say BTC is indid following the gold path. In the senses that, it started as money but its lack of proper used case has made it more of an asset. Gold stands an asset now which ever form it is found. You could resell when ever and still get the value.Looking at scarcity, with bitcoin been held by only a handful of individuals, it is indeed scares and not at its fullest yet as, the demand on it is only within a few for now but, would be more in time and so would the price appreciation be at the apex.",

Tons of jewelry are lost each year, gold that can't be recycled after being used in components, or is simply not worth recycling due to the quantities.I believe many lost gold would be found, just in my opinion.I am also surprised for someone to compare the gold that has been mined when the earth if full of gold and there are hard to reach place for mining gold like earth crust. If what I have read in the past is true, the gold in the earth crust can cover the whole surface of the earth in 4 meters thick. If the earth crust is not possible to reach or humans can not advanced technology to, to mine gold, how about the gold under water, under the ocean, which is very far more than the gold on the surface of the earth, but, that none has been mined before, it could be possible in the future that technology could advance to the extent those gold under oceans could be mined, but that is just my thought, I can be wrong about it. How about the gold existing on the earth surface, scientists give estimates, but the gold existing on the surface can still be more, if there is estimation of 122 billion metric tons of gold on the earth surface, and only 165,000 metric tons are yet mined, I think there is still enough gold on earth surface to still be considered unlimited. I may be wrong, I will like your take on this, but I do not believe in the saying that only little amount of gold are not yet mined, it is still unlimited.",

So the gold supply is not as limited as some may think.I could start with the fact that's not even 100% certain how much gold is still available to be mined. I don't know how accurate the current estimations are.Then, yes, gold does exist in space, and I would not be surprised if it would get attempted to be mined from there, if it will be proven to be more useful than just getting hoarded by the richer entities (especially since such a move could melt its current price).Bitcoin has kinda same problem: if people stops hoarding it, the price may go lower than most of us would like. It doesn't have to be mined from outer space.While I do agree that Bitcoin is scarcer than the total gold in the universe, especially according to our perception, I would not try to prove this because.. what to compare: kg with BTC, gram with satoshi, atom with.. what? since \"tomorrow\" the community could decide that one satoshi is too big (compared to whatever paper money) and we need more digits after the decimal point, and 16 looks just fine for the job.Quote from: virtualdn on May 17, 2022, 12:32:24 PMI think one day 1 BTC will enter the $xxx,xxx zone then the $x,xxx,xxx HODL BTCThis goes to speculation area",
