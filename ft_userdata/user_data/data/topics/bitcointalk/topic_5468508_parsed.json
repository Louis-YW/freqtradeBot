  "content": "For many Indians, investing in US stocks still remains a dream, mostly because of the lack of convenient and accessible options to invest in US equities from India.The launch of the INDmoney app a few years back gave some relief to these investors, as the app allowed users to directly buy the stocks of US-based companies. However, even this option was far from perfect. For one, the app charges a high platform fee and withdrawal fee, which can greatly limit profitability for users. Also, there is a lack of transparency. It doesn’t exactly give direct access to US stocks but works as a mediator, charging fees.If you are looking for the best INDmoney alternatives or the best way to invest in US stocks from India, here you go:Why invest in US stocksSome of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing companies are based in the US.

US-focused international mutual fundsInternational mutual funds are funds by Indian mutual fund houses that provide exposure to international stocks or listed companies US-focused international mutual funds provide maximum exposure to US stocks and may also include stocks from some other countries or international exchanges.This is one of the easiest and most popular methods for Indians to invest in US stocks. However, by investing in US-focused mutual funds, you’d be indirectly investing in US stocks and not buying stocks of US companies directly, so you do not get any rights to voting and/or dividends of the underlying companies. Compare different US-focused mutual funds based on expense ratio, tracking error, and the fund manager’s expertise to find your best fit.7.

You can invest in ETFs through a Demat account with any Indian stockbroker.There are some ETFs that provide exposure to US stocks and securities. Just like US-focused mutual funds, you can invest in US-focused ETFs to buy and trade US stocks indirectly on exchanges. An ETF is a collection of multiple stocks, usually in a certain category.
