But the point of Bitcoin is not to become immune to government regulations and laws but rather to become free of the government and banks.

Because bitcoin is run solely on a free market, meaning that its prices are majorly determined by the supply and demand of users and not by the control of any centralized system or central authorities like the central banks or the government. A community of users, miners and developers are mainly it's drivers and only a fixed limit of 21 million coins capped for the central authority.Because of its community based approach, every interested individual can decide to participate in Bitcoin trading or investments, mining and other developments without necessarily soughting for any form of approval from any authority, it does not mean that whales cannot manipulate the market, which happens oftentimes, but governments cannot really control its growth and development in the long run.",

According to  this record,  there is still a large amount of bitcoin under US government custody, or are there other bitcoins that got missing from their record that you need to tell us about.Interesting. Does your link show the public addresses of the bitcoin being held by the US Govt? I hope the bitcoin is all still there but I wouldn't hold my breath.Senator Cynthia Lummis herself wrote a letter to the US Marshalls last month. They are responsible for securing the bitcoin but so far she has not received a response. She wants to know where the bitcoin is.Cynthia Lummis Letter to US MarshallsThe US government has not conducted a proper audit of the gold it owns since 1950. Why is that? Because all the gold is probably long gone and I have no doubt it was stolen by US officials.If they can't be trusted to keep the gold secure how can you trust them to keep the bitcoin secure?The US Govt has (or had) 193K bitcoins which represents almost 1% of the total bitcoin supply in circulation. So even if all of it was sold after Trump took office that would cause the price of bitcoin to drop by approx. 1% or $1000(1% of $100,000 bitcoin price is $1000). So the damage done to bitcoin is not that great.",

The moment you attach it to a leader, you’re setting yourself up for betrayal. Milei, Trump doesn’t matter. The game is simple: they ride the wave for attention, make promises they’ll never keep, and redirect the hype into their own scams. This isn’t an accident. This is the function of power.Bitcoin is the antithesis of these systems, and that’s why they can’t touch it. Thus they pretend to embrace it, hoping you’ll fall for the illusion. But every time you look to a government for Bitcoin’s future, you’re missing the entire point. They don’t own Bitcoin. They never will. They can print laws, print lies, print fear but they can’t print Bitcoin.The real con is expecting honesty from people who operate in deception. And the biggest red flag is the moment someone praises Bitcoin but tries to sell you something else. That’s when you walk away. No exceptions. No excuses. Bitcoin doesn’t need middlemen. It doesn’t need approval. It doesn’t need promises. It just needs people to wake up and stop looking for saviors.",

Trump started not just one crypto scam but several (Trumpcoin, Melaniacoin, World Liberty, etc.). Where I come from that is called a con artist or scam artist. He even has a pump and dump stock called Trump Media Group (DJT). Trump has been a charlatan and a crook his entire life, not just with crypto but in every business he has ever been involved in.That is who he is, so why would you expect him to act any differently this time?So until we see verifiable proof that the bitcoin funds are still intact (such as the public addresses being made public) then I consider them to be missing and likely stolen. It could have been people in the Trump and/or Biden administration who pilfered it, who knows. Either way it is gone until proven otherwise.",

This drastic 180 degree turn didn’t come out of nowhere. He saw there was an opportunity to make money from being pro-crypto and has managed to earn millions from his supporters through various schemes.I am skeptical about a Bitcoin reserve ever materializing, and if it does it might include more coins than just Bitcoin, depending on which shitcoins his sons feel like pumping for their own benefit.",
