My plan which I should have done last year is to just bet using the stablecoin. This year seems to be a good time to consolidate more of the BTC I earn. And probably just bet more of the altcoins I hold.",

Therefore, I didn't make much on betting and didn't spend much on it. This year is still fresh and needs more analysis of the games to know the decision to take. My favourite area to bet is soccer , so I will have to watch more football clubs to be informed so this will also in soccer knowledge and transfers for this year.",

No, I assume it was below the 50% chance of winning so it was likely on the losing side, I thought 30% was low though before I posted this. Maybe rating it 1-10 instead of 0-100% is wrong, people tend to mistakenly think it was a 1-10 criterea for rating, so my rate would be likely at 3% only. Maybe you could change that.",

Since probability is all percentages and that is what probabilistic math is based on, mostly.The world is so extremely, unfathomably complex, that it would not be possible to accurately measure such things as luck since you do not have the knowledge about all the unknown variables which influence your luck. (In this case I am referring to luck as the probability of winning). But If you asked me how I FEEL about how lucky I am, on a scale from 0 to 100 then I would say probably around 30. (at least during the current time - since I have been on a losing streak, it seems.)I have definitely felt luckier in the past.",

Gambling is only for entertainment with not too much allocation of funds.^Nope, it also matters on which game you are playing for, probably in matches playing cards could be has a greater percentage of chances but in games that are against the house edge, I will rate it into 1-5% which is become hard to increase your chances of winning. In the lottery, how can you rate this? Haha, it could be less than 1 or the smallest fraction of the percentage is your chances of winning, it is quite slim than other games so technically, it matters on which game you bet for. Because for me, this is not important as long as I enjoy the game.",
