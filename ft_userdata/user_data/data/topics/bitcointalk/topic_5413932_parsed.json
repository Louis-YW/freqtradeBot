  "content": "Hi - has anyone used Primocache or other caching software to speed access to a HDD-based block store?I've used the trial and it substantially increased the time to load the windows bitcoin client. It also seems to reduce wear of unnecessary writes to the primary SSD I use, which has the client and some indexes on it. I decided to buy the full package, as it's useful for more than only bitcoin. Is there other software that runs reliably that is a substantial improvement on the native windows caching systems, that makes use of resources like RAM to reduce wear to components like HDDs and SSDs, when using a bitcoin client? This is really important if your systems are highly multipurpose and multi-functional, to reduce e waste and other pollution, and make better use of limited resources so that more people can benefit. I assume that with POS there is less need to run a full node, but sometimes it's useful. Thoughts on this would be valued. Version I've used is 4.2.0",

I use this disk caching thing for gaming, but wouldn't really use it for anything else especially if it is as sensitive as running a node where you are online 24/7.",

Either do it properly with a controller card with cache and and a battery to keep the information in the RAM in case of power outage OR just go for a SSD. Not saying it will not work, just that it's not going to work as well as something that was designed to do it. Without knowing the specs of the rest of the system it's tough to give good advice as to what would help performance.-Dave",

HDD cache software is still being sold?Such oil snake software (which have small impact or has unmentioned danger, while also collect your personal data) still has place today. IMO the worst offender would be game/FPS booster.Going to disagree with you both a very very little bit on this. 99% of the time you are right.For the most part for it's crap and does nothing. However, you do have to put in a 'but'.On older systems, with slower hard drives, and yes there are a ton of machines out there with 5400RPM drives, it does help.And keep in mind some OEMs made PCs with 1TB 5400 RPM drives with no onboard cache to meet a price point.Today, 4GB sticks of DDR3 RAM are very cheap to the point that a lot of IT people just give it away since it has no real use at all anymore.So in the situation of old PC, slow crap drive, free extra RAM. Yes it does help.And you don't have to buy a better drive or clone your old drive or do anything like that.Like I said very limited good comes from it, but not zero at all times.-Dave",

OF course there are always extra tasks (and problems) to do, like initial loading and unloading back to hdd, danger related to unexpected crash of system and losing data stored in memory etc etc. Personally I have never used ramdisk for any sensitive data.By the way, I understand that we have progress in hardware development, we have faster disks, memory and processors, but it does not mean that all 10 year old computers shoud go to bin. 10 years ago people worked on computers and were able to do their daily tasks...",

I mean - I would not use ramdisk for saving draft of document I edit, you know what I mean.As a place which makes the traces of work to disappear - I understand that approach.Regarding the main question - as far as I know blocks does not need to be stored on a fast drive, the problem is with indexes.",
