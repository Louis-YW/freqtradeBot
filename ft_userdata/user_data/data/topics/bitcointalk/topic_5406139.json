  "content": "What happened:: Hello Guys,I am new to crypto and mining in general and wanted to tell you about this scam website that I found.The name of the website is linzhiphoenix.io and they claim to be the official website of the of the company manufacturing the Linzhi Phoenix.At the time they really looked official and I gathered some money from friends and what I had put aside and acted based on my emotions.The transfer was with BTC, I never really had any suspicion about them. On the website it said 2 days processing time. After the third day with no confirmation of shipping I decided to contact them again. They made up some excuse for \"delaying\" the shipping and asked for some understanding. I started to worry, all my friends were telling me that it is a scam. I didn't want to believe.The next week they were already hiding and not replying....I don't know what to do and where to turn.... I know it is my responsibility to protect my coins, but stillScammers Profile Link: I don't think they have a profile hereReference Link: linzhiphoenix.ioAmount Scammed: $7,500.00Payment Method: BTCProof of Payment: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3a9d346bb89d34b5bac7081eae9734f1be6e5c8ab235bf4f4b41557d0d345e57Additional Notes: These scammers must be stopped and not take other people's money.",
