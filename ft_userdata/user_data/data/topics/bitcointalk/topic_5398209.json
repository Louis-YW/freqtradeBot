  "content": "I think it is necessary to warn people for the dangerous of buying second hand computers, especially now that the Corona crisis is a bit lower.Many gamers/people are selling their computers/gaming machines. Trying to find people to buy it.There is an increased risk that these gaming machines which appear beautifull on the outside and a great buy of value could be manipulated and infected with trojans and others spying software and equipment such that if the buyer were to use internet banking or bitcoin that these \"sellers\" of \"second hand gaming personal computers\" could then observe the internet or bitcoin banking and this could lead to compromise of the banking accounts and stealing of funds from the buyer !So consider this a BIG FAT WARNING to be very carefull with buying second hand computers, that almost seem to good to be true.(Even first hand/new computers run risks of being infected, but that is a story for a different time)",

      "body": "Not just the looks outside, but let me tell you an experienced I have buying 2nd hand laptop, (not for my crypto activities just for my kids, sort of gaming laptop).So everything looks ok from the outside, but I didn't check the audio or sound of it. So there is some issue obviously and obviously I want to replace the sound card. When I open it up, it was not only screwed by the previous owners tampered it with some sort of glue. So I have to go the professionals to have it fixed.Of course, the risk is there, and if you wanted to buy a second hand to be used for crypto, then it's better to format or buy a new hardware.",

Usually though, not many people are sophisticated enough to touch the bios side of things, but it's just for piece of mind on my end. Ultimately, a wipe/format should be sufficient for most people, either with dban or dd on Linux systems. Although, that usually requires connecting a USB to a possibly infected machine. So, either go the Qubes OS route, and isolate or use a Live CD of Ubuntu etc. Although, most of the time much of that is overkill. Although, I do always recommend people listening to their inner threat model, and not compromise.",

That is why it is always better to assemble your computer buying piece by piece, since in this way you avoid certain problems like the ones you say and you will have comfort with the components that you install.",

Security-wise this is not really advisable most especially to people who are not aware how to secure their wares...good for those who know they can do to stop any malicious programs found within. Better be buying a new one...for those in budget we already have many cheap laptops or computers available.",

      "body": "Best it to build it yourself with parts from a site like newegg. It is sad motherboards and cpus have rocketed in price. Now as far as that idea it seems kinda of crazy for someone to install spyware/malware to resell a computer to one person. People using that arent so stupid and prob have way better methods of spreading their malware easier and cheaper. Now is it possible for sure. But as many said you would want to reinstall or reformat. Only issue is rootkits. Again this is for the super paranoid. But this can be root level virus that loads before even the operating system. Can be hard to rid of but is more a state level actor or advanced cyber criminal. They arent going to be embedding there computer with high level malware to resell to an unknown user who can turn out to be a grandma and especially leave a trace back to them by the payment lol. Just my 2 cents.An another reason buying gaming machine second hand is bad is not only the software could be compromised but you dont know what they were doing with this said machine. For example maybe they were mining eth for the past 3 years and banging the sh*t out of the GPU. Said GPU can be less effective and eventually crap out a lot sooner from all the overuse. So that cheap looking machine yea it might not be worth it. You get what you pay for.PS: Governments have backdoors on all these machines, hardware and such already lol. Cough windows. Routers and other hardware/firmware. If your really into security and privacy i suggest looking into and researching virtual boxes and whonix. Encryption is great too i recommend VeraCrypt.",

Although, that usually requires connecting a USB to a possibly infected machine. So, either go the Qubes OS route, and isolate or use a Live CD of Ubuntu etc.Iirc repartitioning the HDDs can be done even from Windows' install DVD. Of course, I have an E2B stick with plenty of iso with tools, so I have where to choose from for the job if needed, some from Linux, some even under Windows. I mean that there's a much wider list of options.And although I've used SDelete (yes, I'm a Windoze guy) here and there, I think that repartitioning does the job and wipe is overkill.Quote from: Welsh on May 11, 2022, 10:02:13 PMAlthough, most of the time much of that is overkill. Although, I do always recommend people listening to their inner threat model, and not compromise. The problem is that most people don't have enough knowledge and their \"inner threat model\" will be silent, hence troubles like those signaled by OP.",
