      "body": "Anyone can create a coin by forking github repositories of existing cryptocurrencies, or deploy a token easily using existing smart-contract frameworks by using the remix IDE. This is an absurd price. I understand some people do not know how to do these things and prefer convenience, though this is still an astronomical price for convenience. If you are genuine about offering your services and you want customers, think of how many hours it takes for you to conduct this process and multiply it by a fair hourly rate instead of ripping people off.",
