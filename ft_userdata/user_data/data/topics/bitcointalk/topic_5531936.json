I am not Muslim but from what I know, Zakat is a mandatory donation of all muslims taken from their profit. Correct me if I am wrong but only adult muslims and those who have a wealth of a certain amount are required to pay Zakat and they only do this once a year. From what I have searched, 2.5% of their profit must be donated. Anyway, it is good that religious groups are now starting to see bitcoin for what it is which is a currency. It is very smart in their part because now people could be more motivated to donate since it would just be easy and very convenient.",

You can not have agreement with all other people about what Bitcoin is, what it can be used for.The good news is Bitcoin is a public blockchain, and it's opened for everyone to use it, if you want, you can join and become an investor, user, miner, a Bitcoin node operator.Bitcoin is better than many other investment assets since 2009, with super high ROI and in security, it's best as no way to brute force Bitcoin private key. If you keep your Bitcoin private key safely, secure its backup too, you always have your bitcoin and noone can steal it. With Bitcoin you can bring it everywhere, just in a USB stick, a paper, and in any device.",

For those who want to donate, there should not and will not be obstacles. All these, like, \"innovations\" only say that money, and bitcoin is money, is needed by everyone. How to understand religion, which in theory should be unified, unified in all its definitions, if cryptocurrency is allowed, let it be in all those countries that rely on religion; if not, then it should not be called \"zakat\" or another religious term . I see only manipulation here: what is profitable, then it is possible; what is not, then it is not. There is no need to look for religion where there is an economy, and nothing more. memehunter gave a good definition of all these innovations, and religion in general always keeps away from money (if it is real).Quote from: memehunter on February 17, 2025, 09:59:00 AMSo this 2.5% will be from profit or total investment?It's hard to imagine that everyone will be honest.",

And this is truly the first country to allow Zakat payments. I hope my country will do the same, especially because my country is one of the countries with a Muslim population, but I feel that the most important thing to allow is Bitcoin, because other cryptos still have risks and still need a lot of consideration to be included, especially if it is shitcoin or memecoin.

What do you mean? haram and halal is about the religion, not the country.There's nothing like something in Malaysia is halal while in the other country it's haram.  Is there a country where eating pork is halal for Muslim?There's need an one answer whether Bitcoin is halal or haram, since Malaysia accept Bitcoin in Zakat, this mean Bitcoin is halal.

However, if Bitcoin is used purely as a currency and is accepted as a medium of exchange for all purposes, then there is no doubt that Zakat can be paid.Why are you confusing the issue? There is a difference between paying Zakat through Bitcoin and paying Zakat on Bitcoin. Of course, people who are entitled to Zakat will not accept Bitcoin or want to accept it, because they need cash and such a poor (more) person will not be an educated person who knows Bitcoin and how to use Bitcoin. Maybe some people may agree to accept Bitcoin.Suppose, it is obligatory for you to pay Zakat on your land. If you want to pay Zakat, will you give your land to a poor person as Zakat? Of course not. You have to pay 2.5% of the value of your land as Zakat to the poor. You can consider Bitcoin in the same way. You must set aside and pay Zakat on 2.5% of your total Bitcoin holdings, equal to the Bitcoin equivalent value or equivalent amount. For example, if you own 100 Bitcoins with a market value of approximately $10,000,000 (assuming an exchange rate of $100k), then you must pay Zakat on 2.5 Bitcoins with a market value of $250,000. This means you must pay this amount in fiat.",
