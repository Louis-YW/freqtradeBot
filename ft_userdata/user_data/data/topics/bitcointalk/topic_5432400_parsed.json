  "content": "A family comprises of two,three or more person depending on the type of family. There there must be the father and mother. It is good that we should know how to relate with our family members well in other for easy corrections and advices, so that a good moral and God fearing life can be practiced. Children learn from what they see their parents do at home,than what their parents tell them. For instance,if a man always tells his 15yrs old son to always be at home at 6.00pm and the father comes back home at 10.00pm, how will this boy not stay late nights when he becomes an adult.The home is the first place where the child starts learning from toddler stage till youth stage, and every character displayed by parents in the house will affect their children positively or negatively. That is why as parents we should always try our best to live in unity and love and be of good example to our children. We shouldn't over pamper them and think that we are giving them much love, instead you are making them useless and being nuisance to the society. If these kind of pampered children are given power or leaders in the society they will mess the whole thing up due to the spoilt way,they were brought up. They will also be the ones who will be doing all sort of evils in the society because they were not cautioned by their parents.It is good that the moment your child misbehaved,you should caution and correct him immediately, so that he will live to grow with the right morals and to be a good leader in the society,they will also be of good behavior and add value to the society. Majority of atrocities that are happening in the society today are children whose parent didn't correct them or put them through in life,by living a good life as an example for them to emulate. Parents should have time with their children and correct them when they are going wrong so that they will be able to add value to the society by displaying what they have learnt from their parents. So many homes are broken or some parents don't even see their children for more than a month or two all in the excuse of work, how will you be able to see the wrongs of your child and make correction. The society will end up training your child in the way he will be useless in life. We should try to help this little ones who are vulnerable to attacks to have good morals and character, because that was why God gave them to us,it is not just to give birth to them and leave them alone due to our selfish intention. This will help them  add positive impact to the society ,and this will help to tackle some evil deeds in the society because family is the bedrock of the society.",

The government should be the last body to orientate any parent on the upbringing of their wards. The government is not the determinant of what’s right and wrong and should not have any business in how parents raise their wards.Obviously, there are laws that’s put in place by the government that somewhat dictates on how parents should bring up their children. Those laws are out in place for the general welfare of the child. Aside those laws guaranteeing the rights of the child, the government has no say in how the child is brought up. It all dwells on the parents. Everyone knows the difference between right and wrong and parents no matter how they try to shield away from responsibilities, are the root cause if their child goes astray.",

Unfortunately, this lack of connection between couples, parent-child relationships, and siblings can lead to resentment, especially when parents stop paying attention to their kids' regular activities. As a result of these dysfunctional family settings, the majority of recorded cases of domestic violence, child molestation, kidnapping of girls, and inadequate schooling have occurred.Since busy schedules sometimes make it difficult to slow down and spend time with families, parents must make every effort to instill in their children good morals. In turn, children must be honorable AMBASSADORS of their family tree.",

My 2 children, always follow my every action and word. If I get angry and swear, they will repeat the same thing, they have absolutely no idea what they just said, they are just copying from me.

If you child does something good,call her cheer him up and encourage him to do more,but if he does something wrong, call him and let him know what he did was wrong and tell him the implications of his actions or words,so that he would not do it anymore.

No child chooses his family because you can't select your parents. Some children are born into homes that are headed by drug addict, criminals and child molester. They end up imbibing what they learn from their parents and become a challenge to the society. These children would still grow up to have their own children that might still inculcate the same abnormal behaviors.For us as parents we must ensure that we give the best to our children. Providing their physical need is not enough because emotional and psychological needs are also very important. We must not be too harsh or too soft to our children. The wife and the husband should be friendly to the children so that they can open up and tell them their problems.Recently, my 10year old son told my wife that our neighbors daughter was touching his private part and he is having an urge he cannot explain. And he told her not to tell me because I might be very angry with him. This event just taught me that I must be more friendly with him so that he can also seek advice from me too.",

But of the two, Family that is the people you spent the early stages of your life with and grew up with is more important because you are thought how to act respectfully, that is you are thought morals. An uneducated child with good morals will not be a problem to the society, but an educated child with bad morals is more likely to a nuisance to society.",

That is when all goes south, if you ask me. Many things can go wrong with a teen who does not find discipline and a model to follow when starts to learn from influencers from Instagram, Facebook or Twitter. Those people are fake and would only share what is worth for them to share: parties, women, alcohol abuse, gambling, etc.  The teen would eventually believe that is what a \"winner\" looks like and try to pursue to get a life of eternal party into his own life. It is even worse when the people followed on social media are cruel, greedy, mistreats women, etc. Social media and easy access to internet for children are the anti thesis of proper parenting.",
