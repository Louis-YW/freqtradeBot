  "content": "The upcoming US election has been the greatest thriller movie for me as I have followed it since this year. The chance of Trump becoming the next President is very high after Biden drops out of the race. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin community has extended its support to Trump and invited him to the Bitcoin conference in 2024. He had assured the community at his speech that he would and I quote belowQuoteThe Republican nominee for US president pledged to commute Ross Ulbricht’s sentence, fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and have all Bitcoin mined in the United States.Yesterday in an interview he gave a new statement which I am quoting below.Quote\"Who knows? Maybe we'll pay off our 35 trillion dollars, hand them a little crypto check, right?\" Trump suggested to Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo in an interview. \"We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion.\"SourceWhat do you think is he bluffing with the statement above or is he deceiving the community to gain vote and become the next President of the US?",

He is given a choice to live a day in hell and a day in heaven and then Trump will have a choice of where he will live forever. First, Trump decides to see a place in Hell.  There is a lot of fire, there is a celebration going on, he meets a lot of his friends, everyone is drinking whatever they want, dancing. He spends a day in Hell and is taken by his angels to Paradise.In Paradise it is beautiful, the sun shines, houses of gold and silver, but it is boring, and his acquaintances are not there.The day is over and the angels ask Trump what place he chooses.He chooses Hell because his acquaintances are there and it's fun.He is sent to Hell and as soon as he gets there he sees that there is a lot of fire and all the inhabitants are suffering a lot. Trump is outraged and says he was tricked, but they tell him he wasn't tricked. The day before yesterday there was an election campaign in Hell to elect a chief demon, When he was in Heaven there was an election.And today the election is over.. \"",

I also feel it is a bluff to satisfy the media Just think about it. Bitcoin is now the largest decentralized asset that allows you to move assets under sanctions and does not require large suitcases like cash.The crypto market is very important for the US because many crypto companies are forced to buy US Treasuries.US policy for the World will not change. There is a difference if you live in the US and have a business there.That is why I read the news about who will fire whom after the elections, but I do not take it seriously.",

What I mean is that Trump will do what he will believe is in his best interest to do to have the support of the people. Right now, the goal is to win the election. If he doesn't win, pushing for pro-crypto policies will no longer be in his interest, so I think he won't do it.
