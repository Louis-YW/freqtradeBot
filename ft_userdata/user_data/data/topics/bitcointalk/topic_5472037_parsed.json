  "content": "Welcome everyone, as this copy trade thing is a new thing that has just released, i might as well give it a try!Im here not to promote any class or any signal, i am just here to promote my copytrade, i am not selling my hard earned golden eggy!Im still putting part of my capital to copytrade from future wallet, as i am still grasping if there are any difference from lending fees or anything that is different from the normal future trades. And eventually to put all my capital to copytrade section if everything is the same.My Portfolio as of 29-Oktober-2023 https://imgur.com/a/jGqrTh7Cash- $6,9001 Y - $7,074Im not begging or forcing you to join my copytrade, nor do i guarantee profit. Feel free to check my screenshots, and if you feel like its a good opportunity, feel free to join up, i would suggest bring small amount of capital to test out the water first.Why is my ROI so big in the first few days of copytrade? luck, as these past few days, the coin goes up like crazy, but i would put my benchmark at around 10% per monthSome background about myselfIm a trader that tried all sort of things that could be traded online, from coin, forex, stocks, etf, bonds, etc, and i found myself very comfortable with crypto, main reason would be as they are open 24/7. I started trading in 2015, and i found success in trading crypto in around 2019, it was not an easy ride at all =). I trade in binance future with a starting capital of $1,000 in 2019, and managed to convert it to $6,666 in 2022, and after that i withdraw whatever i gain from crypto, and leave $6,666 in the bank to trade. I saw the opportunity and would try to embark on this copytrade journey, and here we are, trying to promote my copytrade. I am looking to increase my capital to $10,000, hoping to achieve it by the end of the year =)Link to join my copytradehttps://www.binance.info/en/copy-trading/lead-details?portfolioId=3696019065534966784 JOIN AT YOUR OWN RISK, PROFITS ARE NOT GUARANTEED!If you are interested, i would suggest select fixed ratio, and set dd to 95% =)For those who are interested, thank you for trusting me, and i will updates my progress hereCurrent Task 29/10/23- Put all capital to copytrade- Make capital to $10,000",

My scare is just the uncertainty of bots being deployed and midway, these bots go haywire and the fall is always disastrous. Imagine committing a significant amount of savings to a bot trading copy trade and get to loose it.",

I target around 10%/month.To do list:- Make an ig channel",

How much can someone expect to get by copytrading you ?I averaged around 10% per month .You could see my track record in binance copytrade, if you want to join i suggest to enter with a minimum of $100 and fixed ratio sl 95%, feel free to smell around first and join if you think its good =)The downside to my current strat is that i can only do this with a maximum of around $50k usd, more than 50k will decrease my income significantly. But i dont have that much capital, so im trying to get that much first, one of the method is by gaining money from copytrade. Oh and another downside that im worrying about is, that if binance shuts down.",

      "body": "3 March Update Been having alot of IRL problemso im going to update nowwhy join me, instead of other copytrader that gives much more APY ?There are 2 main problem for me that lies in binance copytrading section, first would be that lead copytrader could adjust their balance, meanwhile fucking up their copytrader margin, for exampleA is a Lead trader, and B is copytrading A, A has $10,000 CapitalB has $500 CapitalIf A enter a trade with $20k and bought 20k dogecoin with $1 each, and price of doge coin goes to $.6, the Lead trader could just top up whenever he wants to not get liquidatedmeanwhile B has no information regarding this, and his $500 would just get liquidatedhence why one of the reason i say to have a minimum $100 to copytrade me is this. (There is one more reason that is related to some coin have minimum purchase, but we wont be discussing that here)Second would be some lead copytrader can take out all his money, and leave $1k in his lead copytrading, and make him and all his follower get liquidated on purpose, as i saw some copytrader get liquidated with tens of thousands of dollar, meanwhile the lead trader portfolio PNL does not decrease a significant amount.Why is he doing this? i can only think of 2 simple reason, one he bought alt coins, in which he bought the coin from another future account, and to bring the price up, he bought using his lead trading account, or the lead trader is just a shit of a person.Well anyway, with this info, i could guarantee you that i would not do this, as first, if i have this shit in mind, i wont be sharing to you guys, im here to make a decent amount of traction for my social media slowly, and i have a couple of friends that help me with this journey, and also i would like to thank you for everyone that has been helping me gaining this much amount of follower.With that in mind, i have made another lead copytrading portfolio, that technically gives alot of more APY, feel free to check it out, but with more APY return, there comes with more risk, so keep in mind with problem A =)I guarantee you guys that with my main portoflio, with a minimum of $1,000 you wont be needing to add any money.If you have any worry or questions, feel free to dmhere is my telegram account: @dcoinclub",
