If you hear about the increment of price for market you no need to allow your former product finish before you increase your price too. Why is it like that? If you no increase the price and you wan wait for your former product to finish that means you no go see new product buy again since the price don increase for market and your money no go reach again.why NNPC dey fix price?NNPC say e no dey fix price for anybody.

This price hike no go continue like this dey go. E go dey change as people are buying and the sellers too go soon dey reduce the price in order to attract more customers to their side. The problem here be say we dey easily adapt to things for this country Â how Dangote, NNPC and other refineries fit help the matter?Plenty things go take place if dangote refinary begin dey work now and more extra better things if govt own refineries are revive also.

I watched one of PBAT videos during the presidential campaign where he bragged that if he becomes president he would remove subsidy and he would also be unperturbed by series of protest from aggrieved nigerians. So if we want to go by what he said... Subsidy removal has come to stay.Like dis some people dey talk say de subsidy removal na beta tin but na naija wey dey. How are we sure say after we don suffer all dis suffer finish our govt go do the right thing?

My area, some people dey even say no bi President Tinubu Removed di fuel price while other people dey no bi Buhari. But me I know say no Buhari and Tinubu come dey implement am fully so na the both men do am. As Buhari start am Tinubu can still cancel it as president. Fuel subsidy na good thing but I no support am because mostly we do Niger Delta. The oil is taking from di area yet we are not benefiting any and probably na only di fuel subsidy we been dey benefit. Now di fuel price in my locality is #700-800 per litre. Very soon the poor and the average Nigerians can not buy fuel again. For the Dangote Refinaries. Make nobody put hope for there. Di Refinaries wey im build at di Northern part of di country e no dey sell fuel in di kwantri but im dey carry am go outside kwantri dey sell dem. Dangote cements wey dem dey sell am very cheap in other kwantries, dem dey sell am #5000 in Nigeria. Anything Dangote , I no won hear am with my hears. He is one of the problem in Nigeria. He is also joining di ruling class to suffer the poor. Dangote can discuss with the president to reduce cost of living in the kwantri but he is very happy when the people are suffering.",

Na because the government dey inefficient and ineffective to monitor wetin people wey dey sell petrol dey do and in fact wetin business people dey do with products wey dem buy. Na masses just dey carry or the load through increment. Government suppose dey control price through the necessary board but na who go do am when dem dey corrupt. Before I come to petrol own, shebi we know say some people wey dey sell some things like food stuffs, beverages etc, there products dey spoil for there hand if them no sell am quick and in this instance, dem go reduce the price so dat dem fit sell am out quicker, so na who dey pay dem back the difference when dem go buy new one?Another thing be say if companies dey bring new products for market against the existing old one, customers dey rush the new one and that one most times make the seller to keep the price of the old and new differently.Now for petrol as marketers dey rush change to new price because make dem for fit buy for new price when dem make order, that na lie. On a normal, new price is suppose to be bought with new price and sold in new price. If dem increase price, you buy based on the new price and sell so as well. Anyway, the regulation for petrol market and control really need some touch for things to make sense.",
