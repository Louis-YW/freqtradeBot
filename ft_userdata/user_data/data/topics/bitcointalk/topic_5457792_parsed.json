He will be trending on the news, social media, TV and everyone all over the globe will have his name in their mouth and in their thoughts, as he is the most entertaining and popular president (candidate) of the world.This does not mean that we won‚Äôt benefit from short term action.In fact, more people will look for Trump related tokens as the market is stabilising more and more, as Trump is gaining more relevance and popularity.Why am I so certain about our success?Everyone here knows that I do not like mentioning other crypto currency project‚Äôs, so let‚Äôs not do this again‚Ä¶ üòÅIn 2021 Elon Musk posted a Tweet saying that he‚Äôd buy a dog called Floki.Remember what happened after?@RealFlokiInu pumped to an All Time High of around 5 billion market cap after that happened just because they were the biggest and most known project in the space with a Floki related name.#TrumpCoin is the biggest and most known project in the space with a Trump related name as well.This means that your investment in TrumpCoin is very likely to pump after Trump gains more attention in the world.Why would you invest now?TrumpCoin is not just waiting for luck or miracles to happen. We are creating our own legacy with the help of our own initiatives.If you remember the very first days of our launch when many other projects tried to copy us, you‚Äôll notice that they‚Äôre ALL dead by now.None of them survived due to them not being as original and dedicated as us.We‚Äôre persistent, hard working, transparent and backed by some BIG whales.Why do you think Venture Capitals approached us in the first place?They know that once #Trump gains more popularity ALL Crypto investors will look for a ‚ÄúTrumpCoin‚Äù so why wouldn‚Äôt they invest in the one and only TrumpCoin!!!Let this sink in‚Ä¶",

Never heard before that a president creates it's own crypto. I think they are too busy for it and they are rich already to still have an interest on selling a crypto. Projects like this are only a meme coin and I think I already heard of this before. Maybe they are only inspired to Pepe coin who failed at their first attempt but later on became successful. Great that you are concerned about the others but the question is, are those people feeling the same thing to you? They won't even thank you for that kindness your showing. Like it or not, there will always be people who choose to be greedy and they won't ever made their research before they invest in a crypto.",

Not that it matters too much as whether it is one or more it will be undeniable that both will be a shitcoin, however I wonder if scammers are really out of ideas and are even recycling old coins just to try to deceive newbies into investing into their useless coins, however I doubt that it will have the same success it had years ago as I do not see the fans of Trump as excited as they were back then when he declared his intention to compete for the US presidency.",

Meme coins is market is full of project that is just leeching on current trend either personality, cartoon, or anything that is viral online. What really surprised me is the volume of liquidity being staked on the liquidity pool of this garbage token because some random meme coin that is newly listed on DEX sometimes get 1M or more liquidity which is a sign that many people still trust investing this coin.If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Trump coin or meme coin is already popular when he became president. This meme coin is just reviving it‚Äôs popularity after the recent action of Elon about supporting Trump to regain control of his Twitter account that is banned during the previous ownership before Elon bought Twitter.",

All they needed is low level photoshopping and forking a coin. There weren't even tokens so everything had their own chain.",
