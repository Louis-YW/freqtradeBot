I am sure they can answer your Bitcoin trading questions and tell you about the best trading practices. So, you might want to move your post there instead: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0Also, I have never heard of Bingx but I would strongly advise against copy trading. It never ends well. You should trade only after doing your own research.",

And as far as I can see you are not a newbie in this crypto trading industry, because what you are doing is a style of traders that only a newbie here can't understand.    Also, copy trading for me is not desirable, because it is not profitable for me either. Yes, you can make money there, but it's not big, and don't expect to make a lot of money, and there are many chances that copying the traders there is good, because most of them are not.",

But hey, I've stumbled upon Tycoon Signals(Tycoon.io) , and I've got high hopes for it! From what I gather, they've got verified traders who know their stuff. Plus, they offer a bunch of different trading strategies that you can tailor to your liking. And the best part? You can customize the risk management to match your own risk tolerance. They also show you all the stats and performance info, so you can make smart choices about who to copy. The interface is user-friendly, and they've got a cool community vibe going on too. Can't wait to see if Tycoon Signals lives up to the hype!How do you think this new platforms compares to what currently on the market and would you go for it ?If you find the project interesting do not hesitate to support it and click on my Refence link and spread the word.",

Copy-trading is the worse form of trading for any trader and it won't teach you anything about trading in general. The copy-trading is not safe as you can get your capital liquidated by following a trader blindly.It's always preferable to learn the trading yourself as that will be the best thing for the long term success. Many people get some profitable trades with copy-trading and then they blindly put their money into it. And, when those people lose the whole capital as copy-trading is most probably the main cause of liquidation in crypto-trading world. Those traders whom you're following can't predict the market 100% of the time, and that's why you're putting your capital at risk with the copy-trading stuff. Although, it's possible to gain information about Bingx with a Google search, but I would rather suggest you to withdraw your funds from copy-trading and learn the basics of trading first before putting your money into it.",

Why risk letting someone else figure out your strategy? In that case you could sell signals and earn something out of it, instead of giving those signals for free.As you can see it does not make much sense for anyone to let themselves be copied by someone else if they obtain nothing from it, so it would not surprise me if some dishonest exchanges allowed copy trading and the only options available for those interested in it were bad traders or bots programmed to lose on purpose.",

By the way, it's not important to know the identity of traders whom you copied, what's important is you're earning. As long as you are earning and there's nothing wrong of what you're doing then you can go.QuoteIf someone gave you some trading advice on the street would you accept it? And if the answer is no, then why is that case? Why things suddenly change just because now that advice is being offered online through the platform of an exchange?I see your point but the thing here is that the street (misterious one) is different from what I said, I mean, I'm getting an advice to a profitable one not from a unsuccessful trader. Ofcourse, you have to observe and determine if that person is telling the truth that he is really earning of that kind of stuff. By the way, he is my mentor and he provide a proof that he is really earning.",

My team has created a trading account on BingX, and the strategy we use is using Fibonacci, Bollinger Bands, RSI, MACD, and some other indicators, to safely enter trades. The margin is 3% of the account. On bullish markets, it's always a win and and on bearish market, it only drops to collect orders. The worst case scenario over a year can be loss of 30% of the account, but if you patiently hang in there, a lot more than that 30% will have already been profited. Meaning that if you enter in January, there's a high chance to receive over 500% profit, making your account 5 times bigger. Let's say if it's 100$, you'll have 500$ and in the worst scenario, losing 30% of that will result in 350$ which is still 350% of your initial asset. We think that's a very safe strategy.
