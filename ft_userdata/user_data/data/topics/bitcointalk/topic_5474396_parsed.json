And you might even be surprised that some users might even encourage you to use a non-kyc exchange if you care about your privacy after giving you the steps you need in completing the verification.",

After clicking there, you can verify the account with your own ID number.After clicking on the red circle with number one, you can see a page like this, there is your ID card number. (ID card number of whose ID card you want to verify)Name and father's name and date of birth should be given.After giving them correctly, a page will appear in front of you where you will be asked to take a picture of your face, move your head according to their instructions, close and open your eyes, tilt your head up and down.If these are correct your account will be verified within few minutes.",

I don't think that this is the philosophy of most members of the forum (or maybe I'm not so senior, but I don't think that is the problem).So who knows, maybe he/she was simply asking how to verify identity, that can be done without coming to a specialized forum, or maybe someone understands what he really means and contact him/her in private.OP, if your intentions are good, beware of possible scam attempts in your inbox. If they're not, consider getting back on the right track before it's too late.",

Fake ID and addresses? It's not going to work on Binance exchange because they use live verification where they won't allow you to upload any picture, you will need to hold your ID you just submitted in your hand and take selfie, some will even ask you to right your name and date on paper and hold it with your ID card, gone are the days where you can use a fake ID to pass KYC verification. The last time I passed KYC verification on Binance was so easily done, all I dropped was my BVN number and they automatically have access to my full name and others, no ID dropped and no selfie was asked of me, but right now I am not sure that they still have that available, you can check if it is, but it's the most easiest way of completing KYC verification on Binance exchange, the easiest I have ever done on any exchange so far. KYC verification is not complicated to pass, there is no need to go online looking for videos to watch, just follow Binance rules and regulations, they will guide you through easily.After clicking your account details you will see identification on the menu like this..Then you will see verification levels and if you haven't passed any before you should start with the Fiat limit of 50k USD daily as this is what I passed too.",

I hope things donâ€™t get more complicated for him and he must have known the disadvantages of keeping money in a centralized exchange.
