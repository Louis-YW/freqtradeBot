      "body": "So the point of the game is to be the one who deposits the most coins into a given address. I tried to start a new round just to see the UI and how the game is played but I got a '429 Too many requests' error. Maybe it's because I am using a VPN or are you maybe experiencing some issues with the game right now?One thing isn't clear to me. You explain that the game is over if no one raises the bet after 144 new blocks. Theoretically, the game could then last days/weeks/months... I have always been of the opinion that gamblers prefer quick rounds in casino games, rather than long and painful waiting times.Â  How do you handle unconfirmed transactions or transactions that are deposited after a round has ended? Let's say I broadcast a transaction, but it doesn't find its way into the 144th and last block and only gets confirmed a few blocks later. Does the game end, and what happens with my money? Or do you register unconfirmed transactions as well and consider them valid as long as your wallet sees them before the last 144th block gets mined? Good luck with the game!",
