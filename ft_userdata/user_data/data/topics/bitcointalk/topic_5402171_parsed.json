  "content": "Hello,I was told to post an issue in the 'General Discussion' forum, so here it is...Iam having a fairly small issue - that Ive just never experienced before, and I was hoping one of you might have an idea. Ive used this GPU to mine XMR a month or two ago, and everything was fine. I just tried launching XMRig - and it seems to be stuck on the very last line that you see on the image there, which says, \"allocated 2336 MB (2080+256) huge pages 100% 1168/1168 + JIT (1ms)\"I have seen that line before, but the client always - just starts mining away after that for some reason now - it just wont move past that, its stuck right there.I have:1. Changed Pool2. Changed Mining Clients3. Restartedand a few other things, but I was just curious if anyone might know why this is suddenly happening?Thank you,Jhttps://postimg.cc/n9fkxMpB",
