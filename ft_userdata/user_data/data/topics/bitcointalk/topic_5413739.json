  "content": "Hi everyone..1) I tried putting in my given public key.. but the output returns as invalid. am i suppose to convert the raw given public key in a bitcoin transaction before using lattice? what shoud i convert it to?2) If all i had is the public key, can the lattice attack program still work?3)if i must give the r,s,kp values besides the public key, which website gives very technical details of a bitcoin transaction? i know 2coins is now defunct. is there any similar website?based on https://github.com/bitlogik/lattice-attacki have read the READ.md but im still not very clear. hence, im here aking you experts. Thank you so much on your advice.",

ThanksYes if you want i can try to resume the  lattice attack in a simple way but i have to know what sort of leakage in the nonce of the signature  are you attempt in the signatures you want to attack?-a small nonce for ex a nonce between 1 to 2^128  instead of 1 to 2^256 like this :000000000000000000000000000000003fc87113fa3119661528d1ead67fd97c00000000000000000000000000000000c9b514fe70e73b4762e893ad7fa927b900000000000000000000000000000000bccd31a9026c3b39220ab2d185b408000000000000000000000000000000000075c73909c9d056ec09c5394ebd04336400000000000000000000000000000000a86b35d428b45d48be1b4995c8c8b4ad00000000000000000000000000000000b08ad648ce95649a0d893e7d7b596503...-a leakage in the MSB or LSB of signatures (for ex you know the first 8 bits of the nonce value)8798269c708d7cdcf5c8d81a3e6e5f8770dbfaebfd0130e70bd4cf1ecf8adbd108a31e897638a5bf4c3adc3daaaf3d8f1241b30ac46fea3e0f154547b01380df51bf53e79da24d83649ff8396cfb81b6c02d4c6a65776d40217c7b8b66cf6000d279f11b49061bc8c804ceea19327956beaaf16b84383a10df39db88e457f99344159fa36129f20e644542b83c8bd8b5eb22a1bd78bdc2787c0de106b20962c5be46afb29211a3a68149533eaaecd2b817d7fe3584085fbe329ac8751bffe703it assumes that you know the bold value before performing the attack -a weak generation of nonce with fixed bits for ex the 16th bytes of the  nonce have always  the value \"FD\" (you don't have to know what value but only that the bits at a fixed position are always the same).f62a05c0e4fab585df2a0e020e87b62fdbfc6112306de89c2e692ac22c34a412c357830e65c5a66c63152c51911e0a3fdbd4dd208d990a661b3fc0efa951c208884299a0e2f15bb800ac4139bb4892afd22a141456d399d0c2ed8250e26830363cd1ab221edf28805abef9b0a44d05cfdc1d3d43896d062d96ae5a65499d092c5fe0366612732cada1caac8e2d71277fd94f2abd74e0fa0042786c30695a756d6c79fe6d34c51e311c356fec4a290d7fd7fe27c9f776c172a965a9b8e7f0f9dawith a little trick this last attack can be really powerful because you don't have to know where the fixed bits areGood Day.
