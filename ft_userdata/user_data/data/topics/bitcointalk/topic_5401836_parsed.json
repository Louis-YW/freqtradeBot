      "body": "I expect price to bottom at current prices ($25k to low $30,000s), perhaps throughout the summer if macro environment contintues to look negative for the next few months. But in the Fall I think we'll start to see a recovery. Might just be a slow grinding recovery, or we could see it leap back into the $40k's rather quickly if people start thinking the bear market is over. Basically I don't expect much but I think the recovery will have started before end of the year.When people really start coming back to the market the price should shoot up because of the supply shock from all the accumulation that has happened the past 12 months, but I don't expect a ton of people to come back into the market until next year so I think it's more likely we'll see this bottom play out and then grind up a bit to finish the year, and then next year we'll start to see strong price growth and new ATHs.",

Although it could very well extend to the other remaining half, I think the green and better days are coming. But it might come a little late, in the last quarter of this year, the later part of the second half. There are good news happening and coming but they're still pooling up power. So Bitcoin is probably just consolidating during these boring days. Once it bursts, the price could go into a strong rally toward $50,000.",

Maybe there will be more trends than sideways chop like we have no in September but I think most of the biggest moves will be sometime in Oct-Dec.Right now you can see with all the barting around that there is very little liquidity. And most likely this will continue until Friday when the CPI numbers come out.Then if the numbers are a surprise we should get a decent move.",

There are certain events that are going to happen within the next 10 to 20 days that could have significant effects.We also have another major war that could happen in winter (China/Taiwan) that could mess up the world even more than the Russia/Ukraine one has done.But if the \"doomsday\" scenarios don't take place I expect price to start rising very soon. Breaking certain resistances such as the $50k one could speed up the rise significantly and $100k would be in reach in a very short time after.",

I also expect a red annual candle, since according to the theory of cyclicality, 2022 is a year of decline, after a year of growth and a new ATH, that is, the price will close on December 31 below $45,600.What are your expectations and what do you consider first of all, fundamental analysis or technical analysis based on charts and indicators?Looks like the 4-year cycle is happening right? It happened in 2018 where Bitcoin went down from $20,000 to near $3,000. Base on what is happening around the world, it seems like it will happen again. The good thing is it isn't that worse like what happened in 2018.My prediction to what will happen this year is Bitcoin might go sideways and as long as Bitcoin will not pass the resistance which is the $46,000-$48,000 (highest price reached before the 9 week red candle happened), we might remain stagnant the whole year. I hope that all of us are ready with this one. On the other hand, the good thing is we already saw an inverted hammer candle last week which often means that a trend reversal is happening base on technical. Technical isn't 100% accurate though and it might happen or not. As of now, the weekly candle is in green.",

The true bull market will come somewhere in 2024, together with new halvening. I also don't expect the value of bitcoin to rise in the second half of 2022 at all. The economic situation in the light of recent and previous events has a very unstable position and it would be naive to expect that everything will improve overnight and investors will massively start buying bitcoin. It seems to me (I can only assume) that in the next year or two we will not see a serious bitcoin price growth. I think there will be small growth surges, but this is unlikely to greatly affect the current trend.",

Although, the effort and intent as I see it is not totally defeated as 6months ahead could be a long time.Taking a page in this, we've seen bitcoin dump in a bearish market in such a way that wasn't anticipated and it dumped suddenly and dip too. What to expect next is a period of consolidation where the market gets to struggle back up, with the bulls gaining momentum at each step on the way in preparation for a bullish market during the halving yet to come. So what am expecting is some slight move to the top, let's say $55k and then it stabilises for a long time.",

I think the current price movement is just a preparation for a big pump on the Q4 because the price keeps battling the bears just to keep above 30K many times. I’m still optimistic that Bitcoin will recover and attempt to reach new ATH on Q4 this year despite there is recession looming around the world.",

Can you elaborate on this, this is the first time I hear this theory?I calculate the cycle from halving to halving. 4 years. A rough calculation tells that at around 1.5 years after halving there's the ATH and the downtrend starts, after one more year (more or less) it's basically in the crypto winter and from that point we're getting slowly back to bullish trend, and in 1.5 years there's halving again.Am I wrong?",
