If true, who is the liquidity provider?I don't know why you can't see it, but I can see the maximum amount when I choose cryptocurrency. For example, BTC is set at 54, ETH 810 etc. Their website looks like something that was made in the 1990s and overall there's very little info about them, which makes me very suspicious of all of this.",

Deny the Client's request to withdraw funds into a third-party account without providing a reason;https://basex.one/aml.phpThis is the most annoying policy for any exchange.QuoteEach transaction is attributed a risk factor, signifying the extent of 'contamination' of the funds. This risk factor is capped at a maximum of 25%.After psn.net claimed that because of a stupid bot score funds transferred from crypto.com wallet are suspicious I would stay away from any of those services that even try to calculate a risk score.QuoteThe refund of funds is effectuated after a comprehensive investigation conducted by the Service's Security Department, which may encompass a meticulous verification of the sender. The refund is implemented after deducting a commission fee up to 7% of the transaction amount, this is done to cover the labor expenses associated with processing the application and arranging the fund's reimbursement.7% tax on a hunch the funds are \"risky\" and the user has no right to oppose, lol.You do realize that if you followed AML regulation you would have had to seize the money and inform your local authority about this then after a police inquiry turn the funds to them to return them to the user?This is just abuse and trying to scam so poor user who can't justify with 100 pages of docs proof his $100 earned from a casino!",

We take all necessary measures to protect our users' assets, using cutting-edge security technologies and storing funds in cold wallets.This seems to be common language or words popularly used by exchange owners and I will like to emphasize on the security aspect of this exchange, although hugeblack already given a clear review about the security aspect. This is the only one problem we are facing, trust and security any exchange that can be 99 percent in that area can be a very great exchange and I can actually say is the most important part of every trader or users today. Everyone needs where their funds will be safe due to numerous issues about exchange people are afraid of trusting their assets in the hands of exchange owner.",

Right now, mempool.space shows that 3 sat/vByte is enough to get your transaction included in next block while your website shows, we need 22 satoshis.Quote from: stompix on October 09, 2023, 09:39:10 AMAfter psn.net claimed that because of a stupid bot score funds transferred from crypto.com wallet are suspicious I would stay away from any of those services that even try to calculate a risk score.Risk score is a joke, although, a lot of companies will use that to make money.",
