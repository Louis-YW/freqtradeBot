      "body": "You need to run it using Tor network.Quote from: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/99436/security-risks-with-running-bitcoin-core-and-how-to-protect-yourselfYes your IP address will be visible to peers that you connect to unless you use Tor. (Tor is recommended if privacy is especially important to you.) However, if you choose to use a clearnet node and you don't want your IP address to show up on sites like bitnodes.io you can run a non-listening node by disabling listening. You do this by configuring with the -listen=0 flag or putting listen=0 in your config file. This way you can't be contacted by nodes you aren't directly connected to. The downside to this is that you aren't helping the network as much and you will typically have fewer connections.VPN isn't good for security since they store your IP address on their centralized server, you don't have any way to verify if your VPN is legit and trusted.Running it on different network could increase your privacy for little bit, but it doesn't protect your privacy.",

There could present some security risk and you will need to take some precautions; as suggested above, run it over Tor network and avoid using VPNs. Also, no one needs to know you're running a nice or a mining rig for that matter, although the latter is much harder to keep private.Quote from: russelbrok on December 27, 2022, 09:56:53 AMit better to run bitcoin node / mining in a completely different network?If you can, do run it over a different network that services your home. Same way you would not want to access your wallet address and Netflix on the same network and device.",

More likely since your IP will be known to other node and appear on crawler website such as https://bitnodes.io/.Quote from: russelbrok on December 27, 2022, 09:56:53 AMWould a VPN help or is it better to run bitcoin node / mining in a completely different network?Both option could work, but i don't know how much security risk could be decreased. Besides, you need to trust VPN provider when we're talking about privacy.",

I would advise you that if you don't know much about online security, it might be better to give up on that idea.if you still want to start your node, it is certainly ideal to do it through another network, or at least not the ones through which you do other personal things.",

Take note mining Bitcoin needs ASIC machine to be able to mine Bitcoin and you don't need to have a full node just to mine BTC.And mining Bitcoin needs low ping and stable internet if you are going to use VPN you will get high stale shares due to high ping.So if you are going to mine instead of having a full node better use mining pools without VPN(without tor as suggested above).",

I run a couple of nodes and they both run behind Tor (Umbrel and MyNode). I am not worried about anything being compromised since I don't run lightning nodes or anything. I only use my nodes to check the balances of my wallet addresses and some other stuff but I think at the very least it's a good idea to run all of your traffic through a VPN.I would stat simple and then work your way into more complex node functionality like dealing with the command line and maybe even running a wallet out of it.

Your computer could be compromised when you visit a malicious website that infects it with a keylogger which would then steal your password and wallet file to gain access to your keys and take your money.",
