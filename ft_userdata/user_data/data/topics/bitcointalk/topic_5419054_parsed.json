  "content": "Yesterday was the 14th Bitcoin whitepaper anniversary and it seems like it's just yesterday when it all started. Rides and waves of up and down. And if you're worried and feeling down looking at the price of bitcoin these days because it's not moving a lot. Just take a closer look at this table made by someone that I've seen. I'm not associated with the guy and the website, I've actually visited it but I can't find this image there. Nonetheless, this is a good motivation for those that are impatient about bitcoin's price or wanting to see it pump as soon as possible. Just enjoy the ride and this table will make you patient and want to see more about bitcoin in the future. According to the table, looking at the gain of it, that's 10.2 million times of percentage for its yesterday's price for bitcoin since the same date of 2010. But obviously, the highest was still last year which was the bull run. Now, just take a look at those prices on the same date from different years. That will be enough motivation to HODL and DCA as we're waiting for the next halving and bull run.Source1Source2",

From $0.19 in 2010 to $20k in 2022 today, despite a significant drop from last year's ATH of $67k. But the price of $ 20k is a price that is still high if we look at the history of bitcoin in the past.Bitcoin in the future may be able to reach the latest ATH and exceed the price limit we think. October next year will be October that will be different.source: https://bitcoinvisuals.com/market-volumeTake a look at this daily bitcoin volume chart from 2013-until now, bitcoin daily trading volume continues to increase and the largest volume ever reached was when 2021 when new ATH was reached, and when Bitcoin reaches ATH again the volume will be even greater. Bitcoin is the most valuable digital asset.Meanwhile, regarding the 14th Anniversary Bitcoin Whitepaper SEC Chairman Gary Gensler conveyed his birthday year to Bitcoin Whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto “Happy 14th birthday to Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper! This has led to the innovation and investment of crypto assets. Let's make sure as crypto enters its 15th year that investors are properly protected,\" SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a Twitter post.",

We have never thought that a former's all time high will be now the bottom of the bear market. It just took 5 years before we see and how much more with what we're going to see in the future. As we're waiting for it to heavily reach $100k, that might be the bottom and it will be surpassed in the future.Quote from: taufik123 on November 01, 2022, 01:46:22 PMTake a look at this daily bitcoin volume chart from 2013-until now, bitcoin daily trading volume continues to increase and the largest volume ever reached was when 2021 when new ATH was reached, and when Bitcoin reaches ATH again the volume will be even greater. Bitcoin is the most valuable digital asset.I reckon! It's not just only stable on its volume but it will be higher too.

This has led to the innovation and investment of crypto assets. Let's make sure as crypto enters its 15th year that investors are properly protected,\" SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a Twitter post.Well, that's some recognition from a regulator. I find it positive though because Gensler is recognizing bitcoin but we don't know what they may do from exchanges and to each of us.Quote from: 348Judah on November 01, 2022, 01:59:19 PMHistorical data is what we work with but not he determination for the bitcoin price to rise or fall in it parallel market but the years of consistency as financial asset and currency is a proof, it's not much about the raising or falling in price but rather the length or degree to which one can hodl bitcoin over time, there's certainty about where the future is leading with bitcoin in making better financial economy for those investing today. And that's why we believe in the market cycles and when we tell that to those that are new, they won't understand what it is. But us, we've seen and proved through data and numbers and that's why we're optimistic on what bitcoin awaits in the future. Whether the price of it might fall for the coming years, we know that it's not going to stay there forever and it will eventually recover just like in the old times.Quote from: DapanasFruit on November 01, 2022, 02:07:07 PMTime is certainly flying so fast and before we know it we can be celebrating the 15th year of Bitcoin's Whitepaper and then BTC can be experiencing another round of deserved ATH.

Those that have both at the top are the ones considering that they're in a bad situation because they're holding little bitcoin now and its value has dropped a lot. But just like those that have firstly experienced it on a bear market on 2018 or earlier, if they're patient, they'll get back on the track and will soon see how they're making it. If they still believe in bitcoin, they have to use these times to buy because it's 70% down from the last ATH.Quote from: Agbe on November 01, 2022, 02:40:56 PMWe thank God for another wonderful year of bitcoin again.

Even at the time of 16k$ it was still ATH. The rise of bitcoin is very close. Everyone who is hodling it will enjoy the labour of their work.It varies on the mindset of the holder. If he thinks that it's still ATH, that's being optimistic and positive that no matter how low it may get, it'll be back to the top.Quote from: mk4 on November 01, 2022, 05:21:00 PMUnfortunately the path they wanted to take is most likely \"protection\" through egregious AML/KYC requirements. Gary Gensler and company can honestly go f*ck themselves.With that greetings, I see him welcoming about bitcoin and recognizing it but on the other hand, yeah, welcoming in a way that they'll be doing something that a typical government will do for an asset class like bitcoin. They may say that they are there to protect but it's more than that for sure.Quote from: Zanab247 on November 01, 2022, 05:50:04 PMA big congratulations to all bitcoiners in the community for another 14th anniversary, because many people thought Bitcoin price will not get to this stage before it will collapse for bitcoiners to regret for their choice to be a bitcoiners but today Bitcoin is still standing as the king among other cryptocurrencies.

If it's not for them that has been the advocates and enthusiasts of bitcoin, many won't be part of this great community to stay. And at these times, with those data that companies are showing, it's been said that there are many holders that don't want to sell at any price but typically are holding and preparing for the next rally.Quote from: eightdots on November 01, 2022, 06:53:13 PMI will use the photo to post a story on Instagram. 14 more years will pass.

And note that it's been 14 years already, we still say that it's still early to invest and that's for real while others don't take it seriously.",
