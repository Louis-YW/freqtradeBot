  "content": "I was browsing today trying to find a better alternative to Binance's savings, after suffering a third interest drop. I came across the following website: Stakingrewards.com, which presents you with all the available alternatives. I was interested in USDT/BUSD/USDC and was surprised to see the offered APY from a platform named \"Midas Investments\". They're offering absurdly high APY on coins such as USDT or USDC (up to 16%), and 8.5% and 10.4% on Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, without requiring a lock-in period. They also feature their own coin, named after their website, offering up to 27% APY.Has anyone used them? While I don't believe they are currently a scam, I'm not sure if their business model is sustainable in the long term. Supposedly, they've been in business for over 4 years (haven't confirmed it myself), while according to Captainaltcoin.com's review, they're a registered business in Switzerland, with a pretty decent rating of 8.2/10.ReviewMidas Investments",

Not only are they centralized, but they also require KYC, according to a few other replies I read at least. Taking into account that I haven't found anyone directly mentioning that they've been scammed, except some users claiming that it's fishy and provides absurdly high APYs, I don't believe it's a straight up scam but rather suspicious to say the least. The website mentions Switzerland, but a whois domain lookup shows Finland.The only thing concerning/surprising me is that there's not a single mention that they've been scammed by this platform. Their APYs are out of this world, especially for single stablecoin vaults. I'd understand if they were paired with a riskier algorithmic stablecoin, but single USDT/USDC/BUSD vaults offering up to 16%? That's crazy.I am tempted to try with a small amount of money just to test how their platform functions.",
