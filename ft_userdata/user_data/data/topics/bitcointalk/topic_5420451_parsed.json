FTX Japan was close-only mode last hour. FTX US said trading with halt in a few days. I am pretty sure the Justin Sun loop-hole to burn tokens won't even work. IF anything it might of made things worse because if there is a liquidation, we might get 25% back. But if you bought those tokens at a 80% loss and then get 25% of that back you are basically getting 5% back in the end. Basically MtGox 2.0.....",

That's in fact just a side show of somebody who's more like a clown whose goal is to entertain and temporarily redirect everybody's attention. The SEC and the government is now already investigating FTX. Assets are either frozen or to be seized. Even FTX US which declared its independence and normal operation is now about to end as well.",

I thought Mt gox was a group of people interested in crypto that built an exchange, and ftx was people interested in trading products and derivatives associated with crypto.I'm still confused as to the full extent of what went on here (though I've seen rumours of attempts to borrow funds to pump coins and prop up other schemes - or directly lend to them). There was news on Tuesday of a lot of resignations, I wonder if there was an initial whistle-blower that caused the collapse or if it was just a hunch.",

The moment they started selling, FTT was still significantly higher from here, and add to the fact that Binance invested in FTX(and FTT, with a discount in 2019) very early on. I'd say Binance still made a good amount of money; or worst case scenario they're breakeven.",

This means that the SEC takes digital asset trading seriously and they are making strides to try and keep things under control.With all that is happening in the crypto space today, everyone should consider every possibility so as not to harm many investors or their users and it makes sense to look for other opportunities as long as you stay diligent and aware.",

They assume because it's a massive company, that they won't get burnt, even though history has proven otherwise. I've literally learned in business that companies can practically do whatever they want. The amount of times a company has fallen through, and we haven't been paid is actually devastating, especially to smaller companies. It's the same here, some people will be punished for the wrong doing's they've done, and if any ill play has been found, but ultimately Ftx should've stopped trading years ago. They would've seen this coming, and they still accepted money, and allowed users to deposit, and store money on their exchange. Technically, users storing money on their exchange has a wallet isn't their money, and warnings should've been given. Obviously, you can argue that it's their money as they own the private keys, but I won't get into that right now. I never understand why these companies don't have people with a little bit of morals, that would warn customers before they burn everything down to the ground, and basically the customers get hurt the most, not the people behind the exchange. The people behind the exchange either go to prison for wrongdoing's or they line their pockets over the years, and they'll probably go on some other business venture after this. It's a pretty sick world we live in if you think about it, as rarely there's repercussions for everyone involved, and usually just public big players.",

If FTX that has billions worth and the backing of a company behind, lots of known investors, it fall very hard causing a dip in the price. And most probably BNB or Binance is not an exception to this. And who knows, proof of reserves might be late in implementing in suddenly there will be a big bank run or shall we shall crypto run - investors suddenly withdrawing causing panic, and then it had ripple effect.
