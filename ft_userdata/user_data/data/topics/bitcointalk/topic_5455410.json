In the past I've heard unpleasant stories of how some customers lost their money as a result the crashing of some commercial banks, but saving funds in bitcoin either for your children future or for personal purpose is a wise choice and can help to checkmate this.",

Instead, you should choose a government bank because if they go bankrupt, you will still be supported by the state. But if you want to invest in Bitcoin, ensuring proper storage and security is important. Using a hardware wallet from a reputable website is indeed a recommended method for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Remember to keep multiple backups of your wallet's recovery phrase or seed and store them in separate secure locations.",

I hope that as a parent of the child, I have made a good decision for them by thinking about their future.Not a bad idea to save your funds on assets that have store of value like bitcoin. But I would likely advise you that you should split them and probably invest some in other assets too because bitcoin is a volatile asset. Although every bitcoin has the potential not to remain at this price or go lower than this in a year to come but due to its volatility mainly caused by economic factors it cannot be certain there won’t be a bear period when you might need it. Bitcoin as at of last year this time around was close to $30k but it is below that now. So imagine someone that bought that price and is trying to sell off now will loss. But once you save in another asset you can turn to them when bitcoin is facing a bearish period and that will save you from panic sell.Also since this is a long time saying I would suggest you think and make a good choice of wallet. An electrum wallet will be advice but if the funds is huge I would advise you to just go for hardware wallet instead. Then be cautious of where to store it or them",

One of the primary concerns is that banks and governments have control over your funds, and there is a risk of them declaring bankruptcy, which can leave citizens cheated. Therefore, it has become increasingly difficult to trust any bank, especially during times of inflation.Alternatively, investing in Bitcoin can offer potentially significant returns, and it allows you to have full control over your funds, effectively becoming your own bank. To ensure the utmost security, it is advisable to use a non-custodial wallet or consider purchasing a hardware wallet. These measures can provide added protection for your Bitcoin holdings.",

Banks are ancient businesses, their models are obsolete and their grip on societies around the globe will only weaken as economics weaken their primary currency for business and as people lose faith and confidence in their pull over economies. It will be a painful change for those who do not find a hedge like Bitcoin, but hopefully it will be smoother for those who do use the hedge.

You think a lot for you to actually settle down and think into the future and what can possibly happen to the money that you have kept in store for your child. Making the decision to make the withdrawal and convert the money to bitcoin is a better option considering that it will be safer from any economic challenge that the banks will face. Now that you have made the choice of keeping it in bitcoins, you have only solved one challenge. You also need to be aware and ensure that you know how to keep the bitcoins safe because it can also be lost to theft and through other means.",

It won't really make sense if your children can't access the bitcoin you bought for them after your death.

One of the safest option is to put your money where nobody is controlling it except you, plus you get to enjoy the profit in the future. I personally witnessed when one of the main stream education insurance in my country went bankrupt and not everything was refunded. Not sure what happened back then since I was too young to understand things regarding the financial aspect, but It was most likely caused by some corrupt officers. Just make it sure that you're teaching your children how to access their money as early as they have in the right mind to understand things, other wise it will all go to waste when an unfortunate incident happens to you. That's the only major problem I'm looking at in such situation other than the risk of your children withdrawing it prematurely and spend it to useless things, of course that will not happen if you keep the keys away from their reach.",

I don't feel buying BTC and saving your money in it is the problem, but setting everything up and keeping it in a safe enviroment, people lose their funds often because they choose the wrong wallet and have bad operational security, so if you are sure you are ready and you have enough knowledge about BTC, you can go on with your plan.",

He could also look into investing on a form of 401k or a Roth IRA for his son, a trust fund per se. That would really set the kid for the future, and does not carry with it a lot of risks that investing in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies will bring. I would highly suggest you diversify your savings as well, one for emergency, one for your kid, and one for travel and leisure, being the basics. This will help you make sure you don't drain out your savings all at once, and keeps you set at a goal that you want to achieve. Lastly, you might wanna look into other forms of investing, like real-estate and other forms of commodities like gold and silver, diversifying your portfolio gives you the best chance at making sure you turn a profit when push comes to shove. Do this and not only will you secure a bright future for your kid, you'd also be ensuring a nice and dandy retirement for you and your wife.",
