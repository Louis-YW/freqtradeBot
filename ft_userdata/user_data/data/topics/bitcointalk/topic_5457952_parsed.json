Downloading causes security problems again but it is not surprising many warnings about careful downloading activity.People just ignore warnings, being careless because they want to explore new things, new games, new products and ignore all security advice. Not only games but also many applications on mobile or softwares on computers or laptops, they don't stop a few seconds for thinking about security risk.Thank you for this information but again, many people will forget about the security advice very quickly. They are app-enthusiasts.",

There will be many victims for sure, it is too late to avoid that. Scammers were smart to target a popular game that most of us have always known from our childhood days. My big concern and what I cannot stop thinking about is what if this is not the only game that scammers gave been able to embed a Trojan. There are many childhood popular games played by people and they can be infected too. Best thing I think is that we should avoid keeping our crypto in the same device where we download things and use for other activities.",

And, who still plays Super Mario, (no offense) but I think they must be millennials and the adoption rate among millennials is less than the Gen-Z generation, So I can say, many would still be saved from this Umbral Stealer. I read so many news like these in the past, like the following ones:[Warning]: New Mystic Stealer targets 40 web browsers and crypto walletsPirated Windows builds with crypto stealerI can say, these types of attacks are increasing, and the number of victims too, because many new people are adopting crypto in there lives and appreciating this technology because this has escaped them from the matrix. And attackers are taking benefit of the newbies coming into the crypto sphere. Well, all we can do is to spread awareness among them by sharing these types of news. Last time, I shared the above news with my friends too who are involved or not involved in crypto. Because those who are not involved in crypto they will someday get into it and then they might prevent from making the same mistake that other newbies made.",

      "body": "Thanks for the warning but I wonder if there are still people in the forum who play Super Mario 3 which is a really old and classic game, It's just very OG. Despite its age it remains incredibly popular and enjoyable for many people around the world. I'm sure there are still a ton of players who continue to download it from the internet time to times but I personally wouldn't do so unless I'm certain about the source's authenticity.So if you want to play the real game make sure to download it from the real source because It's possible to find versions of the game online that have been edited by hackers who then reupload them to the internet. These modified versions can be used to exploit people's PCs for activities like crypto mining or data theft.So getting the game from a reliable source is what you need to do to avoid any trojans or malware. If you have already downloaded the game from a sus website/forum, you better try to use an antivirus scan to clean your PC as well as it's important to change your important passwords and take necessary precautions to protect your personal information before it's too late.",
