  "content": "So two days ago I had my first proposed bitcoin lecture to my colleagues at work. Prior to this time I had written and gotten approval to have a 30-minute session on bitcoin during our biweekly meeting. I was excited and pumped up knowing that this is the moment I've been waiting for. I already have a fair knowledge about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and I thought it would be easy to transmit that knowledge so my colleagues. How hard could it be, this are my colleagues I see everyday. However , just like Murphy's law anything that can go wrong will go wrong. The first thing that went wrong was instead of the 30 minutes for the talk my supervisor said it would be 15 minutes. Second, the air conditioning system decided to break down on that day, everywhere was so hot and you could see that my colleagues were visibly uncomfortable. Third since I was going to be the last speaker they had already had a heated argument about something that went on in the office the previous week. It was crazy.When I was giving the floor to speak, I literally froze because the look on their faces was not one of enthusiasm but one of let's just get it done with. I forgot my presentation. I was stuttering. Sweating profusely. Everywhere was so hot that my colleagues were grumbling. My supervisor reading the room understood, dismissed the meeting. He gave me another chance to talk to them about Bitcoin in the next biweekly meeting.I know by then the AC would have been fixed but I want to ask members of this forum how do I overcome stage fright in my next meeting? This right now is my biggest worry and concern. I do not want to mess this up again. Please share some tips with me, Thank you.",

      "body": "Stage fright is normal, many people experience it. It shows that you care because you are worried how it will go. So, don't run away from it, embrace it and learn how to control it. Be interesting and fun, and don't speak in a monotonous and boring voice. You can practice your speech at home in front of friends and family. That way you will gain some experience in standing in front of a crowd of people. See how they will react. Ask them for some feedback and what they thought about it when you are done. Ask them if you should change something in the way your present your ideas, if the speech should be shorter, longer, if they understood the points you were trying to make, etc.",

This right now is my biggest worry and concern. I do not want to mess this up again. Please share some tips with me, Thank you.As with many other things in life, practice makes perfect! Practice your material as often as you can. The more familiar you are with it, the more confident you will feel when presenting it. Everyone makes mistakes; it's no big deal. It's important to recognize that feeling nervous before a presentation can be normal and even helpful. Don't let one small error throw you off. Try to focus on the big picture and tell yourself that it's okay to make mistakes. And even if you do experience some stage fright, remind yourself that it's normal and that you have the skills and knowledge to deliver a successful presentation.",

It's more about the fear of speaking to a larger public.Some get over that easier, some harder and I don't have a good advice for it. Maybe just break the ice and try to present something (even something else) to a bigger public, to try to get over the natural fear of being not listened or even being mocked in public.From what I know, one basic rule to start without really looking at them. Focus on your thoughts, not their faces. After the topic gets some traction and you have a clear idea what to tell next, you can move on to their faces too if you want to, but don't have too high expectations.",

Please share some tips with me, Thank you.Although anyone can make mistakes, as many people have mentioned, I will interpret your actions as showing a lack of confidence in yourself. When we are confident, I think that everything is simpler to accomplish, especially when it comes to public speaking. In order to avoid becoming persuaded whenever there is a distraction, I would encourage you to practice regularly on whatever you are preparing to give that day and attempt to grasp it properly rather than merely cramming. I believe sometimes confidence attractive people attention because everyone will like to pay full attention to whatever you want to say due to your confidence actionI believe many other will like to ask questions,In order to quickly have questions answered, try coming up with some questions yourself for each section you chose to discuss. This might also help your presentation, in my opinion.",

It’s very hard to overcome it unless you are very confident to your lecturing skills. I usually just use copy paper and read it often while lecturing. I avoid I contact while I’m speaking and makes my presentation complete and easy to understand so that I will have less talk directly to the people since the presentation speak for itself. I suggest that you should express yourself on your presentation material as if it is the one talks for you so that you will have less interaction as much as possible during your lecture.",

      "body": "Dude that’s normal. Don’t feel bad about yourself. You know that successful people starts with failing a lot in their first attempts.I remembered during the early days of the pandemic, I was hosting my very first online panel discussion about the impact of COVID-19 in the crypto and blockchain space. I have invited around 5 speakers that time. During that time I was on my way to become broke again. I didn’t have a high quality camera and microphone, lighting, etc. My room was messed up in which it’s kinda ugly. It was the first time that I have hosted despite without any experience at all. I only have the guts. Because of my lack of experience, some guests are correcting me the way I handle the panel while I was streaming live. But I just kept going until the end of the panel discussion.The second live session that I have was an AMA. But during that time, I forgot to turn off the camera when I went outside for a bathroom break. Yeah it was embarassing and I lately realized. It was ugly at first. I did acknowledged the feedback from both the speakers and the viewers, but never discouraged me. I kept going and improving until I am finally comfortable doing it until today. Because of it, I can finally afford to upgrade my “room studio” with upgraded CPU, lighting, green screen, cam and mic, software and skills in handling AMAs, panel discussions, podcasts, etc.Planting stage is the hardest. But once you’ve kept building and being consistent in what you do, you’ll finally gonna bear fruit for as long as you want, and that is what I am enjoying right now thanks to my previous experience in being embarassed but on a positive perspective. Hope this inspires you bud. Just keep it going and love what you do. Never stop improving. Always apply the 4 pillars “Decide. Take Action. Assess. Adjust”. Repeat that and you’ll eventually become better in no time.",

I have been engaged in some few public speaking, and my technique to always avoid melting when it is time to speak to the many people is that I always find the most comfortable and welcoming face, and there if there are no welcoming or comfortable faces, I just look slightly above the head of the people listening to me, and just occasionally glance at them. I do that so I do not get nervous or intimidated by the expressions on their faces. Try it, maybe it will work for you.",

Firstly, I will like to know how prepared you were before your presentation because regardless of the familiarity with your colleagues your ability to capture their interest and attention depends on your level of knowledge which can be gotten from adequate preparations without this, you will always fumble hence you won't have the right words to speak to them and if you can't be ahead of them then you can't have them listen to you as you wish since the whole thing will sound boring to their ears. Before finding a way to fix the AC which may help to keep the environment cool, I suggest you try not to look at the faces of your colleagues when talking to them this will help you to reduce stage fright and being bold and in control of the conversation will always keep you away from stage fright but in all, get enough knowledge of what you want to teach them before you begin.",

But in my opinion, you really have to prepare everything, if you are given 15 minutes, whereas you can finish in 30 minutes, you really have to trim your material well and just use a few cores to be more on and clear.Maybe I would feel the same way if I were in your condition at that time. But it's a good try. You should have a small notebook that you use to read each core bitcoin lecture that you want to explain. If you have memorized anything related to bitcoin, it will be easier. You just need to mentally prepare yourself to be able to speak in front of many people well and fluently. It's just a simple tip, but you need to try it.",

But the whole situation wasn't not totally your fault although you had a stage fright and you felt they have already had a pissed day and your timing wasn't just correct which is true in a situation like that seeing there tensed faces even myself i will freeze up trying to give a speech or share a knowledge on something i know.
