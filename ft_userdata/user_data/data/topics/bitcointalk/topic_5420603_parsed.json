The result is not to leave your coins on CEXs or not, but in the coins/tokens, which may be like platform tokens (like BNB, FTT), which will collapse if the platform collapses or decreases its value severely. - The same is related to stablecoin that will be frozen in your wallet.  - It also applies to the central blockchain, which may be stopped, halted, or a hardfork.So its bigger than non custodial wallets to the type of coins.",

Your loss isn't that much compared to the lost of many but, whether it's a small or big loss, they're still loss to each and everyone of us. We may have been indirect connection to FTX for those that don't have an account and deposit there.But because the whole market suffers from it, we're all affected.",

Though it affects the market and of course me from the latest dump which FTX is one of the factors why we experienced this market dump right now. I didn't sell anything that's why I still considered myself having no loss at the moment. People started becoming aware on how dangerous storing their assets on a centralized exchange after this FTX incident. It's not bad to use a CEX we should just make sure not to store crypto there especially that things happens so fast.",

But everything happened so sudden and fast, after CZ started the fight with a tweet, I removed it from my watchlist. Once again, my condolences to those who lost their money in this incident, investing in cryptocurrencies is an extremely risky form of investment, invest with your money ready to lose.",

At the end, you can't trust anybody words when you get disappointed by their fault and you can only blame yourself since you're careless.In this case, if to blame, we should blame ourselves, not them because we said we don't trust banks and we choose cryptocurrency to reduce risk because of centralization of banks. But in the end, we can't get out of that vicious circle just for the sake of profit. I believe that the people who leave money on it are day traders, for the sake of profit, forgetting that risk is also lurking for them. There have been many lessons about exchanges collapsing but people will quickly forget and centralized exchanges will never be lost.",

This is just another reminder to everyone investing in crypto that it's not really good to store your crypto in an exchange. Lucky, you only lost $120. How about the other users? Unfortunate event like this is nothing new in crypto space. This is a quite similar case happened with QuadrigaCX. Soon, all of us would wake up to a news that what happened with this exchange was deliberate.",

I use Binance for daily trading but now I have no trust on Cex more and want to be safe from these kind of collapse I am 80% out From Crypto.

Therefore i did not suffer any direct loss because of the whole drama around FTX. Of course i was indirectly affected by it, just like everyone else that is involved in the crypto space. My portfolio value has dropped again significantly even though i was already down more than 95% in comparison to it's ATH of may 2021. I have a medium amount of Kucoin shares on Kucoin itself because of the Kucoin bonus and also the whitelisting for sales and stuff but of course in theory the same thing that happened to FTX can happen to every other centralized exchange.",

These things can't happen enough for people to understand that leaving their funds on exchanges is a terrible mistake and they should also not be hodling funds/coins that are basically centralized/worthless shitcoins that can collapse pretty easily, there'd be many more similar incidences in the future, but i'm afraid it will happen with no lessons learned. Having said that, there is a reason why people hodl Bitcoin that is sustainable for the long run, because it can't go extinct or completely collapse, there could be a serious plunge like what is happening now, but since it basically has an actual utility, you just know that it is definitely going to recover with time.",
