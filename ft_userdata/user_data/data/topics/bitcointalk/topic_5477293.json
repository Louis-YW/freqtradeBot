  "content": "I was a professor. So I know that universities promote violence. They have promoted violence against me. And all of you evil people do not care because you are some of the most bloodthirsty hateful entities imaginable. On the news, you can see that universities including Harvard, MIT, and UPenn promote violence and just want Jewish people to die. They love it when their students call for the extermination of the Jews. Why is this the case? It is because there is a strong correlation between race and intelligence, and the Jews have the highest level of intelligence. Universities do not like this at all because universities have been taken over by the people with lower levels of intelligence who hate people who are smarter than them. Universities have therefore fallen. They are no longer a place of learning but they are instead a place of hatred.I have BANNED anyone who has attended a single class at Harvard, MIT, and UPenn from contributing to the cryptocurrency project that I am working on. And no, this ban will not be lifted. I will not accept any apologies at all for this. Universities have not apologized for promoting violence against me, so no apology will be acceptable. The only acceptable form of an apology comes from a graduate from Harvard who comes to a camp fire to burn his or her diploma. Anything less than that is insincere. Any apology that is not accompanied by the burning of a diploma is Nazism.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.Here is a scientific paper that claims a 92% correlation coefficient between mean IQ (um. We cannot really take the mean of IQ scores; we should take the median instead. But whatevs) and skin color. And if you are going to tell me that this paper is wrong without even giving me a reason why it may be wrong, then I will give you more scientific papers on the subject.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289605000917Here is proof that universities promote violence:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRRDr1Q4KfEP.S. Even the Jews are some of the most intelligent people on Earth, I am not impressed by their level of intelligence because they cannot understand that Bitcoin has a mining algorithm that was never designed to advance science. Maybe I should just call the Jews 'slightly less dumb' instead of 'intelligent'.",

      "body": "Seems to me that Jews are based in God-religion, but IQ is based in evolution-religion.What I mean is, evolution theory essentially destroys the evolution idea. How? In all practical forms of evolution theory, the theory holds that evolution came about through random mutations, one way or another. But when you consider what 'random' really means in random mutations, it essentially means that we don't know which of the mutations did the job of evolution. Since we don't know this, how do we even know that there was any 'advancement' by evolution at all? Evolution is all guesswork.On the other hand, the Jews are being held together by a strong, sense of family-nation. Their nation has been recorded to have been set up by God. Their existence, and their Tanakh writings, when examined scientifically, show that such a nation is impossible without some powerful form of 'interference-in-natural-happenings'. This interference is way beyond what simple higher intelligence (IQ) could accomplish.So, the question is (since the Jews have a God-religion), which religion is right (if either)? The God-religion, or the evolution-religion? As shown above, evolution in the large scale is essentially impossible. At least, we haven't found any theory for it that holds water. But the God-religion is evident in the machinery of nature. Machines have makers.This is the bottom-line reason why universities are violently against the Jews. Universities have been taken over by people who want to be in control of their lives. But even though they can't be (except in extremely limited ways), it makes them feel good to build themselves up as though they were, and to show others that they have control over themselves and life and the universe.People who are behind the universities - basically the financiers - want the evolution-religion to be real. One of the ways to attempt this is to get rid of the Jews, who represent a religion to which the universities are diametrically opposed.If there were true quality IQ people in and behind the universities, they would join reality, and worship God. Since university IQ is mediocre, no matter how it is measured, they fight the only IQ that counts... God-religion IQ. They maintain their nothing-religion of evolution.",

Those Polish people had very high intelligence. They had their country organized throughout... from the top down to the lowliest farmer.Because the Polish people were intelligently organized, when Hitler invaded and conquered, all he had to do to find the potentially dangerous Poles (the intelligent ones) was to check their records. It was all listed in their records. So, Hitler had an easy time of killing off the intelligent, dangerous ones.That's where the term 'dumb Pollock' came from. All that was left after Hitler got finished was the dumb ones.The point? The next generation - children of the dumb ones - produced intelligent ones, to the extent that today, Poland has some of the most highly intelligent people in the free world.Southeast Asian countries have some of the most intelligent people around. Why? Look at their language. The Chinese languages comprise some 6,000 characters or more, all with a different meaning... at least slightly different. The average Chinese person learns only about 2,000 of these characters. A smart Chinese person might learn as high as 4,000.The Jews might be intelligent and smart from doing studies. But most of it is a gift, a blessing from God. Why would God bless them this way? Because He made a promise to Abraham, their first father. And God is still fulfilling His promise, even though the Jews, in general, have rejected part of the Godhead.",

And I also know that the cause of violence is narrow selfishness, followed by hatred throughout the centuries.Yes, I can use the word \"admiration\" for the will and spirit of pregnant people when they have gone through a lot of pain to make them become people who use their intelligence flexibly. But returning to the issue of violence, are you sure that it is common? Or is that just the perspective you are referencing on a certain group.And back to the original question I asked about the law of cause and effect. Nothing is truly absolutely perfect in terms of the 3D worldview, even in higher dimensions it is easy to force the intellectual viewpoints that the perceived object itself determines to shape it. The problem of violence is something that no one wants, but it still exists, but the way of dealing with it that I see expressed by groups of people including a religious group only reflects the hatred of the people. them and that cycle never ends.",

I wouldn't be surprised if other nationalities are discriminated in those universities, that is if the allegations are true. Violence exists all over the world and I don't think that it's peculiar to Jews, infact the black race has surfered more injustice than any other race, so it is a berbaric act that needs to be stopped. I'm thinking the reverse that in this age of technological advancement, that if anyone is found with a high IQ that they'll be celebrated and encouraged to manifest their talents. I sincerely doubt that any sensible university in this modern age will try to discourage, not to talk about exterminating great minds.",

Intifada has always been interpreted as an uprising or a resistance against Israeli military occupation. It isn't until very recently that Zionist propagandists started pushing this narrative that it's a genocidal term because they want to censor criticism of the actual genocide Israel is committing.Quote from: jvanname on December 10, 2023, 12:02:35 PMP.S. Even the Jews are some of the most intelligent people on EarthPerhaps that's why there are so many anti-Zionist Jews. It's absurd that they would be accused of being antisemitic for being against the mass slaughtering of Palestinians.Universities have promoted violence against me and they refuse to acknowledge any wrongdoing, so don't you think for one second that they won't love genocide. The meaning of 'Intifada' has absolutely no relevance to the statements by the universities.Congress-So does a student calling for the extermination of Jews violate your policies against harassment and bullying?Universities-Nah. It is all good. We actually like it when students threaten faculty members.Congress-You flaming morons.Pilot-Harvard hates Jews.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

You are a completely worthless human. God hates you. You are going to Hell.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.I don't even understand yet how Universities have supposedly promoted violence against you, like in a very personal level, to the point you are not longer willing to work for an university, man. Also nobody here is explicitly siding with universities, regardless of them being private or public, we just do not want to left unchallenged some stuff you say and which sound rather irrational to us. For example, you have told us you believe universities promote nacional-socialism in the United States, but to me that does not make sense or at least, it is not compatible with many of the policies universities have implemented around your country to allow people of color, latinoamericans and Asian students to apply and get access to high quality education in those centers of study. Do you understand ?Have you not consider the possibility the university you worked at had some problems with the way you expressed yourself during classes or the fact you may have gone through bad personal times of your life which could ave pushed you over the edge while in campus? To me that sounds more reasonable, since you seem to have quite an explosive personality (I am not saying your personality is bad or you are at fault, all that stuff your lived through could have been a big misunderstanding)",
