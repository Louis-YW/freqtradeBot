QuoteEvery time when the price of BTC surges there will news articles reporting millions of dollars being liquidated.Although OP where do you here this sort of news. Because not all the time I hear about this, I can say probably due to the surge in the price of Bitcoin people are liquidating their assets worth millions to use them to buy Bitcoin this is my thoughts about that.",

      "body": "In trading crypto, there are people who trade crypto derivatives or futures. In this kind of trading, people either short (predict that the Bitcoin might go down, so they get profits) or Long (predict that the Bitcoin might go down, so they get profits). On top of that, they use leverage (Borrowed funds). Once they open a position with leverage with funds in his account acting as collateral, a liquidation price is set. If the market price goes against the opened position beyond that liquidation price, the exchange's Liquidation engine will close the position and take out all the collateral the trader used for borrowing.So in the case of the recent market uptrend, there are traders who opened short positions against Bitcoin and most of them probably had their liquidation prices set at 30K,33K, 35K depending on the leverage and entry prices. When the Bitcoin price rapidly moved upwards, the positions that had no stop losses got liquidated, leading to news of massive liquidations.",

If bitcoin increased to $32400, the funds traders used to open short at $27000 will be liquidated. Assuming bitcoin price is at $35000, the funds of traders that long at $35000 will be liquidated around $28000 if the price of bitcoin fall.

But what I understand it to be is that the ability to buy and sell that particular coin is it’s liquidity. For example we will be saying something like bitcoin has more liquidity than altcoins, this is because whenever you wish to buy or sell any amount of bitcoin you will easily get a buyer or seller, but if it is the other coins you won’t get for the amount you wanted mostly if it is large amount. We also sometimes say CEX like binance has more liquidity than DEX like Bisq because their more people to buy and sell on CEX than on DEX, and hence converting your coins to cash is easier their.",

What exactly does it mean and how it works? Liquidations will take majority of your collateral to the exchange and with forced liquidations that will be executed directly by exchange, you can not do anything. Before forced liquidations, you will receive Margin calls but I am sure most of people who have Margin calls will have forced liquidations from some of margin calls.Liquidations will be based on formula of each exchange and the leverage you use for your gamble (trading with leverage).When market price falls, people cut loss, price slips more and sometimes can appear Cascade effects, crashed and forced liquidations will appear massively on many centralized exchanges.Forced Liquidation.What does liquidation mean and how to avoid it?",

OP is asking about liquidations which happen whenever the price of Bitcoin rallies. This refers to margin or leverage trading. Liquidation means the platform or exchange you are using closes your position and takes your money away because you are already losing the margin. Meaning to say, you don't have money anymore to support your position. In simple terms, if you predict that Bitcoin goes down and Bitcoin went up, you lost. Liquidation could happen, depending of course on your leverage. Thus, when there's a huge movement of Bitcoin whether up or down, there are ensuing news of liquidations.",

Hmm, I'm sure most of the Op's queries are already answered by fellow members, I just would like to add here from the trading point of view that if you do not have enough capital to service the volatility of the market and you're experienced users better not to go for the leverage trades, Spot market can also offer decent opportunities and massive rewards on it. It's just a timely thing, In a consolidating market the funding rates can be Headache as well.OP drong anything else if you really want to ask freely, on the same time i think topic belongs to the trading section.",

The latter may not even be liquidation in its strict sense. I think liquidation news aren't talking about amounts which are closed because the traders decided so. These news are referring to amounts forcedly liquidated by exchanges. Meaning, these are amounts lost because of the traders' wrong predictions or positions. If they short Bitcoin and the price rises, they're wrong and they lose their money.",
