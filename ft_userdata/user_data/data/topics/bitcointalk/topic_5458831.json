  "content": "Opinion: Bitcoiners should build a trusted decentralized network to become more resilient against possible future crisis.Problem: Fiat system is controlled corrupt peopleBartering is inconvenient. I’m a plumber and want to grill a beef steak. But the cow farmer does not need a plumber now. Money makes the marketplace more efficient. The plumber can fix a pipe for somebody else for cash and spend cash to buy his steak. He can even safe his money and buy the steak later. However, money printing erodes the purchasing power of fiat. Canceling bank accounts, so a protesting Canadian trucker can’t buy his breakfast, erodes the transaction value of fiat. This might become even worse with the introduction of CBDC, which could be programmed to be redeemed only for good that the state deems appropriate. Bitcoin is low inflation and high censorship resistance Bitcoin has predictable and low monetary inflation and has a high degree of censorship resistance overcoming the problems of fiat. However, Bitcoin is not widely accepted as a payment for goods and services. This requires you to exchange your fiat salary for Bitcoin to safe and to exchange your Bitcoin for fiat to spend.nice: salary in BTC -> foodreality: salary in fait -> BTC -> fiat -> foodHow regulation conquers Bitcoin to rob savers of their savings and reintroduce censorshipThe exchange between BTC and fiat is controlled by the government, banks, payment processors and centralized exchanges. They censor people and transactions reintroducing censorship on the Bitcoin onramp and offramp. Due to KYC, your identity is linked to how many bitcoins your bought. People more powerful than you (government or criminals who hacked the exchange database) can threaten violence rob you of most or all your Bitcoin reintroducing the problem that powerful humans can rob the savings of powerless humans.Trading Peer to peer offers some protectionThe obvious solution is ditching centralized exchanges and replacing them with decentralized exchanges most prominent would be Bisq. Bisq is open source, runs over TOR and has very little centralized attack surface. I like Bisq a lot, but don’t want to trust entirely on Bisq.Trading BTC over Bisq is no silver bullet.1. Single communication route: Bisq runs over TOR. However, TOR can and is currently DDoS-attacked. Government can take measures against TOR or against internet traffic leaving the country.2. Tainted coins: BTC has a transparent ledger. Everybody can check the history of each transaction. The government / banks / exchanges can then define “bad” transaction histories. If you send a Bitcoin transaction with a “bad” history to an exchange, your account gets frozen. US announced interacting with certain BTC addresses gets you published with several years of prison time. Government restrictions tend to grow. It is possible that the government tries to define more histories as “bad” e.g. coin joins being bad or coins bought on exchanges without KYC being bad. It is also possible that the government will try to extend the regulation to miners banning them form mining transactions with a bad history. The problem is, that the coin trades on Bisq can be singled out by coin analytics companies. The government can then make laws against people using Bisq or spending coins with a Bisq-history. Additionally, a small minority of coins sold on Bisq has a bad origin (Hack or Scam). 3. Flexibility: Let’s say you are protesting peacefully against your government without breaking any laws. This annoys politicians, who skip due process and just block your bank account. Now you can’t pay rent, can’t pay your utility bills and after cash gets replaced by CBDC you can’t even buy food. On Bisq you can sell BTC for a bank transfer or cash. You might not be able to pay some bills with cash. Supplementing Bisq with long term trusted trading relationships builds resilienceBefore you have problems every Bitcoiner builds up 5-10 trading relationships. As the years go on trust increases. This gives you additional options exchanging BTC<->goods/services.1. Multiple communication routes: You will know each other’s mobile phone numbers, and email addresses making your communication more robust in case one communication method is not available.2. Coins can’t be marked by coin analytics as tainted: Since you trust each other you don’t need custody wallets or time locked multi sig transactions, which would increase suspicion of Chainanalysis. Also you know the history of the coins of your trading counterparty. You don’t accidently by coins with bad history like in Bisq and safe time checking the history of the coins you bought.3. Flexibility: If you and your trading counterparty trust each other, you have great flexibility. Pay BTC get voucher from your grocery shop. Pay BTC get grass fed beef send to you. Pay BTC get your utility bill paid. Pay BTC get a gold coin send to you. With trust you have unlimited options. You also build up goodwill, if you run into troubles the other person will spend more time to amend his payment method to help you out.Do you agree with me?Did I overlook something?Do you live in Germany or within EU/SEPA and want do build up a network and sell me some BTC against EUR long term?",

In a way I agree with you but think you should not advertise a p2p platform because that's what it seems you're doing right now! ... your discussion is actually helpful and I will ADD that for a trader to have little worries when trading for whatever purpose hisor her Bitcoin considering the government regulations on reaching a compromise between BTC and fiat and consumer goods(e.gCBDC) and already existing trading platforms, he or she should be aware of these so to be on a safer side:Diversify Trading Platforms: Instead of relying solely on P2P platforms, consider using a combination of centralized exchanges and reputable P2P platforms. Centralized exchanges offer liquidity and a wide range of trading options, while P2P platforms provide privacy and direct peer-to-peer transactions. Diversifying platforms can help mitigate the risks associated with deficiencies in a single platform.*Stay Informed:Stay updated with the latest news and developments related to CBDCs, as they may impact the trading landscape. Being aware of any regulatory changes or potential shifts in the market will allow you to adapt your trading strategies accordingly. I recommend this always 👌Explore Decentralized Exchanges (DEX):DEX platforms operate on blockchain technology, allowing users to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies directly without the need for intermediaries. Consider exploring DEX platforms that offer a high level of security, transparency, and user control over funds.Secure wallet usage: Regardless of the trading platforms you choose, prioritize the security of your Bitcoin holdings. Use secure hardware wallets or cold storage solutions to protect your funds from potential hacking or theft.Engage in Trusted Networks: Joining trusted communities or networks of Bitcoin traders can provide opportunities for secure, peer-to-peer trading. Participating in forums, social media groups, or local meetups can help you connect with reputable traders and reduce the risks associated with trading on unfamiliar platforms.(Just like this platform...so congratulations you're in the right place 😁)Remember, trading Bitcoin involves inherent risks, and no direct method can completely eliminate all potential issues. It's crucial to conduct thorough research, exercise caution, and make informed decisions based on your risk tolerance and trading goals.b. You did overlook the fact that no although no system can be completely trusted, you can reduce risk by taking diverse precautionsc. No I'm not in Germany!",

I don't think so and even if it's going to happen it will be very slow because we have people that don't want to use digital payment still, it's going to be a matter of choice, choose what suits your convenience. We can't do without the Banks, to spend Bitcoin in the real world you need to convert into Fiat and that money is heading into your Bank account anyway, what we want to prevent is cleaning every traces of Bitcoin money into our Bank accounts, that's why I personally use P2P trades. The exchange between Bitcoin into Fiat is controlled by YOU, not the government or the Banks, no one forces you to sign up on a centralized exchange and pass their KYC, everyone knows what KYC requirements means when asked.A real P2P platform is one step ahead of Banks, government and other centralized puppet companies, it's left for you to make your choice wisely. About the Tainted Coins, it can still be avoided, the problem with privacy and anonymity in crypto space starts with a user, who look for centralized platforms themselves and passed their KYC, you want to stay out of sight? Don't ever pass KYc and stay away from every God damn centralized exchanges.",

Just think people are forced to use CBDC because they can't buy any stuff from grocery stores if you're not using CBDC. The government will make it also available to all, probably even giving phones to the elderly so they can receive stimulus packages thru CBDC.Easier to distribute stimi to people that has CBDC account on their phones. You'll see the benefit so they'd really going to sign up for it.",

If you don't want to use that form, then choose a p2p exchange like Bisq, the trading funds would always remain in your custody through a multi-sig set up, so there is unlikely to be dispute, but if there is, Bisq arbitration would help to settle the dispute.",

I remember the time when my transaction was sent by a trader whom I traded with but wasn't received in my account, and then we appealed the system and it took 4 days for my transaction to be deposited into my account.  I received my transaction after 4 days and we both agreed that the issue was resolved. I know that there is an issue of privacy on Binance, but still without their interference it would be difficult to solve the issue.I would also chose safety of my money over privacy because if my assets and my money is safe, and for that I need to do my KYC, then I wont hesitate with the thing. However, if there was such a platform on a decentralized exchange then I would definitely go with that, but currently the only safe options are those exchanges that require KYC and they have their name in the crypto-world.",

That's cause people don't appreciate what they don't normally use for their daily lives so that's bound to happen. It's not really a good assumption though, that anarchy is going to be a bad thing for more people, don't the people in Slab City in California live in peace even though they're the closest to a lawlessness? I can understand the scare of using P2P but when the system in place is working properly and ensures the safety of both parties, it's safe to assume that using P2P for transactions is relatively safe. Safety and risk is relative to how competent the system is in my opinion.",

      "body": "You've made an interesting idea in advocating for long-term trusted trading connections, however this runs opposed to the core spirit of what Bitcoin represents: decentralisation. I think it's a step backwards to advocate for a trust-based system because that means going towards a more centralised structure. We might as well be asked to put our faith in the government and huge banks all over again.You're right, there are problems with Bisq. Each and every one of them does. However, these problems can be fixed. Bitcoiners, rather than reverting to more traditional trust-based relationships, ought to concentrate on enhancing and perfecting these decentralised alternatives.Also, it's risky to discount the importance of regulated markets altogether. Yes, they have their own issues, but they supply Bitcoin with the services and liquidity it needs to thrive in the current economic context. Throwing them out entirely would be like trying to save the world by drowning it in a bathtub full of dirty water.",

When did losing control over your funds and giving it to a third party become safer that being in control of your trading funds throughout the trade. This thread shows that many people don't know how p2p exchanges work and it would save everyone's time if they learn how it works. A multi-sig set up ensures that the trade happens without any party being scammed, it is not dangerous; you just have to know what you are doing and choose an irreversible payment option if you are the seller.",

The influence of Bitcoin will increase, and you will have multiple spending options if the demand for it increases.Treating money in categories and that this is clean money, colored money, and dirty money is a mistake. Money is money, otherwise it would have been the first to destroy the money that is confiscated from the drug trade.It is true that we have limited options for those who want to buy and sell bitcoin without KYC, but there will always be an option or alternative such as XMR, and the centralized options will become better regulated.",

Just think people are forced to use CBDC because they can't buy any stuff from grocery stores if you're not using CBDC. The government will make it also available to all, probably even giving phones to the elderly so they can receive stimulus packages thru CBDC.Easier to distribute stimi to people that has CBDC account on their phones. You'll see the benefit so they'd really going to sign up for it.You could be right, but I don't think it'll be that quick. Few months to a year would be a very short notice. But I don't see cash getting completely replaced until we have CBDC, or other solutions that are available to everyone (including homeless etc). Currently banks can deny you a service even without stating any reason, so potentially some people would be left out without any means to participate in the system.Quote from: Z-tight on July 06, 2023, 08:44:33 PMThis is not true, true p2p eliminates an intermediary or third party, if there is a third party it is no longer peer to peer, but peer to intermediary, and intermediary to the other peer.What's widely described as P2P online crypto transactions (e.g. exchanging btc for fiat) would still require a 3rd party fiat processor.The only \"true\" P2P transaction would be exchanging btc for physical cash, but that won't be possible if/when cash goes away.",

And this trust must be given to someone within your area region and more likely your community because if you just merely trust someone in another country and send the coins to the person without receiving your money and the person run away with the coin then your coins will be gone. That is why exchange p2p is also good because you have to receive the money before you release the coins. And every country has their p2p methods to do except the international exchange platforms which perform general per to per. So creating separate p2p for transactions might not necessary again because there are already existing ones.",
