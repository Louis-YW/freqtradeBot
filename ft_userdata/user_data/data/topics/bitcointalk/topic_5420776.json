Apparently they are DMing people to deposit funds and they had some connection to FTX.Most likely won’t open any accounts until this storm clears in the next month or so.Even crypto.com is having some fud. They hold large amount of SHIB in their portfolio. A very small cap coin. Nowhere is safe except maybe Coinbase, Gemini, kraken, and cold storage.",

Exchanges now are being more careful, because of what happened to FTX and recently, top exchanges shows their financial status and holdings, probably to gain the trust of every investors and tell the public that they are pretty solid so better not to panic.",

But it seems right, never leave your fund in exchange for storing it and probably it would be better if every session of your trading activities just withdraw your fund even though the fee will hurting you as long as your whole fund are safe.",

So giving your KYC to them shouldn't really be a problem, unless you are a criminal.On the other hand, for all the \"under the radar\" moves that you want to make, you could use DeFi, like pancake or 1inch or whatever you want to use, and that way you could move it around with a custodial wallet like metamask, and everything will be sort of hidden as well, only the entry and exit will be known, rest will be hidden.",

I have an account with them but with the first level of verification (name, location etc.) So I don't know which features can use and not use if the account is unverified.

Not an FTX user here, so can't say it's alternatives and don't know a standout comparison of them.MEXC is a Tier-2 exchange but it is a good one to buy hidden gems in bull market. In bull market, not in bear market. In bear market, you will more likely to buy falling knives, not hidden gems.Around ending of a bear market, after altcoins lose 90% or more from their all time highs or previous highest price in a bull market, you can filter altcoins and find gems to buy. It is not a time to do this because bear market is happening and massacre is happening.Is FTX an ending of this bear market or is it only a start of something worse?",

Especially whenever you have coumpounded the money there and the exchange see it , feels like an exortion if you ask me . They would do ask for kyc anyway ... just the matter of time and they will catch you with no choice but kyc still in the end , what a cruel business .",

Which is why it’s too dangerous.it's such a tough choice to make. When we do KYC, our personal identity will be known and we are afraid that it will be misused, but when a hack occurs, the possibility to get assets back may go well because everything is recorded and has been protected by an official legal entity. but when there is no KYC and there is no legal entity that regulates it, when hacked or exchanges steal our assets, then there is nothing we can do, because they are indeed illegal and no legal entity can catch them. Of course, this will be a difficult thing to choose, depending on which is more important.",
