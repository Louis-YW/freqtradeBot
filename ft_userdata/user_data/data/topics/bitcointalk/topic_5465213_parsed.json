That amount at Stake is pretty high but there’s a serious concern here if the prediction was right. You might get tagged as involved to match fixing if your source sells this call on multiple user that place bet big time on same match. Keep safe since this is a huge amount.",

To test the bet and to see it for yourself. Ofcourse doubt would be there but you won't bet on it if you don't have enoigh basis or trust into it won't you? Unless you are just too thrilled and excited to get an easy win, which should be avoided. This is gambling industry and no such thing as assured outcome exist unless results would be altered or cheating such as inside info would be done. Unfair as well to other players who are putting their luck on the line. And yes, be careful as well to not bet everything on it just because of that information as long as you yourself has the assurance. When I first saw your previous post it gave me an initial question of why would that informant give you something as important as the winning bet if he could bet on it all by himself. Be careful.",
