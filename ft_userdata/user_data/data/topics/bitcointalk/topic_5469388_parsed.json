If there is one please kindly leave a link.Earlier this year I came across some articles talking about ERC3525 and SFT that comes with it. ERC3525 combines the attributes of both ERC20 and ERC72, seems similar to ERC1155: https://twitter.com/myanTokenGeek/status/1566081253094223873/photo/1To me, they seem to be trying to address the same problem as they both are used in grouping assets together with different IDs. What I still don't understand why one would be used over another. Seems like SFTs are being explored in the gaming, but do you guys know any good examples of either ERC 1155 or ERC 3525 being used?",
