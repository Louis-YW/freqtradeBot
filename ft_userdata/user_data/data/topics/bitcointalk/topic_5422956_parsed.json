Also don't be blinded on someone's rank, not all legendary ranks can be trusted, always check their trust profile including the trusted and untrusted feedback.

Because what i understand is, you hold/receive the paypal fund (of your client) then send/exchange it to crypto (to his crypto/bitcoin wallet) as i saw the \"payout to crypto\" on your other thread on cracked.",
