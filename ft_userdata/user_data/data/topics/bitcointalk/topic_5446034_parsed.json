However, it appears that not everything is sunshine and rainbows in the Sanctuary, though. An alarming amount of user reports have emerged on Reddit(opens in new tab) and the Blizzard forums(opens in new tab), claiming that the beta is bricking the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, one of the best graphics cards.One Reddit user reported that his Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC 12G had perished after playing the game for only 20 minutes. According to the Redditor's recount, the cutscene in the chapel was the exact moment his GeForce RTX 3080 Ti went haywire. It didn't take long before other affected users started to pitch in. Another user(opens in new tab) claims the cutscene also bricked his Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Vision OC 12G. However, users have also experienced crashes during normal gameplay too.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-3080-ti-gpus-are-mysteriously-dying-on-diablo-iv-betaDiablo 4 just bricked my 3080 TIhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/11tzj1w/diablo_4_just_bricked_my_3080_ti/Mining does not kill graphics cards in 20 minutes",

I've seen a lot of problematic AMD Radeon HD 7970 and AMD Radeon HD 7990 cards that overheated a lot, but they were re-mined, not broken. It is also very difficult to burn the power supply if it is of high quality, because it will turn off if it overheats.But if the fan of the power supply is broken, then the transistors can explode.",

Usually server power supplies burned video cards, and on standard PSUs this is possible, but very difficult.Yes i agree, mining does not kill anything, mostly it is an existing hardware failure or user failure. @Topic:It is a normal failure. Such failures can happen in betas or new games or after an update - the games developer can´t test on every different pc configuration and the overall problem is - the fps are not locked in menu, so the FPS beginn to fly to the moon - the card is overheating. This is normal and i don´t unterstand why developers don´t limit the FPS is menus and so on. I would always limit the FPS in menus to the Monitor refresh rate.In CoD MW2 you can set a max FPS for the menu, so the card can´t overheat.",

IIRC, the issue is also related to uncapped FPS in the main menu, kind of wild that the same thing happened again. I thought either Nvidia or the game developer will fix it. I don't think it is hard that to put a cap on FPS from the driver or even the game itself no?Quote from: JayDDee on March 24, 2023, 07:52:14 PMThe bricking claims seem to be overhyped, as usual. Crashing is a normal protection mechanism.Some claim that the GPU is dead though, as it no longer works after the crash. Not sure how reliable that claim is though. IIRC some people also claim the same thing when New World comes out, it is word investigating at least if more reports show up.",

Corsair works fine with weak video cards, but beginners should be aware of these problems. This will not happen in a week or a month, so I recommend that all beginners start with video cards with less power consumption.",
