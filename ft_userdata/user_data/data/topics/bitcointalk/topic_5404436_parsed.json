(bottom/tops) of possible price range the market sits inside(i use the words hint and possible.. its not a exact formulae for an exact amount. there are other variables that are included that i have not described. its just a loose hint)but in simple terms, lets first take the ATHthe reason it topped out at $70k instead of $100k is easy to understandif you work out the mining costs of different regions of the planet (different electric costs) japan and germany being the higher end at between 35-40cent per kwhyou can calculate that the cost becomes around $70k. the threshold where everyone on the planet finds it cheaper to mine it rather then buy it. because obviously everyone on the planet can mine for less then $70k at the timeand so the buys dry up and the sells overpower the buys. so it topped out at $70kthere was no buy demand if people can obtain it cheaper via mining. so thats why it didnt go further.you can use the mining cost calculations to refresh the value window periodically and see the window prices generally move withintake the bottom.when calculating the minimum (cheapest electric+hardware cost ROI) no one wants to sell at a loss and so they refuse to sell.. again less sells and more buys because for some countries when the price is near the bottom end its cheaper to buy rather than mine it.this is why the chances of bitcoin Bottom being zero is negligible chance. there is too much value holding it up in the multiple thousands of dollar range to crash to zero..what you find is that when the price goes down.. the cheap efficient miners keep mining. its the expensive hobby miners that switch off their asics and then start to buy. this means the efficient miners get more share of the reward meaning more coin per hash. meaning cheaper coin for them mine. for a drastic shift downwards of the bottom end of the window. would require alot of shifting of hashpower.the difficulty adjustments wont go back to CPU penny rates in a fortnight. it would take over a year to get to CPU rates again. the hashrate of the last 6 months is staying happily over 200exa. so yea. that sort of scenario is not happening.",

There's no one can predict the market or have a crystal ball to know the exact Bitcoin price on x day etc.The best way is setting up many limit orders e.g. buy on specific prices $20K, $19K, $18K, $17K, $16K and so on. If you can hold for long term and Bitcoin will make new ATH, then you'll earn so much profit in the future.",

I am sure BTC will be 100000 in the next 1.5 -2 years. That is why bying even at 30000 is a great opportunity, which far-sighted people won`t lose. the way i view it.. if you can calculate the value window.. you can find the safe zone. there is actual reason the price topped out at $70k and not $100keveryone on the planet last year could mine bitcoin for under $70k and so no one would buy bitcoin if they can acquire/mine it cheaper elsewhere. so the buys dry up.same at the other end if no one can mine for less. anywhere on the planet. then no one is going to sell for less.this window is then where the price fits it. if no one is selling for les and cant mine for less. the will buy it for moreyes the window can change if the mining costs change so keep an eye on the changes. but the price sits inside the window. this means the window can grow up and increase giving more chance of reaching $100k if the window is at or above $100k. and it means if new asics come out that are more efficient or that the higher cost miners drop out giving more coin share per block to the remaining miners it can make mining cheaper which then allows the price to come down. because they are more able to sell. now imagine you have $XX k to invest .. and you found the window is $15k-$70kdecide to split up the window..(in this scenario you have yet to see the market price. you only know the window)your willing to risk 1% at the top and more % at the bottomEG35% 25% 15% 10% 8% 4% 2% 1%[|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||]15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70where by you are not throwing it all in. but instead taking opportunity based on risk. where by you always have spare funds left. to take more opportunity. (in this scenario you NOW look at the price to see where it fits in the window)we are in the green area right now. so for now dont measure out 1% to leave for the top end. you might aswell re-evaluate and change the % at the bottom end to take the opportunity.for instance. put that 15% 10% 8% 4% 2% 1% above the current price. into numbers between the bottom of the current window upto  where you might say your willing to still buy at EG all of the green and some orange if the price goes up. and re-jig the % accordinglybut if the price was in the red zone when you first look at market prices(imagine scenario you entered last year). then you would only risk the small percentages and leave the large percentages at the bottom for when the correction occurs so that you can take those opportunities...what you dont want to do is say only invest 5% at $21k because you think/hope that it will drop to then put 95% in.. can leave you in regret if the price rises and you only invested 5%.. however investing 95% at say $30k but then it went down to $21k then to $17k then to $21 again. means you regret the 95% you already spent and only have 5% left. so spread the percentage to fit the opportunity and risk where you are probably happier to have invested 25% at $21k.. more so then investing just 5% and hoping it drops one more time",
