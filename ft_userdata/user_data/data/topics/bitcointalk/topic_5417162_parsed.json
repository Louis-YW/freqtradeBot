  "content": "According to Statista statistics, there are over 7,500 cryptocurrencies on the market as of November 2021, and although this reflects the industry's growing prominence, it also demonstrates the potential for cryptocurrency frauds to grow in the digital asset field. Crypto frauds had increased by more than 30% in 2021 compared to the previous year, with the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) reporting that a total of $1 billion had been stolen since the start of 2021.With the proliferation of crypto projects and, as a result, crypto scams, crypto launchpads are becoming increasingly relevant in the field. Blockchain-based projects may raise funds via crypto launchpads. With the ability for investors to participate in early-stage sales, they have the option to purchase a specific cryptocurrency at a discounted price prior to its official introduction on the market.What makes AdLunam so unique?AdLunam is a platform that assists crypto projects in generating cash and creating a dedicated crypto following.
