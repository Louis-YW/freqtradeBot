I think most people are quite sure that the SEC will approve it, so they are buying early to maximize their profits by the time the announcement are made. (price jumped from $30 000 to $35000 in a day)  In any way, it is nice to see the Bitcoin price increase before Black Friday and also before Xmas, when people need money for the festive season and for a well deserved holiday.",

(price jumped from $30 000 to $35000 in a day)  There are some rumours that the recent price spike was triggered by the appearance of Blackrock's bitcoin ETF ticker (iBTC) on the DTCC exchange. This was taken as them having some insider info about ETF being approved, despite SEC not confirming this yet. The ticker has been removed yesterday and apparently brought back in today. I've no idea is it just an error or some blatant price manipulation attempt.Some more info:https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-ibtc-relisted-dtcc",
