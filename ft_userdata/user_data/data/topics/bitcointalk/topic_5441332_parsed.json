It's not about the link to the article, but more about not putting the text in quotation. When don't quote it and don't include the source you're posting it as your own.

Maybe you dunno how to add reference links for proper citations, that's fine... All you need to do is to COPY THE LINK on whatever sites you got the informations from ( though Theymos doesn't allow links from improper sources as it turns out to be phishing links, but that's the reasons why you need to careful where you get informations from at first).. then paste it below the post and that's it.That's actually a beginning step to citations in here but as time fades, you'll get to learn important too.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

If that happens, pretty sure their device is probably hacked and their password/account/etc is not secured. That aside, obviously your posts will get removed/you will get banned if you share virus/malware/phishing links on the internet. That is not new, and OP or anyone should familiarize themselves with posting rules (especially since most of them are pinned) before making new posts. I always tell beginners to read and scroll around the forum before doing anything else. There is no need to rush making posts here and there. Even if you want to rank up quickly, you're still gated by activity and merit. You need to make meaningful posts in the first place, and I doubt you can do that without being aware of the forum rules.",
