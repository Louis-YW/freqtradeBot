Some say that cryptocurrency prices can be manipulated by wealthy individuals. Despite being decentralized, it seems that price movements can be controlled by specific entities.Most altcoins are not decentralized. If you are looking for a decentralized coin, go for bitcoin. Altcoins have less marketcap. The less the market cap the higher the possibility of market manipulation of the altcoin.Quote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMSo, in your opinion, can everything related to money in this world be manipulated? For instance, do you believe that the value of the USD or the largest stock market in the US can be manipulated by a few individuals?The price of fiat are controlled by the government and the central bank. Quote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMWhat kind of people are capable of market manipulation?For altcoins, people that have huge amount of the coins or token. If 5 whales of a coin has 20% of a coin, they can together easily manipulate the coin price.",

Manipulation is like the oil in the business I believe, because sometimes the market can only move with manipulation. It causes a spontaneous and unplanned decision either to invest hugely or to run out with your investment but whichever it goes the manipulator would have benefited. Like in cryptocurrency, someone can shake the market by dumping or buying hugely and cause panic. Sometimes when government print currency, that could be for some artificial purpose for a greater goin to the manipulator. Quote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMWhat kind of people are capable of market manipulation?An individual, institution or government. The government can purchase in large quantity some stock they want to appreciate and that will cause people to start investing in it.",

This is very common with the government in handling fiat. They instill in the systems the conditions they need functional by simply pumping in more fiat currencies or reducing the amount in circulation. It’s a manipulation done by affecting the lack or availability of a commodity.It’s almost the same thing when it comes to cryptocurrencies that are centralized but this ain’t the case with bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized and as such, no one holds that much power to create these conditions but then, institutions with large hodlings could mimic what is obtainable in centralized systems by flooding the market with more coins but it always ain’t enough until the masses join in.Soon, you would find the coin recovering. It’s just how it works.",

They will jump as soon as they see window of opportunity.And we have seen a lot in alts with small trading volume. If they will put thousands of dollars, they can easily make it look like they gained 100-1000% of the price. But people should be very cautious on this type of movement as they can get screwed fast.",

Although the concept of decentralization in cryptocurrencies suggests resistance to manipulation, the reality is more nuanced, since the concentration of resources in the hands of wealthy agents can influence prices, since in an emerging market like this, some significant operations they can have a disproportionate impact, and considering that many cryptocurrencies are not decentralized and have little value, it makes the task of manipulation even easierQuote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMWhat kind of people are capable of market manipulation?the type of people with the ability to manipulate the market is usually those who have considerable financial resources and deep knowledge about the markets...What is known as \"Whales\" These could be from institutional investors, investment funds, high-risk operators often even people with significant connections in financial circles..",

Always those people who do havethat financial capacity would be always having that power and the advantage on moving or influencing things even if we do say that this crypto space isnt something that could be easily be manipulated but it seems now on these years on which it is really that heading on the way where markets could really be easily be influenced or could easily be that manipulate.This is why whether you are getting involved with stock market or forex, or crypto then dont get surprised that these kind of behavior would really be that existing or something that could be able to see.You wont really be that able to avoid up these things since those people or institutions who do have that capacity will definitely be doing something at their advantage or something on their liking.",

Those who want to speculate on an asset with sufficient volume and distribution also take serious risks and are not always successful. For example, if we accept that the price of Bitcoin is determined by a free market, we should also accept that all the players in that market are free. Someone who wants to influence the whole market can also implement a faulty strategy where they lose all their money. Besides, without speculators the market would be as static as a dead sea. They may be morally problematic people, but I think they bring fun to the market.",

Some say that cryptocurrency prices can be manipulated by wealthy individuals. Despite being decentralized, it seems that price movements can be controlled by specific entities.In a business or trade, people who like to manipulate, are always there.Especially as in the realm of crypto assets, stocks and other investment assets. Even though manipulating a market or investment assets, such as stocks, is strictly prohibited, because these actions can harm other investors. But still people who like to manipulate are always there. So you could say the act of manipulating is no longer strange. Likewise in the crypto market, often market manipulation is carried out by individuals or groups to achieve the goals they want (market prices). Maybe decentralized crypto like bitcoin can also be manipulated, but it will definitely be quite difficult, because we all know that bitcoin has a very large market capitalization, so to manipulate it will definitely be quite difficult and not like manipulating altcoins.Quote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMSo, in your opinion, can everything related to money in this world be manipulated?

Because currency can always be manipulated in value. But the way to manipulate it may be from an economic or political perspective. So basically the thing called manipulation always exists in almost every aspect.Quote from: Okayama on August 29, 2023, 09:05:54 PMWhat kind of people are capable of market manipulation?In the crypto market, usually people who like to manipulate the market are people who already have abundant wealth, that's the point. So people like that can easily make news and make market price movements in a cryptocurrency. And the point of it all, for the plan to work. So in conclusion, people who can manipulate the market are people who really have a lot of finances and are very experienced in the crypto field.",

The actions of these actors can make people sell off or buy more cryptocurrencies. When the news is bad like a major hodler dumping his coins people will be moved to sell their investments because they are afraid that the price will drop further. Sometimes these market manipulators intend to make the price drop and buy back at a cheaper price.

The USD cannot be manipulated by an individual but the government from time to time manipulates the value of the dollars based on certain economic practices. There are times when the value of the Chinese Yuan was devalued to boost exports. The stock market can be manipulated by spreading false information and falsely inflating the trade, quote, or value of some stock.
