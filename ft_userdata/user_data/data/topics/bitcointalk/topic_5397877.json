The best thing to do is buy now and hodl regardless of the market trend because even if it falls deeper, one buys more. We are expecting a bull run in 2023-24 during the next BTC halving.",

I also thought it's different this time and at least no longer go this low.What I can tell that it's usually no bad time and no good time to buy bitcoin. Best may be to DCA. (However, please do with your money as you decide.)",

As a result, many people believe they should try to plan their investments by purchasing within specified windows in order to acquire the best price.Everything in crypto is always evolving. If you're trying to time your purchases, this could be an issue. For the term, though, i think the ideal time to buy is near the end of the month. From my observations, the first ten days of the month, the prices usually experience a rise, followed by a price drop (due to people selling after price hikes) in the second half of the month. You can also acquire Bitcoin and hold it for a long time if you want to make a bigger profit. As more individuals purchase and utilize Bitcoin, the value and purchasing power of the BitCoin you purchase today may increase. Keeping your Bitcoin is also a good idea if you bought it while the price was quite high. Not only will you avoid losing money, but you might even make money in the long run. The value of Bitcoin will, of course, fluctuate. If you follow the market, your purchasing power will increase rather than decrease as a result of inflation.",

It won't return its trend quickly and we won't see a V shape rally from $32k to $69k. There will be a long time for accumulation in months before the market will be warmed up again before 2024 halving.Because people now are uncertainty about what will happen with Bitcoin, up or down, fall more or rally strongly. From uncertainty, they will response from panic to FOMO with Bitcoin bounce. I expect to see big green and big red candles in next few days around $32k.",

Though I think there are some doubts in their mind because most of them are saying that a possible 2018 scenario might takes place again just like what most people here keeps on saying, but for me, it is still to early to decide whether it can happen or not. We should always keep an eye on the market and see if the support would be broken and whether the downtrend would still continue just like what happened in 2018.",

Personally, I honestly do not think there is an actual time that is the best time to buy, bitcoin market is a large market and it is not possible for everyone in the world to be buying or selling bitcoin at the same time, this is out of market characteristics, your decision and my decision to either buy or sell should be born out of yours and my research respectively, this means, you alone can decide when you want to buy or sell, and also, I alone can decide when to buy or sell, it's a personal thing, there is no general side to it. Quote and what if the price turns back to bull?What do we do?You can either FOMO in (if you are a risk taker) or sit and watch supposedly big gains pass you by, there is no two ways to it, the market does not know or respect anybody, you either learn how to flow with the market or sit and watch those who know how to while they make their money.",

I would say start accumulating bitcoin in slow pace. Keep an open eye to the volatility and keep on buying in little quantities. If you have 1000 dollars to invest, break it up in 10 parts of 100 dollars each. That will average out your buying price to keep the risk low. But do not expect that the market will come back up anytime soon. So plan your investment for alteast 2 - 3 years timeframe.",

It should be on our own instincts regardless of the price that it has right now. There are scenarios such as this:BTC pulled back to $34k, but you asked \"Is this a good time to buy?\", but you didn't. BTC pulled back to $33k, but you asked the same thing and didn't take action.BTC pulled back to $30k, but you asked the same thing and didn't take action again.BTC suddenly pumped back to $35k, and then you said \"How I wish I did bought some\" and regretted it.Some people are hesitant to buy when it's cheap, fearing that it might go lower and may lose even more. But the thing is no matter how skilled we are in looking at the charts, reading the candlesticks, getting updated with the trends, etc., there are no promises or guarantees about the movement of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies out there.",
