      "body": "I personally did not sign up on any BC gaming sites since I think they are risky. Yes, investing in any gaming site may easily provide profits, but in order to avoid scammers, do your research first by reading reviews and checking the appropriate licensing regulations.  But it's really up to you when your a fond of casino's or gambling then why not, go for a ride   but be mindful to set limit for yourself and only play with money you can afford to lose.",

      "body": "ive been on BC for about 2.5 years now. im a VIP47 with close to 950K wagered. the site was good during the beginning of covid when i first joined. now i feel like hackers and maybe the site itself are running 3rd party scripts while you're playing which will give you loss after loss after loss. they're literally taken away any type of good vip benefits they once had, the \"level up spin\" used to be daily spin even if you knew you were never going to win more than .50 on that free spin. i have a \"vip host\" which is an absolute joke (BCGAME_POP) not only did they make me wait from levels 45-47 before assigning me one, ive maybe recived $10 total worth of bonuses in the last two years (for being such a great player). stake seems like much more of a legit site these days not only do i only have a fraction of what ive wagered on BC wagered there, my benefits are 100x better, i get daily, weekly, and monthly bonuses and have cashed out plenty of times without having to deposit just off of building up my bonus cash ive got. if you're on BC and got more questions feel free to hit me up username is \"IAmSatoshi\"",

Recently, have you look at the scam accusations board and see the title of those cases? Most were marked as \"resolved\". Of course, it'll be very much appreciated if you can compile me a list of these new complaints so I can take a look into them. Otherwise, I'm not sure what purpose do this thread serve.",

They invest a lot in advertising outside this forum they focus on A-ads and other popular advertising networks, but if you're asking if BC.game is a scam site check this thread Introducing BC.Game Support Team: Building Trust and Transparency They have many scam accusations but on this thread, they are addressing them one by one although there are a few that are left unresolved because both parties can't agree. better check those unresolved and judge for yourselves if BC.GAME has done its best to resolve it.",
