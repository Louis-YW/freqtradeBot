At first, I thought the problem was with the cable, but when I tried it on Electrum 4.4.3, the transaction signed normally.The improvements mentioned in the release of Electrum 4.4.5 are only for Jade. Hopefully, this also applies to Trezor, as I experienced before.",

I think if you go back to version 4.4.4, it might work.it is not Electrum's problem and there is a discussion about it here https://github.com/trezor/trezord-go/issues/247I tried to transact by sending Bitcoin using Electrum 4.4.5, connected to Trezor T. This time, the transaction signing process was successful, unlike when using version 4.4.4.Trezor or Electrum could be the cause of failure when signing transactions in Electrum 4.4.4;What is clear, signing transactions using Trezor T is back to normal when using Electrum version 4.4.5 with the improvements as quoted by the OP; meanwhile, Trezor T has not yet received the latest firmware update.",
