  "content": "Satoshi is FacelessCryptocurrency as a digital currency designed to be decentralized and work through a computer network has radicalized global economy and exchanges. It is visible to the blind and audible to the deaf that cryptocurrency has come to stay and BTC leads the crypto market. As known Bitcoin is the world first cryptocurrency and was invented in 2008 by an Unkown person or group called Satoshi Nakamoto. This invention defiled many theoretical models and the traditional system now labels it as investment not to be use for transaction with merchants. More than $16 billion BTC has been traded since inception and it is estimated that over 144 million people owns Bitcoin globally.It is of interest to know why the founder kept his identity unknown and remain faceless in a face of a culture changing invention. Is He/She or are They afraid or Ashamed?In recent times, Ripple CEO has spent over $150 million on law suit of violation to sales of XRP, Fine of $4.3 Billion has been labeled on binance and violation charges for CZ to pay $50 million and step down, FTX founder Sam faces 100 years imprisonment, Bittrex to pay $24 million to US regulatories etc. Who knows the next swing?

In whatever case, note that not all cryptocurrency is decentralized. Infact, the only true decentralized cryptocurrency is bitcoin, so it is wrong to generalize decentralisation to the whole cryptocurrency.Quote from: RioBlemz on November 25, 2023, 03:13:44 PMIt is visible to the blind and audible to the deaf that cryptocurrency has come to stay and BTC leads the crypto market. Oh no, many people don't agree with this. Many people who are not blind and deaf and including the government are yet to see anything good in bitcoin which is why they keep fighting bitcoin.Quote from: RioBlemz on November 25, 2023, 03:13:44 PMIn recent times, Ripple CEO has spent over $150 million on law suit of violation to sales of XRP, Fine of $4.3 Billion has been labeled on binance and violation charges for CZ to pay $50 million and step down, FTX founder Sam faces 100 years imprisonment, Bittrex to pay $24 million to US regulatories etc. Who knows the next swing? But I am sure many more to come.Avoiding law suits, the government and paying fines is not the reason Satoshi remained anonymous. He did so to avoid an iota of centralisation especially in reaching consensus in the network. Besides, the nature of bitcoin doesn't need a CEO. If Satoshi wasn't anonymous, bitcoin would have had like 10 forkings.",

Since you're the first person to counteract the monetary system that everyone's been falling under in the past millennia, you're bound to have a few enemies in the upper echelons of the society, some with the power to off you and your family as if you never existed in the first place. Satoshi's probably paranoid about this and so he made sure to cover up his tracks after the creation of bitcoin. Or it could be that he just doesn't want the limelight. It's so hectic and problematic to be famous sometimes, and he prolly foresaw this while creating bitcoin. To spare himself the trouble, he just made sure to never reveal who he is.",

I leave it to conscious imagination of the did of menJust to address you very last sentence.. Has it occurred to you that being faceless is a major pivot towards the success of what we call the blockchain technology today?Loads of systems have faces which ties an identity to them and makes them answerable to the solutions they offer, irrespective of their good will, these solutions are mostly challenged by forces already existing and in most cases, agencies that control or regulate the space their innovations are targeted at. In such cases, to alow your inovations work on auto pilot, it is necessary to leave those solutions in the hands of someone or something that will not consider any interferences and cannot  be stopped. This is what birthed the coding solution to finance and other blockchain technology applied solutions.You will agree with me that SEC and other forces will not spare Satoshi if he was come disclose his identity anytime soon, and this will greatly affect both the tech and Bitcoin negatively.",

Let's look for a moment at how bitcoin developed, which was initially feared by several countries because it was thought to be able to destroy the economic system centered on financial institutions. Those who can control a centralized economic system do not want to be replaced so it is worth trying to punish people who start to disrupt this system. But because Satoshi Nakamoto understands the consequences when creating great works, hiding his identity will be much safer in all aspects of his life.Satoshi Nakamoto's intelligence basically had a reason and he deliberately hid his identity so as not to be traced to anyone who intended to destroy bitcoin. Today we can see that bitcoin is growing quite rapidly throughout the world and if he didn't hide his identity maybe today we would no longer hear about bitcoin in the media, forums or other public places.",
