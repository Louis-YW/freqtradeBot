  "content": "For doing our research about Bitcoin, we need to make a detailed research, where it is really essential to have accurate sources. A lack of accurate sources or even inaccurate sources can be very dangerous when disinformation based on a lack of knowledge is shared. It is a big problem on Twitter, where much disinformation is shared and not removed. We need to find accurate sources based on fact and from experts, possibly even from coders who are coding around Bitcoin itself (or can read Bitcoin’s code to understand it). But we also need a good explanation, understandable for normal people who are not coders. A very good source in my opinion is Andreas Antonopoulos, he’s a very experienced, greek Computer Scientist and he can can explain complicated topics very well, to make it easier to understand for normal people. Andreas Antonopoulos has written a good book, called “Mastering Bitcoin”Maybe you have heard from his book “Mastering Bitcoin” where he describes Bitcoin’s details. It’s a book mostly for coders but his first 2 chapters are also informative for normal people. Andreas Antonopoulos has made his book available on GitHub: https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch01.asciidoc https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch02.asciidoc I like his offer to make his book available to everyone because Andreas Antonopoulos is acting non-profit, he is not greedy, which is very good in my opinion. Andreas Antonopoulos has a big websiteAndreas Antonopoulos has a big website, too, where he links all his content: https://aantonop.com/I won’t go into detail here but I’m sure you’ll find interesting content on his website. A very interesting part for Beginners in addition to his book is his glossary about common crypto words. In his glossary, Andreas Antonopoulos gives a very short but on point description of common crypto words: https://aantonop.com/glossary/Andreas Antonopoulos is also known for his historical video, where he explained Bitcoin over 10 years ago to an almost empty audience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywO0r_Fz0lc People like Andreas Antonopoulos have been very important to educate about Bitcoin, keep it sane and explain it to normal people. Andreas Antonopoulos is truly a very knowledgeable source of crypto, where everyone will find helpful content. We should also recommend him as a sane source of crypto knowledge.",

That said, he hasn't been producing much content of late, I'm not entirely sure why that is.Of course, his knowledge is outstanding and when he detected Bitcoin very early, it showed already, how educated he is to see Bitcoin and anticipate how successful it will become. His knowledge as a Computer Scientists helps him to understand Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology even better and what I like most from Andreas Antonopoulos to explain Blockchain knowledge easy to normal people, who are not coders. I don’t know why he’s less active right now but after following Bitcoin for 10 years, he might need a bit vacation because it might be stressful and after his achievements from Andreas Antonopoulos about Blockchain education, his vacation is well deserved.",

      "body": "Expanding knowledge of bitcoin is uncomplicated with the help of Andreas Antonopoulos. It is because his contributions are available and can be easily access in different platforms. Thereby, anyone who wants to acquire basic understanding and gather necessary information can do it. Lastly, he explained every information in a thoroughly manner, but is straightforward that people that are unfamiliar with the concept of cryptocurrency would understand. Thus, I do believe he is very helpful, especially for beginners.",

You don't need to know how a car is constructed in order to drive it. Well, I pretty much agree with this, people who try to explain Bitcoin from a technical perspective to a person who doesn't even know what it is nor do they have much knowledge about technology and how it all works, if you start explaining cryptography to a newbie he will definitely get confused and lost in the middle even if he starts to grasp the idea initially.It's better to keep things where they should be, so limiting the information for newbies to what Bitcoin is, how one can buy and store it, how to send and receive Bitcoins and that's it. The knowledge that one might require later on they can find out about themselves.",

I agree to your point because Andreas Antonopoulos has studied Bitcoin for a very long time and he has acquired much knowledge to investigate it in detail. Bitcoin is not easy to understand at all because it's a very technical topic and most of us need to rely on experienced computer scientists to review it. Antonopoulos is such a trusted and experienced computer scientist. I like it from Andreas Antonopoulos to make his book publicly available to everyone (https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook). Normally, such knowledge it not available for free. Andreas Antonopoulos is acting non-profit here, he is not greedy, which is very good in my opinion. Educating about Bitcoin is more important in his oponion, a very honorable decision from Andreas Antonopoulos.  Quote from: FUCKBSVFUCK on April 30, 2023, 05:24:00 PMI have also provided the link to a source code to understand it. As you know, the first two books are the foundation of the Bitcoin book and the third one is the original code and its contents. You can read them here, and see them and see how important these are and how they relate to Bitcoin. This will be helpful for you, too.You don't have provided any link.  Honestly, I don't understand what's even your point??",
