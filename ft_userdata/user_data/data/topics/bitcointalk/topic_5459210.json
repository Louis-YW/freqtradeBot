Users can manually credit the deposits via the \"Transaction History\" page. Do note that deposits made into expired deposit addresses would not be automatically credited. But better to always copy the address on Binance directly and send it to anyone that wants to transfer coin or token to your Binance account, or to use it to send coin to your Binance account.People should always know that the addresses on Binance are not theirs because they did not generate the addresses themselves, it is Binance that has the keys, Binance is in control of the addresses and have the full control over the coins. Binance can change any of the address at anytime they want. People should be aware of that.",

It is good users won’t lose their funds when it’s still deposited in the old address, if not it might cause mayhem between them and their users.",

People should be aware of that.I think this is even the second time in space of 12 months that I have heard of bitcoin changing address. Although when I found out that my btc addresses were still the same and I enquired I was let to know it was only for Alticoins. So now seeing this, is a bit confusing but maybe the address changed in first quarter or last quarter of 2022 was for ethereum and the likes of bnb. The only advice at this period is just to check directly from the app so as not to send funds to old wallets. And also one shouldn’t sleep on the advice that has been given multiple times here, which is to treat all exchanges as a market place",

And that is what I am also using for my trading business.It is a new news, not the old one and Binance has indicated that they will notify their customers that their addresses would be changed. Address can be permanent on exchanges but there are times that exchanges can decide to start giving another addresses to their customers. So which can make it not permanent.Quote from: Stable090 on July 13, 2023, 09:40:50 PMWetin dey do binance wey dey just dey change wallet anyhow, thanks for dis information, seriously dis information wey u post here dey very important to some people wey dey dis local board.

Once again thanks @OP. Use your noncustodial wallet address instead of an exchange bitcoin address for signature campaigns. This may help you when you want to sign message with bitcoin address. But also good to stake your bitcoin address.If anyone is affected, the money will not just be credited automatically, but if you go to deposit history, you will be able to credit the coin manually without the help of customers care. With that, you will know that your address has been changed because Binance will also make it clear that your addresses has been changed.Before the address would be changed, Binance will also send email.",
