Yes, we can point out the good / bad / ugly of what they may or may not want to do. But beyond that, it's their coin. Do with it as they want.-Dave",

Nobody can afford to support Bitcoin for their political interests because it will be like \"Oh bull, hit me\". Remember my words if anyone would do that the Bull will hit him hard enough that his generation will remember. Because everyone like the control, and power in their hands, Bitcoin eliminates the central power authorities and divides the rights on equality.Quote from: mk4 on May 03, 2023, 03:19:45 PMYea while it can technically be an \"investment\", calling it an \"investment\" can undermine it quite a bit.

Bitcoin's ability to weaken or break down political strongholds can be seen as a threat by government's and financial institutions, which may lead to increased regulation or even outright bans on Bitcoin ownership or use.",

Yeah instant millionaire I guess, since we all have different way of earning or profiting. But hodling doesn't also guarantee you success like the BTC did. Investment could also the same but once the BTC you owned are in the market, then you're part of the game already. Unlike hodling you just wait for miracle to happen.",

Once people get tired of certain authorities controlling the money they are using, they will look for options and BTC is the best one.",

Satoshi's message in the Genesis Block is also political. I also share this dream of political freedom through bitcoin mass adoption. Fiat has been a control tool in the hands of the government to control the entire activities of humans. They make and enforce draconian economic policies to force their political will on the people. An example is my country when the government restricted cash withdrawal from citizens while government officials were given unhindered access to cash because they want to force the people to vote for them. Due to lack of money citizens were forced to sell their votes for peanuts because they needed money to buy food. Bitcoin would have been a political and economic tool to frustrate these evil plots by these politicians because it would have given the populace unhindered access to their money. Mass adoption will make this dream real.",

I recognize that governments certainly aren't fond of cryptocurrencies for obvious reasons (money laundering, tax evasion, privacy, no control over them, some of which are also extremely common with fiat currencies, but that's another story), although that doesn't cancel their investment nature. You may not consider holding as an active investment, but it's practically no different than buying an asset such as gold; you don't have to actively trade to be considered an investment.",

This is important and necessary. On the other hand, the mempool has grown in recent days, and it shows, I think, that bitcoin is already in active use, and technically there is not much room for even more use growth at the moment.If we encourage people to use it more often, we will simply face more competition for block space and a higher entry threshold for new participants interested in bitcoin.

So I get the idea that accepting and Hodling bitcoins can be a kind of political movement that aims to restore some sort of freedom to the people. Endorsing and encouraging bitcoin use can also be equated to promotion of this kind of political movement. The government see it as such too, it is part of the reason why they are fighting so hard against it.",

There are fractions within every government that don't care about bitcoin at all, but there are also those who are for or against it and make their stance public every time they're asked (or not).Some good examples from the US are Elizabeth Warren and Warren Davidson, you can look them up online along with their opinions about bitcoin. As time goes by, holding bitcoin will not only influence your voting, but it will become voting. If you decide to invest a lot of money into bitcoin, you will want to support politicians who try to make your life easier. As a politician, you will have to be aware that openly criticizing bitcoin will make you lose votes of people who hold it. The more bitcoiners there are the more votes you will be losing... or gaining, depending on your stance.",
