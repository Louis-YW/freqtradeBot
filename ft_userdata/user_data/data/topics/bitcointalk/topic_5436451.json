  "content": "HELLO!Alpen Coin has designed a card for Coldkey last year. The design was inspired by a famous painting of Ferdinand HODLER (What a name!!).Ferdinand Hodler (1853-1918), Le Lac de Thoune aux reflets symétriques, 1905.Huile sur toile, 80,2 x 100 cm © MAH Genève, photo : B. Jacot-Descombes Inv.1939-33Hodler is one of the most famous swiss painter. It was important for Alpen Coin to share our love for Art and Swiss Culture with bitcoiners.  That's why despite the COLDKEY Story we have made this card with SATOCHIP.LOTS- 1 Alpen Coin x COLDSCAM satodime card (3 have been printed)- 1 Alpen Coin x COLDSCAM satodime card (test print, Satochip has made 2 test prints)RULES- Choose a slot between 0 - f (no random) for lot 1 or lot 2- Requirements: Jr Member and up .
