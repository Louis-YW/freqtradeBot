We use innovative momentum detection methods developed by our traders with over 10 years of practical trading experience. For observation, all trading pairs of Binance Futures & Cryptorg Futures were taken, except for pairs with BUSD. Automatic addition of pairs for analysis within a few seconds after the listing.⚡️ Signals come as notifications to our telegram channel https://t.me/market_shock🕹 Full documentation https://support.cryptorg.net/ctg-en/market-shock/In the documentation, I described three options for working with such notifications. For an active trader, the main thing is to catch the volatility that arises behind the impulses and trade it.🏄🏻‍♂️ The tool is available to everyone. So feel free to share this useful channel with your friends.I recommend that everyone who actively trades intraday set a sound signal for notifications from the channel so as not to miss important moments of market activity!",
