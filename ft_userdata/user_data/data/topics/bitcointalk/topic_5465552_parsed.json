  "content": "Based on my experience, yes.Here is the history, in my telegram group some users were talking about the RBF flag and how this allow you many things from bump the fee to increment the priority of your transaction, up to change the destination address and amounts, even return the balance minus fee to the source address or some other address under you control.That is some OK in the most of the cases, but some user reach me privately to show me that is not necessary to have the RFB flag enable in a TX to be replaced or modified, this is a FullRBFThis user send me some dust amount to my address and some of his addresses. The original TX doesn’t have the RFB flag.After some days of the TX waiting in mempool, he do a FullRBF twice, first of it was changing the destination address to another address and 8 minutes later a second FullRBF changing the destination once again to my address.Images Original TXFirst FullRFBSecond FullRFBFinal TXID: 942a454340c5115d769a16aad85b85a19875bb2f5e544de1b776570b76294f62If he hadn't performed that second FullRBF the dust amount would have ended in one of his addresses.This makes me think about the post of satoshi about the vending machine.What if a dishonest user sends a TX with low Fee (1 Sat/vB) to a vending machine, the machine releases the product, and after some time that user performs a FullRBF changing the destination address to one of his own addresses?I like the FullRBF feature to bump the fee. But i also see it as some kind of loophole for those some scenariosSo the question about this is: what do you think about FullRBF, does it allow double spend or not?",

Once a transaction is initiated without Full RBF enabled you wait for the confirmation or the transaction been dropped. Also about the issue giving out the product after making transaction with the venting machine I think that has been fixed by you/seller waiting for at least a single confirmation or for at most 6 confirmation. With six confirmation the transaction is agreed to be save already",

That's why they shouldn't be releasing the product under a 0-conf transaction.

If a transaction is unconfirmed yet,you can use Replace By Fee (RBF) to change the transaction to a new address but you must bump the transaction fee to be higher than the previous one,so that miners will quickly add it to the blockchain. Electrum wallet and blue wallet are example of walkers with RBF.",

First was the smaller number of nodes in total that one could connect to and send a conflicting transaction to each and wait to get one confirmed. And second was the fact that one could send out a transaction (the actual payment) to the network but mine the next block containing the double spend themselves since the difficulty was very low.",
