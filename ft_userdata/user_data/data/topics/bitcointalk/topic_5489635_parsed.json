The questions will mostly be technical and historical. To create an incentive, I will generously merit the first person who replies with the correct answer. If that is not good enough incentive, I'll create a leaderboard!Your answer needs to be explanatory. Not just a yes-no or a single number.If nobody finds the answer until the cut-off date, I will submit it.Have fun! It's a game.  The first question was a tribute to the whitepaper. Now let's see how good we are at math.Question: What is the chance of having exactly three blocks mined within the next 10 minutes? You can assume that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average.Cut-off date: 27/03/2024.",

I’m not sure if this computation will be accurate on Bitcoin mining since I don’t have enough knowledge on this area. Thanks for the heads up I mistakenly substituted 3 instead of 1I also got the same result using this formula. However, the word “exactly” in the BlackHatCoiner`s assignment confuses me. After all, this implies that exactly 3 blocks and no more should be mined in 10 minutes, and that the situation where 3 were mined and the fourth was already started to be mined is not suitable, as far as I understand. That is, after exactly ten minutes, exactly three blocks should be mined, and the extraction of the fourth should fall on the eleventh minute. And if my thoughts are correct, then Poison Distribution formula does not take this into account and the probability is calculated incorrectly, because it is greater than it actually is.",

Your formula makes sense in finite sets. For example, the odds of getting an even number from a dice roll. Code:{Total of even integers from 1 to 6} / {Total integers from 1 to 6} = 3 / 6 = 0.5The set of all possible outcomes in the Bitcoin network within 10 minutes is infinite.

So the probability of mining three blocks in the next 10 minutes is about 0.1% or 1/1000.Otherwise,,,Since there is a binomial probability for each event (yes or no), the probability will be the average position of the numbers. Given its value, the binomial probability for each event will be 1/2.  Then the probabilities for the first three events would be: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8",

You can assume that a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average.To calculate the probability of having exactly three blocks mined within the next 10 minutes (which is almost impossible) I used the poisson formula and I got p(3;1) =0.0613 So I'd say that there's a 6.13% chance of having exactly three blocks mined within the next 10 minutes.I could have loved to explain how I got my answer in details but my keyboard isn't giving me every thing I need to type.The poisson formula looks like this, p(x;a) = (e^(-a) *a^x) / x! I used \"a\" to replace the symbol I couldn't find in my keyboard.
