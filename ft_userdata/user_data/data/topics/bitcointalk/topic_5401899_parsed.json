It's an Asic and that's it. No sorry I forgot - too expensive as nearly any Goldshell Asic - you won't get your money back",

Video cards based on this algorithm are not profitable and ASIC is useless for other coins.",

      "body": "The yield on almost every Goldshell ASIC sucks. I bought a KD-BOX for $4800 in March and it made $7/day of revenue. Now it makes 2 bucks if I am lucky, and is only worth $2300. That's a payback time of > 1000 days. I doubt these new models will be any different, especially since power cost doesn't matter for KDA mining.",
