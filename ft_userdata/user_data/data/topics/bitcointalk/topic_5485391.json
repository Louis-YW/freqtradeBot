If you can hodli your bitcoin in the bear market that is when you are a good hodler. I hope that you don't have plans to sell those bitcoin in the bull market, and if you have plans to to that, then you should have a price target that when bitcoin reaches, you can sell and take profit. This is because bitcoin price will not be bullish alone, the bear market will come after the bull run.",

Because someone will not show the bitcoin address there are privacy reasons for me it is quite reasonable.You can say that it is quite profitable to buy bitcoin at $22,000 if it is true and now it is around $52,000 many people buy in the lowest area before but make sure when you will withdraw the profit, if you wait longer after the halving then it will be better and it could be that the price of bitcoin soars.",

You would struggle to store it for the long term if you do that as you may be forced to sell when you don't want to and maybe at a loss, because you need the money to pay some of your bills urgently.It is worth mentioning that you should only buy BTC with an amount you can afford to lose, dca strategy helps you control how much BTC you buy, you can use it and buy small portions of BTC regularly, and before you know it you have a lot of coins.",

I'd really like to know how he can prove to us that he owns bitcoin if not by signing a message with his address.I like to observe the FOMO, just as I like to watch the market go into despair and you can smell the euphoria through the monitor. It's really interesting that people who hold bitcoin now are happy, but they had the same bitcoin 6 months ago and were sad, like it was some king of burden. Watch how this turns into a level 2 euphoria, when it goes up again and some of them who sold go into buyback mode at $60k",

Let us just hope that he won't be too confident of the profit and to be careless of the possibilities with regards to the next market price behavior of Bitcoin and this market in general.And as per the right time to invest, there's no such thing to be honest. Just invest when you're ready and once you are aware of how things work in this industry. If you are one of those who are too optimistic of the market price direction, then better yet to pull out your investment or to not invest at all. The market is way too unpredictable 'coz the market prices despite of the increase recently, could still be manipulated and result to a sudden decline or price correction. Be prepared and know how to respond; just if incase it take place any day, know to yourself if you can afford continuing the hold or to take profit for now and wait for another opportunity to enter and maximize the profit.",

Now, luck has brought you to where you are now. Instead of panicking and selling earlier when there is price correction, but you chose to hold even longer and show more patience in your investment. I guess patience and understanding come with a great reward in the future. Not all beginners in bitcoin are able to do that. Your faith in bitcoin was certainly deep, and that’s definitely a good thing in you since you are now eligible to reap massive profits. But hold until bull run comes, that’s definitely the perfect time to sell and be in huge profits.",
