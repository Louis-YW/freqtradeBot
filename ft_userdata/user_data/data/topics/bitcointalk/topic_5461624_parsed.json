Long-term investments highlight the importance of time over finance. Although your chances of success are slimmer, your short-term investment goals may be sound. When you invest over time, you not only get to keep your winnings, but you also have time to fix any financial mistakes you may have made. It is preferable to invest over a long period of time, such as three to four years.",

The only area I have also noticed is that, for a market that is consolidating like we have now, short term traders make so much profit buying and selling in a range. By the time they do this repeatedly, they would have made much more profits than those holding for long. But this require so much experience and discipline. Las Las, it boils down to what you are comfortable with and whatever suit your risk appetite.",

You no want do comparison here I believe but as you con put \"but\" mean say you dey favour long term investment to be more profitable. Me I no go too agree with you on that. The only thing wey people dey see about long-term be say maybe Dem go dey market when the bull and ATH go happen and e go be like say na Dem make money pass but we never ask ourselves about the accumulation of the short short profit wey dey comot from short term. The ROI for a short term investor fit even make sense pass persin wey leave him investment for 3years. Like we know say within 3years now, btc no go just waka reach that higher highs, the thing go dey drop sometimes too and na so short term investor wey get eyes for back go dey cash out and DCA again to catch up with the next bull etc. So e just depends on the one wey persin like to follow.

Not really. Both long and short require patient to cash out.

So it could be days, weeks or months, as long as it's not more than 6months, it's still short term investment.",

If we dey based dis discussion for just bitcoin then na long term wey sure pass because even all the OG wey hold their bitcoin from the day wey Bitcoin was sent to their wallets to dis day go comfirm to you say nothing sure pass for Bitcoin side then to become a long term hodler. Long term holding helps you in so many ways that isn't just profit gaining. If you be long term hodler e go make you develop the habit of patience and this one no go only help you for Bitcoin but all round investment that includes the industry and other investment options. E go make you to get patience and with patience your investment go dey profit you, if you know wetin you dey invest inside and e no be scam. Short term holding no bad but if you're get the opportunity to choose which one you go belong among the two choices, choose long term hodling. This one go make you get less stressed for the market and all the shakara wey e dey do. But if this topic involved all coin that one be say you need to decide weda you go hold long or short on your own as nobody know how profitable any coin fit dey at a particular time. Altcoins investment dey very unpredictable and e dey get plenty wahala wey be say if you no put your head for ground you fit fall mumu to scammers.",

Bitcoin do and do increase to all-time-high as usual, but some altcoins failed to do that. During bull market, altcoins may not reach all-time-high again or in time. Some coins are shitcoins and some become dead.Let me give you some good examples:Bitcoin increased to $69000 in 2021. Now at $29300Dash increased to 478 in 2021. Now at $31.80Filecoin increased to $430 in 2020. Now at $4.2Solana increased to $259.9 in 2021. Now at 23.17Most altcoins are still 10 times lower than their all-time-high in 2020/2021, but bitcoin is just not more than 2.5 times lower.In 2020, bitcoin got to all-time-high above $19600 of 2017. Its price increased to $69000 in 2021 which is the present all-time-high. There are many well known altcoins that did not get to all-time-high at all in 2020/2021.Examples of coins that did not get to all-time-high in 2020/2021:EOSBitcoin cashZcashAnd many other coins. Like I have once mentioned, your topic is about bitcoin and this can be taken as an investment assets, but altcoins are gambling assets and only use them to gamble. After a significant bear market and if you are able to risk your money, risking the amount of money that you can afford to lose, there are some altcoins to go for, but not for long term investment except ether, but which I will not encourage anyone to invest on due to privacy reasons and centralization. There has been no coin like bitcoin.I can only advice people to invest in bitcoin which is less volatile, most decentralized and most secure.",

Sometimes the market situations  gives room for more profit.  For instance,  a short time holder basically does trading on  daily basis which means they taking advantage of the market situations to make more profit by trading ie buying and selling when it is bear market while the long term holders need not do so but are curious of the market as it is likely that they might be running at loss and all it takes them is just patience for the market to recover but for the short term holders it is a daily trading exercise giving them opportunity to take advantage of the market situations.Short term holders are basically traders with experience and well skilled with trading techniques so you see why they make more profit while the long term holders are just investors who bought with spare  cash and  made up their mind to hold for a long period of time irrespective of the market situations. What it takes them is patience alone.In all, the both make profit but it is presumed one make more profit than the other.",

      "body": "Determining whether long-term or short-term holders earn more from Bitcoin depends on several factors. As you said, \"What is good for Mr. A, may not be good for Mr. B\". Long-term holders who are generally focused on the potential growth of Bitcoin over an extended period, keep their Bitcoin over time with the ambition to benefit from the overall upward trajectory of the cryptocurrency. Long-term holders typically believe in the long-term viability and potential of Bitcoin and are willing to endure short-term price fluctuations. They may benefit from capital gains if the price of Bitcoin increases significantly over time Short-term traders, on the other hand, aim to profit from short-term price movements. They actively monitor market trends, use technical analysis, and employ trading strategies to capitalize on price volatility. It's worth commenting that both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and no strategy guarantees consistent gains. Ultimately, the decision between long-term and short-term holding strategy depends on your investment goals and personal preferences. Personally, I'd go for both (although, I'm not that strong in Bitcoin), I think I'd want short-term investments in Altcoins, and then long-term investments in Bitcoin.",
