Bitcoin cannot be controlled or regulated.We've seen China ban or fine companies or individuals who has been vocal against the government, resulting in many elites moving out of China to less stringent nations",

If the government does not allow its citizens to work with bitcoin, it will lose its citizens' confidence in the future as well as investment opportunities, it will destroy jobs in the country, and deter foreign businesses from investing in China.I think That's fine and the Government there makes the decision, but there are still plenty of reasons to keep cryptocurrencies legal so they don't harm their own people and impact the rest of the world.",

      "body": "Well, for one thing.... if Bitcoin become a global reserve currency in the future and countries like China banned it, then they will lose out on the benefits of their people to use that currency. I do not think that will bother them too much, because their government wants total control over their citizens and the financial freedom that Bitcoin provide, will be perceived as a threat to their control. My guess is that China will bring out their own government controlled Crypto currency (GovCoin) and they will force people to use that. Their citizens that will be using that currency, will be verified and all transactions will be monitored by their government.",

China is the only country that has a CBDC that is actually being used on a large scale (with a high transaction volume) and they wanted to force more people into the direction of using their centralized altcoin by putting more and more restrictions on any decentralized cryptocurrency that people may want to use like bitcoin. Hence the ban on mining bitcoin and the exchanges. P.S. Of course there are other reasons for said actions. For example one of the reasons to shut down the exchanges were the massive amount of money they were laundering (with their 0 fee fake trades). Or ban on mining was because of their energy crisis.",

Many people in China are still using crypto, but they are trying as hard as they can to hide it from the government officials. If crypto was legal, a big portion of those people would declare their crypto income and pay taxes for it. I don't want to discuss the potential benefits of the blockchain technology, because such benefits are yet to be discovered.Another thing that China lost is the ability to influence the cryptocurrency markets. Remember when more than 50% of crypto mining was located in China and every FUD news coming from there had an immediate impact over the crypto prices.  I'm glad that this is over.",

CCP has always want to have control over it's citizens by monitoring their transactions. China will not have foreign investors that will invest in the country that much,especially the ones that uses bitcoin. It will affect the country and the citizens especially the traders who buys and sells abroad. So many benefits of bitcoin will not be achieved anymore by the Chinese. Banning bitcoin might affect their economy a little,if some present foreign investors in the country don't like the banned,they might leave the country to a bitcoin friendly country or any country that uses bitcoin. Tax paying on crypto should not be why it should be banned",

They even created the first CBDC to counter it.But maybe there is a possibility China will unban if they continue to pursue the reunification with Taiwan and US will interfere with it where they'd be also sanctioned like Russia and it's possible that countries not supporting the unification will only trade with BTC to affect CCP's control.",

Banning crypto creates more unemployment. More unhappy people. Unhappy people don't like their rulers and usually riot. Riots create fights and fights create deaths.We can safely say banning crypto kills people. And who is responsible?Whoever banned crypto.Murderers.",

But that's what their government wants! They have a huge internal market and they have copied almost everything from the west. So their impact for not accepting cryptocurrency will be next to none. The communist part of China doesn't want to depend on anything external which is good from the perspective of administration. That's how they are becoming the next super power and a big threat to the world.",

What do you think countries have to lose by making this choice?China is known as a communist country, so the economic system is regulated and facilitated by the state, so that none of its citizens are allowed to have personal wealth, even though China has implemented a trickle-down economy or what is known as trickle-down economics.As far as we know, Xi Jinping has returned the Chinese economic system to the above economic system, which is all regulated by the state.The state's loss by banning Bitcoin in my opinion is that they cannot enjoy the greatness that Bitcoin has. Because Bitcoin can only be controlled by people who have Bitcoin.However, the ban will not fail Bitcoin.",

If the US feels doing that protects their national security, then what threat is BTC to China's national security that caused a ban on it, none, that is why this is very different from China's BTC ban. BTC only threatens their control of people's money, and that should not be a threat in a free world.Quote from: lhrbeijing on October 25, 2022, 06:25:00 AMSome people say that the wealth accumulated by an individual should be in the sun.
