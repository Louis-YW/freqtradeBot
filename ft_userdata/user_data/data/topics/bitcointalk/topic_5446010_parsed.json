      "body": "A block has not a limit for an X amount of transactions. Each block has a maximum capacity in Megabytes. Since some transactions will take more MB then others (a transaction that is made of many inputs has more MB then a transaction that is made out of one input) you will have different amounts of transactions in each block. Since miners want to have maximum profit they will fill the block with as many high fee transactions as possible. This is somehow a manipulation yes, but will result in high fee transactions being processed faster than low fee transactions. SO yes in a way the miners are manipulating the blocks to get the maximum payment, but you can easily go with that and simply put a high TX Fee.",

Originally, the intention was for the block size to be determined by the total size of bytes in the block, rather than a set number of transactions. This means that a block can contain a smaller number of large transactions or a larger number of smaller transactions, depending on the specific transactions being processed at that time.Quote from: Woodie on March 23, 2023, 07:27:14 AMso really how does the mining mechanics work https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MiningQuote from: Woodie on March 23, 2023, 07:27:14 AMbecause at the moment we have over 50 thousand transactions in 212 blocks pending and to clear this why arent more transactions being accommodated in each block to clear the clog???Given the limited block size, how do you suggest miners should go about including all the pending transactions in the blocks?Quote from: Woodie on March 23, 2023, 07:27:14 AMMy question: Do miners manipulate the network in their favor to get better incentives?How exactly? Miners may prioritize certain transactions with higher transaction fees, as they receive the fees as part of their reward for adding the block to the blockchain. That's pretty much it.",

This is not manipulation, this is how BTC was designed to work, and there isn't any other way to do it.Don't get me wrong, it is completely how bitcoin was designed. It was just the answer to the question of OP. The miners can choose which transactions they like and they could even ignore specific transactions. This is how bitcoin was designed, but it is also a possibility to manipulate. The miners can for example also ignore a transaction with a very high fee rate, just because they don't like the sending or receiving address for example.",

There are many factors that can affect the speed and efficiency of transaction processing, including network congestion, transaction fees, and miner activity. It's important to look at multiple sources of data and to understand the underlying mechanics of the network to get a complete picture.",

For example, if mining is not profitable, then can large miners take such a step to fill blocks only with transactions with high commissions?Yes they could do it, but then the blocks would probably be half empty, so they would loose money. The low TX Fee transactions would then be processed by other pools that then would have full blocks. Even with 50% hash power you would only double the time for low TX Fee transactions.",

So I think now a days it do not depends of Bitcoin miners. Let's see what will happen in the future.",
