  "content": "Hello!I know that while Patrick/Yogg/Coldkey aka ScamKey has left a bad taste in our mouths, I have a proposal.I would like to (starting 1/1/2024) start a \"History\" series of wallets but using Ballet's custom cards.To do it right though, I would not be able to order the cards until the first of ea month (to get the accurate amount for the card denomination). And I would limit it to 4 decimals - which really should pretty close as it could vary depending on which exchange you are looking at and/or what time of day you look as well. I would do 50 of each card, ea month - perhaps auctioning the first 21 cards and then selling 22-50 as regular sales. I would need to work with some artists - any takers?   perhaps some of the ones who worked with scamkey would like to see a sort of rebirth of their art on this series? Take on new artists as well. Would have to work with artists to reach an agreeable compensation - ie a percentage of sales to artist or some other arrangement.I am brainstorming here so this may seem a bit scattered but I have time and ballet has a great turn around time so not worried about delays on production. (was that an issue with scamkey? hmmm... )I think the challenge with Ballet will to have them insure the cards are correctly numbered with the last 2 numbers being \"01\" thru \"50\".",
