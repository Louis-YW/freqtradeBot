A seed phrase puzzle could be a unique twist!However, it raises an important question about trust. If I know the seed phrase, how can the recipient fully trust me? After all, Bitcoin is built on the principle of trustlessness, right?I still love the concept, though. It’s creative and intriguing, and I’m definitely going to explore it further!",

Because how can you convey something that does not exist in principle (physically)?Quote from: LiskPro.com on December 11, 2024, 02:37:27 PM    How can you ensure the gift doesn’t rely on a trusted third party (no seed phrases, no PIN codes...)?This can't be avoided and this is the essence of bitcoin. That is, to write down the seed-phrase and create a wallet yourself, learn how to use it, as well as set fees and make transactions. This is the basis for using bitcoin, which you need to know (it is not as difficult as it sounds). Quote from: LiskPro.com on December 11, 2024, 02:37:27 PM    How can you share Bitcoin with someone who may not be familiar with this technology?Create a wallet, send bitcoin there, and give the seed-phrase as a gift. This technology is a must have to get acquainted with! Be sure to show and explain how to use (save) BTC. This interaction during the holidays will surely strengthen your social bonds.Don't look for easy ways and don't use the services of third parties. All your interaction should be reduced to one thing: only you and bitcoin (without unnecessary intermediaries between you).",

If fund, I'd prefer fighting with the fiat and if for asset, I don't see it feasible to me because you don't trap one into unplanned and unready investment else, they're definitely squandering the assets without minding it potential to be hold around the bullish season to say talk more of holding for longer time.",

And for my wife, I will give Bitcoin as a gift because she already has a wallet and has also known and understood Bitcoin well since I started being involved in this world.And for other people and my child is still small, I can't, and for other people or my own siblings I will consider and if they are interested in Bitcoin maybe I will give a little, but if they don't know anything about Bitcoin I won't give it and I will give another gift because they don't know what to do or how to use it or cash it out or whatever and I know and am sure they know about Bitcoin but they don't have any interest in which I think it's better to give another gift that they like which will be more useful.",

You can use bitcoin core! Or better yet you can use a deterministic wallet that uses mnemonic algorithms, like Electrum to generate a seed phrase and as many private keys as you like.Seeing the private keys is not a con. Remember this is your money that you are giving away (not selling) for it to be categorized as con. In fact you should keep a backup of that mnemonic (the keys you gave away) for the future. In case they lost the paper wallet so that those coins are not lost forever.Finally use a cool design for the paper wallet you want to print that has holiday themes and a short guide/info about Bitcoin on the back including how to spend coins. It could be steps to use Electrum which is a user friendly wallet.And they have to learn how to use bitcoin anyway if they want to use bitcoin! otherwise what's the point of giving away bitcoin?",
