I think a genuine crypto affiliate sites wouldn't reach the casino and offer to review it, but they will act like an ordinary gambler, try to deposit, win some money and try to withdraw. They will get a same experience like the others and they will give a honest review about it, including like the casino freeze the account, ask to submit KYC etc.",

Nevertheless it's a nice experience and you get a lot of good feedback.",

That's a good initiative on your part marketing and lead generation is very important for a very competitive industry, we have one coming up in the first quarter of the year its a directory site we are currently building our social account, and it's on my text profile its both a review site and an interview site but we are not listing new casino and requirements is at least 2 months with a good reputation but we're looking forward to having it in our directory once you announce your casino we'll monitor it and list it free and promote it free.Since you are an active member here I don't see you encountering problems promoting it here its the usual get a copper account, hire a designer and be active, of course you know the drill.",

Move this thread to service section so that many could see that you are seeking for the said service. For sure many users here especially those gambling experienced people could help you with that. Also hire a person who can work with you on marketing aspect since they could also help you out to spread the word about your casino and your planned launching.Looking forward to see a new reputable casino will exist here so good luck.",

I think a genuine crypto affiliate sites wouldn't reach the casino and offer to review it, but they will act like an ordinary gambler, try to deposit, win some money and try to withdraw.Have you not seen paid reviews here on this forum? Some reputable members actually participated in casino or coin mixer reviews before and their feedbacks seemed honest from what I've read. Some were critical while others are good so it's quite balanced. I don't see any difference if casino affiliates would do the same type of review.........Quote from: SirJohnVonSlotty on December 19, 2022, 09:39:53 AM...We are officially launching our crypto casino tomorrow, and I'm looking to partner up for reviews, listings and press releases. You can offer it to the regular players if you don't get enough from affiliates. Other casinos have already done it before.",

That's a great start for your casino I'm sure you know what the community is looking for in a new casino, like a copper account a well-designed announcement thread, and a very active owner and representative, if you want to go the extra mile you can launch a signature campaign a month-long campaign for a start will greatly help your casino, once you launch your casino and you've done the right thing reviewers will start reviewing your casino for a feedback.",

I trust his reviews because he has a very solid and detailed way of properly reviewing, explaining and presenting his findings on a gambling site he reviewed.

You'll probably agree with me that there are many members here who actually know their stuff when it comes to playing slots or other games so I don't see their reviews less important than those casino affiliates.",

But base on the topic QuoteAre you a Crypto Affiliate? Review our casino for a fee $$, there are many users that has site which accept cryptocurrencies but I will advise you to meet a manager to discuss the way forward about the developmental process and how the site will be managed in the forum. And also users are waiting to review your site anytime when it is launched. Congratulations for developing a casino site and about to launch it. I hope campaign will also be launched here after the thorough review.",

This is a welcome development.  Getting a review would not or should not be a problem. I strongly believe you have already set up modalities and steps for  the launch of your casino which is a good move. Review you would definitely get because if you should start asking for review at this early stage of launch, you would get confused of which one  to implement so I would advise launch with the options you already made provision for then call for a general review here to improve better. Here members of the platform can make  a review of your casino site an spot their own differences and call your attention to observation made in the course of reviewing your casino. Nevertheless,  hosting a signature campaign onboard this platform would definitely do you more good for promoting your casino with a reputable Manager to run it for a little while while it is still at it's early stage. @yahoo62278 can do it better.",
