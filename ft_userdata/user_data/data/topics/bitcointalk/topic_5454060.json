It is also about gradually shifting people to the model, where transaction fees will keep the system running.

If you want to produce less coins, then claiming a smaller number of satoshis in the coinbase transaction is perfectly valid. If you want to produce more coins, then you can make a soft-fork, where coins will be locked now, and unlocked in the future, and that will change the proportions in any way you need. Because we could have 100 coins in the circulation, and express each amount as the percentage of the supply.So, if the first version would have no halvings, then they could be introduced in a soft-fork way, just by assigning 25 BTC to the block creator, and sending 25 BTC to some address timelocked to the future block number. And the same for all other halvings, it could be a perfectly valid soft-fork. Another thing is you have some sidechains with 1:1 peg with Bitcoin, and they start with no coins, they are fully based on fees, and nothing else. The same with LN, where also no additional coins are created. Bitcoin will eventually reach the same point on-chain.",

No one can get Satoshi's reasons and we all can guess with assumption that Satoshi Nakamoto did not suddenly die and it is not reason of the disappearance.If death is not a cause, it can be Satoshi wanted to leave Bitcoin community to make it more decentralized for developments.QuoteIf there wasn't any halving Bitcoin would had been fully mined around 2019-2020 with 50Btc per block, would it have been another digital currency implementation failure or would it still be surviving?Bitcoin is strong because it is centralized. You can create an altcoin that has lower total supply than Bitcoin, shorter halving time like 3 years, 2 years or just 1 year but it won't become another Bitcoin, with higher price than Bitcoin.Because lack of decentralization is bad and investors are not interested in centralized coins. Centralization means more risk, rug pull, arrested, coin seizure, blockchain halt.",

However, we have a similar situation with difficulty: it was only halved or doubled in the first version, and then Satoshi changed it before 2009. The same could be done here, we don't need infinite precision, target is adjusted in a nice, compact, 32-bit way, for coin amounts we would need only a precision of a single satoshi, and that would not exceed 64 bits.So, as you can see, there is always some room for improvements, but the first version was good enough to be successful.",

Miners may save sats after sats of mining income, but they'll likely release those bitcoins into circulation earlier because even reaching 1 bitcoin intact takes a very long time. Equalization of transaction fees and the final halving block rewards in the future for the continuity of mining activities. Everyone knows that in the future the tx fee to miners might be higher than the block reward itself. Just imagine if there were no halvings, from 50btc+fees to 0btc+fees, would you still be mining?",

      "body": "The capped total amount of BTC is directly related to the halving mechanics. Without halvings any capped total supply amount would be or feel somewhat arbitrary. How would you justify any capping without halvings? And you won't benefit from the rather unconventional idea of a deflationary supply which is in total opposition to what fiat does. And likely Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to offer something better than the screwed fiat and finance system with their inflationary and greedy failures.You can of course argue, what's the purpose of a total supply of little less than 21 Million BTC or 100.000.000 times that in so far undivisible Satoshis? I'm not going to discuss this here now as it has likely been discussed over and over again.I read somewhere (sorry, no sources available) that the initial supply amount per block of 50BTC (excl. transfer fees) seemed like a kind of sweet spot for Satoshi Nakamoto, not too much, not too few. The right amount to draw attention of people to the idea and to fire up mining and rise the number of miners and hash power to secure the blockchain with trustless and decentralized proof of work. (That we nowadays have a rather small number of mining pools with reasonably sufficient hash power (less than 20 mostly) is another story. I sense a tendency of centralization, at least when you look at pool operators and their control. We'll see how that turns out in the future and with further halvings.)Quote from: rat03gopoh on May 27, 2023, 06:47:06 AM ... Everyone knows that in the future the tx fee to miners might be higher than the block reward itself. Just imagine if there were no halvings, from 50btc+fees to 0btc+fees, would you still be mining?The transition would seem to me arbitrary and too abrupt. It's all about current market value of BTC and efficiency and price of energy for your proof of work (and there is no real trustless and decentralized alternative, definitely PoS won't be). With the next coming halvings we have to see how miners can cope with it. If BTC market price doesn't rise sufficiently mining at current energy and hardware costs might become unsustainable for the big players with their localized hash power concentration and their localized power needs.Efficiency and cheep sustainable \"clean\" energy should thrive and be a key focus for miners (and of course others, too).I'm not sure if I can believe or say that Satoshi Nakamoto anticipated pool mining and the consequences of that when they invented Bitcoin. That seems a too far stretch to me.",

If they choose to attack the network, they would lose a chunk of their miners which would drop their total hasrate massively.Nodes would also refuse to propagate their blocks.Hashrate centralization does not put bitcoin in the hands of governments.- Jay -",

Someone can argue that, but: (1) already we see miners sometimes manage to screw up the existing halvings and mine invalid blocks after it, so this would be even harder to get right, and (2) every time the reward decreases there is an incentive to reorg the chain to try to get the greater reward of the prior block instead of the lesser award of the next block.  The infrequent reductions bunch up that bad incentive into a short period that everyone is aware of rather than having the risk spread out.More speculatively, a continually decreasing award seems like disincentivize participation favoring \"Why bother starting when it rewards less than it did a day ago\" over \"the reward is still as good as its been for the last two years, I better start now before it drops again\".Today the small difference in what you suggest probably wouldn't be enough to cause instability, but early in Bitcoins history it probably would have been because there was essentially no fee income and the use of timelocks for anti-sniping hadn't been invented yet.I don't think it's possible to do \"strictly better\": any other choice will be worse in some respect.  But equally I don't think the existing scheme is uniquely the best, since there are alternatives that are worse in some ways but better in others.Every choice makes some tradeoff and there are many equally valid choices.  I think it's likely that Satoshi considered many valid options and picked the one he thought was simplest.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on May 26, 2023, 11:14:25 AMI see that's statement of \"Development & Technical Discussion\" which is outdated.Indeed, Bitcointalk was long ago abandoned by the vast majority of people actually interested in doing development because it became a waste of their time and energy--  too few insightful discussions relative to ignorant ones and some of the ignorant posters are surprisingly abusive and prolific.There are also too few translators-- people who understand the technical ins and outs and can explain and justify them though they're not directly involved, that can meat-shield the experts from people who are interested but technically clueless and save people with greater involvement or expertise from wasting their time on energy on people that don't (yet) know the difference between a Bitcoin and a bottle cap. ... though BCT probably has the second largest surviving population of these people of any of the online venues I've seen Bitcoin discussed, the stack exchange probably being the most.These days I think there is relatively little development anymore that even makes sense to discuss outside of focused discussion around pull requests.  For example, I can't see a reason to have a bitcointalk thread over stuff like \"streams: Drop confusing DataStream::Serialize method and << operator\" or \"refactor: rpc: Remove unnecessary uses of ParseNonRFCJSONValue() and rename it\".  Mostly minutia that only matters to people maintaining the codebase, invisible to people who are only using the software.The poor SNR and abuse isn't unique to Bitcointalk though it reached uselessness earlier than some other channels...

May be that states pretty much everything why the algorithm of mining was made that way.",

I also see that over time, only more and more large centralized corporations can become miners, it becomes more and more difficult for \"home farms\" with one or more ASICs to compete with them.",

Dropping the block subsidy in every block seems quite boring. There won't be an event, just as we now have every four years with the halving. On the other hand, halving is quite smart, and more attractive as concept. It's also more miner-friendly approach. In each epoch, miners get the same subsidy. A miner who just got into, a little before the halving will have the chance to earn the same as the miner who's being mining for 3 years. I think there has to be a balance, as there rightly is. Now if cutting in half is the correct approach, debatable. But it seems yours is neither the best.",
