  "content": "What happened:: This Sunday I open an account at sportsbet.io with the idea to bet on NFL Final, I choose them because I saw that they sponsor teams like Arsenal and Southampton and there one of the few sportsbook online that offers crypto ( at least to my knowledge ) , I deposit (836.28 usdt ) from my binance account ( I can prove ) , the bet was placed with around 3 hours before NFL final start, and you credited my sportsbet.io ( 1731.38 usdt ) then I requested a withdrawal of 1231 usdt which was declined and I wanted to leave 500 usdt into my account for future betting.They declined my withdrawal and ask for verification, I totally comply and send them my documents, they said \"Thank you for completing our online identity verification.\" and then they said that \" your account was disabled due to being flagged for multi accounting by our security systems\"  and I told them that if I had any other account I will use that to place my bet on NFL final, which of course everybody will do, why you would need a second account?I said to them that I don't have any other account and they asked my to wait another 5 business days which I find it weird since they already verified me and my bet was honestly placed .I leave you all my conversation and print screen with my account below. I am terrible sorry that I did not read this forum before joining this scam sportsbook and I hope they will take the rightful decision here.Scammers Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=832366 Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1458034.10600  Amount Scammed: 1731 USDT Payment Method: USDT Proof of Payment: https://tronscan.io/#/transaction/0c8aaf3eba623db12dde630d6ccf6bf97cb77fe072f6b6889da0062d8a7bc980 PM/Chat Logs: sportsbet.io email with disabled account: https://ibb.co/w6CL5Cvsportsbet.io email with accusing accounts: https://ibb.co/tcZRxwKMy explanation to sportsbet.io: https://ibb.co/9wT8xZ6sportsbet.io email asking to wait for 5 days: https://ibb.co/g9GB9C9My respond for their request: https://ibb.co/LZh3dMqAdditional Notes: sportsbet.io account pxdi: https://ibb.co/ZgvZQwSBet that I placed on NFL final: https://ibb.co/yV52nSXaccount history: https://ibb.co/mqjZvcSaccount balance: https://ibb.co/jhc9c5qunable to withdraw 48 hours: https://ibb.co/W0MFZg4 Bottom line I wish I would read this forum first, but when I sign up for sportsbet.io I really trusted them because I saw them linked with Arsenal, Southampton big Premier League clubs that gives them trust, but they are a complete scam, they don't want to pay a legit bet on NFL Final a massive event!

      "body": "I don't use VPN, but I believe I have dynamic ip.I honestly create my account on Sunday with the sole purpose to bet on NFL final, I had some usdt in my binance account and I really fancy Kansas City Chiefs , so I open up my account at 6:39 PM my time and I deposit at 10:39 PM after I struggle few hours with decision if I should bet or or just enjoy the event. Right after I deposit I place the bet ID: 63e94ea469eea00001d9e5d8 , after the match ended they credited my account with 1731.11 usdt and around 0.27 usdt as reward, I decide at 5:18 am to ask for 1231 usdt withdraw so I can enjoy some profit and leave 500 usdt for others bets.At 6:53 am they asked for my verification and I send them all documents and a reply at 6:53 am then they did not answer me at all until 19:44 when they ask me again to submit my documents and I did it again and send them a reply .Today 14 February, at 7:44 they send me email \"Thank you for completing our online identity verification.\" and \"your account was disabled due to being flagged for multi accounting by our security systems\" and I told them that I don't have any other accounts, why would I ? and now let's be frankly , if I had any other previous account they would not ask for that account verification first? Today 14 February at 9:45 they send me email accusing having other accounts and to respond them honestly, and I reply I have only 1 username: pixdi.Today 14 February at 9:59 they send me another account with this message:\"Hello pxdi,Thank you for providing us with all the information requested.Once our investigation is completed, we shall get back to you. You can expect a response from us within 5 business days.We kindly ask for your patience and understanding meanwhile. \"In exchange I reply to them that I open a review to trustpilot, here on bitcoin talk and I form a complaint to curacao-egaming.com .I also find out that if you sent an email to the email address that sportsbet.io has on their website which is : \" complaints@curacao-egaming.com\" you will receive a reply like this : \"Curaçao eGaming (\"CEG\") has received your message, however it was not able to process or read the message, since it was sent to an automated \"No reply\" email address. \" Please test it to see for yourself!So I go to curacao-egaming.com and I fill a complaint there and they confirm that they receive my complaint with an official email. I also asked them to send my 1731 usdt to a address if they don't want me as my customer, but I feel entitled to receive this amount since my bet is honestly placed. Frankly I lost my trust in them after I saw what they are able to do and I receive this answer from them:\"Hello pxdi, Thank you for your message. Please wait for our Player Safety and Assurance Team to contact you with further instructions on this.We cannot assist you with your request until they have proceeded with this.Should you need assistance with other queries, feel free to reach out.\"I honestly regret the moment I create account to this sportsbook and I think this community will have to do something about because think about if my bet was lost, or during half time they offered me option to cash out at 299 usdt and would have cash out then, would they refund my bet? no, they would have taken my money and it was their right, but when I won and I comply with everything they have asked, why to behave with your customer like this?",

As if Steve or anybody from sportsbet.io see this I only want to either let me continue to use my sportsbet.io account: pxdi or allow me to withdraw my balance of 1731.38 USDT , if they don't want me as their customer I have no problem as long as I received my funds and they have my promise I would never ever create another account with them.",

So sorry about your loss mate and welcome onboard this platform. Your accusations are very much heavy though but I believe this is a little misunderstanding that could be handled. Sportsbet.io have a good reputation onboard this platform so it would be very difficult to believe you even after presenting your evidence here. I think you should give them time to run their check while waiting for their representative here to reply to your complaints and taking it to the appropriate quarters for further processing for which I believe would be sorted out immediately.",

Before blindly taking their defense , you might visit trustpilot page: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/sportsbet.io . I made the same mistake not to look after them, just because they are big sponsor for premier league clubs like Arsenal and Southampton, but if you look there you see more than half people giving them 1 start. Now search their competitor stake.com and you will see they are rated with 4.5 stars out 5, huge difference and you should wonder why?Now to my question: why would I have more than 1 account?  they don't offer any deposit bonus, the only thing I saw is the odds boost which is not so semnificative , and the reward center which is becoming better once you get to better level, like from silver to gold or anything like that, so basically player has all interest to keep only 1 account so he can achieve better level as soon as possible and I don't see any advantage in having more than 1 account.My other question: They request my verification on my account: pxdi and I successfully  send them documents, if I had any other account before why they did not ask any verification to that account first? I tell you why, because there is no other account.As you can see from the images I have upload I only place 1 bet on 1 major event NFL final and since then my account is stucked, my last reply from them was on 14 February at 9:59 a.m from that moment no other reply.If you had an account where you honestly made 1 bet , won and you would not be able to bet again or use your money, will you be happy?",

Regarding Trustpilot, I wouldn't pay too much attention to it as many of those \"reviews\" are either paid for or fake.I am sorry , I did not know about that, I mean no harm to anybody, my goal is either to continue to have my sportsbet.io account: pxdi or withdraw my balance of 1731 usdt.At current time 10 pm ( 22:00 ) my time nobody from sportsbet.io contacted me since 09:59 a.m my time, that means 12 hours since I ever had a reply from them, neither any Steve or user contacted me.I want to add proofs :1) You can check time of my deposit with sportsbet.io : https://tronscan.io/#/transaction/0c8aaf3eba623db12dde630d6ccf6bf97cb77fe072f6b6889da0062d8a7bc980Time of deposit 12 February 10:39 P.M , you can also see in the image that they confirm deposit with a notification at 10:39 PM on 02/12/2023 and current time is 10:42 PM on 02/14/2023 , see here:  https://i.ibb.co/r4RNzqF/time.png2) Current time is 14 February 10:45 PM , more than 48 hours since my deposit took place and according to the message display on my account who says \"You are unable to withdraw for 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons. \" I am still unable to make any withdrawal. You can check here ( pay attention to current time and time of deposit ) : https://i.ibb.co/nMHmPhw/withdraw.pngBottom line : when you try to withdraw a message appear and tells you that you have to wait 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons ( \"You are unable to withdraw for 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons. \" ) and even after 48 hours of waiting you get the same message even if the entire amount of time already passed!1) More than 29 hours since I received any email from sportsbet.io 2) Steve or anybody from sportsbet.io did not contact me3) Their website continue to say \"You are unable to withdraw for 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons. \" and as you can see more than 48 hours passed since my deposit.4) Many of the 1 star reviews from trustpilot share a story close to mine and they are from different countries, I am sorry but I believe that reviews are true, sportsbet.io if they are not scams , surely acts like one.[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Do you think this is right? only a scammer will do this.3) They accuse me of having multiple account and my questions for them is why somebody will make more than 1 account? you do not have a deposit bonus, and any player will be interested to have an older account so they can climb to their reward system ( bronze, silver, gold etc ).If I ever had an account with them, would not be that one verified already?Huh why would they ask verification to account : pxdi? Doest this make sense?Their model of business is simple, if your account is a net loser ( you lose more than you win ) they let you continue to bet with them, if your account is a winner then they close it and refund your deposit . There are dozen of complain online about this behavior from them.You can see this on trustpilot: https://www.trustpilot.com/review/sportsbet.ioOr from the many complaints here on scam acusation:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439809.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5266626.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5428296.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5290729.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418601.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5323603.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5411777.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5086453.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5266592.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5435667.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436620.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5266016.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5189479.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5091170.0I have no interest in being their customer anymore, I want them to be fair and pay my winnings as it should, if they are honorable and have any integrity, they know very well that my bet is an honest bet and they should pay the winnings and I will end this debate !I kindly ask community help here, my bet was honest and they do not want to pay,  today I might be their victim, but tomorrow you can be instead of me, please emphasize with me and let's make them pay otherwise they are just SCAMS!Public questions for Steve:1) If I had any other account why would I not bet there and create a new account? You don't have any deposit bonus and rewards I suppose are better once you get higher in rankings , so what advantage I could ever have if I had a second account.2) Why you did not ask verification on other account ( there are none ) and you ask now on : pxdi ?  I think is obvious that you did not had any other account where to ask for verification and you ask only on the single account I have.3) Why are so many complaints about sportsbet.io ?  This is one of the reason I panic in the first place! everywhere on this forum we see complaints about sportsbet.io , on trustpilot more than half of reviews are 1 start and you have 3 stars average out 5, while your competitor stake 4.5 stars average out 5.4) Why you do not pay a legit bet? we both know and I show evidence here that my bet is legit and you basically stole 895 USDT from my player account  and any joy I had after placing a winning bet.5) If my bet was lost. Would you refund it? or just kept my money and then you let me to make other deposits .I think that to answer to this questions will be very easy for a transparent , honest and integrity man.Quote from: sportsbet.io on February 15, 2023, 05:45:04 PMAs mentioned, I will take the time to review the information and process. I will give you a full explanation this week. regards, Steve.Sportsbet.iono sign of that or to answer my questions![moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

      "body": "Quote from: sportsbet.io on February 15, 2023, 05:45:04 PMHi pxdi, First of all, please don't panic post on every available known outlet to sportsbet.io. This does you no favors, and most of all, this does not speed up our process of getting back to you.We have a fraud/security and payments team who are dealing with many facets of operating a sportsbook and casino. I will instigate the scenario of your account issue this week.We processed over 100,000 withdrawls last month alone, so I can assure you if everything is as sweet and innocent as you suggest, there would be no problem here.The panic posting, emailing, spamming club talk chat and trusting in Trustpilot to get you an overturned result leads me to believe you are aware of what I am going to find out.As mentioned, I will take the time to review the information and process. I will give you a full explanation this week. regards, Steve.Sportsbet.ioEDIT 2:Hi pxdi, As I already mentioned here ^^ which was only just over 12 hours ago, I would look into the situation for you.However, since that response, you have taken it upon yourself to go a little awol. Publically calling me out about integrity and trust, multi-posting, and spamming our customer support is not going to change the normal business process. I am not sure which is the crazier stuff here, the fact you posted old scam accusations where I personally REVERSED the business decision and sided with the customers which lead them to being paid out and case closed, or the fact you have sent over 400 emails in the last 12 hours.It in honestly really weird behavior and I'm afraid that any answer I give to you will just not be understood or listened to.As you have since gone and placed an official complaint with E-gaming commission in Curacao, the matter is now with them and I didn't even get a chance to dig into your case due to your impatience.As always, we will wait for the process of e-gaming curacao ( which is long and drawn out ) and we will adhere to any findings they have. This also means I am no longer in a position to comment on your case now it has been taken up with the commission.Im sure we can all agree on that matter.regards, Steve.p.s. I wasn't joking about the 400. Note from our internal slack channels attached.",

However, despite this, you chose to make a scam accusation on the very same day. How do you expect them to check all the facts if you don't give them the time they need?To be honest I panic and open the thread because I saw many similar cases when they use this to not pay the player, however please not forget that:1) Their system showed in my account this message: \" You are unable to withdraw for 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons.\" and after 48 hours from my deposit I was still unable to withdraw . So dishonest behavior !2) My bet was placed honestly, and they credit my account with winnings , then they stole my winnings3) As long as I comply with their request, offer them all the support and documents as fast as possible, I wanted in exchange to at least communicate with me, while not Steve or support team ever reply to me, and my money are money and I should be able to use them when I want , since 12 February they reply 14 February to wait another 5 business days which means that I had another reply from them until Monday, 20 February, that means 10 calendar days in which I cannot use my funds to bet , because this is the reason why I deposit, to bet, not to get stuck!4) If my bet was lost, Sportsbet.io would refund my bet ? why this issue came out only when player wins??? Take some time and investigate sportsbet.io before taking their defense.For me real facts like:1) Many complaints online2) Display message like \"\" You are unable to withdraw for 48 hours after making a deposit due to security reasons.\" and after 48 hours still not to be able to withdraw   ( what is the purpose of that message  )3) Not paying won bets, that they initial credit and then just as dishonest man will do take the winnings from your account.Finally if you consider that a player has other accounts or simply don't want him as your customer for any given reason, you should just pay him for his honest bet and close his account with the mention that he will ever open another one you will take his funds, that in my view is the right way.I repeat myself, my bet was from NFL final with 3 hours before match start as you can see on Kansas City to win, at half time they even had odds like 4.9 to win, I did not cash out my bet, I keep it and won fairly, it is not normal that my joy of winning a bet to be take of from this scumbags as long as I comply with all their rules and requests . This make me angry and I think anybody will be angry with this situation!Quote from: LEVSKI7 on February 16, 2023, 07:03:43 PMhttps://casinogurubg.com/obzor-sportsbet-io-casino#tab=js-tab-discussion Low ratings and very scammed many complaints on various forums.but no control body at least until the new law in Curacao comes into effectI was stupid to blindly believe in a sportsbook that sponsor Arsenal and Southampton without making any investigation first, from my view their way to operate is to invest in publicity so people can join, if they are losers and lose to casino or sportsbook they leave them to continue, if it happens to be winners they close their account and accuse them of having multiple accounts.Everywhere and on each site with reviews you check you see sportsbet.io is not rated good. I wanted to make peace with them and ask only them to pay my winnings but they do not communicate, so I had not other option that to contact their license from Curacao.",
