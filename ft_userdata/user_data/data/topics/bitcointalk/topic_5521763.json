Most investors want multiple profits from Bitcoin investments, but the majority of them are only able to survive at a multiple of 10% of the basic capital, after which they immediately sell it to secure profits and then buy it back when the price is considered to be at its lowest point. Bitcoin will shine even brighter after successfully breaking a new record at the $100k level and will attract the interest of investors who previously considered Bitcoin as an asset with no future.",

To me, holding is not a problem but buying more is. I wish I had $1000 USD to buy bitcoin and hold but alas I don't. This still didn't deter me from investing and buying what I could afford. It is always better to have little than nothing at all. Thankfully, I did because my money did in fact double this year. Some people who may not have held their positions might be regretting now but I always remind myself that it is not the end of the world yet. Yes it would be such a shame not to maximize the earnings but I could still earn in the future and I do plan on doing so.",

I believe a lot of people suggest DCA, even if you have huge wealth to convert into Bitcoin. Unless you want to yolo and don't care about the risk of course. If you have a spare $1 million, buying $10k worth of Bitcoin is easier compared to people who don't make $1k monthly. It also helps you so you don't buy at the top. CMIIW.I wonder which part of buying more is problematic for you though, since you seem to do DCA from your last 2 sentences. Is it because you can't allocate more to your monthly buys?",

But with the popularity of Bitcoin now, it seems people start to follow the other people to have Bitcoin investment. It is good for them because they can buy Bitcoin and hold it for some time and sell it when the price increase.The situation now gives a big profit for a long term hodler where they already buy Bitcoin from a long time ago. So if you want to start to invests in Bitcoin, you can start it right now and hodl it. You will see your profit comes in the next years so you should continue buy it.Using DCA methods, you will have more and more Bitcoin and you can buy Bitcoin constantly. While you buy Bitcoin, you can sell some Bitcoin if the price increase by suddenly.",

It has go up very fast with $1000 investment in January 2024 increasing by 120% in just one year. Those who invested in Bitcoin for longer time have seen even bigger returns. Like if we took look $1000 investment in 2020 so it would be worth 12 times more today and $1000 investment in 2013 would be worth amazing today. These numbers show that people who have held Bitcoin for long time have made a lot of money.
