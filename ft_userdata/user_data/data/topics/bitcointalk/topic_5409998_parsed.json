  "content": "QuoteLandfills are releasing large amounts of planet-warming methane gas into the atmosphere from the decomposition of waste and are a significant contributor to such emissions in urban areas, a study suggests.Scientists used satellite data from Delhi and Mumbai in India, Lahore in Pakistan and Buenos Aires in Argentina and identified specific locations in each city that persistently emit high methane levels, all of which were landfills. The cities' overall methane emissions from all sources were 1.4 to 2.6 times higher than previous estimates.The study, published in Science Advances on Wednesday, is aimed at helping local governments carry out targeted efforts to limit global warming by pinpointing specific sites of major concern.When organic waste like food, wood or paper decomposes, it emits methane into the air. Landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions globally, after oil and gas systems and agriculture.Although methane only accounts for about 11% of greenhouse gas emissions and lasts about a dozen years in the air, it traps 80 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide does. Scientists estimate that at least 25% of today's warming is driven by methane from human actions.\"This is the first time that high-resolution satellite images have been used to observe landfills and calculate their methane emissions,\" said Joannes Maasakkers, lead author of the study and atmospheric scientist at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research.\"We found that these landfills, which are relatively small compared to city sizes, are responsible for a large fraction of total emissions from a given area,\" he said.Satellite data to detect emissions is still a relatively new field, but it's being used more and more to observe gases across the world. It means more independent organizations are tracking greenhouse gases and identifying big emitters, whereas previously local government figures were the only source available.\"This new work shows just how important it is to manage landfills better, especially in countries like India where landfills are often on fire, emitting a wide range of damaging pollutants,\" said Euan Nisbet, an Earth scientist at Royal Holloway, University of London, who wasn't part of the study.Earlier this year, smoke hung over New Delhi for days after a massive landfill caught fire as the country was sweltering in an extreme heat wave with temperatures surpassing 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). At least two other landfill fires have been reported in India this year.Nisbet added that the newer satellite technology, combined with on-the-ground measurements, makes it easier for researchers to identify \"who is polluting the world.\"China and India are the world's biggest methane polluters, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.At last year's United Nations climate conference, 104 countries signed a pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels. Both India and China are not signatories.The authors plan to carry out more research into landfill sites across the world in future studies.\"It is a quickly developing field and we expect more interesting data to come out soon,\" said Maasakkers.https://phys.org/news/2022-08-satellite-landfills-methane-super-emitters.html....Here we have an interesting and seldom acknowledged facet of climate change: landfills generating significant quantities of methane. Which could be a more dangerous greenhouse gas in contrast to carbon emissions. Space X has devised one method of reducing damage to the environment: burning methane as a rocket fuel. Emissions produced by burning methane are less damaging to the planet than methane itself. Perhaps it could be feasible to hoist networks of air balloons over landfills to capture methane emissions. Which would then be burned as fuel. I think there are definitely crazier waste recycling ideas out there.Seeing as how many are overzealous in their climate change crusade. Enough so to negatively stigmatize PoW and the crypto mining industry. Perhaps they can be appeased by a stronger effort towards a carbon neutral society.",

Methane build up in landfills would be a fire hazard. I doubt they would want to contain or build up mass quantities of it, which could fuel a fire or explosion.Its been said that permafrost in the arctic and antarctic contain large amounts of methane which are released as temperatures rise, and ice at the poles, melt. The phenomenon is known as a methane burp:https://www.resilience.org/stories/2004-12-15/methane-burps-ticking-time-bomb/Unfortunately, we don't have satellites over the poles equipped with mass spectrometers to make rough estimates of how much methane is being released from melting permafrost. But it is possible that it is comparable or even larger than the amounts at landfills. As ice at the poles covers a significantly larger area, in terms of square miles.There's a long list of climate change topics which aren't receiving serious attention for whatever reason. And it is strange.",

There is no way to stop a landfill from producing gas, as long as it contains matter that is decomposing it will produce gas, the membranes are not for stopping gas, they are designed mainly to stop the flowing of the liquids that are generated through the process, the leachate to reach the groundwater, we use this even in farming for open-air manure pit, although..well...I can tell you a lot are done as they should just on paper, and this is even in Europe where we have tight regulations, god help us what happens elsewhere. The dome on top of the pile is not for restricting the gas, is for redirecting all gas through an already made opening from which it can either be collected and used or simply burned in some cases just like flaring.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 17, 2022, 02:51:06 PMLately there's some attention towards biodiesel, which is, from my understanding, exactly this.

      "body": "Upon checking scientific research, some papers focus on capturing and recovering CH4 or Methane and then have it stored in some storage. According to this Peter Englezos, the author of this paper,[1]. He said that it is feasible to recover CH4 from CH4/CO2 and then when it is separated, collect CO2 as well. Landfills probably contain both compounds and a mixture of them. It's important to have it collected and processed with low energy requirements as possible to provide the most efficient way with less harm to the environment. There are very few applications of low-carbon methane fuel for hypersonic propulsion[2].

The issue is the protective bubble that is covering Earth. If it's weakened while you have zero methane, there will still be the extreme heat problems. If the bubble is strong, even with the presence of methane, you won't have to worry about the extreme heat. The bubble should be strengthed...I'm not sure Methane weakens the bubble",

There are claims of over that period but those are just pockets of trapped gas.The best case scenario advertised for our brand new local ecobiogreennaturefriendly is 5 years with multiple layered waste, heavy recycling on-site, no direct dumping of food waste and use of incinerators, and so on and on, and a ton of money! The same advert claims it to be fully ready for other kinds of development, god knows what that might be, in 10 years.But I wouldn't want to be the one going around estimating how the landfill is doing even after 10 years, just carpet bomb the shit out of it and be done. My region has always grown both pigs and cattle intensively, we have hundreds of manure pits and I know tens of scary stories when even after one year some went full \"witness me!!!' with shovels to dig it out and barely managed to get alive when a pocket of hydrogen sulfide was punctured.Quote from: Kakmakr on August 18, 2022, 07:38:03 AMLivestock are responsible for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gases.
