I’m finding it clever they have also planned their platform for bitcoin based ATM.Considering their views on the official site, company is gonna make change in the crypto verse for sure.More here: https://global.hyosung-tns.com/be-inspired",

When you do know that, there are better rates provided on the exchange and do have knowledge about bitcoins and cryptocurrencies enough to actually get engaged in it then you should take a step back and look how beneficial this decision would be.Thus for me if I do have a chance of going to an ATM and purchasing, i would rather decline and look for exchanges, maybe it would be easier for the people who are having an account in the bank but might not have so many positive points for others.",

I do not think that the number of ATMs in my country reaches this number.Generally, unless the technology of these devices is developed to run on the Lightning Network, so that the fees are closer to zero and the possibility of withdrawing funds directly, the expansion of the spread is not the ideal solution.",

It's good news indeed. While bitcoin ATMs have been very huge in the United States, what we have here in the local countries are likely the opposite, maybe below 10 i guess. But anyways, this information is a very good news for all bitcoin enthusiasts as its giving us more chances to buy and sell a range of cryptocurrencies. Although it could be that its more expensive than just going in exchanges, but the convenience knowing the machine is already in front of you will always be effortless for us.",

Aside from the popularity that bitcoin is going to gain, next to it is the expectation that there will be more people who will start patronizing and buying bitcoin, not only for investment alone, but also it can be hold too for future usage. I just hope that now that a lot of bitcoin atm machines have arise, hopefully there will also be a lot of big stores who will start accepting bitcoin as a payment method.",
