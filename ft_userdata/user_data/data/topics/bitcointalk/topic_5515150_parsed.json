  "content": "I am just thinking: Yea, governments cannot print more Bitcoin. So yea, i am 'save from inflation'. But: they just tax my profits. That's basically the same?1. They print fiat. 2. Every rare good on earth rises in price. Also Bitcoin.But perhaps the buying-power keeps even exactly the same (cause everything costs more). Buying-power could even shrink while price rises in fiat terms. 3. But then they tax my 'profit', eg 28% Imagine i always hold my buying power because Bitcoin rises with inflation, but whenever i sell Bitcoin i gotta pay those eg 28% of my profits. Does it really matter if the state takes away my money by inflation or by taxes? Inflation makes it that basically your assets rise and rise in dollar terms, buying power stays the same, but i have 'high profits' that have to be taxed. I guess worst case i could imagine very high inflation, basically nearly all my principal is profit and then i get 40% taxed on it. Once Bitcoin is in late mayority of adoption stage i think there will be no more cracy gains, it will just be a bit better than gold, keeping up with inflation. The more inflation, the more taxes you pay. So basically eg with 40% tax you are only saved from around 60% of the fiat-inflation. Counter: I guess taxes are cheaper than inflation. (eg 30% tax means i guess you are saved from around 70% of the inflation) You only get taxed if you sell (unless they really go for taxing unrealized gains).I guess governments cannot practically rise taxes superhigh cause people flee the country or smth.I guess taxing crypto different then other asset classes hopefully doesn't fly. Stocks and real estate are also taxed, still people who hold stocks and real estate are doing much much better with inflation than non-holders.",

So rather than complaining about the tax percentage, out there there are countries that still set illegal laws against assets such as bitcoin.",

What he is saying is that those coins (bitcoin specifically) will not be taxed if you do not sell it. That is how taxes are as unrealized profits are not taxed.If you read about how rich men get richer, you will find out that what OP talked about is correct. Even rich men can go to the extent of borrowing money because they do not want to sell their property to pay tax because the interest rate on the money they borrow is less than the tax they want to pay if they sell their property.",

Now it is inflationary but its inflation rate is smaller than fiat currencies and the rate can not be changed by anyone, any government.About taxation, governments can tax their citizens but do you think higher tax rate on Bitcoin makes it the same like fiat currencies. I don't think so, honestly because purchasing power of Bitcoin increases with time, like its value growth, so it can outweigh tax rate on Bitcoin investment and gain while you will not get any profit by holding fiat currencies.Compares them in whatever criteria, Bitcoin is better than fiat currencies, not the same.",

But then they tax my 'profit', eg 28% I call that the non-deflated tax scam. To give an exaggerated example, let's suppose that in your country, as happened a couple of years ago, during one year inflation rises 10%. Let's also suppose that someone buys $100K in bitcoin and when the year ends sells it for $105K. The IRS will want to charge you 10% of that $5K of supposed profit when in reality, due to inflation caused by the government, the real purchasing power of the $105K is $94.5K and therefore you have not made any profit. This, moreover, is taking into account the official inflation data which is manipulated downwards, but well, we have to base it on something. In general a CPI of 10% is extraordinary and if it is maintained at an average of 3%, you will have made profits instead of losses, what happens is that they will be charging you more than they should according to the real purchasing power.",

At the same time, every time a user of the first cryptocurrency loses access to their bitcoins, their available number in the world decreases. In addition, there are now a large number of surrogate bitcoins in the world - all kinds of derivatives, wrapped bitcoins, etc. All of them devalue the real real bitcoin. Thus, traditional financiers \"rob\" real bitcoin holders. The government also \"robs\" bitcoin holders when it introduces taxation of bitcoin transactions or capital gains tax. The state did not participate in the creation of Bitcoin and its development, but now it wants to tax those who participated in the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This cannot be avoided. There are some economic theories that consider the state as a \"stationary bandit\".  All this is evil, which we cannot cancel. However, by studying financial literacy, it is possible to minimize the financial damage from such actions of states and those in power. Only we can do this - no one except us is interested in us making a profit.",

I think it's risky to rely on (under the radar) methods for handling Bitcoin because that can lead to legal problems and financial issues down the line. If we only focus on inflation, we might miss how tax policies impact the market. An increase in taxes could cut down the money we have for investing, which could slow down Bitcoin's adoption. This kind of economic uncertainty could create instability that hurts Bitcoin's value. So, we really need to take tax concerns just as seriously as inflation.",
