DNP3 said that his addiction began unexpectedly, and it quickly took a hold of him.DNP3 confessed to having spent all money he could find on a popular crypto gambling brand, chasing elusive big wins. “Even when the big wins did happen it wasn’t enough,” the streamer said. He admitted to having lost everything – including not only the investors’ funds but also his own savings.I knew this guy because i followed him on twitter on his philanthropist activities on the platform also on twitch, that was a year ago, i guess. And was surprised after reading this news. The act of using the investors funds without their consent is illegal in any way, worst if you gamble it all.Well, when gambling addiction hits you, no matter how rich or poor you are, this will be a possible illness to every gambler. That's why gambling moderately.I just read this news which has posted few days ago but never saw this topic on gambling related boards from 1-5 pages.

Desperation will never be a valid reason why you did such thing espwcially if it is concerning other's possessions. Given that he's a stremer and a crypto guru as he calls himself, he should be aware of the possible outcomes of what he did. Maybe he was too confident of his capabilities as a gambler but was not ready for it when unconsciously he used all of his assets first and started to use investors assets with hopes of turning or flipping the table in favor of his likeness but we all know that gambling does not work that way. This industry is full of uncertainties which should make it  needless to say why each gambler should be aware of what he is engaging himself with.",

I was just curious what kind of investment they do to him? That was really a risky move even though the streamer has a lot of followers you wouldn't know what will happen. I hope this would serve a lesson to many people. What happened to the streamer now? I am sure that the investors are in rage on what happened to their money. I was assuming that he is in jail now especially he admitted on what happened to him.",

It should be noted that self-control in gambling is only for those who are able to control their ambition not to chase victory. However, it cannot be denied that the pursuit of victory in gambling always comes unnoticed and applies to anyone.Regarding the use of funds, investors hoping to get a double win instead fall on the verge of a big loss. I think his addiction was quite severe because he had the courage to use the funds of investors who put their hope and trust in him. In the future, I am sure that DNP3 will not gain the trust of anyone to manage finances.",

No one should believe and trust unregulated person or company with their funds. In best scenario your funds could just be trashed through bad investment choices as well. People who work with money should definitely discipline themselves to stop their gambling habit. Results can be terrible in long run for both of you and your family, and same story can hit news.",

In my opinion, gambling with other people's money is the most reckless act and it doesn't matter what the reason is - gambling addiction, intoxication or something else. I believe that a person who has lost investor money should either pay it back or be punished by law. I hope he will answer for his actions before the law and will think before disposing of other people's money.",

Sometimes you make different excuses for yourself to continue what you are doing even though you know it's not good for you or you are going overboard. Self-control is easier said than done, it takes a lot of effort to get away from addiction. Most of the time we are not self-aware that we are starting to get addicted to something till it's too late. I've known a lot of people who haven't gambled till their late age and get addicted to it. Simply saying, gambling was intended to be a source of entertainment however, people find it as a way to earn easy money and end up ruining their life.",

It's not possible that he spent all investors money on gambling, he must have used some for personal purposes. It's unfair how they're no trusts available in this space and how people rush to blame gambling for their failure to secure investors' money. He needs to payback affected people, sorry won't add a thing to their account or recover the lost money. He must have gotten addicted to gambling, but that doesn't help in explaining things to responsible people. It's nobody's business if he lost his own money at the course of his selfish interest to gain more profits out of people's money. My advise for investors is to forget about Influencers and work with genuine businesses that has lasted the test of time. A major part of Influencers online not only on twitch has derailed investors into believing that cryptocurrency is filled with untrustworthy people.",
