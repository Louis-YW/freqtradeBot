  "content": "I imported a 1994 Mitsubishi Delica L400 Exceed from the UK and I want to sell it for crypto to avoid tax. Asking price is 5.26ETH or 0.32BTC. Registered in FL.I'll be driving from Florida to South Dakota via Texas and Colorado. If you live between any of these states, please get in touch to arrange a viewing.It's done just under 200,000 km (125,000 miles) and been registered previously in the UK, Portugal, Armenia, Russia and Japan. Nonetheless, it drives perfectly. I just replaced the CV boot, roll bar drop link, glow plugs and fuel injector so it won't need any attention for a while. Welding was done by the previous owner. It has a factory limited slip differential which is very rare and makes it the ultimate off-roading vehicle. The suspension has ironman 4x4 springs and a lift so it feels like you're driving around in a monster truck.Photos in link. It's a beautiful vehicle looking for a new home in the USA.https://imgur.com/a/vfqdnDj",

You can't really avoid it regardless of how you pay for the vehicle as it's typically assessed at the time of registration. But that's usually buyer's problem.There is capital gains tax, which is quite common these days given the crazy prices on used cars. But again, it doesn't matter how one gets paid for the car. If you made a profit - you have to pay the tax. Adding Bitcoin to the mix just complicates things because both the car sale and the Bitcoin sale are separate tax events.

I've seen people write a lower price on the bill of sale but that carries other risks (for example if the deal goes south, you have recourse only to the extent of the bill of sale value).Usually not worth the risk for a few hundred bucks.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 02, 2022, 03:55:23 PMMaybe he can register this car in some other countries like Mexico if he wants to avoid paying high extortion fees (just a crazy idea).Like DireWolfM14 mentioned, there are states without sales tax but registering a car there usually requires proof of residence, which also costs money to fake.In the end you're saving like $800 on a $10000 used car... for most people it's not worth the hassle and the criminal repercussions.And all that is applicable only to person-to-person sales, which is probably like 1% of car sales in the US. Dealerships will roll the tax into your 10-year loan along with $50k of negative equity from the previous vehicle and off you go",
