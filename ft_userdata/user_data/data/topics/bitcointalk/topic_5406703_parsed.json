  "content": "Group-buy2: please express interest in this thread or via PM.Note: Individually distributed shipping can be done (as per group-buy1: several units need to be ordered; iPollo will be deciding this, we simply convince them with total order size).I propose to host them. Please see hosting thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407422.0Group-buy2; pending[?] units, $x/unitOrder: n/aShipment: n/aGroup-buy1; completed:25 units, $269/unit.Order: paidShipment: shipped & received. Payment for customs will be handled after (roughly $50/unit), for units destined to be hosted by me.This project is hinged on supporting the Grin network: http://grin.mw/Group-buy1: ipollo.com, the G1/G1-mini manufacturer, has agreed to $269/unit at 25 MOQ. Direct from iPollo remains the best option.Group-buy2: In discussion...== Original idea: ==I've pondered an idea recently. Setting up home-suitable miners securing the Grin network (grin.mw) on best-found cheap electricity (<0.15-0.20 CHF/kwH in Switzerland). Then, small hosting locations which would have 10's of machines at minimum, and eventually a main hosting center where electricity is cheapest (under 10 cents). By this stage, larger more efficient miners could be purchased.Now some quick numbers (note I like to use 'calm' estimations / 10 months may already be a 'long' term for this network in terms of price/miningpower/organic coin-being-used growth).Dividends paid weekly, in grin/btc/fiat?, as per the ratio of mining-power-share:income. So 1 token representing 1 miner or 1 unit of power (for example: 1 token = 1 Gps edit: 1 miner), and if it brought in +350/4.33weeks  (350 grin rough revenue monthly for a G1 mini from iPollo pool mining as per my evidence) = +80 grin/week = at current price that's $5 or 28'000 sats roughly (350 sats/grin). So then, consider a cost of <$300 (after bulk discounts) per miner, landed and running in Switzerland.Let's say the supplier agrees at $260/unit. At current price that's 0.0145BTC equivalent. Or 4'000 grin equivalent. That means each miner would earn the equivalent in 50 weeks (ceteris paribus, again, if total network mining power remains stable through a year, which I doubt, 8-10kGps right now coming from big removals of power since a few months/2 years). The machine is 'paid for' in approx. 1 year (there is a part of this venture which is hinged on grin's appreciation or success in general too).Some coin info (which is 3 years old) as of OP time:Algorithm:   cuckAToo32GRIN network hashrate:   8.5089 KH/sGRIN difficulty:   199.1559MGRIN block reward:   60.00 (every minute)GRIN 24h volume:   856,123.33 USDPrice for 1 GRIN:   0.0629 USD",

I doubt there would be a long-term contract, if at all in this case, just an investment of capital upfront for return over the following year(s). Costs associated would be factored in. The advantage here is the fact I could access low-cost electricity/hosting locations, of which there exists 100s of places, especially since the machines are designed discretely enough to be installed in a residential setting (apartments, local shops, houses). As an example, I know of one home-owner who could direct excess power from solar toward a miner; roughly doubling their monthly revenue from their usually-sold-back-to-grid energy. .. and interesting, now that you mention it: I can look to propose a 1-3+ miners/month 'buyback', at a rate to be determined, with my own funds. This means by the end of 12 months I would have purchased back 12-36 units. I don't think hardware maintenance will be too significant - but yes, a x% fee deducted from earnings could cover this. Likewise, I'll have to consider new mining generations being released in the next year/two. A reinvestment fund equally could be set up, to avoid being diluted out.I still need to find more info re: specs on the chips, I'll send their support a message. I've done some searches but the chip details are elusive.",

What you miss out on is the discount with a group-buy (10-20%) and the potential to have it mine at a home/shop-host with utilities included in rent. They would accept a %/x fee, adding to mining profitability.",

To be confirmed, but I would believe that we could have a portion of miners from this group-buy shipped directly to the US. I've written you down tentatively for 3 units. I'll follow-up once I've had the chance to discuss with a sales representative I was put in touch with.===The fact that these machines are relatively quiet+low-heat had me see how appealing it could be for the retail sector (especially plug&play home-miners).I've had 1 miner operational since a couple weeks now, no issues thus far.===@jackg as you shared with me, according to https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/ipollo/g1, the chip size is 12nm.

Re: hosting some buyers' miners, I've had the idea: mining revenue would arrive straight to miner-owners' addresses. They would then send each week/month, an amount according to a pre-determined rate. I am looking to calculate some reasonable figures.Also, I am still ready to confirm monthly unit buy-backs.
