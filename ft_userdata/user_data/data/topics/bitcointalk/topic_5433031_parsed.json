There may be many good things about this forum and there may be many bad things which people may say about it, but believe me, this is the best forum to discuss anything related to bitcoin and crypto currencies. Even the sections like Politics and off-topic have some indept discussions which you won't find any other forum.The reason is that people here are always willing to reply you in detail and express their point of view.",

And even after the Merit system makes this forum cleaner than spam. because everyone is putting more effort into improving the quality of their posts.not everyone has the original goal of making money from these forums. because many newbies enter this forum initially to learn bitcoin and altcoins. because I'm like that too. and earning from signature is a bonus. and become another motivation besides Merit. To be honest my horizons have expanded after getting to know this Forum. I even know the term DCA and various other investment techniques from reading the discussions on this forum. even bitcoin related news always arrives faster in this forum. so that knowledge about the latest news becomes faster in this forum. coupled with the discussion afterward about the news being talked about makes us more thorough before absorbing the existing news content.",

While a lot actually do come on here to make some money, I’d also like to think that the majority of people that find their way to the Bitcointalk forum come here looking for information and to interact with other people about bitcoin. They come looking for information, receive loads and loads of it and would obviously decide to stay. I think the forum is really accommodating as it began originally to talk about bitcoin but grew to accommodate other discussions and boards as well. It accommodates everyone also. The people on here are also matured and there is mutual respect between members. Everyone is free to be themselves. About earning, you’ve just got to first contribute and be a meaningful participant in the forum. Only then would you be eligible to earn some money. You get to learn new stuff and contribute what you know and earn while doing it. A win win",

I initially did not want to join a Signature Campaign ever.  But it comes to a point where you ask yourself.  What am I winning by missing out on this chance.  If others consider my posts be worth something and I can earn something from it, by denying an offer I am only missing out on it and some body else will take the position.All good posters probably thought about this at one point.  But I rather see good posters occupying Campaign positions instead of members posting useless replies and threads.  The Bounty Campaigns were producing enough spam already.You can be a good poster and still be in a Signature Campaign.  I do not think these two are tied in any way.  You just continue doing what ever you did before.  The difference is you now earn something off it too.But I believe this only applies to Campaigns with flexible rules.  If you have a fixed minimum number of posts per week to be paid.  Or have to post a minimum amount of replies in a particular board.  Or the number of boards your posts are counted in is very limited.  Things change.  Members of the Campaign will start posting irrelevant replies to fulfill their weekly paycheck requirements.My advice is.  Only stay on this forum if you have legitimate interest in Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies.  If you are here for weekly payments.  You will have a hard time earning.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "I stumbled across this forum through a google search when the 2017 xMas hype was big on bitcoin. Finding forums good repositories of Q&As in other contexts, I probably searched for \"bitcoin forum\" or \"best bitcoin forum\" at the time, and was promptly redirected to Bitcointalk.Being novel to all this, I had loads of questions in my mind, though I normally, as a habit, try to obtain the answers by reading thoroughly through, rather than formulating the questions straight off, gathering more context in the event. I guess I found plenty of pointers here, as looking over my initial posts, they weren’t very question centered (I did get distracted by altcoins for a while it seems).I have looked over other forums briefly, and occasionally visit one or two in other languages, normally to contrast something local with other opinions in order to get a broader view, but the sheer volume of information on Bitcointalk is a retainer. One does though need to learn to separate the wheat from the chaff, and develop a kind of sense of what is more meaningful, credible, from whom, and persist in the habit of contrasting information.",

I've not read of an old article or project about bitcoin and didn't come across bitcointalk. The forum has been here serving many people who have interest in cryptocurrency, even the big influencers on twitter like hodlonaut once referred in his tweet the fun of the bitcointalk forum.

Bitcointalk has been able to stay this long and improving because of contributions from members of the Forum starting with the founder Satoshi Nakamoto and other awesome members.  Yep. Satoshi Nakamoto created this forum, but I think the most reason why this forum can survive and continue improving is the loyalty and dedication of the forum staff (admins, moderators). Also, there are some great members who support the improvement of this forum both giving suggestions and creating software, data, or other things.Quote from: I_Anime on January 04, 2023, 06:40:30 PMSo my advice for we Newbies is start thinking of a way of improving this forum first before earning. The first thing to do by newbies is to obey the forum rules/regulations. It is one of the most important things to do. Many newbies forget this and only focus on improving post quality or earning money from bounties/campaigns.Always read the pinned posts before posting on any board!!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703657.0",
