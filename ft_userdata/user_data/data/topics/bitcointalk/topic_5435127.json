They ignore the role btc is playing in economic and social aspect of life. What better ways to fully gain better understanding than being taught in the school. Other universities that are now offering cryptocurrency courses include Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford University, National University of Singapore, Cornell University, and University of California Berkeley.BTC is definitely gaining grounds and this is the best way of creating awareness and pushing adoption. Hopefully, other countries universities will follow up. Sources:-  Unlock@Cryptocurrency_Inside",
