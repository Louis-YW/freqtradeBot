Now maybe the window of opportunity.\"Buy Bitcoin, You'll Thank Yourself In The Future” is a book intended for anyone considering buying Bitcoin as a strategic investment to hold on to for at least 10 years.The book looks at opinions for and against buying Bitcoin.

More like a collectible or commodity.” Satoshi NakamotoIt's possible you may look back in the future and say “I bought Bitcoin, I thank myself I did”.Why did you write the book?“The purpose of writing the book, and also setting up the accompanying website is to show and give confidence to someone looking to dip their toes into buying and or holding (hodling) Bitcoin.”Who is the book aimed at?“The book is aimed at someone with no knowledge of Bitcoin or someone with a little knowledge. It is also aimed at someone that is interested and curious how Bitcoin could be an investment for the long term. Someone looking for a catalyst or a primer to help them on their journey of learning about Bitcoin.”What is the purpose of the book?“This comes back to the first question. The purpose of the book is to impart a few years of non programming, general Bitcoin knowledge to the reader, which can potentially give confidence to someone looking to buy and hold Bitcoin. It took me about 12 months to gain confidence before I eventually bought Bitcoin. The learning curve is steep.”If you would like a free PDF copy of the book, please use the contact form:https://bbcdsatoshi.com/Contact/",

If it is written by the same person then what is the proof behind it that both person are the same? That person is using the name of Satoshi for marketing purpose. Someone like Satoshi Nakamoto would never write a book on Bitcoin because he has already done his work in the form of whitepaper. This guy is using old tactics to trap the innocent people. He is promoting it in this forum because he thinks that people here are so crazy about Bitcoin that they will buy any material without any research. @OP if you can prove that this book is written by original Satoshi Nakamoto, then can you please share the source that where has he shared this book, and how you got your hands on it? Now please don't say that you are Satoshi, trust me nobody will accept that statement.",

It's like coming to a jewellers forum where they discuss different smelting methods and offer them a pamphlet why investing in bullion coins makes sense for their future fortune.In other words, you sell wishful thinking.Quote from: shasan on April 15, 2023, 02:31:51 PMAnyway according to the title the book has been written by Satoshi. Not Satoshi but \"BBCD Satoshi\". It is like \"Bitcoin\" and \"Bitcoin Cash\" or \"Bitcoin Gold\".",
