Price of BTC/difficulty etc..this is why I make you name the price, however, you can tell me I will go for one month only so you stick to the price you give on monthly basisMay I ask you why you don't use Nicehash or Mining Rig Rental ?I tried but they are not as professional as it looked from outside.. also you will never ever be able to contact the miners themself while here maybe I can buy your whole mining farm at some point or maybe we can develop something together.. Also I don't like nicehash bid and 10 days idea.. I like peace of mind we agree on a price and that's it.. also if someone should benefit from more than the actual mining returns if I'm paying extra I think that bitcointalk community are the ones who deserve it not connections through a marketplace we know nothing about",

You should at least use some escrow to secure your money.Nice offer by the way, for me this is too much hassle , not worth it unless I can make something like 0.0033 btc per petahash / day, If you end up not finding better offers you can reach out to me.",

The first batch was just a test seeing if I can for real rent here in bitcointalk instead of nicehash and others but 10th of may launch would be more professional focusing on making real money so I consider the $1800+ I paid for the first batch test as a dead money.While its not fully dead as it helped me reach this at the end: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5237323.msg62082336#msg62082336which I could have spent more before I get this strategy to remain always profitable with a certain amount of focus and luck. I will be gaining 30% on every 1 BTC I spent as a solo miner even after paying with high price.",

Going through MRR if the operator cuts and runs you get your unused portion of the funds back.If you go private and they run you are stuck. That is one of the only good things about paying the extra percentages to MRR (and nicehash).Not your mom, not trying to tell you how to do things, but after being here for years I have seen a lot of things go bad and not always someones fault, just something happened and halfway through a deal fell apart.For any 'real' amount of money, and that amount will vary person to person.
