If you don't mind, just give me a go ahead.Thank you for your interest in trying to help me. In fact, I needed that amount of bitcoin two days ago to be able to try the mixinsafe app as part of the review campaign that has been launched a while ago, and I was surprised that the fees for withdrawing bitcoins from Binance cost a lot, so I thought of doing the exchange here on the forum. Unfortunately, I did not receive a response from anyone at the same time that my phone screen was damaged, so I got an extension in the review preparation period to the 15th of this month. Tomorrow I will receive my weekly payment from the signature campaign of which I am a member, and this will enable me to complete what I have been going through.Thank you once again for your concern, and I will not hesitate again to ask one of you for help if I need it in the future. I will close this topic now.",
