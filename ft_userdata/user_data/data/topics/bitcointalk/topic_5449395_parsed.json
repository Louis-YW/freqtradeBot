Money makes ones pride to be too arrogant, sometimes humble people stirs up arrogance as they begins to staunch into dollars. Politician controls elections from afar with money with appearing on any scene.Not having money is like not having life in you, maybe a walking corpse. Society only respect people who has a name and that name is money without it your fine name is useless. I watch Manchester City match where one of the most popular Africa musician name, Wizkid.

Money is good but get it with good works, don't kill or steal to get it.",

      "body": "In regards to this particular topic, yes its true money is the most valuable commodity in life after life itself. But I think money is over-rated in some societies of the world more than it is in others and justifiably so.Take for instance in some countries of Africa where making money is a do or die affair, which however is motivated by lack of good governance. Everybody either want to make money to at least survive or make money to prove a point.  Compare this scenario to the western society where  there are many channels of survival giving room for little or no do-or-die...Money Most times becomes a hundred percent factor for recognitions.In reference to your point concerning Wizkid at Etihad, I've also seen a case where a poor fan of a particular club is suffering with or dies with an llness, and during a match the club recognizes such individual with a stattement or gesture which scarsely happens in our own local football events. My point is that in some good societies attention is also given to a voice of reasoning without the influence of money more than it is given in other unfortunate poorly governed soieties Meanwhile, money is worth the chase because it answers all things but respect to the point that one shouldn't kill or steal to get it",

But I agree on this one;Quote from: Frankolala on April 20, 2023, 05:44:28 PMMoney is not everything, this is where you got it wrong. You must not be rich for you a be happy,a healthy and peaceful mind is rich. If you see money as everything, this will make you put money first in your life and you can be misled by friends easily into doing dirties for money.Definitely, it's not everything and I do agree with that. Our local politics requires a lot of money to run for the office. Still, a lot of people don't understand why these politicians are spending a lot of money for their campaigns just to get elected when their salaries are publicly known to be not so high.",

Money makes ones pride to be too arrogant, sometimes humble people stirs up arrogance as they begins to staunch into dollars. Politician controls elections from afar with money with appearing on any scene.Money is powerful and influences everything around us. But this is an abnormality because this shouldn't be the case. The reason why money seems to control everything is because of greed and materialism that have taken hold of human existence. People sell their consciences and lose their sense of reasoning because of money. Humility is a cultivated virtue that has no respect for poverty or wealth. If a poor man becomes suddenly arrogant because of money, then he was never humble. I have seen many rich people that are extraordinarily humble and many people who are poor and proud. Politicians can use the money to sponsor their campaigns but using it to influence the election through bribing and vote buying is not an action that is caused by money. The reason for that is that they are unpopular and corrupt and aware that they will lose the elections if it is free and fair.QuoteNot having money is like not having life in you, maybe a walking corpse.

I don't also think I need international or national recognition to live a fulfilled and happy life. Everybody will not be an international superstar but there are opportunities to contribute positively to your society. You have the chance to be a good son, a  responsible father, and  a good citizen of your community or country. Don't quantify your success with how much you have but with how useful you are to yourself, family and your community.",

These are not empty words; in order to achieve something big in life, you must be physically strong and pursue it while it is still in its infancy. Money has the ability to manipulate people, whether they are good or bad. People often remark it has a spirit that only a few can stand up to. Those who get it and can't handle it usually end up losing everything again. Despite the extravagant lifestyle that comes with money, contentment is the key. If you're never satisfied with what you have, you'll suffer greatly and lose even what little you have. Money is not everything in some circumstances; you don't need money to buy some of life's quality characters; you can only acquire it by how you interact with others. Even while money is good and has a lot of power, I believe it isn't all one needs to have the wonderful life they've ever dreamt.",
