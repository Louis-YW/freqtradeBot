  "content": "I am selling my Pi Crypto Wallet. Pi Crypto Currency is a new coin which allows users to mine it easily, from any device. Over the last two years I have acquired about 360 Pi Coins now worth $9000 total. In December of 2022, they were worth over $100,000, but currently the ability to buy and sell the coin on an open exchange doesn’t exist. It is my understanding that within the next few months to a year, this will become available as the Pi team has expressed this and makes platform updates often. Please let me know if you are interested in purchasing my wallet from me outright. I will provide you with my information for my Pi Account. I have not identified myself within the account meaning you can assign your identity once it is purchased. Please reach me at +1 (510) 775-3922 or cole.nash@gmail.com or direct message if interested",
