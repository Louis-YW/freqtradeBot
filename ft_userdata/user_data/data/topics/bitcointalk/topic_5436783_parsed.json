Im pretty sure airdroppers had dump their apt long time ago when the release of tokens have been made.

But, they're right that this is mostly a move of the whales trying to get some profit and will send the price down afterwards.",

Or is it because thisproject is new or something ? Frankly I don't get why Aptos is so important, but I'm open minded, and willing to listen.I guess I should note that in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, there are many projects with similar technology and goals, and it can be challenging for new projects to stand out and gain traction. It's also worth noting that the cryptocurrency market is highly speculative and price movements may not always reflect the underlying technology or fundamentals of a project. Some projects may see sudden price increases due to market speculation or hype, rather than any fundamental developments or advancements in their technology. IMO, Aptos is just one more project among hundreds of projects that basically promise more of the same.Having that said, it's always a good idea to do your own research before investing in any cryptocurrency project. This includes understanding the project's technology, its team, its community, and its overall potential.",

Why is Aptos special ? What does it bring to the space that otherL1 projects can not offer ?For me Aptos is a whale coin. If i remember correctly, then the team behind Aptos has raised more than 400 Million $ from the big VC's. One of them was Alameda (FTX), that is also the reason why the Aptos coin lost a lot of value when the events around FTX unfolded a few weeks ago. Now that everything is recovering again projects that have lost harder than the average before just gain more than the average.In addition to that though i also think that whales are manipulating the Aptos price. I read somewhere that the first big token unlock of the VC's is happening in a few months or so and that is why they are pumping the price now. As a small investor i would not touch Aptos until all the seed and private sale tokens are unlocked.",

In fact, I'd never see any reason why Aptos has been in this situation, it is probably because of manipulation happened. But you are right, things like this have only a short life, they drop again and even will collapse totally. A thing like this is very risky to invest with, we have to exert caution when investing coins that are in pump especially if they are new projects and have no working products.",

(source Coindesk)Also rising interest in this project is also related into an 3 steps upgrade, to be completed within Q1 this year, which will improve network efficiency and will significantly reduce gas fees.And even if it is true that sometimes traction generates more tractions by itself I dont' think the two things mentioned above can justify the staggering increase in token prices on their own: in my opinion there is surely something most people ignore about the real reason of it.",

That project was still new and there was no a pump that ever happened before. that is how crypto market is working. Sometime a new token will be pumped so high after it was getting dumped but yeah it will come back again to the its low price in the future.

      "body": "I think Aptos pumping could be as a result of the following: First, prominent personalities and institutions invested heavily in the Aptos project, so basically, this will attract more individuals as well as more institutions to key in, buy/invest in the project which will make the value to go up. Secondly, Aptos technology promises to execute faster transactions when compared to that of Ethereum (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/), as well as other unique qualities - this will equally attract more investors as well as more exchanges. Exchange like Pancakeswap, have also keyed in to AptosÂ  ecosystem, and many more crypto institutions are keying in. Another reason could be the recovery from FTX collapse since Sam Bankman-Friedâs FTX was a supporter of Aptos project. Aptos project is backed by key engineers and crypto experts some of whom were formerly Facebookâs Diem blockchain engineers. All these have the possibility to attract attention to Aptos project leading to a spike on the value, just my humble opinion.",

Those coins that are currently traded on the market are not enough to meet the demand for APT. Even the first unlock of coins could not meet the demand and the price of the coin continued to increase. In this case, the price of the coin may increase many times until the demand equals the supply.",

But in my opinion, if you want to invest in altcoins, you should choose new and potential projects instead of old ones. Already invested in altcoins, the risk is almost the same, but the return on new altcoins will always be more profitable, they are easier to pump than the older altcoins with large caps. There is still an investment opportunity with APT because the real bull season is yet to come, but let's ignore it for the next bear season, that's how I invest in altcoins.",

The next token unlocks will be in November 2023, but so far there are very few tokens on the market. This is an airdrop and some ecosystem tokens. According to analytics, more than 95% of all available tokens are on 20 wallets, but there are also exchanges in this list. The greed of the manipulators can raise the price to the maximum values, and in November there will be a sale of the tokens that are being compromised.",
