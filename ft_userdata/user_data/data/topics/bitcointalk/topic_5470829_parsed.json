  "content": "AdGuard - The Hidden Gem of Ad BlockersIn a world filled with flashy tech products vying for your attention, it's easy to overlook the humble ad blocker. But blocking ads is more crucial than ever, and one under-the-radar app does it better than the rest: AdGuard.AdGuard flies under the radar compared to more well-known ad blockers like uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus. But dig deeper and you'll find a powerful tool packed with useful features lacking in competitors.First, AdGuard goes beyond basic ad blocking. It also blocks tracking, malvertising, phishing, and more threats. This provides a major security boost you won't find in most ad blockers.Second, AdGuard handles ads system-wide, not just in your browser. It blocks ads in apps and games on iOS and Android too. This consistent ad-free experience across devices is invaluable.Third, AdGuard uses significantly less memory and CPU than other leading ad blockers. The lightweight build optimizes performance, especially on mobile. It's snappy and responsive even when blocking ads everywhere.Despite the robust feature set, AdGuard retains an intuitive interface. Options are clear and easy to tweak for your preferences. You can enable, disable, whitelist, and customize various blocking capabilities with a few taps.Overall, AdGuard brings a polished ad blocking experience lacking in competition. Powerful performance, efficient builds, and intuitive controls make it the hidden gem of ad blockers. If you want a peaceful web free of annoying ads and trackers, this underrated app deserves your attention.That's my reviewing after using AdGuard for a year. Before it I used AdBlocker, AdBlock Plus and some others. But none of them can compare to AdGuard when it comes to the comprehensive features, system-wide blocking, performance optimization, and intuitive interface that AdGuard provides.",

Addon can not do that effectively, because large antivirus companies have millions of users, with good databases. Tracking is blocked with browser, if you have good browser, which also have millions of user, so tracking is developed.Second, forum users mostly use desktops and laptops, therefore iOS and Android ad blocking for them is not important.Third, less memory and CPU using nowadays for addon is not important in Windows/Linux.Plus, UBlock origin is much more popular, because it is free, and have localised lists for each country.The only real and big advantage with AdGuard is stealth mode for Youtube, if it will work.",
