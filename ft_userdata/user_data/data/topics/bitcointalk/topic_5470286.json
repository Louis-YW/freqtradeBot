They are not accepting BTC (and a few other cryptocurrencies) directly but instead via Bitpay but its still a good thing for bitcoin when probably the most legendary car manufacturer decided to accept it even through a 3rd party.For now its only for US market but they plan to expand it to Europe too. Quote from: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ferrari-accept-crypto-payment-its-cars-us-2023-10-14/Ferrari (RACE.MI) has started to accept payment in cryptocurrency for its luxury sports cars in the U.S. and will extend the scheme to Europe following requests from its wealthy customers, its marketing and commercial chief told Reuters.Ferrari said the decision came in response to requests from the market and dealers as many of its clients have invested in crypto.\"Some are young investors who have built their fortunes around cryptocurrencies,\" he said. \"Some others are more traditional investors, who want to diversify their portfolios.\"",

Imho, its a good marketing move as crypto millionaires are usually connected with lambos (which I thought is overblown until I visited Dubai) so why not try to get into that market too?

Hell, few years ago I bought my father a car with bitcoin money (not Ferrari ofc lol but a decent Nissan) and I am far from rich so you can imagine what those who have millions (and often lack of brain) do with crypto money.",

You think? Sure, not every Bitcoin holder is dreaming about blowing their stash on a shiny new Ferrari. But you can't deny there are definitely some enthusiasts who love spending on extravagant toys. At the same time, it's important to remember that even today, a ton of high-end buys still happen with untraceable cash - for various reasons you know? I was reading that something like 10% of new luxury car sales in America are straight up cash money and  so bitcoin offers more convenience there, letting people bypass the banks as middlemen.Quote from: pooya87 on October 14, 2023, 07:01:30 AMIn fact I believe the same problem existed with Tesla and I believe this was the real reason why Musk removed the bitcoin payment option not the nonsense he said about the energy consumption.Mask is a well-known manipulator who consistently prioritizes his own interests.

Bitpay is a hosted payment processor, not self hosted payment processor e.g. BTCPay where you don't need to fulfill KYC.

I do think it's good news and I see more sense for those who can afford it to pay for a Ferrari with Bitcoin than to pay for coffees. As for the difference between Ferrari and Tesla, I would say that whoever can afford the Ferrari is so rich that probably yes he will be inclined to pay for the Ferrari with Bitcoin after a good rise in bull market. A Tesla is more middle class and undoing an investment such as Bitcoin to pay for a liability that depreciates does not make much sense but the Ferrari is upper class, people whose assets generate profits that exceed their level of consumption.
