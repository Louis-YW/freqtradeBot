Hi thanks for your help, I already got tron, would try this some other times when I need to trade tron again. The trc 20 network is quite a pain in the ass, wondering why both tron and usdt has same address, but contains different currency and I'm being warned not to send usdt to the same address meant for tron. While they're both the same.",
