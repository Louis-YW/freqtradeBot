This sounds pretty weird because if players can upgrade their horses, it's closer to car racing than horse racing.It is true that at the moment there are a lot of games to bet on, but every sport is very random, so I believe that artificial intelligence will never be able to pass this barrier.It's possible he'll be able to get close to it with quantum computers, but we still don't know that yet.As for the metaverse, there will definitely be casinos, but I'm not sure if it will be much different from the current \"live casinos\".",

Is there a point when \"fine'tuning\" or upgrading stops before betting commences? As long as they cannot make adjustments 2 seconds before the race begins, it sounds like it would be fair across the board. Last second adjustments would seem shady IMO.",

I am not sure if I am getting it right but are you talking about betting on AI horses in the metaverse ?If yes then I don't think it would be fair if people are able to tune/upgrade their horses because that would given them an unfair advantage.There should be some kind of lock-in before the race where no changes can be done and the upgrades should be public.So that others are able to see what upgrades others have done so that they can do it too and keep the race fair.Still not sure on what basis the horses will win though.",

That does sound like a simulated game and the population who bet on horse races would never accept it as an alternative to physical horse racing. To them the event and its crowd with the excitement is what that matters along with the money invested in. Maybe it will find a niche among the people who started their gambling exposure with online betting not the ones before that.QuoteDo you think that gambling have a place with the metaverse in the future?

Yeah the automated play out of things with AI is what makes many think AI is the right tool to use in gambling but even with all the positive results recorded by AI development and usage in games it still does not appeal to me that much knowing fully well the limitation of thos bots and the failure to make changes in second to start of the game or during games section. And I am also sure gambling sites already are aware of this new development and there will do everything possible to keep all parties fair and game outcomes uninfluenced.AI is drawn at by many since it's void of human efforts, so too. make good use of this development there is a need for human involvement the highest that I can use AI is to analyze games and then after using it to make my own decisions during the games, so at that I could make the right adjustment and increase or adjust my game sections.",

Probably the outcome of the game has already been set, regardless of how those horses perform at the middle of the race. That‚Äôs why AI gambling seems not valid and not worth my bet.",

You can't really research computer program horses, or if you could crack that, the code would be really bad.Technically you can call the online betting \"metaverse betting\" already.

Cool, I didn't check that ZED.run yet but by the sound of it, it seems like we become an online rancher. Or like the kind of small robots we use to play called Tamagotchi only this time we breed an online horse. I'm guessing you can feed the horse and let it drink a particular made-up vitamin for it to run faster and all. In short, you can modify its behavior to win a race.

And if things continue in this manner in no distant time we will see more improved development that could solve some of the challenges faced with using bots and provide a better way to interact with the bot during the game session.",
