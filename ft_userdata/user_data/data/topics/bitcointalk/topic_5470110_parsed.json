      "body": "Before anything else, can I affirm you did some basic troubleshooting in your attempts?- the ID this time has not expired- images and its text are clear- all four corners of the ID can be seen- information on the form matches with the ID (if any)- no multiple attempts in a very short period of timeIf so, what about asking their support? what did they say?I've no idea if this exist in bitstamp but some exchanges have a manual verification in case their automated verification does not work. Try to see if you can request it if everything else fail however, I would imagine it would take long",

The old ID has an expiration date and when reached they froze the account asking for new ID.Yes, I was aware but was thinking of a re-verification or some sort as that's typically what I see when it comes to updating KYC information in exchanges.Quote from: corevall on October 12, 2023, 09:29:22 PMI am not making this post lightly.

Been on this for months now.For the sake of discussion, could you share your conversation with their support as well (blur sensitive information)? and might as well move this to Scam Accusations board.But that sounds horrible. I'm assuming you've already sent another email to bitstamp addressing their past actions--how it's just going in circles? Unfortunately, I don't have any other suggestions aside from making noise in crypto communities.",
