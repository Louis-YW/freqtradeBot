They swap investor's tokens and don't swap airdropped tokens because this will make airdropped tokens obsolete and not \"affect the price of their token\" in their imagination since airdrop hunters usually just tend to sell off most of the time.Other times, the tokens are just usually scam and token swap is just an excuse.",

To some projects before, there are really investments which became better when they do this procedure because of smaller transaction fees and ofcourse, faster. But mist of the time, as everyone have mentioned in this topic, it is just an excuse that the project did not meet its expected 'success'. This is also evident to some of the p2e projects at this moments wherein they are changing their mother token to again attract investors, once the first one never did an impression to the market.",

      "body": "Token swap is just another term for salvaging a project that proved to be a failure. Most crypto teams do this in hopes that a new token would help them overhaul what their project is which will in turn, attract new investors or old investors to reconsider the token once more. Kinda like a breath of fresh air, except that it's the same old thing facelifted to make it look fresh and new. I don't buy the idea behind token swaps, but it obviously works because a lot of people still buy them even though they know it's the same thing.",

They will dump their tokens and then once the tokens didn't have enough liquidity, it will make the price to go down instantly. I have been learning from so many cases about that, it seems like this time the developers were always picking the token swap as an answer to avoid the airdrop participants. They were also using this for not to paid the participants. yeah this is that i have seen a lot including me as well i usually sell right away money that i got from airdrop or bounty for hard cash money unless the coin is really have potential",

If they did an airdrop to some or incentivized bounty and renounced a swap and only investors tokens were swap then thats bullshit. Its also paet od the tokenomics and obviously deceiving on part of the community. Yes it is free but thats why there is logical attachement to those airdrops. It help marketings and also boost conifidence of the project. If they done that then surely a lot of negative comment on them.",

My question is why do some Altcoin project do Token Swap?indirectly they don't want users of airdrop tokens to dump on exchanges, usually projects like that always have strange reasons while what happens is their own team dumps them until the price drops, better leave projects like that they don't value you as a holder of tokens airdrop instead of changing new contracts and performing swaps or migrations that are only available to investors",

They want to make people believe that there's something good to happen on their token and token swap is part of development happening on their project then the price would pump after that. They want to try to increase their volume by this way and this nothing to do with those airdrop participants.",

My question is why do some Altcoin project do Token Swap?Hmm so far i have only heard about token swaps that needed to happen because a project was finally able to roll out their own blockchain so you could finally swap your Ethereum-token for example for the real native token that is running on the new blockchain. Another cause for a token swap would be if the contract was hacked or a critical vulnerability in the code was found.If a swap happens with out a real reason and then only the tokens from investors get swapped but not from airdrop participants like you have mentioned, then you know that this is a shady project that only did an airdrop in order to boost their follower numbers but then tricked those participants with the swap. Very shady and also a scam in my opinion.",
