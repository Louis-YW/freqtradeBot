  "content": "So here's the idea:    I have a question about using Satoshis to vote and this vote to be verified in the Mempool. Basically the lowest viable and network preserving s/vB possible is sent from the voting address  to a set of static addresses that represent choices. The vote/1 SAT is sent with the low fee. It will enter the mempool for a period of time and expire at some point? Possibly making the vote free. Running several nodes would help the verification process. Is there any obvious reasons this would not work? voter registration/verification are totally seperate set of challenges.",

From what I understand, there was an anti-spam minimum of 546 satoshis per output.  This was the normal policy for nodes to avoid people clogging up the system with dust transactions.  So even though you could technically make a payment of just 1 satoshi, most nodes would reject it because of the anti-spam policy.",

It will enter the mempool for a period of time and expire at some point? Possibly making the vote free.You would have in the case of the US around 150 million tx, the mempool now holds 20,000, the max was 600 000.Let's assume you somehow manage to run some nodes being able to hold all those you have another problem, which most bitcoin users would not want to deal with. Each address would have to be registered with an individual, it will tie that address to your identity forever, exposing it maybe, the second one is the problem of getting hacked, how would the authority decide which vote is the right one if your address sends two tx!Now the funny thing, it would take a **** of space to fund 150 million unique addresses, bloating the blockchain for weeks.It's a real crude, very time-consuming, and dangerous to the voting secret.There are plenty of other solutions readily available, like i-voting, and it runs on top of a blockchain.",
