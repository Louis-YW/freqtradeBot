  "content": "Almost two years ago the user OgNasty created a thread/topic on Beginners & Help in order to give merit to newbies and Juniors who proved to be able to sign a message with a Bitcoin address. I don't talk to OgNasty but I assume he took this iniciative to spread merits and help others to learn something new and useful within the crypto world.Some time has passed and I took the liberty to gather some data from that thread/topic in order to see how these kind of \"merit Faucets\" may affect the development or growth of a population of users (Newbies) or whether these kinds of opportunities only attract low value users for this forum. Here are the results I have found so far._______________________________________________________________________________ _________________________- 209 Users participated on the thread/topic and 111 of them were merited by OP, each of them received between 2 and 4 merits. Importan to note I did not consider merits provided by others here. About 47% of Newbies who summited their signed message did not receive merits while 53% did, those who did not receive merit seemed to have failed to sign their massage correctly, were suspected to be merit farmers/spammers or were of a rank above Jr. Member.-OP distributed 301 merits to Newbies /Juniors.- After almost two years from the beginning of the merit distribution some of the Newbies who participated have grown to become more active and in some cases more valuable members of this forum, while others did not. In general, nowadays those Newbies are today:Newbie [84]Jr.Member [45]Member [55]Full Member [13]Sr. Member [9]Hero Member [3]Legendary[0]-Here we can see the nowadays distribution of those users who have participated on the faucet in terms of whether they remain a newbie or junior to this day.-Here is the list of users that have participated so far and attempted to sign a message with their adresses:Code:Cryptomint9BDBitcoinExpartGbitGcentralcurrencyhossamdzKoutamihatakeyuduonindotamim60SmithBackwoodcatfightWavesonmespringshowerBholutefeFiremegadoterIssa56Kingmansmoni77BlackVirusesadiya09TDSB999007Thanos01rafi90AquaMagictami40nazmul30Raja SingaDavid48PhoenixZephyrusAxodinBanproxdalchandGyanendra854Milan_07Shubh7668Theory90Kid4Ubabu1981AletheaminlinJack MinRedoubtIndeverBnkr65Respite09Manish2809BordijoUsiderSOCAR.act_MurpheusNyx ErebusAWMM24ketnyVeshemminurreCryptoMargoalexrahman8Rony AhmedxodakovsSparrowOnTheMoonEfarilinoLaurenkiddingfattyaxShussainshahGarmoAbhi7974wbichKovinskiiSmartvirusdev654ZAINmalik75BurdecBevNation10_sjdovn_10Marina5_BlackStarSpartanezHaliburtonmafoja1Mr.right85sonic22smarty101VanguardValeCarosscryptobahtrosenbauer02RonyahPeanutswarTessnikJohnyzBIN-BINEearnpm777mozhajcTsuryanaIron FistRILWANsuzan26@DispoxNR 007israt1@FinixtexASONAMBP303Nimo1013akEYNCEABCD1122nilima47Rihat7HispohertznetworkMus06@IphommeRafi1@BizoranShikha99Anaul93748Rubel232Belal01Saddam2690Cryptofamele7adriaparcerisasevald13EYC_ONEjurkanOdiceGo No YuUKprodFizz070x888888889SatyrBaalMasplancMagicalkingEthan151WakateJontokhan65ten seventyInvokergods19ShammKokrargo88JohnlomapendalliardSpontaneousVeritchNathrixxxRockstarguybitsnackPbacalaDimaxaGamingMarvelmanCryptoHeadlineNewsStunzzAbike007GosgoskingSambeeDXDAgathamayNewlifebtcBigtree@AnguwaManna30Munir575Imranbutt44n0nceretreatexcroCleftwnetTrojanePsycopyroY3shotSatoPrincessBarinekapaulatomicarthurasogojanaveragestudentNovice08091Alanil210ifartedMahiyammahiJuwel12son1223dvndr007EtrangernullamaOddyseyGamessibu1234dashGasty4Ikhp07_act_Ryu_Ar1Crypto LibraryWiwoDunamisxScriptureRipe_berryZlantanndany@HRIDOY4847SiyamskDoan9269Bitcoin.PNBlue KingrojanThemePenelevatesNinsalsa0.orgBamjosAgbeOjima-ojoMate2237-I have taken the comments of @jackg  in consideration and added a graph summarizing the amount of users who participate on the merit faucet and have participated on the forum within a year (Since June 2021).

Notheless, if we assume those merited by OgNasty were the only ones which managed to do so this percentage would be as well about 53%, but clearly some cheaters may have signed correctly without receiving the reward.Please feel free to let us know your own conlusions on these results!  -Here are the sources of information and tools I have used for all thishttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5300698.0 (Data)https://fontmeme.com/es/fuentes-pixeladas/   (Letters)Microsoft(R) Excell(TM) 2016  (Processing of information and graphs)https://ninjastic.space/",

Perhaps many perceived that those that give away Merits are not in need of them as they have aplenty.Well, nobody is in NEED of them.  I also didn't mean to come off as though I cared about my situation personally.  I don't.  I was more preaching from a soapbox that one of the problems on this forum is that people want to praise those that comment or analyze those that are doing things, instead of praising the people that are actually doing things, so we end up with more statisticians than project developers...  Giving another example from me personally...  NastyMining was a project I started over a decade ago that has distributed more than 700 BTC, but that thread is merited by less individuals than this thread received in a week.  If paying all the costs to run a community organization for over a decade while distributing hundreds of BTC with 100% transparency to community members isn't merit worthy, what is?  What are we trying to achieve on these forums?",

It is a great thread and I don't see any reason why we should spare our smerits to those who are new yet we know that some people will abuse it. As you have said, it could also bring low value users in this forum but it also bring users who did contribute in this forum. What nullama share is where I also learn how to do it.",

In this case, those who participated in the thread to sign a message, it was easier to tag them as newbies/Jr. Members by the time they applied. Since I tried to apply as a Member and OgNasty himself directed me to the second thread to learn how to encrypt a message, which I did.Quote It is a great thread and I don't see any reason why we should spare our smerits to those who are new yet we know that some people will abuse it. As you have said, it could also bring low value users in this forum but it also bring users who did contribute in this forum. What nullama share is where I also learn how to do it.I personally think it was a quite good idea to distribute merits while helping newbies to learn something useful, besides OG clarified he checked the users who applied to avoid meriting cheaters, spammers, etc as much as possible, encoraging users who had a fairly chance to become good contributors of the forum, that's just my personal point of view, of course...",

I am aware that perhaps a year is a too wide gap of time to consider someone to be \"an active\" user of the forum, but I supposed it would work as an aproximation in this case.Quote As far as I can see, this could help to know how many newbies that rankrd up and still active and to see how many good newbies have come to Bitcointalk forum.I have stimated the percentage of Newbies that have ranked up to several posotions and those active within a year, however to know how many New users we have in a period of time would require more data than I have taken from OGNasty's faucet Thread, since a Newbie perfectly could join and ignore or choose nor to participate in the faucet.",

Same thing as those reposted contents that receive more likes/ upvotes than the original content. Not just on this forum.Either they (content creators) have to suck it up or adopt to changes (i.e. posting on different communities that appreciate it more or \"game\" the system).",

I must say that it's really interesting to see this data here and also how alot of newbies have benefited from the initiative and most of them have now become permanent members of the forum.And I second what uchegod-21 said concerning those who said the initiative also helped alts, nothing is perfect, even in trading, we trade to profit, but attimes, we have to bear some losses, an initiative like this one is bound to be abused in one way or the way, but what is most important is that the abusers are not more than the genuine benefactors, and then, those who used the initiative to gain merit for the alts, how far can they go now the initiative has come to an end.",
