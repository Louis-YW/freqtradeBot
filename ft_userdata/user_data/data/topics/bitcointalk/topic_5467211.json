Also, I have previously arranged the IPL prediction pool and all other previous cricket pool predictions and discussions over the years, all of those stay in the gambling discussion section.I will surely participate in this one and why not, it is free for everyone, so I guess everyone should give it a try and maybe be lucky to be in the top 10.     I guess there are 10 winners or 4 winners?",

Welcome mate, doors are open for everyone.I am a bit confused as how will you keep track of all the matches and the entries by the people. All of the old contests used the third party site superbru and every calculation was automatic and managed by that site.Let's suppose you have 20 members participating and each member will give his prediction about the match wins, toss and other stuff. Wouldn't it be a headache to manually update all these stats?Also, you need to be online at all times, to check the member's predictions and verify them (by quoting or any other means so no one can edit their posts and change the values). I really do not understand how this will be managed yet to ensure transparency.",

I'm a cricket fan, and I participate in such contests whenever I see one, I was the winner of the IPL contest that was managed by UmerIdrees and funded by Royse.

All of the old contests used the third party site superbru and every calculation was automatic and managed by that site. I think this is the beauty of this contest that it will be totally concluded in the this forum and no third party will be used for getting any data. I am always thinking of new things and this will be my first try to manage whole contest manually. Quote Let's suppose you have 20 members participating and each member will give his prediction about the match wins, toss and other stuff. Wouldn't it be a headache to manually update all these stats? If you check the altcoins bounty management where manager have to manually check every report link from more than 500 users , You will not ask question. Quote Also, you need to be online at all times, to check the member's predictions and verify them (by quoting or any other means so no one can edit their posts and change the values).  All rules are mentioned clearly on first page and point will be awarded to each on these basis. No need to mention any user not following rules, will just ignore without add points. I will add points when I online after match or one time every day and i hope members will support also. Quote I really do not understand how this will be managed yet to ensure transparency.If you are part of this contest and I mistakenly count wrong points for you, what will be your reaction?Quote from: HONDACD125 on September 19, 2023, 08:38:17 AMSuperb @OP , I would love to be enter in this competition.

They usually perform really well and get close to winning the cup, but choke at the end for various annoying reasons.I don't think this time will be any different. They need a captain like MSD to properly take them across the line without choking.",

Another point is that this tournament is being held in India and they will have a lot of home ground pressure and sometimes a home team can fail to perform well in from of home crowd and can choke in the knock out stages of the tournament.Well, India can still manage to win the cup but I feel that it is difficult for the home team to life the cup. Anyhow lets see how it goes, I have given my prediction which I think may be one of the possibilities.",
