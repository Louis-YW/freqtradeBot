Welcome mate, doors are open for everyone.I am a bit confused as how will you keep track of all the matches and the entries by the people. All of the old contests used the third party site superbru and every calculation was automatic and managed by that site.Let's suppose you have 20 members participating and each member will give his prediction about the match wins, toss and other stuff. Wouldn't it be a headache to manually update all these stats?Also, you need to be online at all times, to check the member's predictions and verify them (by quoting or any other means so no one can edit their posts and change the values). I really do not understand how this will be managed yet to ensure transparency.",

I'm a cricket fan, and I participate in such contests whenever I see one, I was the winner of the IPL contest that was managed by UmerIdrees and funded by Royse. Let me know what we can do about the Merit issue because it's not about not being a quality poster but it's because I don't actively post anymore but I want to join the contest.Cheers.",

All of the old contests used the third party site superbru and every calculation was automatic and managed by that site. I think this is the beauty of this contest that it will be totally concluded in the this forum and no third party will be used for getting any data.

Quote Let's suppose you have 20 members participating and each member will give his prediction about the match wins, toss and other stuff. Wouldn't it be a headache to manually update all these stats? If you check the altcoins bounty management where manager have to manually check every report link from more than 500 users , You will not ask question.

No need to mention any user not following rules, will just ignore without add points. I will add points when I online after match or one time every day and i hope members will support also.

They usually perform really well and get close to winning the cup, but choke at the end for various annoying reasons.I don't think this time will be any different. They need a captain like MSD to properly take them across the line without choking.",

Another point is that this tournament is being held in India and they will have a lot of home ground pressure and sometimes a home team can fail to perform well in from of home crowd and can choke in the knock out stages of the tournament.Well, India can still manage to win the cup but I feel that it is difficult for the home team to life the cup. Anyhow lets see how it goes, I have given my prediction which I think may be one of the possibilities.",
