      "body": "E be like say the time don almost reach, we dey just one year away from the next, and possibly the most important, Bitcoin Halving wey go happen for April 2024. E dey interesting now to compare our current situation with the times before the previous Halvings, so we fit understand how big the next Halving go be. As we dey do that, e no go make sense if we just dey look common things or price charts, we suppose focus on something wey dey way more important...Wetin be the thing wey dey important na the BTC Supply, every Halving dey reduce the growth of the BTC Supply, so e go come dey more scarce with lower inflation and demand wey dey always increase, as the price go adjust upwards.One part of the Supply wey dey very interesting na the BTC Supply wey dey available for trade. You fit talk say all the BTC Supply na the same, true talk, but the truth be say like 70% of the whole Supply dey inside the hands of long-term holders now, and 50% of the whole Supply dey inside the hands of the most dedicated long-term holders wey never sell for over 2 years.If you add the Supply wey don loss forever for the early days of Crypto, you go see say the amount wey remain na very small amount, na the Supply wey exchanges fit collect and sell to new people wey wan enter Crypto.",
