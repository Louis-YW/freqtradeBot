  "content": "Due to the state of our economy and the continuous increase in price of goods, services and commodities; I think the only remedy to this impeding economic crisis now is to venture into agriculture.The most common want of human is food as one needs food to gain strength and energy in other to perform daily activities. So on this note it is advisable for us to key into agricultural activities to aid in supplying us food to eat. Our fathers have acquired lands for most of us so it is the duty of us to start developing on this lands because it helps in poverty elevation. For instance if one plants cassava, cucumber, maize, okra, etc you will see that within some period of time these crops will germinate and bear fruits then after which we harvest the crops and process them as food for human consumption. We can see that farming has aided a large number of our population to be able to produce food by themselves and apart from producing food, one can decide to sell the crops and use the money to buy other human needs like clothes, buy creams and soaps and so on.In the process of using agriculture as a means of poverty elevation, there have seem to be set back in the improvement of our agricultural standards due to flooding, fertilizers and lack of loans or grants to our local farmers. For instance this constant flooding have been a major setback to farmers over the years as crops are either harvested before mature date or the crops are being sweep away by flood thereby rendering the farmers efforts as waste.I believe that if government provides fertilizer to our local farmers and also grant them loans to help improve their farms it is going to aid in improvement of our farming methods and this will also make farmers to purchase more lands for farming therefore during the time of harvest the foods will be harvested in larger quantities and also made available to the public at lesser prices. It is just unfortunate to see that rather than provide these things to farmers, they rather use it as a medium of embezzling government funds to their private pockets or instead share it within their families and friends.There's a saying that goes, a hungry man is an angry man as no one will be happy if they don't have food to eat therefore we should channel our energy to farming so that at least let us have food to eat before we can think of other things of life.",

These has been our source of lively hood and I wounder why the government refuse to invest in agriculture. One thing is that we always practice subsistence agriculture.

People would be happy to work and become productive, there by producing food in large quantity which can be distributed within and outside the country there by reducin inflation.Agriculture can be made lucrative by providing the following.machinery: to reduce the stress or hard work involved.

To do there normal subsistence farming. You are right to some extent as one become great by starting from little before becoming big so whether the government provides machines to aid farm operations or not we can still make use of our physical and natural strength to perform farm operations until we start recording huge success then we can seek the aid of government in other to enlarge the quantity of farm produce by using machines to make farming operations more easier.",

And plenty people no wan farm so this matter plenty bro.You start from small as if we want everything to be made available to us before starting something in life, then we will be discouraged and lazy but let's start from little the most important thing is having a land to start farm operations, so as soon as you acquire a land for farming them others will be done stage after stage. Farming doesn't necessarily require government effort before starting, we can start it in a little way then during the long run and the successes recorded will now attract the government to aid in achieving larger farms so that the farm produce can also be harvested in large quantity.In life, what most people look out for is results and except they see you making progress in your field of business, no one will want to encourage or support you but immediately they see that you are making a headway people will start trooping to know and learn how you made it.",
