      "body": "Based on your answers you won't find buyers here as you've deflected all reasonable request.It's frowned upon to take business generated on forum, off forum. Upload pics with your forum username and a time stamp so people can't use your image. You've already uploaded pics on mainstream eBay.Accept reputable forums escrow options for your protection and the buyers. And name a price if you want to sell something. Buck was pretty specific and you responded the same day, In a condescending tone. \"TelLiNg you a priCe wouLd be irResPonsiBle\"  this likely means your a scammer or a broker with nothing on hand the latter is fine but set realistic expectations. For all these reasons I would suggest anyone considering doing business with OP to proceed with caution",

The price issue is nothing really, but the price does change daily, not the dealer, we have a lot of warehouses and stock; when someone wants to buy the item, I need to confirm what country the person is in and the price at the local warehouse, which is reasonable.buckrogers) raises good questions for everyone, and I agree with that.I don't keep a condescending attitude and I apologize for that! buckrogers)Thanks!",
