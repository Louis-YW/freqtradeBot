      "body": "I'm interested in knowing how you will get the money you intend using for your investment without having to do a tedious task that's time and effort consuming? It's not even as though Bitcoin investments is a job or carrier that one can choose to do for a living. Before you even invest in Bitcoin or own a Bitcoin, you've got to render a service in some way that gives you some fiat you can convert into Bitcoin or perform a task that gets you paid in Bitcoin. Whichever way you get your Bitcoin through, there is no way you're going to factor out the place of carrying out a task and looking at the screen is the least of them.If you're investing in your Bitcoin through the DCA methord , it means you have a means of income that comes in at a particular period of time of the week or month from which you can assign a portion that will go into your investment. Same is what is applicable for buying in lump sum. If you're a trader that's when it even gets worse because you need an alternative means of generating cash so when you face some losses, it doesn't really affect you that much and you can still get a source of funds for your trading from your main stream of income.Let's not paint a narrative that sends a wrong message to some newbie that investing in Bitcoin and being profitable at it is just an easy journey that comes on a platter of gold without putting an effort. In life generally, nothing comes for nothing and to even make it well from your Bitcoin investments, you need to invest much which is what an average person that lacks a legit stream of income can't easily do.",

Bitcoin has proved over the years to be a good hedge against inflation but I can't say the same thing for altcoins. Many altcoins become worthless after a short period. Hence, it is important to make that clarification to avoid misdirecting newbies. We should also state that it is not everyone who invested in Bitcoin made profit. Many of them lost because they sold their coins hastily due to FUD or other conditions. Those who are not patient enough or don't have emergency funds might not benefit from investing in Bitcoin.Long-term holdlers don't need to look at the price of Bitcoin every day because they already have plans for their investment.",

If you do, you should add the source to the OP. From what I understand here, the message of this thread is that Bitcoin helps reduce eye strain because you don’t have to stare at a screen for 6hours+ day and you make more money than people with 9-5 jobs. Tbh never would have imagined this to be as one of the solutions or benefits of Bitcoin. It’s interesting because people who own Bitcoin may spend the equal hours or more with those who are not involved in Bitcoin due to the fact that the amount of time we spend on our mobile devices is far more than we spend on anything else.",

When you take an average inflation of some countries in a year and you invested in Bitcoin at the wrong time, you might prefer to hold fiat and not put money in Bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, this is scenario that can happen if you don't do proper investigation before investment. My home country for instance has an average inflation of 30+% and now imagine buying Bitcoin at $70k and you plan to used the money in December if things goes but things are not certain.If you want Bitcoin as a hedge for inflation, time of holding must be put into consideration, not going to be one or two years, you will need to patience for atleast a bull run cycle and you will enjoy better when Bitcoin make a new all time and you will see the benefit of buying Bitcoin instead of keeping your fiats on Banks and some other things that loose value with time.",

Investing for long term can be a passive way to gain profit but for traders, they are still required to sit in front of a computer and be on it for long hours. Some trade by the minute, hour, or by the day so I think it depends on each person how much time you are spending in front of a screen.However I can agree that investing in bitcoin is a lot easier than most office works. The good thing is that you hold your own time and you do not need to be caged into specific office hours.",

In my opinion, a person should only invest in bitcoin when they have a job and income, do not invest just by borrowing and thinking that it will bring profit and will become rich by investing in bitcoin, and do nothing.Also, I disagree when you say that making money from cryptocurrency investments is easy. Making money is never easy, no matter what field it is in because it will have its own difficulties and risks. You will not have to do anything when investing in bitcoin but you will be able to face losses, when you work you will be tired but you will have a regular income. Everything has a price to pay.",

Considering the general contest of investing in Bitcoin (even with all you said), truly, you don't have to work all day (from Monday to Friday and from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.), but a middle-class man or even a rich man still needs to maintain their other sources of income, which can require their time and attention all week. It's from their other sources of income that they can generate money to continue investing in Bitcoin and be able to hold it for the number of years it will take to reach the bull market. Definitely, any experienced bitcoiner who wants to be successful will consider all the necessary factors (entry point, holding period, best wallet to use, etc.) that are needed to be a successful bitcoiner.",

As for me, I bet you that the jobs you call boring are providing and feeding them every day and they can even save a significant amount of money from their jobs. Investing in bitcoin is an opportunity to help us increase our assets, we should not ignore it, but I believe it will not be more important than a job that brings you a stable income. Personally, I need a job with a stable income before thinking about investing in bitcoin, investing in bitcoin is important but it will not be my top priority in this life.

I have to agree with this. While investing in bitcoin does not actually require an 8-hour screen monitoring, but surely acquiring that funds used for investment might be tough and hard most especially for minimal income earners. Others have to even look for additional jobs so they can afford investing in bitcoin. I think the real beauty not only for bitcoin but to all forms of investment is to see yourself finally reaping the fruit of your labor. That’s the time you will come to enjoy your profits from a lot of patience and sacrifices just to endure the risk with bitcoin investment.",

First and foremost, money is not gotten from the tree or printed on a white paper. Before you can earn money legitimately either physically or online, you will need to work yourself out to be compensated of the hard work, the stress and the knowledge you've put in executing the job. It could be a basic monthly salary payment or a one-off contract arrangement for a company or an individual, regardless, you will need to earn money before you can invest it in Bitcoin being it DCA or Lump Sum.Although, there are people who have set certain target to their work life in the sense that they plan to work hard for a certain number of years then retire when their able to meet up certain financial targets. From there they tend to migrate from just being an entrepreneur or a government worker to investors including Angel Investors. In that case, they must still work and climb the ladder of progression and success to achieve that mark.Having said all of these, it is also crucial to mention that you don't just invest and sit down for your profits to maximize. You will also have to follow your investments through monitoring and analysing the market to determine when to move your investments and other investments opportunities. So, be it as it may, I don't see anyone becoming a successful investor without first putting in the energy and time to work either as a businessperson or a government official or in some cases inheritance.",
