I'm not a huge fan of casinos but I've spent almost an hour on the site just enjoying every moment on it.The site is really eye captivating and attractive and it relatively loads fast and has numerous payment methods which i never tried any. I enjoyed playing your demo games. Nice work and keep it up",

You can calculate yourself how much to wager and think whether it is worth or not to wager the required amount for that bonus. Good thing is that your cash balance will not be locked because the bonus balance is separated, so if you decide to deposit and wager but you are giving up for the wagering requirement, you can still withdraw your cash/real balance even if you have not completed the wagering requirement of the bonus.",

Free spins are distributed to give new users free chances to explore games and the casino. Those spins won't be allowed to use and win big then withdraw. It can cause exploitation on the casino bankroll. Logically it should not be allowed at the start in design of free spins.Wagering requirement is not easy to meet and when you meet it, it is harder to still maintain your profit from free-spin wins. With free spins, don't let the idea to withdraw if you win as your priority. Consider it is chance to spin and play for fun and knowing how one game is played on one casino.Question for Vavada.com casino.Do they intend to develop the casino as a Web3 casino that means user can connect their wallets to the casino and play with non custodial wallets? Web3 casino is a new trend.",
