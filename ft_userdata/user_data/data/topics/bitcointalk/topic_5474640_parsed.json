What every wallet does is that they help you manage your private keys and seed phrase that help you generate the private keys. It also helps you spend a coin from any of your addresses.I think this board testify how helpful the forum has been with lots of doubts and confusing chapters of bitcoin, all you do is to just ask and people are ready to give you the best solution which some might not be truly correct but you will surly get that good solution you are want from the rest of the replies.",

If anyone comes on this forum with problem concerning crypto and its not solved then they want something else entirely, they problem is from their ends not this forum, if I have come across bitcoin talk from day one I would have taken the short path knowing about crypto, believe me, I took the hardest route, made some mistakes that could have been avoided if I know about this forum earlier on.I think it's finner to say that Bitcointalk forum is a home of solution to those who want to learn, because believe me, many people don't want to, they are here to be told what they want to hear, you can easily make money doing this and that kinda thing, most newbies lacks patience and we all know that those who lacks patience in crypto space don't deserve it's reward.",

Example is someone that send bitcoin to a wrong address and the transaction has been confirmed. If the transaction has been confirmed, the transaction can not be reversed and the money is just lost. But if the issue can be solved, Bitcointalk members always have clue to the solution. I love being on this forum.Sir, if the transaction of Bitcoin is reversed, then the concepts of decentralization and blockchain would be pointless. Because blockchain was invented to be a designed ecosystem that is immutable, making the transaction reversible makes blockchain negligible. That's why Bitcoin is considered the most secure because you can make safe transactions and not have them reversed. So it is not possible to reverse the transaction when a transaction is confirmed and added to the blockchain. So it is impossible to do it backward.And if your point is accepted, how to make the transaction reversible, then you have to rewrite the block in which the valid transaction is conformed through the fingerprint of the previous block. And this blockchain has to be implemented in what is usually called a 51% attack. I think you probably know that in a 51% attack, the blockchain has to be brought under a process so that the transaction of double spending can be reversed. But this act is only theoretically possible, not practically, because it is not possible that you can bring 50% hash rate under your control in a blockchain. So even Bitcoin talk people can't make you do it. It is not possible for anybody.",
