Taking profit is the most challenging thing to do as you never know if the asset you are invested in will finally stop going up in price. Greed surely comes up when you are seen making easy money by just HODLing and you also tend to invest more when you get some great profits in the end.\"Don't give up\", okay bud. Great Bull Run Strategy.",

      "body": "You should start with the fact that any investment poses risks, even Bitcoin does. One should be aware of that and especially in Beginners area this must be said over and over again.Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Even though am a big fan of Bitcoin, it wouldn't make you filthy rich, unless you have a large capital, the real money is in the Alt where the high risk are, just pick the right one.Actually altcoin investments are a couple of levels of magnitude riskier than Bitcoin investments. And this means that if one has chosen the wrong altcoin or the wrong moments to buy and sell, ... he/she can get burned (too) easy.In my (quite long) experience all the altcoins I've tried out sooner or later went down and never came back to their ath (against Bitcoin, I mean).Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Be patient because that is the key.Yep. Patience in buying and selling, patience in learning too!Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Control your risk; people mostly waste their money gambling on trades that gives only 1:1 reward ratio without remember  every $1 you waste could be $100 during the bull run or a year time.1$ lost while learning is still better than 10k lost because one thought he understood trading (and trading is very difficult for most, actually).So there's no universal truth; one needs to learn, one needs to understand whether trading is a better choice, or investing, or neither (!).Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Learn to sell: you need to learn to cut your loss, even though you are -70% , the left over 30% is reinvested than slowly grinding down to -99% because you are too stubborn to admit you are wrong.Yep, most traders lose the big money because they either became too greedy, either didn't know how to cut the loses.Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_Dont give up: in crypto you will make bad investment, sometimes you will just be unlucky, just do not give up.So true. Trying multiple times, cutting loses, re-investing basically only the gains, repeating this.. it's a good strategy.Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Take profit: if you don't take profit how can you be profitable? Don't be greedy, just take profit.That's correct. The only thing to add is that while a trader may want to take profit faster and more often, an investor may even want to wait for years.But eventually taking profit is the right thing to do; bringing your coins to the grave without having a little fun in life when you were on profit ... would be sad.All in all you gave more good advises than bad ones, still, it would be great if you would nuance everything in the way you give only good ones. Keep in mind that bull runs come and go; the advises may be more important when the price is not going only upwards.",

But other than this I agree with it because huge risks bring huge profits, but those who don't want to bear or be under some stress, they prefer BTC, there are also many other factors that become a reason man to prefer BTC over ALT and vice versa. Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Be patient because that is the key.Sometimes, we should avoid patience and take profit (that's your 6th point). And sometimes, we have to sell at lower rates too just to save the 30% we have left (that's your 4th point), So that we could reinvest it to take it back to %100. So the point is, keeping patience is not the only key but every factor you have discussed here is in correlation with each other.Besides all that, You really have made a good topic, and these points we all should keep in mind despite the difference of ranks.",

Bitcoin is the only currency that surely gives profits without any risks. The altcoins can go zero in value anytime and the ones who invest in altcoins are risking their money in order to earn profits. Remember the case of TerraLuna that caused huge losses to the investors who invested in it with the same mindset as yours. Altcoins are highly risky as investment and if someone really don't want to lose everything then Bitcoin is the only reliable option for such people.Quote from: Kara3 on October 01, 2023, 01:32:13 PM_ Be patient because that is the key._ Control your risk; people mostly waste their money gambling on trades that gives only 1:1 reward ratio without remember  every $1 you waste could be $100 during the bull run or a year time.Well, patience is required in every investment and even in Bitcoin investment the investor must have patience to gain good returns from the investment. I agree that controlling of risk is a good step but sometimes taking risks is also essential in order to reach good levels of financial freedom, but I disagree with you because the ones who are good at trading make far more profits then who ones who hold for bull run.

Don't be greedy, just take profit. Well, if you invest in Bitcoin then you won't have to face -70% loss even if you invest in it right now. Sometimes that can happen but still most of the time that thing doesn't happen with Bitcoin investors. When you invest a low quality altcoin then surely you'll have to find a better way to save your investment.Taking profit isn't always a good thing because sometimes we miss huge profits by taking small profits every once in a while. It depends on our emotional intelligence sometimes because if we can't control our emotions then we may not be able to earn huge profits and sell off early in order to have small profits.",
