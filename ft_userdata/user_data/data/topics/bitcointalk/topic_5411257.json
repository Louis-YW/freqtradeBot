  "content": "I am sharing this article without antagonizing anyone and also sharing it with much neutrality. What are your latest comments, thoughts and opinions on Bitcoin maximalism?The replies of the older members of the forum who joined before 2015 will certainly have more importance in this because they have witnessed the changes and the growth of the cryptospace from being simple to presently being billions of dollars of crazy hehee. Bitcoin Maximalists are skeptical and critical of claims to technical advances made by other cryptocurrency softwares, and seek to maintain and bolster a culture of scrutiny.Still, they acknowledge there are new services and products made available in the crypto sector, and that the product of this effort can provide learnings to Bitcoin.However, they believe that these crypto assets and services are profiting off the short-term limitations of Bitcoin, and thus their use should be discouraged in order to inspire and fund the development of like offerings built on the Bitcoin network.Read in full https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2022/08/25/how-to-be-a-bitcoin-maximalist/?sh=76bcd4897036",

We seem to have observed intolerance against innovation in general, intolerance against all other forms of investment, and so on. The movement is now seemingly characterized with closed-mindedness rather than encouraging constant exploration and innovation and finding ways and possibilities to improve things, which was precisely what Satoshi did.Other than this, it seems some who have been loudly claiming to be Bitcoin maximalists showed double standard. And some have eventually given up that label not because of realizations but because of financial prospects.",

      "body": "Just read the article. The definition of a \"Maximalist\" in it is broad enough to include people like me, who don't oppose altcoins generally, but do oppose some of the \"traits\" in the altcoin space. In my case, I'm particularly concerned about crypto projects which hide their centralist nature from the public, in my opinion mostly to be able to \"ride the Bitcoin train\" without getting control (and profit in an old-style, centralized way) out of their hands. (Thus the \"decentralization maximalist\" phrase below my boring avatar). But I have no problems with altcoins with Bitcoin-style openness like Monero, Groestlcoin or Grin, for example.Generally, the Forbes article puts the focus more in the open, decentralized nature of Bitcoin (and Proof of Work as it's \"base technology\"), and not so much in the opposition to other cryptocurrencies. So I can agree with most of the statements of the \"definition\". The only point where I disagree slightly (so I'm maybe not a \"true\" Bitcoin maximalist) is the ignorance of the issues regarding energy sources powering mining and its carbon footprint. While the protocol for sure doesn't discriminate between miners working with fossil energy and those using renewables, the community itself should be able to promote the second group. The stance of some Maximalists that it doesn't matter which energy is used can be seen as a symptom for a trope I see critical in the Bitcoin community: to ignore the social aspects of the Bitcoin protocol. Code may be law in the Bitcoin protocol but there may be other \"rules\" (or perhaps \"guidelines\", as they can't be \"enforced\" easily) supporting it - like a commitment of the community to try to reduce the carbon footprint.",
