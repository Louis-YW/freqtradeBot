I have never seen a red first bit or these coins gilted. Possibly fakes created? coins gold plated after the fact with fake holograms? Luckily the creator and expert is on the forum currently. I suspect an answer coming shortly. Cant wait to get the details.",

He's a private person, and I am also wondering if someone else commissioned him to do the gilt ones. As for the pennies being on there already Yes that is kind of fucked up, but again it's none of our business really anyhow,, and now that I think about it maybe he has some deal where he hasn't even sent those in yet due to the auction time ending. Fuck who knows lol.. I give up..It's going to be an interesting auction for sure! üòÇ",

If you are longtime buyer, you get leads first ofc... Let's just be happy he's still making coins after 10 years!  Personally, why bother being jealous or mad? If I had been in the professional coin making business for 10 years like him, I'd certainly be doing the same - F, he probably has his own mint and hologram machine by now LOL",
