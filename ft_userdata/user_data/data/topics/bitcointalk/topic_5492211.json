From your own perspective I see you wish to have the transaction on another block before the main transaction is confirmed which is still achievable with the like of lightning network or better still we have a soft fork of segwit which helps to increase the number of transactions in a block due to the segregation or separation of the witness from transaction details. Your idea will be brushed off if it is seen to be not secure enough and by moving to your the POP mechanism I doubt many might trust it",

It took many years to build this community and this trust. The first point of suspension for me with those projects that proclaim that they want to replace Bitcoin is in their attempt to replace an already successful project like Bitcoin instead of trying to build they own ecosystem to help the grow into a fitting alternative instead of trying to take over.We can easily support any project that promises to provide a better alternatives in the market, since Bitcoin is already performing excellently right now and for that we are not looking replacement and any developer that want to contribute should be in form of enhancing the scalability of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem",

That ain’t going to happen as there are benefits that comes with being the pioneer to a field and that’s what Bitcoin enjoys the most today plus, it’s decentralized and highly user involved consensus nature in maintaining the integrity of the network.But, I guess this isn’t the main intent is it.Perhaps those who didn’t get in earlier enough seems to hope for a better opportunity in another coin under the name of swift transactions. You could always seek that out in altcoins but, know the risk otherwise, your best option remains to buy Bitcoin as we still at its early phases.",

It's been 15 years now since Bitcoin was developed, but yet there's no blockchain technology (coin) that has ever ride on Bitcoin, which means that Bitcoin has always been the waymaker in the crypto market for 15 years now, and there is no original idea to surpass it. Have you heard about Bitcoin SV? Posing to have a better coin than Bitcoin but yet cannot be compared to the original coin. I am not against any technology coming up that can do better in the aspect of becoming a very great source of investment for individuals, even better than Bitcoin, but I doubt if that technology is going to be a crypto-related project because so many projects have tried to copy Bitcoin but have not succeeded, perhaps, I don't thinks anyone can be able to sacrifice what Satoshi have sacrificed for us.",

Why some of the forks are active and why most are dead? Why BTC is most famous. I suggest you read the history of the initiation of alts, like when did they started to be made. And why as well. The answers to these questions will give you the whole idea that many coins already exist with some characteristics. The main question is why we need another BTC, while its use cases are lesser than most of the coins already in the market. I know BTC has its own reputation and its not mainly made for other use-cases it served its purpose. So why do you think we need another BTC? I think these alts that have been made are known as alts or under the influence of BTC because they are also made with the same idea that a coin must exist that should have more characteristics than BTC.Quote from: tranthidung on April 09, 2024, 01:47:17 PMWhat?

Bitcoin is the only coin that is 100% decentralized. Most developers have created what you described in OP but they all faded away. It will therefore be nice if you join the bitcoin blockchain maintainers and implement these your ideas as a means to scale bitcoin. Just like LN, SigWit, Taproot etc. This will make our dear bitcoin more sustainable than creating thousands duplicate bitcoin-likes.",
