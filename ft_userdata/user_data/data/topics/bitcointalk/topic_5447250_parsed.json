  "content": "The amount of tax that was collected is set to 1% TDS, no matter if you are buying crypto or selling crypto, or exchanging it into fiat. That's how they plotted the whole game and made it the hardest regulation ever. This makes sense, the Indian finance minister is keeping it at strictest terms so that \"Money Laundering\" can be avoided which may be done via Crypto Transfer. The whole point of TDS is now clear. In fact, various exchanges also reported that most of the revenue was lost in the process of TDS considering the volume they are playing with. Due to this reason most of the WEB 3 startups in India now have offices offshore to evade the hard tax rules. Not only this, anything converted into the fiat gets taxed flat 30%.That is harsh and the best way to flee crypto investors out of the country.QuoteThe high tax rate on a low threshold ($125 in a financial year) made crypto trading unprofitable, and exchanges unviable in India.Indian tax authorities collected Rs 158 crore (approx. $19 million) in TDS on the transfer of virtual digital assets (VDA) till March 20, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary told the Parliament on Tuesday. Given that the financial year ended on March 31, it can be taken as the final figure for the entire 2022-23 fiscal.1% TDS at $125 Threshold The Indian government brought crypto transactions under a new tax regime through the budget for 2022-23. It provided for 1% TDS on VDA transfers exceeding Rs 10,000 (approx. $125) in a financial year. Besides, all gains on VDA transfers were subjected to a 30% income tax. The 1% TDS began to be deducted from July 1, 2023. In November, the minister informed the Indian Parliament that TDS collection on VDAs from July 1 to November 1 was Rs 60.46 crore ($7.4 million). Given the low tax collection, it was expected that the government would ease the tax rate and bring it between 0.05% and 0.1%, in line with the industry’s demand. But the authorities did not provide any such relief. Regulatory Vacuum Subsequently, crypto transactions were placed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Industry representatives surprisingly hailed the decision as it provided some kind of clarity, a break from a complete regulatory vacuum.Due to the high taxes, along with a hostile regulatory environment, India, which had a burgeoning crypto ecosystem, began to cede the advantage to the neighboring and more friendly jurisdictions such as UAE and Singapore. As per a Nasscom study, 60% of India’s 450 Web 3 startups are registered outside the country. The report also highlighted that India is well set to drive the Web 3 transformation thanks to its large talent pool, which accounts for 11% of the global market.  Crypto Adoption Growing As per the latest Statista data, India has 150 million crypto users. By the end of 2023, India’s crypto adoption rate could become higher than that of the UK and the US, and 11% of locals will have experimented with digital asset transactions. India hosted G20 Finance Minister and Central Bank Governors meeting last month, where discussion on crypto regulations figured prominently. And it seems by the end of 2023, the powerful economic block will have some kind of regulation in place for the cryptocurrency sector.India’s 1% TDS on Crypto Transfers Yields $19 Million in 9 Months",
