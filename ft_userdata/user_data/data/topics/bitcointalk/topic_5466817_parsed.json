  "content": "Now the US is threatening to make North Korea stronger than ever. And NK knows it. So, they will simply go ahead with arms deals with Russia faster than ever. I mean, the sanctions got Russia to unite in strength with many nations, and boosted the speed at which BRICS was becoming the top world currency system. So, go ahead and make Russia and BRICS even stronger by more sanctions... causing NK to become a big player in BRICS. I mean, they were starting to show strength. So give them this big boost in their strength. Sanctions.U.S. threatens additional sanctions on North Korea if the communist nation inks arms deal with Russiahttps://www.naturalnews.com/2023-09-13-america-sanctions-north-korea-arms-deal-russia.htmlThe United States is threatening to add even more sanctions against the rogue communist nation of North Korea if it sells weapons to Russia.This warning comes as North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have crossed into Russia on his armored train to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and, according to U.S. intelligence, to negotiate an arms deal. (Related: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warns of nuclear war, orders military to get ready for possible U.S.-led invasion.)North Korean state media confirmed that Kim left Pyongyang for Russia on Sunday, Sept. 10, and that he was accompanied by top military officials and arms industry leaders. Russian state television later confirmed Kim's arrival, showing the communist leader dressed in a suit and smiling as he stepped off his armored train onto a red carpet at a train station in the Russian Far East, being greeted by a welcome delegation from the Kremlin, including Alexander Kozlov, the minister for natural resources.Kim is expected to spend a lot of his time in Russia in negotiations. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that the Russian and North Korean delegations would be negotiating and, if needed, Kim will be meeting with Putin in a \"one-on-one format.\"Washington warns Pyongyang will \"pay a price\" for selling arms to MoscowThe U.S. has warned North Korea against selling weapons to Russia that could end up being used in the Kremlin's ongoing special military operation in Ukraine.\"We urge the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] to abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia,\" said National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson in an interview with South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan similarly warned that North Korea will \"pay a price\" if it supplies weapons to Russia....",

Even if North Korea was accepted or considered as a possible member of BRICS, it would only make relations between east and west to become more complex.It is one thing to accept a country like Iran or Argentina as a member, but it is completely different to do the same to a country which is so autocratic as only itself can be. BRICS will lose of they add NK.",

      "body": "One example of how Russia has made the Ukraine war closer to Russia's foreign relations is the deal with North Korea.Since the beginning of the war, the countries of the western world have been imposing sanctions one after the other, but they cannot stop them, because it must be understood that as a result of this war, Russia has a lot to do with the countries of the world Arguments such as the arms deal with those that had nothing to do with them, as a whole, the war may have weakened Russia a little militarily, but made it a lot stronger in other ways.According to various sources, Russians are losing a lot of weapons, that's why they are asking for help from different countries. I think it's true. Yes, North Korea has a lot They will get a lot of arms aid. China is not able to pay directly to Russia for various reasons. America does not have a good relationship with North America and this is an opportunity for Russia.***I think the more sanctions come in, the stronger Russia will become in every area, especially in terms of building relationships.North Korea is already under a lot of sanctions, so the new sanctions won't do much for them because their economic situation is already there and now if they pay only American made North Korea in Russia Their economy will become another issue which is very bad for America because North Korea has strong influence in the region even as America loses its dominance in the region.And if America imposes sanctions, North Korea will continue to trade with Russia and China and its allies, which is better for them.But America will make a very big mistake because America knows well that it does not care about any threat to America, they have not stopped all the tests even after imposing sanctions one after another.A series of major weapons tests were carried out with weapons such as hydrogen bombs.Just as the US is offering its allies to come to Ukraine with NATO help, why would Russia go it alone and invite them into an unwritten alliance that could lead to World War III.I think such sanctions are a threat for America in the days to come because by these sanctions they are helping BRICS to become stronger, and they are shooting themselves in the foot.And stopping the war with these threats is far from a foreign policy, and they are distancing themselves from the world in my opinion.We have to remember that America was divided before. They are the ones who made them nuclear weapons strong now if they ban them then those weapons will be used against them.Finally, the threat of sanctions against North Korea does not apply to America's current situation.They have offered to strengthen North Korea even more, but I think it's too late.",

This may not make it totally counterfeit proof.Time for BRICS to take up Bitcoin  That isn't such a funny idea. Problem is, if the world took on Bitcoin as the world currency, the satoshi would become the basic 'dollar'. Why? Because 21 million bitcoins won't go very far for the whole population of the world.The people who held a large number of bitcoins would be the wealthy elite. Average folks who had only a bitcoin or two would be very high class. The whole operation in the world would change.There is a lot of thinking that would have to go into this. How do we really make a currency out of it... a paper satoshi bill that can be traded, hand-to-hand, without the electronics when necessary? And how do we recover old satoshi bills that are damaged or lost? Such would take some additions to the blockchain, like a date on the bills, after which they wouldn't be worth anything. But if nobody came up with the old bill to trade it for a fresh, crisp one, who gets the new bill? Do we simply burn it?Burning it might be a good idea. After all, the blockchain and the Core are built so that if the supply of bitcoins is reduced through burning, the satoshi can be subdivided any number of times into much smaller pieces... like a tenth of a penny... a penny being a hundredth of a satoshi.Lots of things to think about.Russia has some darn good Devs regarding blockchains and programming. They just might think this whole thing through and 'adjust' Bitcoin to get rid of the flaws that are keeping it from becoming a popular world currency. There still are average people who have never heard of Bitcoin.",

They are used to Western sanctions and have discovered diverse means to invade these economic blockages. Most of the sanctions on them were targeted at starving the nation of funds that would be used to finance their nuclear weapon programs. But they have devised many illegal means of getting funds to still survive. North Korea has also been assisted by some nations such as China to invade sanctions. I am worried that this partnership between Russia and NK will give the isolated nation more channels to access the needed funds. And this bilateral relation will extend the war in Ukraine because, with NK, Russia will have access to more weapons. BRICS alliance is made of different countries that have not shown much commitment to the organization due to personal interest.  I am not sure that many nations in BRICS will be comfortable with North Korea joining the alliance.",
