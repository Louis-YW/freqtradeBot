Once you are done with that, close the tab.Now, right-click on the AppImage file again, you will be able to see the \"Run as program\" option, click on it, and you are good to go",

Just download it. Right-click on the file and, down under properties, enable the \"Executable as Program\" option. Once you are done with that, close the tab.+1, OP just miss that step. I miss that step also a few hours ago after trying to install it on bootable Linux. OP must go to property and the permission tab to tick \"allow executing file as program\"https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-docs/blob/master/tails.rstQuoteOpen Home/Persistent folder (where the appimage will now live), right click on the appimage and select Properties. Select the Permissions tab and click \"Allow executing file as program\" then close the dialog. More detailed instructions with screenshots are available hereIf still didn't work, OP could use appimagetool to extract an existing AppImage into an AppDirCode:appimagetool -v /path/to/AppDiror just simple use this code into terminal:Code:./electrum --appimage-extractHere many step you could try : https://superuser.com/questions/1301583/how-can-i-extract-files-from-an-appimage",

But it surged another question: why the account which is on 25-th word doesn't visualize the balance?you mean hidden wallet? Go to File > New/Restore, choose a wallet name (any name) and connect using your HW device, enter PIN and correct PIN and correct passphrase + right derivation pathYou can find out right derivation path by the type of address you used in the past. Did it started with 1, 3, or bc1? According to this order, you choose one, two, or three option.Try this and you will succeed. As long as the balance is zero, I think your problem is in the last right derivation step. Otherwise, your problem is in one of the first steps.To access your standard wallet (first wallet or not hidden one), Go to File > New/Restore, choose a wallet name (any name) and connect using your HW device, enter PIN and correct PIN and make passphrase blank.you you will need new wallet file per account/derivation",

So I can sleep peacefully, knowing that there is no need of Ledger device for backing in possession of my wallet. I read that the Electrum is a cold wallet. Does it mean, that it runs when the PC is offline? If yes, in which way the  transactions does happen if the computer do not connect to internet?Thanks a lot!",

If Electrum doesn't detect your ledger, maybe something is wrong with the cable USB, or the Bitcoin application didn't install yet on the ledger application or you didn't Set up the udev rules. So if your problem with the last one, you have to set it up 1st by go to the terminal, and set it up by following the code:Code:wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bashhttps://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Fix-connection-issues?support=trueQuote from: guanabana on May 24, 2023, 06:59:54 PMI read that the Electrum is a cold wallet.

If yes, in which way the  transactions does happen if the computer do not connect to internet?Thanks a lot!Yes, you can run Electrum offline without being connected to the internet, you can use offline transactions until Sign, but for broadcast, you need the internet.On electrum 4.3.3, you have to carefully because the new update looks different when transaction. You have to click Preview tab when being new transaction appears tab sign and broadcast, so if you click OK the transaction being together with sign and broadcast.",

You might want to check this guide[1] or search about \"airgap setup\" on this board if you want to read further.[1] https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html",
