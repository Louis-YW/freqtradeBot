Another thing that motivates people to hold BTC is because they want to spend it like a currency that it is, and they wouldn't turn down the offer to spend BTC rather than fiat to any merchant that is open to accept it.Quote from: xanto on December 30, 2022, 07:37:50 PMPlease,answer only those who really own at least 1 bitcoinThough i answered your op, i do not have anything close to 1 BTC.",

They have to rent facilities to store it and guards to guard it. There is a storage issue. Bitcoin fixes that.Imagine someone who holds a large amount of money in their bank account and suddenly, their country decides to put capital controls and people can't withdraw their money. There is a liquidity issue. Bitcoin fixes that. Imagine someone who decides to send a payment to Africa and the banks require a 12% fee. There is a huge remmitance issue. Bitcoin fixes that.Imagine someone who wants to prove ownership of their property. There is a bureaucracy issue. Bitcoin fixes that.Imagine someone who sees their local currency being devastated by the exchange rates against dollar or euro. There is a massive attack on the local currency. Bitcoin fixes that.Imagine someone who holds lots of money in a bank account. If the government decide to inflate the monetary system, they can print money, causing people's money to lose its value. Bitcoin fixes that.Imagine lending money to someone and having to trust that they have the money to repay you. There is a trust issue. Bitcoin fixes that. In fact, Bitcoin solves the double-spending problem. Kudos to Satoshi and Adam Back.I believe in Bitcoin to be a superior monetary system, where everyone is equal. It's not about you and me, it's not about the people that have 100BTC, nor for those that have 100Sats. Every single one of us can be sovereign and maintain their own keys and their own nodes.Finally, Never forget how it all started \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\" - Satoshi Nakamoto.",

What majority of them don't understand is that btc investment is not like ponzi that promises to make you rich in overnight. Btc is gradually and a long time project that requires patience from investors. I think trading will be more suitable for their likes. The earlier they realize this, the better for them.",

Please,answer only those who really own at least 1 bitcoinThank you^ It is hard to accumulate 1 BTC now because it is very expensive, if you have, you are not a regular investor because you have that large sum in your wallet. I have under 1 BTC, a small amount that only I can afford to hold, I did not easily get panic because I know already the market sentiment and the market movement. I have been here in the crypto market for how many years so now I fully understand if there is a market crash and learned how to hold my asset while the market was in a bad situation. BTC has a smaller fraction than you want, there is no need to have a whole number because that is very expensive, you can even own a worth of $5 in your wallet.",
