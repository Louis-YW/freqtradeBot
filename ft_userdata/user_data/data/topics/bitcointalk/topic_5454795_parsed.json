On Telegram group for the Metropoly Bounty - Murat's group is called Tokensfund - this can be confirmed in his Bitcointalk thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5244401.msg61215531#msg61215531The following information appeared on April 14, 2023:On May 2, 2023 everything still looked fine:On May 4, 2023, the first strange things began:By strange things, I mean this: \"Looks like they will be paying\" - So until now Murat thought they wouldn't pay?The next and last updates came on May 7 and 8, 2023:Since that last announcemeent Telegram group has been blocked, so I tried to contact via bounty thread:Quote from: Fritwakky on May 11, 2023, 07:43:13 PM~skippedYou have blocked the ability to write on your Telegram group, so I will try to ask here about when the tokens for the Metropoly Bounty campaign will be paid out?Three days ago on Telegram you wrote:\"Metropoly sent only 62K tokens instead of 250K tokens. We are waiting for them to send the remaining tokens.\"Metropoly representatives on Telegram say you have been paid the correct amount of tokens.It is certain that someone is cheating. If you want to remove suspicion from yourself, then you should write us more details about this situation.(I also quoted this post in Murat's thread, but he deleted it - screenshots below.)There are also posts of other bounty participants in the bounty thread, but Murat never replied to any of them:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418627.msg62251384#msg62251384https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418627.msg62270491#msg62270491https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418627.msg62306582#msg62306582I don't have screenshots of my conversation with Metropoly representatives, but I got this one from other bounty participant:Anyway, my conversation looked almost the same.At this point, all bounty participants were deadlocked.Metropoly says the tokens are being sent to the Bounty Manager and there is no contact with Murat.I understand that there can be misunderstandings in businesses and they often require time to be cleared up.However, in this case, both sides are behaving very suspiciously.The Metropoly project does not want to confirm in any way how many tokens were sent to Murat.Murat blocks the group on Telegram and deletes posts asking for clarification from his self-moderated thead:I would like to believe that Murat is honest in this situation, but it is difficult to think so looking at his unprofessional behavior.I hope this thread will get Murat's attention and he finally explain what's going on.EDIT June 2, 2023After creating this thread, I informed Murat of its existence and asked for comment. Today (June 2, 2023) Murat deleted my post and as you can see there is no answer from him, so he still continues his behavior, i.e. silence.",

However, anything can happen.Has Metropoly said how many tokens they have paid to the bounty manager Murat? I can't see any number there from the Metropoly part. It's better if you ask how many tokens have been paid. Also, has Murat shared any address containing the tokens?I don't want to justify anyone here but in such cases, it's the project team who don't follow the campaign reward model which later, ruins the campaign manager's reputation. I'm sharing this from my experience.In a campaign I managed, the reward pool was 50k $TUP tokens. I asked the team whether I should ask for the ERC20 address or BEP20. The team has picked ERC20 with a promise to pay the fee from their pocket as usual. But later, they paid me ~0.22 ETH while I was required more than 1 ETH to cover the fees. I was in real trouble. The team doesn't want to pay more fees and hunters keep forcing me to distribute the token. I have no way to distribute it because the fee was too low to cover the txs. Later. I had to convert the token into USDT Polygon and shared in Polygon address.From that experience, I trust Murat over the team. You should ask the team how many tokens they had paid and ask to share the tx id. That will make everything transparent.",

Also, has Murat shared any address containing the tokens?From the chat between Op and Metropoly, I can deduce that Metropoly has paid Murat which Murat also acknowledged. But the payment is not in full, which is why Murat hasn't distributed the rewards. Then Metropoly is not willing to give out the total amount they paid Murat because they have not made a complete payment. It seems there is lack of communication between Murat and Metropoly and then more communication breach between Murat and the campaign participants. The group being locked raised the panic that resulted to this post, but then Murat said he locked it because of spam.I also trust Murat more than the team, but I think he needs to make an explicit clarification about the whole process incase Metropoly will decided to take another lane other than what was agreed.",

If you read carefully the main issue issue here, The problem is not about the change of bounty allocation but rather the team is claiming that they paid in full while the manager claims that the team is still not sending the remaining token. There’s a miscommunication or argument here on the total amount of token that will be distributed on bounty participants. The OP shows how the campaign manager is not sure on the exact amount of tokens which the team will be sent. There’s no such readjustment here but only a miscommunication about the total tokens allocated since the manager is still waiting for more tokens which the team is not aware.",

As the BM said on the opening post of the bounty that they have 250k of token available, worth 100k USD, for the bounty. If we assume Murat mean it's been escrowed and payment is secured, then the trace of the token's transfer will still be on their address. If we assume it's just a poorly worded sentence and that Murat was saying team is allocating 250k token, which not escrowed or being on Murat's possession, and then team said they've sent the amount in full to the BM, they can prove it by send us the TX ID.The one lied can be --hopefully-- proven through TX ID.

The first thing I planned to do was looking for their TG group to look for any update or announcement about payment, or to ask them the TX ID myself, as the one listed on the bounty page is no longer available. So, naturally, I go to their website, straight to their contact page... and stopped right there. [archived]Now, with their still-active tg group, I gave it a cursory look before wasting anyone's time joining the group just to ask something that's been explained or asked before, and it looks like someone already beat me to it.It might worth to mention that the device I use to take the screenshot is a dedicated device for forum purpose, so I intentionally matched the device time with forum's local time. That said, it's been 18 hours since that \"ASAP\" promise. Just gonna leave these nice couple of screenshot right there for community to decide the nature of the project itself.Nonetheless, as always, have to take every side of the story for consideration. So, for Murat, assuming you're aware of this thread's existence as you've been notified by OP, it will be very much appreciated and contributing to the case if you can provide us the TX ID yourself, given metropoly's community manager need a recalibration in the definition of \"as soon as possible\". If they haven't paid you in full like you claimed they hadn't --which is why you're yet to distribute the payment-- the hash could work as supporting evidence.",

Factoring out the why he accepted project with details as I said above [no license, no physical office, with questionable nature of real estate] and factoring in the sum of token value if he cheated it, I can't see how he'd like to risk his reputation for token that's --as the discussion on their group implied-- going south and steadily sinking.Nonetheless, given both side seems never responded here to give their side of story with proper evidence, and as how, up to this post was made, the TX ID promised by the admin of metropoly is yet to be shared, I think I have to dive further. I am joining the group and asking the hash as well as simultaneously reaching Murat through the DM on his TG, let's see what happen.Edit: HereEdit 2: Took some time, but here:Conversation with Metropoly's representativeInterestingly, their website, when clicked, will redirect us to send email to what's below picture shown, a tad bit different than what's written on their page, and when an email sent to that address as the site suggested, it'll bounce.Luckily for them, me, and all of us, I send the email to both account, to \"hello\" and to \"admin\". As I didn't get a bounce notification, I assume the email is successfully went through the \"admin\" address. Let's wait and see if they'll give any explanation about itMeanwhile, or simultaneously, the minute my conversation with Metropoly on telegram ended and I am going to move the conversation to email, Murat replied me, as follows:Conversation with MuratJust in case Murat is in certain binding terms with the team, I am blurring the TX ID until given permission by him to share it. However, I can confirm that the TX contain what he said on the opening post of OP as well as that the entire fund is still there, so the theory that Murat somewhat run away with the fund can be refuted for the time being.Edit 3: Just got a permission from Murat to publish the TX ID. The screenshot and the link as below:https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9f13e8f313d1bf85527e1fb419fa7e459028c999fb8d6d8513d7ccea95aa5bb1For anyone interested on researching this case further, I think you are more than welcome to conduct it with the current materials.",

Judging from:1. Their reluctance to share \"private\" contract like TX hash proof of payment.2. They asked me to send an email for that simple matter, to the one that listed on their page, that bounced, while the other email is yet to give me any reply up to this day3. They have no registeration for such an ambitious project that's definitely need a legal compliance in form of --at the very least-- registered company4. And given that when Murat finally provided TX ID himself to me and it is revealed that the transaction is indeed as he claimed, 62.5K token and it's still thereI'd like to extend the benefits of doubt to Murat that he's not the one cheated his bounty participants here, and instead, the \"company\" breached their contract. As for your suggestion, I think it is quite safe to assume, inferred from his reply to me and his post on his bounty group, that he's pursuing the matter periodically.Oh, by the way, they kicked me out from the group and deleted my chat. So that speaks volume too.",
