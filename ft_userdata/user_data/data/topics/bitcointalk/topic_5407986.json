Banks expect to be able to use those funds to generate revenue through loans/investments/etc so yes it would make sense that they have gov backed rules to control that.Then there is the issue of Debit cards which some folks love to use instead of carrying cash. When you use one that is a direct withdrawal from the acct it is tied to and that makes it very easy for folks using them to do more than 6 tx's in a single day...",

We can deposit as much as we want, they never give us a hard time, but when we want to withdraw they will find a way to slow down the process. Lol, that's how most banks are doing.Quote from: NotFuzzyWarm on July 29, 2022, 02:20:22 AMWhat country do you live in?

For example, I can deposit 1000$ or 10000$ in my account but I can only withdraw no more than 1000$/day. If I want to withdraw more than the specified amount, I have to go to the bank and give them full identification and the reason for the withdrawal. They do the procedure for me to withdraw money.",

Maybe we are in a recession, however, even in a developing country that I live, never heard of this prior even in the 2008-2009 economic crisis.But it just highlight was crypto can overcome this traditional system. Nevertheless, there are crypto exchanges at least our local exchange that you have to go to KYC to be able to have a good cash-in/cash out protoocls.",

All the rest, satisfied with the way banks work, give them their money with reverence and, as you rightly noted, then beg with humiliation for their money back. It is impossible to call it otherwise than a humiliation with all these begging, confirmations and evidence that it is you who have the right to your money. Banks have double standards: they carefully check the account owner, block transfers and create a bunch of various obstacles, but when scammers rob bank users (not a rare occurrence in my country), they shrug their shoulders, unable to help. Then why are they needed at all? Owner transactions are blocked, but fraudsters are not. It's not a normal practice. It is like a lock that the owner cannot open, but unlocks at the sight of thieves.
