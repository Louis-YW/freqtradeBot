  "content": "In the past weeks we have heardÂ  in the news about Donald Trump intent to make bitcoin a strategic reserve for the USA and also how the US Fed Reserve chair Jerome Powell had to make a counter statement against Trump's purported move by saying the US Fed reserve isn't allowed by law to hold bitcoin as reserve (subject to congressional ratification)As the days locomotes more and more countries are considering taking same decision as El Salvador, and it's as though some of these countries are waiting for a major influential catalyst like the US before keying in. Hence, i was contemplating within about how should the BRICS go ahead before the US to adopt bitcoin as reserve while Trump is waiting for Congress validation.Would it make a much positive drive on bitcoin price as we anticipate the market would be with the US? And at the level of the geopolitical-cum-economic war (we all know what's happening there between these two poles) what do you suggest could be the implication of such phenomenal action on the BRICS for nations who are already considering on adopting bitcoin? For what will this mean for the US!",

Though if BRICS were to get ahead of the US I could also see a 180 happening on their current stance, with steps taken against Bitcoin to devalue BRICS' Bitcoin reserves. Then again most nations learned at this point that the fight against Bitcoin is an uphill battle so that doesn't seem all too likely.",

Why so much believe the word lyes on the US?Unto you Op, I think Question I get to ask too What if the decline of the US economy Chairman from the proposal of the Donald Trump to adopt bitcoin for national reserve was a political game with the political promises that he'd make bitcoin an Fed economy reserve during his just to grab his votes and supports the adoption of bitcoin?Then I think it'd be a setback hopping and anticipating on this of both geopolitical regions.Let who's ready take the lead and based on their perspective globally influences they'd both trigger massive adoptions.",

So in short, any shift of monetary policies by the US will affect them. Or the other hand, US or at least Trump's administration now is talking about making Bitcoin as a national reserve. And if doing so, BRICS will be trap or put in the corner again. So if BRICS decided to get ahead, then there could be a race between them and the US as for who will have stockpile of Bitcoin. But it doesn't mean though that the winner could be in control. It's interesting scenario, but in the end, it's a win-win scenario for Bitcoin holders.",

They can go faster or slower than the USA and another ally but when the race kicks off, nations with bigger economic size can do it better if they change their national vision and policies, they can speed up their Bitcoin adoption and Bitcoin reserves very easily.",

Bitcoin is the revolution in financial system and the US can't afford to lose that competition. If BRICS countries adopt Bitcoin and the USA will see this as a threat, then the USA will adopt it better. The US has much more resources than BRICS countries, except China, China is a country capable of building many great things but we shouldn't underestimate that there is a Japan and South Korea on US's side.

BRICS countries, compared to USA, can afford riskier steps in economy. What will Brazil lose if they create a strategic Bitcoin reserves? Not much, compared with the US.",

It's interesting scenario, but in the end, it's a win-win scenario for Bitcoin holders.If look into the names of countries in BRICS, there only two countries that are slowly becoming economic power house. The first is China, which might become an economic power house in a decade time shadowing the US and the next is India. They are the ones with big population and a bigger market. They both are the ones who hate Bitcoin and other crypto because they believe it is used mainly for money laundering. They both have already started rolling out CBDC for thier general population. If these two countries come out with a regulation then only others will follow. As of now there nothing in news or in papers about it",

If BRICS is uncertain with its success, I think it is too far to concern about what will happen with Bitcoin reserves for nations in BRICS. The US allies you want to hear is NATO, right? Well it's simple to note that USA is NATO and NATO is USA because they are the one country which gives that alliance the esteemed relevance it possesses. However, I will avoid to dwell on that politics because that's not what the thread treats but bitcoin with the possibility of adoption as reserve, and so we should keep it that way.Secondly, what's this about including the US allies to the discuss, is it US allies that are pushing for a bitcoin strategic reserve or it's just the US as a sovereign entity?The idea behind the creation of the BRICS was to achieve a delink of those countries involved from the use of the US dollar against the stronghold/dominance it has on their countries economy and local currency.Â  It wasn't about NATO since there are NATO countries that doesn't use the US dollar but euro (â¬).",

There is no guarantee that this idea will come to fruition as most of those countries' central banks have already rejected the idea.

The bitcoins the US holds from Silk Road are held by the US Department of Justice, it has nothing to do with the Fed and I don't think US law allows for the use of seized assets as national reserves. So if they want to build a bitcoin reserve, they need to use government money and start from zero like other countries. They are just the first country to come up with this idea, they are not ahead of any other country because they have not started implementing this idea yet.",

Anyone who sells them bitcoins or they buy bitcoins or any other asset is only for their business purposes. Second: national reserves are a very important thing and any changes need to be proposed, discussed and approved. No agency or government does it arbitrarily and without regulation. Bitcoin is just an emerging asset class in the world, we don't need to hype things up more than necessary. Bitcoin reserves are just an idea, a rumor, and Bitcoins are not so important that governments should secretly and frantically buy them. It has been reported that: the US Department of Justice has reportedly received court approval to sell $6.5 billion worth of bitcoins it seized from Silk Road. It seems like they are desperate to sell them and have been waiting for it for a long time, don't think they are quietly accumulating them for years. They don't care about bitcoin as much as we think.https://x.com/tier10k/status/1877176406905356670",
