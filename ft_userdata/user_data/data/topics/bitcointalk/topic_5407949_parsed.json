  "content": "Should you invest in ICO? Defi? NFT's? or what more.. One side of crypto is a lucrative option then any other form of investment today but, the other side is in the dark. So, i am not talking about the bad sides you can find many in the internet, but here i am today going to share how do i choose better projects to look upon for the investment or any kind of participation.Use Casesthe first thing i see in any project is the use case. Is the project define any better use case. though this does't alone guaranty a successful position but it can be a good reason to get a well supportive project.Non Repeatedthis is to be checked cleaverly. you must look wheather the project is a unique identity, improvised repeat or fully copied repeat. you might think i will go with unque project, but thats not always true, yeah, i find that the success ratio for very unique project is much less then the improvised one. it is not that i totally ignore the unique project, but i choose very carefull when selecting the unique projects. whereas, if it is a improvised project it may have updated skills then the previous one. my focus will now set on the other terms to check the project like team and other records.Teamteam is most important part, it really matter who is in the board. the decision maker should have a powerful approach for the project. and it generally reflects from the beginning of project, you must look into the project as a customer or user to find its powerful approach, and stop thinking as an investor.Business Sensedoes the project showing a better business sense. yes many of project i found around reflect some sort of uniqueness and making people curioius but on the other side i found lack of business sense and thus most of them if not all, fails to reach on target.In all, the universe of investable cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products and services is still small and requires careful evaluation. If you find it useful kindly appreciate my time and words.",

The best place to determine the kind of projects that are coming up can be checked on the Bounty Board.QuoteUse CasesI only look for projects that have use cases in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. I have seen many real word projects either dying out or being unable to sustain for the long term.That's a good idea actually. We don't know how good coins with real world use cases might perform but we can actually get a really good insight for the coins with crypto ecosystem usecase. For instance using DOT for cross chain interoperability is quite a unique idea.QuoteQuoteNon RepeatedThere are several successful projects which are nothing but an upgraded version of an existing project. They have been very successful. It all depends on how effective a project is and whether is it able to solve the pain area.Again, that's very true. Even I have noticed projects which are a better version of existing projects.They performed really well when compared to previous projects. We just have to find out how the project is making the same thing better.",
