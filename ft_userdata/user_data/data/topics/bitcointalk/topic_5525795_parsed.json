No. Having more nodes can not solve the congestion. Having more nodes can help in making the network more decentralized. If talking of network congestion, this is another discussion entirely that is not about nodes nor about decentralizing the bitcoin network.",

In first couple of years you could mine bitcoin using your PC (CPU mining) so every node was also a miner and every miner was a node.Today they are more separated, a miner needs to purchase mining hardware (ASIC) and they mostly don't even run a node, instead they connect to a mining pool that runs it for them.",

      "body": "The OP's subject line practically contradicts itself: Bitcoin hit a scale ceiling about six months after it started, and it's only gotten slower and more expensive since then.Bitcoin handles about 500k transactions per day right now, and uses $20B-40B in hardware to do so.In contrast, worldwide daily credit card processors handle about 2-4 billion transactions per day, and at peak times can process over one million transactions per second.Bitcoin was never ever designed to be a mainstream currency that people use every day to pay for things--Satoshi was no idiot, and he* knew that his architecture would not support that. Bitcoin was designed to be intentionally slow and expensive to transact, which is what gives it it's security and decentralization. The blockchain architecture has one unique advantage (and only one): to thwart government control over the network and thus allow transactions to proceed that one or more governments would wish to stop. If you don't want to accomplish this, then using the blockchain architecture is a stupid waste of time and computing resources because every other feature Bitcoin has can be accomplished cheaper and faster and better in other ways.But the performance tax you pay for this feature is that it will never ever scale to anything close to mainstream.As for true decentralization per Bitcoin's original purpose, it's worth noting that today there are just a few, very identifiable, publicly known companies that control the majority of the Bitcoin hashrate. Yes, there are thousands of nodes, but there are only perhaps 3-5 legal entities in the world that matter, and those entities could be compelled by (say) the US government to do whatever they wanted them--so Bitcoin ins't really \"decentralized\" in the way it originally was anyhow.For Bitcoin's purpose today, which is a meme investment that is fronted by centralized apps and brokers, there is no scalability problem that anybody cares about.(* We don't know if Satoshi was a \"he\", \"she\", or a dev team at the NSA/CIA, but I'm just using that terminology for brevity).",

With transactions been done in segwit you have the signatures moved from the inputs there by creating more space left by scripts and technically instead of actually having a block of 1Mb you end up having more like 4Mb since the calculations now is in weight, which means more space for more transactions and lesser fees to be paid",
