If so at least that should be good for at least paying off the infra and miner gear debts so the mega-mining companies are certainly not hurting much.",

It is just that people do it, even if there are the same reasons as for a data center that speak against it.Because in a 'real' DC people want walls and doors and security and redundant cooling and humidity control  and redundant power backup and power conditioning and lots of other things. I can add a lot of power and racks and massive fans and some cooling to an existing warehouse and mine there. But in the end it's a converted warehouse. There is nothing wrong with that, it works fine for that. Quick and simple and fairly inexpensive. When building new if you are getting money from VCs or from any other source it does matter. If you are building new and the area is not going to want / need another warehouse of that size or in that location then your business plan better have another use for the building or it's going to be hard to get money to build it or possibly even permits from the locality. -Dave",

Mining equipment must work.Well in Texas space and power are cheap, west Texas is dry so water wall cooling works well.Cheap power is probably the main driver of any farm. Purchase power agreements (and/or riders) that in a nutshell we will sell you this power deeply discounted when in excess (in the case of TX wind) and we will reward you as well when we need you to idle. The math makes it work out for everyone. Here is a rider from my local power authority here in Oklahoma. They also have an agreement to \"source\" power from Hydro and wind to satisfy ESG requirements if desired.https://grda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Rider-BTC-R-1-effective-2021.11.01.pdf",

Of course it is more than RIOT earned from mining in August - most of their miners were shut off so power could be used elsewhere....The 'normal' consumers of power in Texas are *not* spending/losing money on this. When farms are at full power they pay ERCOT far more than what ERCOT credits them when usage needs to cut back. It is a win-win for all parties involved: ERCOT is able to finance building more wind/solar farms because they have a few non-critical but still massive users of the power that justify building more capacity but they also do not have to be too concerned when the wind dies down and the sun sets during scorching hot weather. Riot and the other mega farms simply throttle down so the remaining power can be used where it is really needed.Because the Texas grid cannot send excess power to other states they would be hard pressed to justify building more solar/wind farms just to satisfy peak loads and have 'excess' power capacity wasted during good weather.",
