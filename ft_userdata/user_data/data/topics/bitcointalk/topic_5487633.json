Bitcoin will always be the flagship coin for me and the best store of value in the crypto market, its rarity of only 21 million coins available makes it both a hedge against inflation and a long term investment opportunity.Until now I have not been interested in investing in meme coins even though they can offer high returns, the low market capitalization and lack of regulation can make meme coins very vulnerable to price manipulation and fraudulent schemes. Market volatility can also make investing in Meme coin very risky as its value can fluctuate rapidly based on changes in demand and other market factors.",

Bitcoin is global money.Meme coins are useless little things whose entire value is based on people buying it for its name or logo. Literally anyone can make a meme coin. It's an endless supply, with no utility backing it up. Meme coins are 100% get-rich-quick speculation with nothing backing them up. They are purely for trading, and very very risky.It's like asking if a kid in a lemonade stand on a street corner can challenge McDonalds in the food business.If you're seriously asking this question you should start learning a lot more about Bitcoin and Crypto, and also about investing, money, and what makes things valuable in the first place.",

Anybody to that move his fund from bitcoin to meme coin does not do it because of meme coin challenging btc but to make profit because as btc is rising by %10 so are some altcoin rising by %50 or above. But that does not imply that those meme coin is challenging btc in any ways. If you check binance and any other exchange right now you will discover that those meme coin you claim is challenging bitcoin are declining and BTC is still rising. Btc rose to $69k while Shiba,doge and Pepe are dropping so btc is alway btc and can not be compared with any other. I have seen many alt/shit/meme coin that challenged btc but all are no where to be found today. Btc has more reliable features compeard to meme coins. One factor is the total number in supply, market capitalization, market dominance.",

Well, they got hyped because of Bitcoin's sudden rise in the past few weeks. I mean in times when Bitcoin goes up in price, so do altcoins, but not instantly. Don't look at meme coins too high. You might lose your money investing in it. Quote from: ryannw on March 05, 2024, 12:47:48 PMLot of bitcoin users would now feel tempted to move their funds to these meme coins for higher profit. At such, do you think that any meme coin has the capacity to challenge bitcoin dominance ? Eh? Where did you get this idea? Do you have numbers to back it up? I'm a Bitcoin holder, but I'm not even thinking of selling it just to buy those meme coins especially now that it went up in price already. Any meme coin can challenge Bitcoin's dominance? Are you kidding me? Are you a meme coin maximalist think about that. Ok, I'll just assume that you're a newbie in investing, and meme coins are the first thing that you saw in Coingecko or Coinmarketcap hence, you are posting threads like this.  Not even Ethereum can challenge Bitcoin's dominance so why think about it with meme coins? If I were you, I would not look at meme coins that high because TBH, they are very risky to invest in. Maybe those meme coins at the top 100 are considerable, but those below? You can invest still though, but be careful, and most meme coins don't have any use case at all so for me, they are considered useless.",

Lot of bitcoin users would now feel tempted to move their funds to these meme coins for higher profit. At such, do you think that any meme coin has the capacity to challenge bitcoin dominance ? That's a fairly simple question, and the answer is no. Some coins can have some lucky growth due to pumping, speculations or just catching the wave of overall market growth. But challenging Bitcoin is not just about the price increasing significantly and fast. It's mainly about market capitalization, as that's how we measure which coins are at the top. Bitcoin has a capitalization of over $1 trillion, while Pepe is at $2.6 billion. So, to challenge Bitcoin, it would have to grow not by 4x (400%) but by 500x (50000%). I hope that alone shows how unrealistic this is.",

Lot of bitcoin users would now feel tempted to move their funds to these meme coins for higher profit. At such, do you think that any meme coin has the capacity to challenge bitcoin dominance ? To replace Bitcoin? This question is not just thoughtfully asked. Bitcoin and meme coins are not just in the same class, and as we all know meme coins are for the representation and fun of it, so why would something as unserious as that replace Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the number one cryptocurrency and has good relevance due to that, and whatever positive thing you are hearing in the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin leads it and keeps moving the industry forward. A typical example is the ETF of late. Fine, Bitcoin is heavy, it may not move as hugely as meme coins when it comes to the multiple times it could count the income for the investors' return, but don't also forget that it had done that before when it was still very small in price, so let's give it to it.Now, Bitcoin may not move in that multiples to deliver the income, but meme coins cannot also reach the huge importance and dominate of Bitcoin, not to mention the huge liquidity of its market capitalizations. Billions are being pumped to Bitcoin as if it were nothing while a few million are being pumped to meme coins. And when it comes to the relevance and what the big guys and institutional investors and traders want to deal with, it's all Bitcoin. So I do not know where the challenge from meme coins is coming from, they are even far from it, you could be talking about Ethereum to make a more valid point even as Ethereum is still far from Bitcoin in terms of dominance and relevance in the industry.",

Recently, we've seen a surge in interest in meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, leading to sharp increases in their value. However, I believe that Bitcoin will remain the leading cryptocurrency for the foreseeable future. While meme coins may attract attention and create short-term speculative waves, their long-term sustainability and value are questionable. In contrast, Bitcoin has an established history, widespread recognition, and proven reliability as an investment asset and store of value.",
