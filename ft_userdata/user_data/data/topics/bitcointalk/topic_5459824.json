  "content": "I don't know how effective all these bitcoin mixers are or what they charge, though there is a better way...Railgun is a Zero Knowledge Proof based privacy app / wallet currently live on Polygon, Ethereum and BSC. Whilst it isn't merely a mixer it can effectively function like one, though it allows you to use the entire liquidity of the chain's decentralised exchanges as a privacy set. Which on polygon, Ethereum and BSC is obviously billions. So for instance to anonymise BTC simply bridge to wBTC on Polygon and deposit into Railgun. ( 0.25% fee). If the privacy set is adequate for your needs then simply wait for other transactions to mask your transactions and then withdraw to a fresh wallet ( 0.25% fee). Bridge back to BTC and you have untraceable bitcoin. If the privacy set in inadequate for your needs then after depositing you can use the private DEX feature to swap your wBTC into USDC, USDT, Eth, Matic or whatever else has an adequate privacy set ( 0.5% fee as it is both a withdraw and deposit of the new token). Wait for sufficient volume in transacted assets to mask and then withdraw to fresh wallet / wallets ( 0.25% fee). You can then swap back from clean wallets and bridge your wBTC back to the bitcoin network for clean, untraceable bicoin. Hence in the best case the round trip will cost 0.5% + gas fees, which are pennies on Polygon. Worst case it will be 1% + gas fees + dex trade fees (generally 0.05% on Uniswap V3 for major currencies). For maximum privacy the longer the assets are held within Railgun the greater the anonymity as more transactions mask your own and the privacy set increases. You can also privately transfer to another 0zk account within Railgun fee free. For paying salaries anonymously or OTC sales settled entirely onchain and anonymously for instance. DYOR but it works....",

But problem with exchanges are they are highly regulated, a crypto user don't like it.I don't know what you are offering but it looks like an exchange [swap site] running by a warped token.",
