Maybe if you describe your problem in a little more detail someone might be able to help you.  Like whats the actual problem you hit when trying to hook up OneKey to Electrum? Did some error message pop up? and what steps you have taken to troubleshoot so far? The more information you share, the more likely we will find a solution to your problem.",
