I have a Pakistani friend - who told me - that during COVID there was no jobs and people were laid off from their jobs, most of them started leaning freelancing. and during the fiscal year 2020-2021 the freelance brough 3 billion revenue to the country. Try to be an influencer tell people how they can earn money. Which region are you from?",

Under modernization, people exchanged self sufficient farms for cities and global markets. Skilled labor for mechanization and automation. Recently we've seen trends in the opposite direction. People are abandoning cities and moving to rural areas to engage in off grid living. The high cost of fossil fuels is causing people to seek more local options. Skilled labor could be on the rise once again with DIY movements and processes like 3d printing. The high cost of living is making it popular for DIY options, due to the less feasible cost of hiring a professional.I think those future trends which can be predicted and observed define a direction for an improving economy. Essentially things that used to be affordable and viable are becoming less so in our current era. Which is forcing us to seek alternatives. Fast tracking said alternatives is better for standard of living. Anything that accelerates or supports the transition process could fuel an economic boost. Productivity is usually a big part of it. Boost productivity, create wealth and value. Distribute rewards evenly. Reduce things that destroy productivity and wealth.",

      "body": "Depends on what country are you currently in. If it is a third world country, ut is obvious that it would be tough because corruption is high in those countries ( actually likewise with my country). There are many ways to boost an economy of a country such as boosting tourism, supporting exportation of your own goods, and the likes. Adapting to technology would also be great if your country's economy would be able to do so. But as I said, plans won't make it easy, how a government would react will be crucial. In my country, Industrialization is visioned to make changes, but I guess agricultural sectors should be prioritize because I consider it as my country's asset. Feel free to guess my country haha.",

First mandatory stepDon't vote for an imbecile who is all talk promising you everything will be great and he will do marvels in 4 (or 5) years.The moment the population votes only with the slogans and not with somebody presenting the reality and the mandatory hardships of switching the country to the right path it will be just another 4 years of wasted time and sometimes making things worse.Quote from: Hydrogen on September 12, 2022, 02:37:44 PMUnder modernization, people exchanged self sufficient farms for cities and global markets.

I have both of them, last year I spent like around 100euros on the heating of the flat around 100sq mp and 5 times more for the house although I've been there only maximum 8-10 days a month, the rest of the period the heating was left on minimal to prevent damage.3d printing? You can't afford to rent in the city but you can go and buy a 3d printer and the material for it?Gas? So you leave the city behind where you can use the metro or the bus and you go deep into the woods where if an emergency happens you have to drive 100km back to it? What about groceries? What about work?",

Here I believe we are capable of analyzing your own economy and if you see something unprofitable, do what you can to try and fix it even if it is difficult or expensive. GDP, unemployment rate, and these types of economic indicators. These numbers can be manipulated so don't let them influence how you think about your economy.",
