  "content": "The military aggression of the Russian Federation against the independence of Ukraine continues for the ninth month. Why am I a resident of Ukraine, entering the branch of the Russian locale, should see the topic \"politics\"? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=91.0In which the Russians are openly promoting their war, calling for the destruction of my country and my people? Why is the Russian locale run by two Russian Nazis xandry and Xal0lex? Supporting and not deleting the posts of Russian assassins? And they delete the posts of those who support the Ukrainians. I remind you that this forum is the Western world. And he must support the sanctions that the whole world has imposed against Russia.I demand from the administration of this forum to remove the topic \"politics\" from the Russian locale https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=91.0 which offends my feelings, and the feelings of the citizens of my country Ukraine. Who are suffering right now from the war that the Russians started. If the administration of the forum does not comply with my requirement. I will apply to all supervisory authorities of the EU and the US to hold the administration of this forum accountable. I sincerely hope that the administration will meet the needs of the entire Ukrainian community of this forum and fulfill our demands.Sorry for my English.",

I know I have been able to say things on this forum that would have been censored on social media. On Twitter before Musk came in I would have been banned for sure. Good thing we have someone in charge who respects freedom of speech. Those who don't respect it are usually for opinion contrary to their own, but theirs they don't want censored.As for the topic of the Russian forum, I don't know Russian either and I'm not going to get involved by using a translator, but I think that everything that is not death threats from one forum member to another or things like that will come to nothing because of the forum policy that we are discussing.What I do understand that theymos should somehow make sure is that only posts from one side are not censored. That is, see if it is true that pro-Russian or pro-war opinions are not censored and those supporting Ukraine are. I don't know exactly how the situation is on that board, but if the two moderators are from one side, there should be at least one moderator from the other. Or better just one of each.

You'll never see this in a place where everyone is striving to be politically correct and just won't speak their minds.
