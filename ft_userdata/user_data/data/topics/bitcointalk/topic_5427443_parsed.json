  "content": "When we were kids, reading was encouraged by our parents and teachers because we had to go to school and pass exams. Grades might be the biggest drive to read/learn although grades sometimes don't equal knowledge. As we grow up, whether we go to college or not, reading means so much more. We learn a lot of lessons from reading and later examine them in life. We enrich our mind through reading as our life and experiences are limited. We discover the laws of nature and human societies to guide our life and predict the future thanks to reading. The list goes on and on... What is your opinion on reading ? or simply what is the book you have read recently and what have you learned from it ?",

It's true that our mind has to be occupied every day, otherwise we'll get bored or crazy. All the gains we talked about are beneficial in a long term. Better start reading today and keep it as a ritual.",

Reading guidelines are necessary for young students, hopefully nowadays parents should spare more time watching their kids read.",

It is much more difficult to be done than others because it takes a lot of time and needs readers to calm down and think deep as well. I believe this is a rare ability to acquire for most people nowadays.Quote from: DeathAngel on December 13, 2022, 02:04:48 PMI don’t read novels or anything like that, I see them as pointless & a waste of time.

It will open your eyes & probably confirm to you why you are here on this forum. Readings on finance and cryptocurrency are rewarding because you can easily measure their \"output\" so that you like them. In contrast, novels reading is not for acquiring specific skills or money-making but purely for a better understanding of human nature and society. Being educated by our physical surroundings is not enough and a spiritual education or reflection from other people's experiences is essential for personal growth. You may get shocked to look back on what you believed ten years from now and never realize how the change happened. Things like novel-reading might be one of the factors.Quote from: scifiant on December 12, 2022, 01:48:37 PMReading is priceless, not only for gaining knowledge on specific topics but also when it comes to general knowledge, one's vocabulary, a better understanding of human nature...the list is miles long. And I do agree, the parents should encourage their children to read and pay close attention to what they're reading, as some books can do damage when read before the abilities to understand them have developed. Exactly. reading has a very large scope of tangible and intangible gains. To better understand human nature is the core value. You are welcome to share great books you or your children have recently read. Cheers.",
