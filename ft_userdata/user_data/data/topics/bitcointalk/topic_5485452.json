  "content": "My Bitcoin Investment I thanks God I am back to continue the knowledge of bitcoin and it Blockchain, within this period which I was absent from the forum, I have learn more and I have also taught many people and some of them also invested in bitcoin some times I used some of the good quality posts for reference, I have not stopped my learning. And today I am a good investor. So far so good I have invested 0.05494075 BTC..In January 1, 2023, I made my first purchased of bitcoin My First Bitcoin on the New Year Day 2023. and after that I purchased it massively when the price was low as $23+k as of of early (first 4 months) 2023 and after then I used DCA to accumulate every week and month and today I have a good number or amount of bitcoin for my level. And I am not competing with anyone but to my level. I have bitcoin now.  I was planning to have 1 bitcoin but at a time the school expenses were much so I have to stop and hodle the once I have acquired. I think this is the time for me to excite my joy. I have invested some reasonable amount of bitcoin before the halving and the Bull Market. At first I was keeping my coins in the Exchange where I bought my coins but later when I discovered that it is not saved for me to keep them there, then I created an Electrum wallet which I have asked question on it last year , so I transferred all the coins to the newly created wallet and printed out the seed phrase and laminated it and keep it in a safe place and also photocopy two extra and store it in different locations. I will like to thanks those who taught me wallet from one way or the other in the forum. Such as LoyceMobile, NeuroticFish, Charles-Tim, joniboini, Rruchi man, SquirrelJulietGarden, Peanutswar. And special greeting to The Cryptovator, The Sceptical Chymist, rby, Rikafip, SamReomo, GeorgeJohn, CryptoHeadlineNews, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange, Franctoshi, Sandra_hakeem, Eh Moo Nah, SmartGold01, Mpamaegbu, Adbitco. Thanks you all.DiMarxist.",

      "body": "Wow! After a year, you have acquired this much bitcoin and it was through DCA as well. I would say that that is really admirable and inspiring especially for those who do not think they can’t afford bitcoin. In just a year or maybe even less, you could accumulate bitcoin depending on how much you want to have.This makes me want to work even harder and try to have as much bitcoin as you have now. While it is truly such an amazing milestone, I would advise for you to not share exactly how much bitcoin you have. The world is a dangerous place and whether that is on the internet or somewhere else, there are still lots of ill-intentioned people. I am wishing you all the best and good luck!",

I think your nice story illustrates how a simple man with a humble means can still make it big with Bitcoin investing. I know that saving money for cryptocurrency is not an easy task since we are dealing also with the reality of rising cost of living - like inflation everywhere is so real. Now, despite these many challenges hampering us everyday you never give up and continue your dream of owning Bitcoin just before the coming halving in April. What are the reasons for accumulating Bitcoin...is it to use it for future plans?",

It's not even done yet. It's just about to start spiking. You got in at a good time. I hope you already have a level you want to start taking profit before the noise begins. The excitement will make many overstay in the market. Once the excitement begins you may be tempted to get more greedy and that's not  good. I said when to start taking profit and that's because you don't want to quit the market at once. Take profit gradually once it touches your line of exit because it can still go way past it and you don't want to be on the sidelines with remorse.",

This is very necessary for any new investor to understand the market in which he intends to invest.You also made a good decision when you transferred your assets from the central exchange to a secure wallet where the seed and private key can be kept in a safe place away from the risks and problems of central exchanges.In addition to that, continuing the DCA policy in the long term is also a very good decision because holding in the long term is better than speculation and exposure to losses due to fluctuations.Congratulation.",

OP you have done a method that is suitable for anyone and DCA is able to provide a gap between looking at profits, usually when I do DCA every week I record how much I spend and at what price I enter.

Bitcoin (BTC) is more than just trading, that's the insight I've inspired so far, maybe in the next halving we'll see Bitcoin (BTC) hit $100K and your investment will be around $5.7K. It will get bigger as your weekly accumulation continues, well, it would be a beautiful story if we actually go to the moon during the next halving .",

Because you keep on learning about bitcoin investments, you may stop at one point, but the important thing is that you keep on pursuing bitcoin or your passion. You have to stay dedicated to bitcoin investment as it is hard to deal with. It will take time and effort for you to master it or to even earn efficiently. And from the looks of it, you've gained quite an amount of bitcoin; it is a big or good amount of holdings. I hope you keep on holding that as the exciting event will come, and I'm sure your holdings will increase more.

Of course, you have your agenda like others similar to you whom I have faced more times than I can recall.Why he can't dump his stash? He is the one who invested to get that stash of Satoshi?
