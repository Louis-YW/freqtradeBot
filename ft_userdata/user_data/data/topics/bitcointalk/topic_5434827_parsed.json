Practically de-civilization is impossible unless or until the destruction of the earth (as in the film named 2012), where we would have to rebuild the whole civilization. Policies might be different, but it doesn't means we are being pushed towards de-civilization.",

The rate at which civilization and technological advancement is growing, one can only but wonder, if any thing can stop that. Today the world is talking about cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology ect, which has transformed the world with its potentials, so it's just not possible for us to make a U-turn and start an unthinkable DE-CIVILIZATION.",

Rather, it is the destruction of the civilized way that people work together, freely, to build society structure that makes life easier for all.When people become compartmentalized - the  butchers, the bakers, the machinists, the doctors, the farmers, the crypto-enthusiasts, etc. - if somebody disrupts their system, they all have a more difficult time, and some even die. When they are in turmoil like that, it is much easier for somebody else who is strong, to fight them and conquer them.That's the idea behind de-civilization. The big de-civilization makers seem to have either decided that it isn't working, or they have decided that now is a good time to let it continue on its own. But maybe they have developed AI to such a point that they can change their direction of their operations.Klaus Schwab, George Soros Pull Out of WEF Davos Summit At The Last Minutehttps://newspunch.com/klaus-schwab-george-soros-pull-out-of-wef-davos-summit-at-the-last-minute/Klaus Schwab has followed George Soros in suddenly pulling out of the World Economic Forum annual summit in Davos, being held from today until January 20.Citing an unexpected \"scheduling conflict\", Soros announced on the weekend that he would not be attending the WEF meeting on Monday.----------George Soros@georgesoros·FollowDue to an unavoidable scheduling conflict, regrettably I cannot attend the @WEF Annual Meeting in Davos this year as I have in past years.
