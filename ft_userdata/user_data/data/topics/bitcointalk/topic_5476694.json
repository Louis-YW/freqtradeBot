  "content": "I see binance has posted bitcointalk forum on its social media,Speaking of news, this feature has been around for a while but I usually only trade assets there. One website or app brings together technicals and fundamentals, for me it's social media for crytpo activists ExampleBinance might as well reward the community for its worthy unity of purpose and togetherness in giving it a platform.Do you think the news written by binance users can be accounted for in terms of its veracity?Or maybe you've been writing and reading binance square for a long time?Maybe bitcointalk forum users will increase after binance wrote, or maybe there will be a similar Cex who wrote bitcointalk on his social media, either in momentum or history in the future.For me, it's like a chat room feature but not limited and even highlighted on the homepage, cex integrates social media. Later social media will follow the development with the existence of wallet features, trading etc.example hey wallet Although it takes time and with different techniques.Do you (new user) also know bitcointalk forum from there?

      "body": "I think differently than you. Binance posted about Bitcointalk on their X account, social media accounts because they know Bitcoin is the biggest asset in cryptocurrency market and related to Bitcoin, Bitcointalk is not only part of history of its growth but also still is biggest community for Bitcoin discussion and developments.I would say the opposite than you, Binance used Bitcointalk to show that they understand about Bitcoin history and hope that those posts will make their exchanges look to be more knowledgeable than other exchanges.",

Quote from: johnsaributua on December 05, 2023, 11:43:38 PMDo you (new user) also know bitcointalk forum from there? Welcome This is not the first time an exchange has posted about Bitcointalk.org seems like the first for Binance (they posted it twice) and I really don’t know if that will affect the number of newbies that will pop up on the forum but I’m sure that some that have never heard about Bitcointalk might be interested to see the forum that Satoshi was a part of and that’s what will drive them to the forum… some might create an account while others will just visit as a guess.If you have read threads where users talk about how they discovered bitcointalk you’ll read similar stories of how they saw the link in a famous user post and then curiosity drove them to check it out themselves and eventually they fell in love with the forum and that’s how they have kept posting till this day.",

Anyone with a Binance account can post what they like, as Binance Square is open to everyone. There are many more reliable sources from which we can receive news.Quote from: johnsaributua on December 05, 2023, 11:43:38 PMMaybe bitcoin talk forum users will increase after Binance wrote, or maybe there will be a similar Cex who wrote bitcoin talk on his social media, either in momentum or history in the future.Bitcointalk forum is eight years older than Binance; Binance was launched in 2017, and BTT is the main forum for Bitcoin. I don't think there is a centralized platform whose team is unfamiliar with this forum. If they indirectly promote the forum, that's a good thing. I hope that new members coming from there will use hardware wallets instead of using their CEX platforms.",

I can't vividly remember if those were like giveaways or actual bounties and that's why they've got some idea about our community here.They know where they've started and just like the other successful projects these days, this is the place where they have all come from before they've left this space and finally focused on their own journeys. Well, if they can give some credits by just including the image of the forum on their articles or tweets or posts, that's already good enough IMO.",

      "body": "Yes, I agree that it's more appropriate for their purpose to commemorate history and a good event, but I think bitcointalk is also a pioneer and a forum that is getting bigger, to this day there are many newbies who have just registered and old members who have been actively discussing for years.  For me binance is taking a good step if that is the goal, indeed these people's writings are without links and basic reasons because there are no community guidelines and standards in writing procedures, but for entertainment and fud and fomo events maybe free  directly on the exchanger for all decisions. I'm quite comfortable with binance's updated system and ui/ux even though my assets only pass through exchanging to fiat every week",

Also the vast history this forum holds in relating to bitcoin and crypto currency as a whole will make it well known across other forum and exchange.Quote from: johnsaributua on December 05, 2023, 11:43:38 PM Later social media will follow the development with the existence of wallet features, trading etc.example hey wallet Although it takes time and with different techniques. This may be true but I don't really think it will be feasible, since most investors have now being seeing reasons to avoid centralise exchanges or wallets. Even browsers like Opera mini and brave has added this feature but I don't think it has been successful for them. not your key not your coins",
