I want to know your honest experience. Is it safe? Well, coming across and reading about aviator crash game for the first time, this (if it be a casino) has no presence on this forum, so I am personally wondering, or should I say it's possible that no one here tried it.Since you said you saw the ad on Facebook, I think best place to find out if they are truly legitimate is through their comments sections in the ad, but be careful though, don't trust all the reviews you see there, they could possibly hire people to keep commenting good stuff on their ad to attract unsuspecting gamblers who they could possibly scam, for me, I've made a resolution to never play on a casino that doesn't have a presence on this forum.",

Seems legit but is it really mandatory for you to play the crash game on that specific app you have mentioned?What I'm trying to say is, there are lots of reputable crypto-gambling platform that offers crash game such as Bitcasino, Stake, Roobet, Windice, etc. Or do you care about having the feature of depositing fiat money aside from crypto? Or do you really want to play specifically the game with the name \"Aviator\"?I don't know the unique features/promotions/bonuses etc. of that game app you saw on Facebook ads that seem to catch your attention compared to the usual crash games that we can already see at those crypto-gambling platforms that I have mentioned.",

If you play on a smartphone and the internet signal is not good, you have the risk of not being able to stop the plane in the exact time you want and may result in losses.",

I have often been using the web and is even more smarter and fine, I don't know if any gambling site here do offer this game as well except the one common in my country which I do not want to mention their name here not to promote them.Quote from: coolcoinz on May 18, 2023, 08:04:31 PMQuote from: Adbitco on May 18, 2023, 06:34:54 PMI have played this game couple of days, I deposited with our local currency to play it.

Yeah I do win but the higher the amount the higher your earnings, is just 2x of whatever you stake with so if you stake with $100 and you've been able to cash out before the jet fly away then you winning but if you couldn't cash before the jet takes off then your $100 is gone just a second or minutes, although it was a local gambling site that I do play it with NGN and not $.As long as the jet keeps flying or moving then your earnings keeps increasing but if the jet take off without cashing out all money gone, what you account is odds like if you been able to accumulate 10 odds, then you stakes with $100, it will then be $100x10 to give $1000 instantly when you be able to cash out at such odds but is very difficult to get such odd.",

Is there something special about this Aviator crash game compared to the other crash games from several online casinos?I mean i have played crash games before using different online casinos and they all have the same rules, winning percentage, and multiplier. That's why I am curious to know what's different with this crash game as it became popular and trending in social media?  Maybe these people just discovered this interesting game? Or does it give a good multiplier and high winning percentage? Like it wont crash at 0.+++?",

There isn't any mention to this being a gambling game on the description, what I thought really shady from the company behind it.I don't know if the low ratings are due to the game being a scam or if it's just naive people rating the app unfairly, since they don't understand the basics about gambling.If you like crash game, why not to go for it at trusted platforms, instead of using these random apps?",

There's no need to install an app as you can quickly play these crash games on most crypto casinos since these games are from third-party providers (Spribe, Turbo games, etc.). Check the casinos you play on because there's a good chance that these games are on their game list.Iirc a few casinos back then tried to promote the game after it got released, and at some point, it used to be the trending topic on ANN threads. I still haven't played it, as I assume it'd be no different from any other crash game.",

Availability may vary depending on where you're located.I agree with you on that,  maybe the crash advert is coming to the ops based on his regional preferences because I use Facebook too but I have not come across such ads on my feeds,  but then it good to see how evolving gambling is becoming seeing traditional games getting upgraded to meet the current standard. We may see more comments as regards to this but then most members here may not see the Avarter crash games ads and would be needing a link to visit such a site and hope ops will provide some links soon.",

One thing I believe from being in this industry, the best way to know whether a gambling site is legitimate or not is to play on it on the actual as well as asking for ither people's insights. Personally, I don't engage to mainstream gambling sutes or those which are being advertised on social media platforms. One reason is traffic on transactions; many players would engage to that platform if it would be advertised in such way. Another is pile of problems if the team won't be able to handle the number of their players. I'd be more okay with not-so-popular but credible ones in this industry.",
