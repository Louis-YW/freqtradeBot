  "content": "Greetings,There is one unstoppable tech trend that could have a huge impact on the future price of Bitcoin: the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto.Back in October, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood hosted a podcast titled \"Why Bitcoin is the Currency of Artificial Intelligence,\" and one of the big takeaways was that Bitcoin has certain inherent properties as a digital currency that make it better suited to the emerging AI-powered economy than traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar.1 Bitcoin consists of 100 million satoshis (just like 1 dollar consists of 100 cents). About 40 of them need to be equal to 0.01 dollars. This could make Bitcoin useful for micropayments, especially the types of micropayments that AI bots can make on your behalf.Bitcoin is also a peer-to-peer currency, meaning that people can send Bitcoin directly to each other without the need for any financial intermediaries. This means that no intermediary takes a cut of every transaction.But for very small transactions, Bitcoin is still impractical, given the transaction fees. If a solution to this problem is not found, it could open the door for other cryptocurrencies to become the \"currency of Artificial Intelligence\".According to Sam Altman of OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT), the next wave of innovation will be autonomous AI agents, and this is where Bitcoin could step in and act as a currency.  How do you think AI will impact Bitcoin or the crypto world?",

It has been serving so many purpose for years now and still serving. so if they choose to input Bitcoin as a digital currency for their Ai products then that's fine so long they dont cause more problems like what we are currently experiencing from ordinals and runes that's flooding the Blockchain.Besides Ai are still under beta stage and still trying to develop through learning. so how then are they going to help Bitcoin be more valuable. It might be possible in the future but I think they should only use Bitcoin as a payment method and not use the blockchian in anyway for their ai products.",

But for the whole it really doesn't matter after all since we see how bitcoin survive without AI technology. People know bitcoin as it is and they always think about this coin for investment. Maybe AI can do something but I believe its for short time hype only.About auto payments maybe it will come soon but for sure bitcoin doesn't necessarily need this technology since what's important for it is to get more higher demand and if bitcoin would successfully be adopted by a lot of people around the world which there's a huge surge of buy orders or demands will came then that one can truly move bitcoin and could able to convince those legislators that bitcoin is good as alternative currency to be adopted or use.",

It has many use cases and you are free to pick any use case you want to use with Bitcoin.There are API, trading bots and AIs don't change too much in automatic trading with bots. From API bots, you can have AI trading bots with latest developments of AI but Bitcoin is here, with or without AI. It can have more use cases in future when adoption becomes better but with time, you will less likely see any actual game-changing use cases for Bitcoin.Like gold, now it is as it is, do you hope AI to change ways human use gold in society?Will AI increase or destroy value of gold?Answer is No for both questions.",

And as a trend, it cannot beneficial to bitcoin not by acting as a currency but in helping to create educational and informative campaigns on bitcoin. AI cannot act as a currency for bitcoin. Humans are bitcoin largest asset. We are the ones through adoption that can move bitcoin forward in to the future and not AI.If AI is going to do auto-payments for us in the future how do you think we can mitigate against the risk of hacks as it will have to go online connect to our bitcoin wallet to make auto payments.

But because its supply is limited and making bitcoin to be scarce which is even one of the reasons the demand is increasing, thus making the price to increase.",
