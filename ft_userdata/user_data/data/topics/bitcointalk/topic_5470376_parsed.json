  "content": "I got into Bitcoin as a college student though I am not involved in earning yet but I have a lot of interest in Bitcoin and I am planning to hold Bitcoin. My father is a Malaysian expatriate. He receives a salary of $500 per month and sends $400 per month to support my family. I collect all the money from my father's salary and spend it for family support. Recently I have made a plan to invest a certain part of my father's salary remittance in Bitcoin but in this case I don't understand whether it should be invested in Bitcoin. I paid attention to invest in bitcoin seeing the popularity and future importance of bitcoin but my father and mother from my family have no knowledge of bitcoin so they keep persuading me to invest in bitcoin.My parents thought that bitcoins that cannot be seen or touched cannot be an asset. They think that investing in physical assets such as gold, bank deposits, land etc. is more profitable than Bitcoin. But even after I convinced them, they are not ready to invest in Bitcoin. They don't want to believe in virtual currency. Right now I want your important advice on how to convince them.",

Bitcoin for now is extremely volatile compared to gold and land.The land is also difficult if you have little capital to buy, and the hassle of getting proper documents to be able to own land under your name is difficult.Bitcoin is still new so we still don't know what will happen in the coming years in Bitcoin especially since some governments are against it.Gold if you own it physically, you will have a hard time storing it physically but there are already a lot of ways to own gold online now.",

Op, if you're truly committed to investing in Bitcoin, it might be best to use some of your own money rather than funds designated for your family's care. Your parents might be hesitant to invest in Bitcoin because they may not be familiar with it or don't fully trust it. It could be a good approach to invest independently, demonstrating its potential by showing your eventual profits and how you've safeguarded the investment.As for gold and land, as your parents mentioned, these are typically viewed as long-term, stable assets that hold their value. They may not offer the same rapid growth potential as Bitcoin, which is known for its volatility. If your parents are not comfortable with Bitcoin, you might consider investing in land on their behalf.",

Your parent are afraid of loss and this is because they have a fixed amount for the necessities of the whole month and as bitcoin is highly volatile they may fear their money. If you are investing in gold or land on the other side I will suggest bitcoin because gold and land both require a large amount of capital and you have only $400 in which you fulfill your family needs. If you buy land it will not give such a profit and the price of gold is going up and down if you are taking the risk to invest in it then why you can't take the risk to invest it in Bitcoin it does not require that much amount you can apply the DCA methods and hold for the next bull run which will be held near after halving. So I recommend you the bitcoin to invest in it as it's a better option you have and if you are involved in it the future will be yours there will be a huge demand for bitcoin in the world but before going for the best DYOR.",

Talk well to your parents, set aside $20 - $40 for Bitcoin investment and show them the results in the next 1-2 years (we can even invest in Bitcoin with only $5-$10), make purchases every month. Maybe this way they will be amazed by the results of their investment.I know that convincing someone who is the opposite of us is very difficult. One way is to prove it. It's normal for parents to behave like that because they were born in a different era and tend to find it difficult to accept change.",

After all, it's their money. When the time comes that you make your own money and will have extra savings, then invest in Bitcoin and show them how it is indeed a better option.",

Maybe there are some really attractive advantage to this one compare to other it just so happens that the person comparing or telling you the investment has some degree of personal bias. The best thing you can do when you're in the same dilemma is do a self-assessment and see what really works for you, bitcoin is for people who don't mind the volatile nature of its market and those people do mind losing the value of their investment because they know that bitcoin's return will be high, so if you're not in that category at all then you have to be second-guessing whether you should invest in bitcoin or not.",

It can be difficult and challenging to convince parents to invest in something new and unfamiliar, especially when it comes to cryptocurrency. But you can consider educating and understanding first yourself and them about Bitcoin, of course, start with the basics, what Bitcoins is. how it works? and why it's considered a potential investment. Highlight the benefits of Bitcoin, you can increase their chances of being open to the idea. With regards to diversification, you can suggest that you're not putting all your eggs in one basket. You can allocate a small portion of your father's salary for Bitcoin to demonstrate its potential, this way you can show your parents the actual results and ease their concerns while keeping the rest in more traditional assets like gold or land.Be patient with your parents, it's important to respect your parents' opinions and decisions, they may not change their views overnight. Understand that their concerns are valid and it's essential to address them with respect and empathy.",

Now, there is nothing wrong with investing on land as its value will surely appreciate since we are not manufacturing lands in the same fashion as we are doing with cars or gadgets hence its value will really be soaring though it can snail-paced. I am then suggesting that you slowly educate them on cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin and then slowly build up your portfolio, in addition to other forms of investments as we should be following the notion that putting one's eggs in one basket can be so risky. Always remember that BTC is a volatile asset one day it can dramatically soar the next week it can dump in value - it is a roller-coaster ride so be prepared to enjoy.",

That means it's money spent on daily needs, is it correct that you use money for daily needs to invest in bitcoin? Why don't you make money yourself to invest in bitcoin? Instead you have to take other people's money and convince others to invest in bitcoin. You are a student, I think you have the ability to earn money to take care of yourself rather than depending on your family and now you want to use their money for your own purposes. If you haven't made money yet, don't try to teach someone how to make money.",

However, if you're considering digital gold, it's also a sound investment. It's worth noting that gold has already reached its peak, whereas bitcoin is still on the rise. The significant demand for bitcoin is likely to push its price to new heights, making it the choice for potentially massive profits.Nevertheless, it's essential to consider that bitcoin falls into the high-risk category of investments. Its price is highly volatile, so there are no guarantees. If you prefer a safer investment, gold is the more established option.",
