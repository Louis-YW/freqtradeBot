What you say violates the terms of use of Paxful[1] and may lead to the account being blocked if they know about it or realize that financial flows are not made from the username. Why not use open source or decentralized options like bisq[1] https://paxful.com/terms-of-service",

In addition to being against the platform's terms and rules from what you are trying to do, both you and the individual providing his documents to verify your account and using his identity are both at significant risks. You could face a ban at any moment from Paxful if only the support team request you to undergo verification one more time and you don’t find that person you had the deal with and you can just imagine if you have a good balance in that account. Also another risk is that the person who verified your account could in any moment gain access to it by simply contacting support and convincing them by sending his ID.Beside you, there is a risk for the person providing his identity documents as well, especially if you're involved in any illegal activities such as money laundering or fraudulent activities. So stay safe and try to verify the account with your own documents otherwise use a different platform",

Because on Peer to Peer trading platforms, bought and multi accounts are big problems for scam and offer market manipulations.After the change of paxful CEO, I do not expect them to be more strict in enforcing the regulations, but in a way that ensures the continuity of their work in the United States, especially with the increased competition with Binance P2P, so most likely that account may continue for a while, but in the end the account will be banned. - The problem for the seller is that the buyer may use the account for illegal activities, and all of these things will be directly linked to your identity. - The problem for the buyer is that accounts can be created with fake documents, which means that the account may be blocked quickly.Therefore, there is no way to do such a transaction safely, even if it is compatible with the terms of use.",
