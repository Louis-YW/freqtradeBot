  "content": "One would actually wonder the essence for creating such topic and my response is bitterness.Illiteracy is massively driving into the country especially among the youths and how it has become so difficult for most people to actively participate in educative discussions.~What is the level of illiteracy within the youths in your local environment~have you taken your time to notice the illiteracy rate withi and around you?~what would you suggest should be done to help fight this illiteracy",

Because you might be shy to further education seeing that you age mates and classmates has gone too far, leaving you behind.So i suggest those that not educated enough should enroll in adult education to reduce the rate of illiteracy in the country. Other possibly Government should give free education enable both the poor attain and obtain good educational background.",

Â We shouldn't just conclude that people with degrees and certifications are educated. People do buy degrees too. To me people who have exposure even without papers should be considered educated, because they most likely have knowledge about things. Not all parents can afford education even if it's there obligation to fulfill. After all informal education is also education.",

As with the existence of an innovative learning program development program from a humanitarian organization or the like.The problem is that parents cannot afford to pay for education, that's why the local government provides free education for underprivileged people.",
