What's the current state of all the forks and how to I protect myself while claiming them and swapping for BTC?I assume only BCH, BSV are probably worth the time. Is the general workflow here:1. Send the BTC to a fresh hardware wallet, wait for it to confirm. It's now safe.2. Now download whatever fork wallets and claim those. 3. Send forks wherever and swap for BTC.Are there any safe non-KYC exchanges where I can do the swaps?",

      "body": "You may want to read LoyceV's Bitcoin Fork claiming guide (and service). Don't look at the Forkcoin prices in that topic, but the other information is still valid.Last time I checked, BCH, BSV and eCash don't have replay protection. Get some Fork dust on each chain, and include that in your transaction to prevent replaying on another chain.I used to include BTG and BCD too. Depend on how many coins you had it may or may not be worth the effort. Don't forget eCash, which is a BCH Fork but still worth something.Quote from: Thylacine on December 06, 2023, 11:27:04 AM1. Send the BTC to a fresh hardware wallet, wait for it to confirm. It's now safe.Correct. Even better if you include offline signing. No need to risk your private keys on a hot wallet.Quote2. Now download whatever fork wallets and claim those.I wouldn't trust them on my main system. I prefer to use either a VM or a dedicated laptop that I wipe after each Forkcoin.Quote3. Send forks wherever and swap for BTC.That's the way.QuoteAre there any safe non-KYC exchanges where I can do the swaps?They exist, but I don't dare make recommendations. Do your own research, and don't trust them with more than you're willing to lose.",

      "body": "Welcome back after a long break!Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) are indeed the most notable forks of Bitcoin. There have been other forks, but their relevance and value are considerably lower. (like Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond to mention some of em.)Your proposed workflow is a good starting point. Be sure to downlaod the wallets from the official sources, there are few scams out there. Verify the signatures while doing that. Regarding ur question about non-KYC exchanges:There are a few exchanges where you can trade without extensive KYC processes but most of them are limited when it comes to higher amounts. You can check them for example right hereAnother workaround would be the use of decentralized exchanges (called DEXs): Some platforms create wrapped versions of non-Ethereum tokens, including Bitcoin Cash, that can be traded on DEXs afterwards. On this way you have to take a few more steps to swap them back to BTC (while using cross-chain DEXs and/or bridges) but you wouldn't face a KYC process.",

Here's how I did it:Quote from: LoyceV on May 07, 2022, 08:58:45 AMBSV's lack of replay protection was once again the solution to my problem This is how I recovered BSV that was sent to pubkey (many years ago):First, move BCH and eCash to a new addressInstall a fresh spare laptop (with VPN of course)Download the full BCH client (the one Forked from Bitcoin Core) (note: I do not trust this software, but used CoinMarketCap.com to find the \"official\" website)Import the pubkey, let it synchronize the first few years (until the coins show up, but before they are sent out (after all, you should have moved your BCH out of this address already))Take it offlineImport the private keyCreate a raw transaction to a new address (this transaction won't be valid on the BCH chain, but will work on the BSV chain). Just in case, I used a legacy addressCopy the transaction to a USB stickCheck it (I used BCH's Electrum Fork for this, in a VM), and broadcast it online on the BSV networkUse another device to broadcast the transaction on the BSV network. I used https://whatsonchain.com/broadcast (on Tor)Wipe the laptop (don't let it go online again after you entered the private key!)Or maybe your coins moved already when you moved coins on the other chain.",

There are no generalized MEV / replayer bots out there doing their thing?Whether you think these forks have a use case or not, as someone coming back to the Bitcoin ecosystem after a while, it's difficult to understate how much damage these chains have done to the Bitcoin brand.

Without knowing how much BTC there were the BTG and BCD forks too.If you already moved your BTC and are going to nuke that windows install anyway then installing some sketchy clients is not a big deal if you are talking more then a few dollars worth of coins.Also depending where you are exchanging the coins you might be better off going fork -> BTC -> Some alt like doge / LTC -> withdraw instead of fork -> BTC -> withdraw since some of these sketchy exchanges have stupid high BTC withdraw fees.Also, be safe make sure that there is NOTHING on that laptop that has any information that matters that can be compromised. -Dave",
