Just to mention I checked your website it's quite brand new so you must come up with something unique like intro to yourself because that's raise a red flag in my mind you did not disclose any of the teams information (or I might have missed) but still looking forward to it. Like if the social media accounts would be linked to it then it would be more comfortable for one to trust on your newly platform. And just to mention out I am not trying to discourage your efforts here as I was solely talking about those lazy people who are going to use such tools. So you are ok in my thoughts because you are just providing services which could save one's time but of course it would be a waste of money. Every person have there own set of mind and my mindset is instead of paying $19 dollars per month I would love to add that money in my holdings even the amount is not that much but at the end it will make sense and worth too.",

You can also the see their previous performance in trading. All the traders passed a test before they become eligible to be a master trader, so you can assure that they are not scam. In other words, copy-trading is more transparent which is really good if you want to trade using their signals.Even if they are profitable traders, they will also experience loses since they can't control the market movement. Since you have the authority to decide, choose the best trader.",

And upon looking at those top weekly rankings on trading in Binance's futures. I wonder why most of them don't have many followers, I mean some have hundreds and two digits, while on perpetual rankings the rest don't even have.",

Copytrading has benefits for both new and old traders;For new traders, they can make profits from copying the trade of professionals as they try to learn to trade on their own, also the leaderboard gives you options of a list of professional traders to copy, so you can make a choice suitable for you. For other traders, It can help you know if your analysis of a trade to take is correct because there are other professional traders that you can compare your analysis with, and it also gives you an idea of how more professional traders trade the market. And on days when you feel lazy and can't make analysis, you can still make profit.",

Of course it is not that simple of a job and you should be more careful about it but as long as you let it happen, I do not think that it will get any worse if you personally do it.",

The difference is that we can see the trader and his trading history.

But that's not what I meant to say here. As in copy trading, we follow others trades, and the decision is ours, like whether we take the entry as the person took it or exit the entry.But what the OP mentioned here is that we can automate the process, and I said who wanted to make the process automated. The point here is that we do not have to do analysis; instead, we only copy the trade of others (as you said, we have every required ability to do it all by ourselves). That's why I said that. Unless you were preferring the ability of copying, as I do not call that an ability,",

I have a strong feeling that this is not something different from those. I have said this multiple times and as people will be reading this topic too, so I'll say it again. Learn to trade from the ground up. When there's no one to copy from, you are nothing. You are finished. No one to blame for your loss and no one to worship for your wins. Do it yourself so that you can be successful in the future. Knowledge is something that others can't take away from you.",
