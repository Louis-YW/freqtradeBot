  "content": "Maybe an introduction post, or what I'm looking for....(I did have another account here. But can't find it now... It was years ago when I was buying BTC at under $100. Of courses I didn't buy nearly enough and spent most of it too.... Anyway)For fun, I am writing my own bot (mostly in python). I like coding. So why not.... Plus I want some flexibility that I can't find in other boys on offer (I am not a pro trader. So I can write a bot to my understanding that does not need to understand all the terminology although will probably do it. I just don't know all the tech terms)I am using some indicators from talib and also having fun writing my own indicators and algorithms (I like mathematics too).Would love to find other users with similar interests. I am happy to help others where I can, although I will have my own questions tooNot really looking for strategies, although am interested to read them of others. I am more into the tech side, calculations, etc (I have spotted a few oddities how talib makes calculations, and would love to talk to users that understand this)Also not looking for investment not to invest with anyone else!If there are any great threads here. I would love to follow them, or maybe start our own.Please let me know if I should be looking somewhere?Anyway happy tradingDean Donice",
