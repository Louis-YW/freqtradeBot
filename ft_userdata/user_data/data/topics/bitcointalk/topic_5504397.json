The volatility in bitcoin price is reducing which makes bitcoin becoming a safe asset people can invest on. If you want high ROI, go for altcoins like meme coins. But know that you may lose your money as you want huge ROI, but it is possible that you can make money. Bitcoin is safer and better but the profit may not be that much.",

They can think that they're just like us, the quite early adopters and there is more to them to wait for Bitcoin.While I see that many are discouraged upon looking at its price, you'd see how irrelevant this concern is in the long run. Time is the enemy of most of the investors that are skeptic that they're too late on the game already. They'd always think that they're too late when they don't do it right now and wait furthermore.",

It's basically a medium through which you can effectively carry out your transaction while having full control of your Bitcoin and we have to balance that out so we don't get too caught to expect quick benefit from every amount of Bitcoin we lay hold on.Quote from: ContentWriter on July 28, 2024, 01:41:42 PM Are there other ways people like us who are late adopters benefit from Bitcoin?using Bitcoin has a lot of advantages and benefit to users ranging from what you're currently using it for which is accepting of payment from client, another feasible way of using or benefitting from Bitcoin is through HODling it. I know that  most of those that joined at this range of time might think they're already late and somehow, it's possible that the kind of profit earlier Bitcoin investors had isn't possible to get at this moment but it's necessary to note that it took a good amount of time before they saw the profit from thier earlier investment and some others couldn't even hold on long enough and sold too early and in the process missing out when they should have had the best benefit from Thier Bitcoin. somehow, I don't think those of us at this moment are late bitcon adoptors, a lot countries are still at the point of adopting Bitcoin as her primary reserve and we know what effect it will have on Bitcoin price when some of them do so and so it's just best to keep HODling it if you're already buying. The good thing is that even if Bitcoin don't get to the amount most people are speculating, it's certain that it won't go down to the point where you will be at loss so now is not late at all.",

The price of bitcoin is increasing overtime and that will give you opportunity to make profit from your bitcoin investment as you hodli.You are still new to bitcoin because a lot of people are still ignorant to invest and some early adopters couldn't hodli for long and have sold their bitcoin.",

Are you late the simple answer is yes but It doesn't mean you can achieve more in this industry you might can earn more than me or other people here and still make decent profit from bitcoin. Right now Bitcoin already touch 67K which is high but if you look Bitcoin ETF big companies like BlackRock is buying more and I believe bitcoin still have plenty room to grow than 70K but of course all of this just based on my opinion you need to do your own research. But if you want triple digit apy invest in altcoin haha",

The key point is the \"long run\" which means in 5 years bitcoin could be worth a million dollars but the next two it could dump more!",

People who bought Bitcoin two years ago and kept it to date would have made some profit. So next time, when you are paid in Bitcoin, don't convert it to fiat. Consider keeping these payments in a good wallet for a long time. I don't also see people who are investing in Bitcoin currently as late investors. Bitcoin still has the potential to increase in price in the future. I predict that those who buy and keep Bitcoin recently will be called early investors in the future. Don't always consider the opportunity you have lost; seek means to take advantage of the available ones.",

Are there other ways people like us who are late adopters benefit from Bitcoin?When engaging in Bitcoin investment, quick gain should be set aside.  If you want to make a huge gain on Bitcoin, you need a lot of patience because you have to wait for the market to pass several 4 year cycles.  Historically, Bitcoin can record new all-time highs several months after the block reward halves and that happens every 4 years. If you are into business, aside from getting the interest of many customers that pay in BTC you have to need much patience to make your investment increase for several folds.  With the Bitcoin block halving and the event that follows that, I think patience is the key to maximizing the benefit from Bitcoin regardless if they are early or late adopters.",

If they had known that bitcoin would grow to the level it is now, they wouldn't have sold their bitcoins when they did. This means patience and commitment are neccessary if you want to earn. @OP, your ability to get good returns depends on your willingness to wait for your investment to grow. No time is too late to invest in bitcoin, all that matters is the strategy you put in place and your ability to be patient. Bitcoin price Is still growing and there are still a lot to expect from bitcoin. Those who are still thinking they are late already to invest will come back in few years with regrets.

The original aim of bitcoin was not to serve as an investment, but as a means of payment. People actually do make payments with bitcoins as long as the recipient accepts it. Majority of bitcoin adopters live in countries were bitcoin is not recognised, yet likeminds share bitcoin privately without the consent of the government. That is the power of the internet and decentralization.",

However, there are other ways you can benefit from Bitcoin and they are below:Run a node: The benefits of running a node is not financial but it's equipped with privacy enhancement. You can run a Bitcoin node and use it own your discretion, your rules your way and doesn't have to depend on other nodes to propagate your transaction to the Bitcoin network.Run a lightening Network: You can run a Bitcoin lightening Node, the benefits that comes with this is that you can earn some sats when you rout a transaction for people that uses the Lightening Network. It's a bitcoin later two where transaction are cheaper and faster. If you have the resource, you can make hundreds of sats daily depending on how many transactions you route through your channel for that day.Lastky, if you have the capacity to buy and hold, you never can tell how much this will go later in the future but you must be a diamond holder of Bitcoin else you will sell it later when something comes up.",

And in order not to regret it later as much as you regret it now, it is better to invest. After all, by doing so you do not limit your opportunities with your own inaction.",
