Yet, I noticed some of your posts both in WO threads and other threads as well. Being in an online forum for twelve years is impressive. It seems there were a lot of ups and downs during your journey. A couple of red feedback proves the time was not good always. I understand a single person cannot be a good person for everyone. Or it's tough to maintain. Seems like you made some enemies. Still, you are in the forum and I believe people respect you. I hope you will be there for a long time. Good luck and Congratulations once again!",

I'd like to be like you when I grow up.😅That's a long period of time to be in this forum, congratulations to you @OgNasty, you took your time to follow every single rules and regulations in this (crazy Forum, like you called it) Forum and you're still here with us, it's a great thing to celebrate with you. I believe some other users have messed up their reputation but you stayed strong and believed that one day you'd be amongst the oldest users in this Forum. You can be old here but you're stronger when it comes to trading and giving advise to investors too.Congrats once again sir @OgNasty",

This is a big motivation for me, and even for others who still have a long way to go to even reach a quarter of your time spent here in the forum. Seeing these kinds of posts or achievements from reputable members like you, helps me boost myself and gives me determination to be also a help to other members with what I can contribute here.

It's awesome to see after all these ups and downs you are still standing strong. Congratulations, and keep inspiring everyone. For me the best memory of you is how you kept your words and returned the 500 BTC that you were holding back in the days. Not many people will have such balls to keep such words.

Over the past 12 years, you have witnessed remarkable advancements in the new platform and innovations, despite the significant risks involved. Fortunately, these risks have paid off handsomely. Trust is crucial in the world of escrow, and you have consistently demonstrated your reliability and competence. However, I must admit that I do miss the presence of escrow services in forums, particularly when dealing with coins that have not yet been listed on exchanges. This topic is often overlooked or not given enough attention, but it remains highly important in such situations.",

If you wish to write a book about your journey in this forum, it will be an interesting one. The 2nd most trusted in the forum and yet has about 8 negative tags. Reading through your feedback made me understand that many drama must have happened in the past, especially from Vod(who left upto 5 different negative feedbacks) and the TMAN.It's cool as a memory.

I liked a lot of things about Bitcoin when I first discovered it. The free transactions (once upon a time), no clawbacks, a limited number of coins, being able to mine at home, and it being open source software. Plus it was being traded 24/7 and the community was friendly and supportive. It was clear to see it was going places. Thanks everyone for all the kind words. I see a few people mentioning my negative feedback. All I can really say about that is it is a bit disgraceful that so many default trust members include users like Vod in their trust networks who publicly tried to extort me. As with everything nowadays, corruption at the highest levels.",
