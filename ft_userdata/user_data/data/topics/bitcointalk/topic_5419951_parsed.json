In the last 4 hours everybody is dumping.But it still feels good to see CZ comes out to expose what they uncover when a huge FTT was deposited on Binance. It is suspicious enough. If the government can regulate which exchanges can postpone withdrawals, they should beable to also see suspicious things going on and be transparent.",

It will be good for the industry if Binacne takeover FTX. CZ is really nailing them. He knows the business well and might just be able to see who is swimming naked including Alameda. Crazy time and SOL is also affected. Gotta see how genius CZ.",

You are probably right.  However, as long as you're willing to hold through the nonsense and wait for this to be over, you could make the case that the market will be stronger on the other side.  As far as who the actual winner will be...  I find it hard to believe that as a smaller newcomer with a ton of promotional expenses (they have arenas named after them) FTX would be able to withstand a war with Binance.  I think we're seeing that evidence now as FTX is bleeding BTC from customers and BNB is one of the few coins now showing red today.",

No one will lose, both FTX and Binance will take advantage of the situation and liquidate the retail investors. The recent tweet by sam seems to settle down the things but then who were affected ?

I wonder if we will have any more twists on this topic.Right but remember that binance has not bought ftx right now and there is still DD which needs to be agreed upon. Anything can happen in crypto market and there could be a situation in which they don't agree upon a mutual deal. Whatever may be the situation, the market will remain extremely volatile and if anyone looking to do future trading, be very careful and use low leverage because of the current volatility in the market.",

Unnecessary invitation. i think CZ saved the crypto industry from crashing. if he didn't discover the near bankruptcy which FTX is about to execute a bankrun, just imagine how deep the price could dive if SBF had dumped all the asset to the market.regulators (SEC) will not be able to see this coming. its one reason that regulators i think has to be someone with resources. if they are not able to see it coming, they is now way Gensler is able to regulate crypto.",

I doubt that. I think it goes beyond that and runs into ego challenge with both men. They want to flex muscles a bit, forgetting that it will rub off negatively on the industry. Some people are even of the opinion that CZ may not have even sold off his holdings of FTX tokens that he only wanted to FUD and shake the other dude. There's a possibility to that. Otherwise, why would he make his selling off public instead of quietly doing it.",
