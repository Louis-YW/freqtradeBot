  "content": "Though I've been an avid follower of this forum for years, this is my first time taking the initiative to participate actively and voice my concerns. I believe that our community thrives on transparency and shared experiences, and today I aim to contribute to that collective knowledge.1. Introduction to Bons.com: Recently, I decided to experiment with a platform named Bons.com. As an enthusiast and a believer in the potential of the crypto industry, it's disheartening to encounter platforms that seem to deviate from the principles that make our community so robust.2. High Threshold for Withdrawals: The first red flag was their exorbitantly high withdrawal threshold of $800 in ETH. It's unreasonable, especially for newcomers in the crypto sphere.3. Intrusive KYC Requirements: Once I tried withdrawing, I was inundated with an avalanche of KYC verifications – from basic ones to more intrusive demands like a selfie with my ID. I respect KYC as a standard, but the timing and intensity at Bons.com felt more like a tactic to deter withdrawals than a genuine security measure.4. Hidden Charges and High Fees: The fees here are nothing short of daylight robbery. Aside from taxing deposits and withdrawals heavily, there's a staggering 10% fee on withdrawals. They even coerce users into meeting a wagering requirement to avoid this 10% fee, irrespective of whether you used any bonus.5. Suspicious Online Reviews: My alarm bells started ringing louder when I noticed the peculiar behavior of their online reviews. Negative feedback on Trustpilot seems to vanish into thin air. This manipulation isn't isolated to just Trustpilot – many review sites, especially in the casino and sportsbook domain, seem to be swayed easily by financial incentives.6. Affiliates, Beware!: For those contemplating affiliate marketing with Bons.com, I'd recommend a hard pass. Their terms and overall conduct are far from congenial.7. My Future Plans: Given my experiences and observations, I'm contemplating launching a small website dedicated to unadulterated reviews. The focus will be on genuine feedback from users, including myself, without any commercial incentives or affiliate commissions. Authenticity and honesty will be at its core.In Conclusion: The crypto industry deserves platforms that uphold its values. My experience with Bons.com is a cautionary tale I felt obligated to share. I hope it aids fellow members in making informed choices and would love to hear from those who've had similar encounters.",

You've raised a very valid point about Trustpilots. It's becoming increasingly challenging to discern genuine reviews from the fabricated ones on these platforms. Your perspective is precisely why I turned to this forum. I value the collective wisdom and candid experiences of community members here.You're right; nothing beats firsthand accounts from users who've navigated these platforms themselves. Lesson indeed learned, and I'll be more cautious moving forward. I appreciate your advice and the heads-up.",

One casino has to be specially bad if their have both unfair terms of service and at the same time they intend to take over money from \"dormant\" accounts.  I could understand that having a lot of accounts which do not have much activity can be a hassle for casinos, specially those not big enough to invest more money in their structure and keep track of the balances of all their users, still I do not think money should be cut short from the integrity of their gamblers as this website does.",

      "body": "OP I have read all you have said and I see you say have been a follower of this platform for so long but you registered here on the 29th of August 2023 and you made this post the following day and it made me wonder why you have been aware of this platform for long as you have said and have not done anything here or is this an alt account of yours to hide your identity?I think this is not the right board for this as it has to do with reputation of a casino. So therefore it would be nice you move it to reputation boardReviews are sometimes being manipulated by organisation's. They pay for fake reviews and also to remove reviews pointing out their lapses as well. The best form of review is a personal experience about the process. If you get involved in engagement with them that would give you more clues on who they really are so as to be cautious while dealing with them.Nevertheless, the casino you mentioned is not popular and I think their presence is not recognised here. So I would advise you to try making use of reputable casino here so that if any issues arises in the future, it can be handled easily without any much problems of protocols.With respect to KYC, OP should know that this is what virtually all casinos and exchange does. They demand for it based on the existing laws of wherever they are operating from and in that case would not want to default so as not to fall out with the government of their jurisdiction. So in that case, OP KYC is not a new thing neither is it an issue although it is actually against the real decentralisation goal but it is ones decision to choose if to do KYC or not.Your experience as a first timer is what makes them call crypto names. These are the reasons why people fall victim of scammers and scams and after everything and their first time experience they put the blame on Bitcoin and crypto to be scam while they had forgot to do their own research before engaging. You said you have known this platform for long at least you should have checked for reputable casinos here and make your choice before dealing rather than going after an unknown one. However, it is nice you are sharing your experience you encountered with this casino so that other members would see it and take caution or possibly do away with them. Your experience is worth learning from OP. Thanks for sharing.",

Even though TrustPilot is a compensated review site, I'm not sure. Because of this, it's wise to examine a casino before parting with cash to gamble there.Because if you don't behave in this way, you'll undoubtedly run into trouble when you want to withdraw money from the casino playing platform. To ensure that the money we deposit is not lost, it must also have a license to operate.",

Someone who finds the verification too complicated can leave the casino and look for another less complicated one. We have to choose the casino based on what we are looking for and we don't join the casino based on the promotions they provide. Maybe ID requirements have become normal in casinos as a condition for verifying our gambling accounts. But if they ask for more, including selfies, maybe we should rethink verification because if our goal is to gamble just for fun, we shouldn't need to verify the gambling account until it's complete. Casinos should also understand that not all of their members want to make money from gambling and there are some members just want to have fun by gambling and don't think too much about verification.",

I already saw that the casino is listed on casino.guro, but I'm still curious to know how you found this casino and why you didn't choose to use the old and more reliable casinos, you chose this casino in particular, when I saw this thread I was thinking : What the hell is this casino that I’ve never heard of? So I decided to access the link so I could see what this casino would do to make you create an account there, man, I must confess that right from the beginning I discovered the reason why you created an account at this casino, I suppose you were attracted by that:the casino has many bonuses, although it is something that all casinos keep doing, it is important to observe how often the casino gives bonuses, the type of bonus and whether the casino has constantly changed bonuses, because when a casino does not have a fixed bonus, something as always and for many years they have a sign-up bonus, weekly bonus, they keep changing it, one month they give x value of sign-up bonus, in other months they change the value of the sign-up bonus so this is a sign that the casino still doesn't have an ideal form of bonus. I like old casinos because they maintain their types of bonuses, even if sometimes they reduce the bonus amount a little, yet the old casino remains faithful to its bonusThis shows the consistency of the casino, while what happens in new casinos is a form of trap, they use the bonus as a way of attracting people to steal from them and as they want to steal in a way that makes it seem like they are not stealing, so they use their money as weapons, and with that they manage to stay in the gambling market for a long time. Well, from what I read you intend to create a casino review site, there are already reliable sites that do this. but if you still want to create it, then you will have to work hard to have a good reputation on this forum, only then can your website be famous and trustworthy",

It is a pity that newbies keep falling for virtually all these unknown casino without conducting due diligence on them. They give mouth watering bonuses that are unrealistic just to get at unsuspecting audience who have no idea of their gimmicks. They are good at tricking people to get registered with them and then they make them deposit and play and when it is time to withdraw from the wins, they start their drama of KYC and others excuses just to trap their members down and after a long battle with KYC they start telling you stories and block your account with them. These are the stories such casino play to but anyways it is nice you mentioned them here. If you can, create a thread for your own experience at to he reputation or scam accusations board with evidence that members could see it and possibly of possible act on it for you but the chances would be minimal to get at them but you have already created awareness here about the casino.",
