      "body": "There are also other reasons why Russia has tried to use the Chinese yuan instead of the dollar. Of particular importance here are the US sanctions imposed against Russia and the disconnection of almost all Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system, which made it very difficult to use the dollar. In addition, Russia previously held a significant part of its foreign exchange reserves in yuan. But the Chinese yuan has fallen in price over the past year, and Russia has suffered significant losses because of this.Experts believe that the popularity of the yuan in Russia is due to the adjustment of Russia's own policy and the constant development of Sino-Russian trade and economic cooperation. Yuan breaks trading records forMoscow Exchange. However, the increasing role of the yuan only indicates that the currencies of unfriendly countries have been forced out or fled from Russia. Given that no one is talking about trading in rubles, it is the yuan that remains the means of payment, which allows you to somehow trade with the rest of the world, which has narrowed to China and India this year.",

      "body": "The use of the yuan instead of the dollar by Russia and other countries can have some impact on the US economy depending on the reactions of other countries and financial markets. For example when yuan reduces the demand for the dollar, it can lead to a depreciation of the US currency and can make imports more expensive for US consumers and businesses. It will also make US exports more competitive in markets that use yuan. Use of yuan can also increase trade and investment flows between China and other countries which can create new opportunities for US businesses that are able to compete in these markets. If the yuan becomes more widely used in international transactions, it can become a reserve currency alongside the dollar, which can help to diversify the global financial system and reduce the dominance of the US currency, something that  is not favorable on the side of US dollar.I think that  the power yuan has as a currency for China and Russia is still relatively limited compared to the dollar, and any shift in this direction for other countries will take time and will not be easy.",

And now, China and Russia have come together to use Yuan especially in trades and exports of black gold (oil) from Saudi Arabia.Recently, the Russian and Chinese leader namely president Xi JinPing and Vladimir Putin have met recently in Moscow to discuss about some future developments of China-Russia relations and other strategic cooperations. In-fact it was reported that they both signed various documents about the trade and currency which will make a heavy impact towards US economy.",

Give your personal opinion on this development!We may have recently noticed an increase in the trend to reduce the use of the dollar, but this global trend had begun since the sixties of the last century and is the reason for the rise of the euro and the yuan. Recent global events have increased this trend, as Russia has become banned from using the dollar within the framework of the sanctions imposed on it. The economic war between China and America was also a direct cause.On the other hand, we should not exaggerate too much, because some countries resorted to using the yuan because they complain of a lack of liquidity in dollars, in addition to the fact that the bulk of their reserves are in dollars, and they will not dare to exchange them for yuan in order to avoid a direct confrontation with America. According to World Bank reports, the Chinese yuan does not represent more than 12 percent of the global exchange volume.So far, the dollar is not threatened, and I do not expect that the United States will remain a spectator if it feels that the status of the dollar is really in danger.",

Rather this are just moves taken to dampen US dominance beyond economical control probably it is has to do with politics. With the effect of US sanction on Russia many countries are seemingly wary of such future occurrences and are opening ways to other currencies to reduce the US dominance. Even Saudi Arabia has open up a way to sell their oil and gas in currencies outside dollars. Even African union has had a plan to create its on central currency to use to transact within Africa as this could strengthen local currencies against the dollar. Nonetheless I don’t see the dollars losing much of its dominance just yet and this shouldn’t affect the country’s economy because it is not that US uses its Dollars as brokerage when every transaction takes to say that the lesser fee gotten from this brokerage will affect the economy.",

And I think they can see the weakness of the US dollar and the US in general, it seems they believe this is the golden opportunity they have been waiting for to give a strong blow to the US dollar, now whether or not they will be successful is anyone’s guess, but it seems they are preparing themselves for an open economic clash with the US and the west.",

From the end of the thirteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century. the people of this land were called Muscovites.Prince Daniel, who was born in 1261, became the first appanage prince of Moscow approximately in 1277. This year can be considered the date of the formation of Muscovy, which is now called Russia. In 1319, Ivan, the fourth son of Daniel, later nicknamed Kalita, became the new Moscow prince. From that moment, Muscovy began to \"grow in breadth\", since then it has become famous. This is how Moscow and the Moscow principality appeared.

China openly declared a couple of months ago that the world was bipolar, the world remains bipolar. And these poles of the world... USA AND China! Yes, you heard right, it is the USA and China! There is no Russia at the second pole!China, logically, took on the role of the second pole, after it became clear that Russia is an empty shell, of which so far, of all its greatness, is only nuclear weapons from the times of the USSR. Nothing else !And of course, China, within the framework of imperial concepts, is now gathering its satellites. More precisely, their appendages (economic, resource, political). And in order for them to be TOTALLY manageable, one thing remains to be done - to \"cut off\" their connection with the world economy, where \"the dollar rules the ball.\" And to sit down, like a drug dealer, only not on drugs, but on the economy of the satellites and on the Yuan. All ! Their economies are constantly reducing dollar receipts, their economies are based on the Yuan, which means they are completely dependent on China. For one thing, China will solve the problem of inflation and giant long. Yes - if you don't know - China's external debt is almost 1.5 times larger than the American one. And debt in dollars. At the same time, China continues to increase gold reserves in USD. And not hiding it much, but actively supporting our appendages in the case of \"giving up the dollar\" Wisdom and cunning are a feature of China!",
