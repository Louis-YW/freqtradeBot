  "content": "It's about control, not really so called Great Replacement(replacement of whites or something like that with other races). In the Matrix system, artificial environments are more controlled by those who built the system. It's like a zoo, then moving animals from their natural environments to zoos because zoos are more controlled. I will advice you to start planning to move from cities (or artificial environments) to natural environments to avoid being fully controlled in the future like animals in zoos",

What you are saying is not exactly what I mean in my post... it's a little similar though considering the fact that people typically move alot from places that are rural in nature in search of better opportunities in other societies, or some would immediately start contributing to the societies they are moving to. I actually believe this rural areas or places like that can survive well on their own (to be independent and successful) and live sustainably. For this to be possible, you need to allow people to be what their CREATOR created them to be, then the people will have different problems they are better/unique at solving, or different roles they are made for or are better at fulfilling. This people will need to be trained by those doing well who share thesame abilities/talents/gifts with them, probably via apprenticeship with moderate/basic Math, Civic, health education, religion, language/grammar, etc in the education. What ever problem that needs to be solved in a society, you should have people who are specially designed to solve the problem well. Look for them and have them developed by those above them and put them in their right department to solve the problems they know how to solve well.  I think you can succeed in developing a safe and successful independent society when you have a true leader designed by the CREATOR to properly develop a society according to HIS Will.",
