  "content": "China Court Partial Approved Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin/Litecoin) to be used in the country. In spite of the ban of Crypto  in the country, China court finally rules in favour of litecoin to be used in the country as a digital asset and not a currency. China court said, Bitcoin was not  brought by the Monetary Authority in the country therefore, it cant be used as a currency but only as a digital asset.  Chinese court approves crypto trading but not its use as a cash substituteQuoteAlthough the court acknowledged the existing Chinese ban on cryptocurrency trading, the presiding judge noted that Litecoin could not be treated as a currency. According to the court, the crypto is not issued by a monetary authority alongside a lack of backing from legal and financial frameworks. Quote“According to real administrative regulations and cases, our country only denies the monetary attributes of virtual currency and prohibits its circulation as currency, but the virtual currency itself is a virtual property protected by the law,” the court ruled.",

Litecoin is Bitcoin fork, similar like other forked coins e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV etc.I wonder what's behind the reason they consider to allow Litecoin while they ban Bitcoin? I'd think the government have accumulated many portion of LTC.QuoteInterestingly, amid the existing ban on Bitcoin (BTC), the court considered Litecoin, noting that the country has laws governing such assets. In the case, the judge cited a lack of laws prohibiting the perception of Litecoin as an illegal asset. Therefore, the judge ruled in favor of the complainant for proving that the defendant borrowed a cryptocurrency and ordered him to return Litecoin.",

I think there ban will still stand unless they have come to rule out the ban on Bitcoin, because if trading of Bitcoin is allowed, trading of other crypto assest is not a problem.",

According to the news, bitcoin was not banned as a property in China, just not to be used as a currency. China has banned bitcoin several times, there is nothing impossible. Let us see what would come out of this when Chinese citizens have already know more truth about bitcoin in China. Quote from: Beparanf on September 17, 2022, 09:21:29 AMWell well well if it’s China.

The last one yet was when the price of bitcoin falled from $63500 back to $45000 by Elon Musk manipulation, then followed by China FUD that drew the price further to $28900 or so. But what happened? Bitcoin increased back and reach all-time-high. We do not have to worry about this.",

I have also learnt not to too take them seriously as well because maybe shortly after this new so called development, it will be followed by another news of them \"Totally banning cryptocurrency\" again, nothing surprising.",

This is a commendable move from the Chinese government, which has an extreme stance on cryptocurrencies. Their initial acceptance of it as a commodity was a success, and given its volatility, there was nothing wrong with them listing it as a commodity.",
