The damage is already done and it is impossible to act like nothing happened. No person in the right mind will ever invest huge amounts in the projects that clown Do Kwon manages. His name is tainted now. Maybe it wasn't his fault, maybe he is innocent. Nobody cares. People lost thousands, millions. Why would anybody ever trust that guy?",

What I just think is that some people will buy Luna, wait for the airdrop, they will be given luna classic and sell. Nobody knows what will happen to luna classic, but I think luna has dropped very well, luna classic can be a profitable coin, but invest what you can afford to lose. I was shocked some people committed suicide because of luna drop, invest what you can be able to lose that will not affect you.",

The hype was so big when it was being launched but in the long term and you will always be seeing the token will be gradually dumped. I do believe any luna holders who have both will always think to sell one from these tokens. It's pretty similar like a few money for all of them. They will try to pick one as their holding. People will use the fork token as a way to decrease their lose. Remmeber so many people were not able to get out during the crash and this is a momentum for them to recover their lose",

And it looks like Do Kwon is trying the impossible againQuoteThe hype was so big when it was being launched but in the long term and you will always be seeing the token will be gradually dumped. I see the same thing happening on this Luna fork, same admin same results he just want to save his faceQuoteRemmeber so many people were not able to get out during the crash and this is a momentum for them to recover their lostI don't think they can still recover their losses but let's see if they can it,Â  Do Kwon is still not out of the loop, their legislators are questioning him and many investors are likely to file charges, and many developers are laughing at him for being arrogant before the Luna crash.",

      "body": "Airdrop for old holders only? then how about trader who are trying to buy when the price is in the range (let's say) $0.1-$50, they are new buyers, will they get an airdrop too or not? If not, then V2 seems difficult to gain the trust of investors. After all, the public is already horrified by a dump like this. If they provide an airdrop for the holder, is Do Kwon sure, who gets this airdrop will not selling LUNA from airdrop immediately? This will be same as bounty campaign rewards, mostly prefer to sell when high then hold for long terms. Because, this is a chance for them to get back their lose money. Airdrop may be will be succeed an LUNA gain another trust, if they give same USD value as their last buy. of course this also not fair for people who are buying LUNA when the price $50, then cutting loss when $40, then buyback, when price $30 and cut losses $20, this is will be hard snapshot and distributions method, to make it fair for thousand people.",
