How is it organized, is a new server automatically added in or must it be registered somewhere?In other words, if I run my server, should I report it to be added to the list? Should I do something to be sure it will not be added?",

I think electrumx had some configuration for that, but I do not remember details, I've checked that long time ago.",

Does it mean that if I start server and keep it running, there is chance it will be automatically 'detected' by script, added to the public servers list and I cannot do anything with that? What are the options - changing port to non-standard? IP filtering at the firewall level makes no sense.",

      "body": "I mean it is unrelated to the Electrum script. I believe Electrs disable the Electrum Server peer discovery protocol by default, so you don't have to worry. I just trying to say that Electrs is not suitable for public server as noted on their readme. Another relevant discussion can be seen at https://github.com/romanz/electrs/issues/187.Or this explanation also could tell why it's unsuitable due to how its design:Quote from: https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/server-performance.html#discussionAs can be seen from the Electrs database schema, only the block height for an address is stored. To be more specific, the ScriptPubKey is hashed and the first 8 bytes of this ‘script hash’ are stored as a key where the value is the confirmed block height for a transaction associated with that script hash. This means that block must be retrieved from Bitcoin Core using the P2P interface and parsed for transactions that have outputs matching the address. For a deep wallet such as that used in this test, this can be a lot of data that must be reparsed for every wallet load. For this particular wallet, 3.5GB of blocks needed to be fetched from Bitcoin Core and parsed every time the wallet is loaded!",
