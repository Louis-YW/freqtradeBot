  "content": "Europe has unveiled the inaugural Bitcoin Spot ETF, marked by the launch of $BCOIN, a symbol that signals a noteworthy step forward in Bitcoin's embrace.Anticipate significant market movements in the upcoming week due to the initiation of BTC price volatility.A new era seems to be dawning. Following Ripple's legal success against the U.S. SEC, a Bitcoin spot ETF is now introduced by Jacobi Asset Management, a London firm authorized by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. After securing approval and two years of preparation, the ETF is listed on Euronext Amsterdam as $BCOIN. Fidelity Digital Assets will safeguard the fund, and Flow Traders assumes the role of market maker.BTC prices have been range-bound with notably subdued volatility for the past seven months. The current compressed state of the price requires a stable foundation for a potential upward surge to $30,000. The introduction of a Bitcoin spot ETF might be the catalyst propelling prices toward this threshold.The question lingers: How long can the bullish momentum be sustained?According to Analyst Crypto Tony, BTC prices are forecasted to hover within the $29,400 to $29,500 range for the week ahead. However, a bullish uptick is foreseen on August 20, 2023, with the possibility of breaching the $30,000 mark. Recent months have demanded substantial bullish forces to overcome these thresholds, hinting at an impending resurgence in Bitcoin's volatility.Presently, Bitcoin's price displays minimal fluctuations, maintaining a nearly constant level. While external influencers such as CPI rates, FOMC decisions, and the DXY index have failed to incite the desired fluctuations, the BTC spot ETF could potentially infuse positive influence. Yet, market participants grapple with uncertainty regarding forthcoming price actions and the strengthening bear sentiment. Consequently, the market remains ensnared within a narrow consolidation range.",

Still waiting for this spot ETF to prove me wrong about all ETFs (I'd be really pleased to be wrong), been some weeks of discussion on this forum about it. I'm surprised how optimist the mood is, though I concede this seems a different beast (UK, not Guernsey, would have swung my mind into the positive camp).I don't see this news in any of the local papers here, economics section still pretty much focused on euro outlook.",

List of bitcoin prices this year from January to August at the time of this writing, you can check on several available platforms that bitcoin has reached more than the price you mentioned. At least the price above $30k has been reached several times even though it is only at $31k.OP. Various events that occur throughout the country can be positive and negative triggers for the price of bitcoin.The best anticipation is to have strong power to hold bitcoins without any feelings of concern even when the market price continues to move downwards.",

But I see several encouraging signals in his analysis, and I'm fairly certain that his prediction will come true. Although bitcoin has already gone above the stated amount this year, I believe that if it crosses the $30,000 level, it will most likely not return below that number again, and we will continue to see a rise with occasional minor corrections as time passes.Quote from: rachael9385 on August 16, 2023, 12:33:45 PMWith the provided link and the picture you can tell for you self if the price will go above $30k or not https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#ChartGraphs can be difficult to grasp at times, and some individuals are unsure how to interpret them.

It doesn’t make sense at all to determine what’s the next move of Bitcoin. One thing is for sure here that Bitcoin will surely surpass that 30K psychological barrier since Bitcoin ATH was above 65K.  That 30k level was breach multiple times in the past before the ATH reach so breaking it while there’s already a higher price target achieved is very easy. The on,y question here is when.Your chart only shows temporary price action. I don’t know what your specific position with this comment but the chart doesn’t provide useful information to determine the next move.",

I guess we all know the answer to this question  is it doesn't. If these guys really wanted  to honour or embrace Bitcoin they would have done so without introducing another altcoin on the market! Btw If you connect the dots, what's actually happening here is that  these guys are trying to hitch a ride on bitcoins success and call it supporting Bitcoin which we all can see that it's deception, and trying to feed as a centralized coin..Quote from: wilkine on August 16, 2023, 09:03:25 AM-snip-The question lingers: How long can the bullish momentum be sustained?Not as bad as it sounds for bitcoin, but if they can coordinate the process of getting  an approval..most certainly the momentum can be sustainable,  besides one price starts to go up the speculation alone can provide some support to keep price upQuoteWill BTC go above $30,000?From where price is currently sitting,  30k can be easily breached without breaking  a sweat,  let's talk about getting to $50k and above for now",

Because BTC is cooking and collecting fuel for next flight to Moon of another planet. And yes i definitely think that BTC will go above $30k easily.Because $30k is the most easiest Resistance level that it will break with time but due to the news of Paypal restricting the buying and selling of things using BTC might make market to bleed but this is just temporary and there is still so much room for the BTC to grow. You question is so childish although i still not stopped my self to give you some hope but please do not use my advice or POV as defending attack when the things went upside down. hehe.",

Don't be deceive about the price decrease you see, that makes it seem like a $30k price is difficult to cross. it is just temporary and it won't be long for bitcoin to go above the $30k price. By September or whereabouts, bitcoin is supposed to be above $30k by right. Am looking at a $35k price before the end of the year. By next year, we should be talking about higher prices of bitcoin. You should acquire more bitcoin now, as the opportunity is open because $30k will be a small amount when we enter the bull run",

Wow, I thought that we will have good news, unfortunately, it seems the market reacted negatively.I also thought that we have a good news like this one:QuoteOn Aug. 16, the National Futures Association (NFA) — designated by the U.S. commodities regulator as a registered futures association — granted Coinbase permission to operate a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) platform.https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-futures-approval-seen-as-a-major-win-amid-war-on-cryptoBut I guess it didn't have the enough hype about this positive news.",

You guys always emphasize the supply but forget to mention the demand of bitcoin. Supply is limited but demand does not increase, then the price will never increase, supply is not the only factor for bitcoin to increase in price if there is no demand. We should judge the value of bitcoin by looking at supply and demand, we shouldn't focus too much on the halving, what if the bitcoin price doesn't increase after the halving?",
