I thought <12character EOS addresses were invalid?.. Oh myThank you allIs the transaction confirmed? Do you see it in the blockchain?If the transaction is already confirmed, there is nothing you can do. The coins are probably stuck forever in an address nobody has the private key.However, it is more likely that the transaction failed and did not get a confirmation (if the address is invalid). Although, it might be valid (then there is nothing you can do)",

      "body": "If you accidentally sent to an address with a missing character in Coinbase in my experience it will be stuck on their transaction history and actually, you can't able to see the transaction through any block explorer if you are lucky the same as mine before then you can contact Coinbase issue to refresh your account. But if you can find the transaction in the block explorer and receive confirmation then there is no way to get your coins back. I would suggest you try to contact Coinbase and maybe they can give you some few advice here https://help.coinbase.com/en/contact-us?",

However you can send small amount first and if it's alright, you can send it all.Quote from: https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/sending-and-receiving/what-happens-if-i-use-the-wrong-coinbase-wallet-addressWhat happens if I use the wrong Wallet address to send or receive crypto?While Coinbase Wallet gives you complete custodian control over your digital assets, this also means that we're not able to recover any funds sent or received to an incorrect address. We strongly suggest that you double check addresses before sending or receiving crypto through Wallet.",

Quote from: marcotheminer on June 23, 2022, 08:13:28 PMThe address I sent to, I did not type 1 character .. it was valid as per coinbase, and so was sent. 1 character is still mean everything in the crypto. If it was true already sent and you can do nothing for that. The transaction already gone and better to check it through explorer whether that's delivered in address or not. No chance to recover it.",
