If you are not sure about the services above, you should be able to use swap services that are more secure, such as Pancakeswap, 1inch, or Biswap, because I have used these swap services and I can say that these services are secure, fast and easy for users to use.",

Whether they are legit or not but it was safe to use a reliable exchange as long as our tokens are available to them. But if not, we leave no choice but to take risks from these new swaps sites and see how it works. But upon reading their names, doubts had come into my mind. Well, it was just my personal opinion but I have to say, we need to do research in order to find how reliable they are and try, that was an absolute way to determine f that is a scam site or now.",

This indicates the platform has a lot of time to grow or to gain trust but why did these platforms left behind? (behind means these websites have lower traffic than the ones currently being recommended by other members like Pancakswap, or Uniswap, etc.). The names which you picked I don't know from where did you came to know about these platforms because the one named as atomicdex is now named as comodo wallet. This means your data is out of date.But, still, my recommendations for you are the same, if you want to swap BTC like on DEXs swaps then do not trust some swaps which have less reputation, and who is forcing you to use these when you have a better options available. But, if you really wanted to swap on these platforms then (as I have no experience on these) try not to swap with big amounts.",

Although I didn't really try it, it's just that some of them only let you connect with one type of wallet like metamask. I can confirm they only accept wrapped bitcoins, we agree that such tokens are highly not recommended in the long term.",

I said you should avoid them if they only offer wrapped tokens, meaning that if they offer native BTC swaps then you can try them (after checking other things like their past problems, etc). Wrapped tokens are risky since they can get frozen, lost their value, and so on quickly. Besides, why would you settle with wrapped tokens if you can trade native BTC? Exposing yourself to wrapped tokens will just increase the risk of your funds losing its values.",
