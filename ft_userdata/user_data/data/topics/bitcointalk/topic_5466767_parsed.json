AsÂ  the population dey grow na so the demand for food tooÂ  they increase. You can start with a plastic tank or tarpaulin for the fish farming. You can also rent ponds from people. There are people that have ponds they rent out for fish farming purpose . The profit in fish farming is huge. Na my parent business be this so I know what they make from it.2: Mobile money AKA POS business: money dey for pos business, no look am say e no dey. Just get a good location and the placeÂ  busy. Pos business provides convenience to a lot of people that don't want go through bank hassle.Â  I am among the first people who started the POS business before it became a global thing ðŸ˜ƒ.

You fit sell shoes, clothes or anyone of your choice. The reason I love this one, you don't need to rent a physical store, people go dey see your product online. Just make sure say your product are of good qualities and deliver to your customer on time. 4: Buy properties people can rent from you like canopies, chairs, table, curtains, costumes etc. You can be renting these properties out to people that have parties or occasion and be making your cool cash. You know say party na sure thing, whether na birthday, wedding ceremony and even burial. People will need all these for the party. All these businesses are lucrative in Nigeria, However the success of any business requires careful planning, market research and commitment.

All you need to get use pako knack your small POS bot or if you have funds, you can rent a shop. There is a guy in my neighbourhood, this is the business that he is into and he is making it. Infact some people don't all that waste of money, only an umbrella with two plastic chairs and your POS machine, you are good to start making profit.The best is, if your location is in a very busy area, with high transactions, like markets or busy bus stop e.t.c. Before you know it yopu have made millions. The cashless policy real wrecked some POS operators then and kicked them out of the business but the serious ones that are making profit are still cashing out daily from it.

The only thing required is just to put interest on how to be security conscious ( that is to say, you must be very careful with your key phrase) risk common is the volatility level of it which it will still come back to the previous price.One thing we must know is that there is no business that doesn't involved risk, POS business easily attract arm robbers meaning you need to be very careful while selling your money to people that comes to collect money. Fishery you need to learn how it works before venturing into it and not every place it will survived if you don't know the eyes, buying properties for rentage also has a very big challenge as we have also involved ourselves with such, most times we get incomplete returns and whenever we asked those people to replace it story comes ( this made our aunty to stop doing that business) and moreover chairs being it table and canopies they has low life span before you knew it all of them will start getting weaker.online business( E-commerce) is something very much better at least you don't incur much risk as it must be pay on before delivery and people must send you money before you would deliver it to them, which you have less stress free. Although this business is much encouraging for a woman as you don't know the kind of men you are to meet out there all less you basically deal with women wear than men maybe you might not get hurt while dealing with your fellow women compared with dealing men.",

Almost every business, small retail or wholesalers have P.O.S terminal to ease customers payments and burden of carrying large cash around. Even private individuals now carry P.O.S around.For rentage, a good location or environment that is prone to weekend gyrating and partying would be a good idea. Better still, a more populated place would have more appeal to such kind of business. For fishery and poultry farming, food is a necessity and I don't think people have stopped or will stop enjoying a good fish or poultry dish anytime soon.",

If you have been there and still hanging around, you will understand how heat of maintaining a business has become and if you are new, the chances of making it will be low because newbie cannot survive with economic hardship. It's easy to start a business but maintenance and running cost is the problem in this country.Quote from: Victorybit1 on September 14, 2023, 10:40:33 AMI've you ever been in a situation wey you deyÂ  think which business to do with money wey just enter your hand?Like better money enter your hand but you don't know what business to do with it.I want to tell you all 4 correct businesses wey you fit use am do wey go yield better profit at the end.1: Fish farming or Poultry farming: The demand for food product na constant thing.

There are people that have ponds they rent out for fish farming purpose . The profit in fish farming is huge. Na my parent business be this so I know what they make from it.There is something about fish farming you need to know and the main people who run them will not tell you. Fish business is of two types, there are people that goes into rearing fingalings, feed them until they reach the target kg before they are out for sale which you just explaind but the loss you will encounter in this one is deadly especially if you are not expert or have experience. Sometimes is not about the fish having sickness, there is high rate of cannibalism in fishing farming where the fish eat there self. They do that a lot when they found others are sick, they eat them in less than 24 hours before you come for check up and some also die naturally.Instead of buying fingerlings from scratch and rear, it's better you go into hatching business. This is where you have your own fish pond, mate the male sperms with the female eggs and they produce fingerlings after some days. You can sell them to people who buy to feed until maturity. The loss been a hatcher is far minimum than the fish farming itself and it's more lucrative without doing much. Think twice before you venture into fish farming my brother.Quote2: Mobile money AKA POS business: money dey for pos business, no look am say e no dey. Just get a good location and the placeÂ  busy. Pos business provides convenience to a lot of people that don't want go through bank hassle.Â  I am among the first people who started the POS business before it became a global thing ðŸ˜ƒ. I made a lot of money, and I am still doing it.The first challenge of this business is that it's already saturated, meaning you will make less profits if you are starting in a new location but if you have a busy area and no any available, you may make more profit but it's rare these that you will pass through any street or corner without seeing a POS business.Another challenge with this one is that you will likely get scam by some people if you are not smart ahead of them, you need to have 3 eyes to succeed in POS business because there are possibilities of collecting fake cash deposit, fake transfer, fake alert and even getting rob if your location isn't secure area.Quote3: online business( E-commerce) With the increase social media engagement, starting online store by selling various products is very lucrative. You fit sell shoes, clothes or anyone of your choice. The reason I love this one, you don't need to rent a physical store, people go dey see your product online. Just make sure say your product are of good qualities and deliver to your customer on time. Online business no dy work for Naija, you should said drop shipping instead. Drop shipping is buying stuff from e-commerce and then bring them to Nigeria to sell. Many of the vendors we have on Instagram, whatsapp, Snapchat and tiktok are into drop shipping and they make money from them.",

The only thing required is just to put interest on how to be security conscious ( that is to say, you must be very careful with your key phrase) risk common is the volatility level of it which it will still come back to the previous price.You are right@smartgold01, but the problem is that everyone must not do the same thing. In life people have different interest and passion. Not what you like that I might also like. Not everybody that like there investment to be in Bitcoin/crypto considering the fact that it's an online business which can crash at any time. Although Bitcoin is not one of those online business that can crash and can never and will never crash because I know Bitcoin very well. But just considering what happened to LUNA COIN coin you can research about it and you will know why many people are afraid of online investment.Quote from: SmartGold01 on September 14, 2023, 09:43:43 PMOne thing we must know is that there is no business that doesn't involved risk, POS business easily attract arm robbers meaning you need to be very careful while selling your money to people that comes to collect money.

You do risk acesment in other not to loose because the motive of every business man is to make profit. When you invest in fish farming after training, The profit made can be used to invest in crypto. But if you don't want to invest in crypto you can still use you profit to reinvest.",
