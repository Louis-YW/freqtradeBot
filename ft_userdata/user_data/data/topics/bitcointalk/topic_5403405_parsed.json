  "content": "Alik BakhshiThe first president after Putin will be the president of Muscovy        Russian President Vladimir Putin, during his speech at the 25th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, said \"The USSR is historical Russia, but it so happened that it ceased to exist.\" It's a pity Putin did not name the reason for this. Today Russia is on the verge of final disintegration and the reason is known.          In the article “When the donkey dies” (2005, https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/3702.html) I wrote that Putin’s policy is dangerous not only for neighboring, former fraternal peoples, with most of which Putin managed to ruin relations, but also for countries with well-established democracies, which could turn into disastrous self-isolation for Russia. The war launched by Russia in Ukraine as the first step towards the restoration of the empire within the borders of the USSR will be its last step. The Russian Empire will return to its historical borders and acquire its former name Muscovy. The vast territory beyond the Volga River will be divided between the indigenous peoples of Siberia and the Urals. By the way, historically Siberia was not Russia, they were exiled to Siberia from Russia.    21.06. 2022",

They are states of mind. Your state of mind regarding borders might be different from that of the next person.Whose state of mind is right regarding Siberia? Isn't it the one who maintains the power over it? Written words regarding borders are only there to keep the memory of who claims ownership of what alive.If you or China or Mongolia or anybody else doesn't like the FACT that Siberia is part of Russia, go take it from them if you can. Your borders might be right. You might have the strength to do this. If you do, you can make Siberia belong to anyone you want.",

Take a look at popular Wikipedia maps. They show Siberia as part of Russia. Who would benefit from Siberia being part of Russia? Russia of course.This seems to suggest that Russia is taking over the world through some unknown means and methods. They certainly didn't conquer the map-makers to make the maps change. Maybe they rule the world and we don't know it, right?If Siberia belongs to the indigenous peoples of Siberia, let them prove it by showing it on the maps... if they are strong enough. Or is it that indigenous peoples of Siberia rule the world, and are simply letting the maps exist as they are as a cover for their covert operations?I agree with you that what is right isn't always the thing that exists. The indigenous peoples of Siberia might be the rightful heirs to Siberia, and they might think that they own Siberia. But what do they have for strength if any other country decides to push them off their land right into the ocean?",

The time will come and the states of the Ural and Siberian peoples will appear on the map: Tatars, Yakuts, Buryats and many others.",
