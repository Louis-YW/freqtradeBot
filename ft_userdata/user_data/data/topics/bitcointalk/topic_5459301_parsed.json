I will surely participate in the Launchpad and just hope the project do well. I have used Arkham platform before but still need a lot of work to be done to be among the top go analytical tool in the market.",

This explains it i guess. I have never used Binance as my main exchange though and i don't really own any BNB besides a little bit to pay for transaction costs on the binance smart chain so i have no chance to participate in this launchpad sale. I am not sure about that project though because i don't really get that intel-to-earn mechanic that they are introducing. Also 50 Million € valuation for the investment round on Binance seems ok to me. Lower would be better of course but that is still ok.",

Am sure it is part of the reason why they chose binance. Yeah no one knows the logic binance use in selecting projects for their launch pad because if this is what they are all about, they will not have the desired support from majority of the crypto community who understand this point. But then many crypto users and investors are more concerned about their profit than what a project represent.  i bet the majority will only participate for the short term profit, after that , they will walk and never return.",

Even though I already signed up before, I just didn't get any invites.Another thing, there was some issue that spreading about Arkham, some are saying that Arkham is a project of the CIA to have surveillance on people.And the issue also that Arkham is just collecting every person's personal information like email, name, IP, and device info because that's indeed what is on their terms of service.Overall, I'm not a hater of this project, it's a great project for on-chain analysis and an all-in-one wallet scanner. The only thing I don't like is the way they collect some personal information.",

Different approach actually. I agree. Like I said, with Binance handling the token sale on its launchpad platform is enough reason to exponential increase the pumpamenntals. The narrative on crypto twitter has changed now about Arkham. I believe their CEO held a space and explained a few things. The overall sentiments right now is bullish. For a team that reportedly raised over $150M prior to this launchpad sale, I expect the token to do a minimum of 5x from launchpad price. Goodluck to everyone who got in via the launchpad, their airdrop or early investment rounds.",

Goodluck to everyone who got in via the launchpad, their airdrop or early investment rounds. Wow I didnt know that they raised that much. I assume thats a pledge from VCs and not in liquid cause thats a lot of money. Probably the lowest price could do is like $1 utmost given the hype. But there are lots of airdrops to be dump too, that could lowered the potential range. Im not sure if I can join heavily on this one as my funds tied up on other dapps.",
