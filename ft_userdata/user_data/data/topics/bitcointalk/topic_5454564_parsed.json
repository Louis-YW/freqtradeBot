  "content": "I have upgraded my Avalon A1246 miner with Phanteks T30 fans and have trouble with the Hasboards. Hasboard #0 already got replaced, now Hasboard #1 has to get replaced as well - just after installing the repaired Hashboard #0.Is this normal? I was so stupid and didn‘t test the miner before directly installing the Phanteks and now I wonder if the fans are causing issues.Do I need a custom software to handle the different fans? Is anyone here, who has tried such things out?",

Would you mind posting it here?Possible fans are the cause of your problem and it might be a compatibility issue based on a bit of research about that fan the max amps of Phanteks t30 is 0.36A which is pretty low compared to stock fans.Why not try to put the stock fans again to test?About custom software/firmware for this unit, I never heard of any custom firmware for this unit.",

      "body": "Given the information that philipma1957 has provided, I would ask what the temperatures are that you're dealing with.  It sounds like this could be a simple case of your boards frying because you're not cooling them off enough so they are burning up.  Without more information about your board temperatures or your ambient room temperature, the assumption is going to be that you removed the fans that were necessary to cool the boards and replaced them with quieter ones that are more convenient for your situation, but aren't providing the necessary cooling.  More information from you to confirm this diagnosis is needed.",
