Of course you may get unlucky with late shares if you're too far away, but it's not really required to have a pool be local.I do generally endorse having more pools to help decentralization of hashpower.Keep in mind if this is about Altcoin mining pools, your thread is in the wrong section.Quote from: -ck on November 17, 2017, 02:56:16 AM1.

A quick browse in the Mining/Pools board already brought up a very similar question by the way:Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5376622.0Costs for a Mining Pool Provider?[/url]So this was about the costs, nevertheless BitMaxz already had linked the software you'd need over there. I also remember there are more similar questions popping up every now and then; as long as a thread isn't too old (necroposting), feel free to comment on one of those instead of opening a new thread with a question already answered elsewhere.",
