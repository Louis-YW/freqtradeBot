It's obvious that Google is tracking our browsing and web activities, but using our smartphones as spying tools seems a little bit exaggerated. I know that they have the power and ability to do so, but what's the point? Nowadays almost everyone has a Google account/Youtube account and uses Chrome browser on an Android device. If it becomes too obvious that Google is spying on us, many people would just delete their Google accounts and root their Android devices. It's not that the Google alternatives aren't as bad as Google.Do you think that Apple won't spy on it's customers? Privacy is something utopian in the current digital world.",

Privacy is something utopian in the current digital world. Yes, I had the same case last year. I am using an old iphone and use facebook to keep in touch with some friends. Once my friend and I were talking and accidentally mentioned the toy bear, because it is very beautiful and I think my son will like it. I asked my friend: do you know where it sells?. When I got home, I turned on my phone and played on Facebook and was quite surprised to see so many ads about the toy bear I talked to my friend about. Actually, I was quite surprised but also did not pay much attention to why this happened. It's only when it happens a few times that I start to think that the devices we're using are spying on us.",

The internet world is very intense - have you notice there were so many games on fb where they use to ask to access your personal info and you willingly give access. Why do they do that. That is because they have now legal right to get your personal access..",

That being said, their advertising or analytics javascript is found on so many pages it's quite possible that they might be able to connect the dots via other methods. They are turning out to be a really scummy company these days, far from their original motto of do no evil. They are much more benign, but possibly more dangerous than a company like Amazon because of the information they have access to - especially when it comes to manipulating news or even individual politicians who might want to take restraining actions against them.",

To be honest this sounds funny abit but why i may not have a doubt about it is because google itself is a centralized network and in the world of a centralized system i don't think there's anything called privacy even though they may claim it that you have it, but believe me its all lies, but as regards the aspect of spying your talks or conversations Is another thing entirely of which i believe google has the power to do such but wouldn't, and no recent devices made from them that opens up users to their access other than the normal tracking which is more likely not to function well if the location is off, but listening to your conversation has something to do maybe with your device, or you been hacked, your experience might just be a coincidence.",
