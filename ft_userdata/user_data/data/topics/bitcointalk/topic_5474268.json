      "body": "Okay, first things first. Your request for a loan makes no sense. Can you explain how resolving some tax problem means you need to take out a Bitcoin loan? I'm not quite following the logic there. Also, just being real with you - asking for a no-collateral loan as a new member here is a tough sell. Maybe just take some time to build up your reputation around here first before pursuing the loan idea.",

Thank you in advance for your kindness. Tibor Horváth.Email: tiborhorvth505@yahoo.comIsn't it only 15% taxes on your profit ?  Quote2. How is the exchange of crypto-assets for a conventional FIAT currency (e.g. USD, EUR, GBP etc.) taxed?A special income category has been created for income from capital. Gains from crypto transactions are taxed at 15% PIT (the general tax rate in Hungary). No other tax or social security contribution is payable.Source: https://cms.law/en/int/expert-guides/cms-expert-guide-on-taxation-of-crypto-assets/hungary",

Yes, indeed, you're absolutely right. I leave neutrals for that reason saying to myself \"maybe he's just not informed about collateral\", but that's unrealistic. Someone who is registering here just for a loan will never participate in the forum life...Quote from: Vod on November 17, 2023, 07:59:12 AMOff topic:  what type of home you looking to buy and where?I am located in Eastern Europe, I bought a house some months ago thanks to Bitcoin (but unfortunately not with btc).  Next step is now trying to pay for renovations in the same way!",

      "body": "If you put yourself in the same position as any lender would be in, what would you do if a newbie who made two posts asked you for a loan? Would you give a loan to a member that had no trade history, no forum history, provided no collateral and was completely anonymous? At least if a reputable member of the forum vouched for the newbie it might change your mind but in this case this did not happen.You have received both neutral and negative trust on your account, I would advise you to forget this account and create another if you want to contribute to the forum as a helpful member and eventually join a signature campaign.Quote from: Tibor5032 on November 16, 2023, 06:56:38 AMDear community, If someone would be so kind as to lend me 0.05 btc, I would really appreciate it.

What are you talking about? Someone is asking you to pay taxes before you can withdraw money (btc) from an account? These kind of pay us first things tend to be scams, designed to siphon money from folks through slick promises.  you're a fool if you've already paid any money to them.Quote from: Tibor5032 on November 20, 2023, 04:57:48 PMTax was 0.35 BTC including contributions.

Don't send anything else their way and  walk away and take it as a tough lesson. Going forward, be very wary of platforms asking for upfront fees like that.  Legit ones typically dont operate that way.",
