The problem is that having yet to learn what to do with borrowed money is a prime example of ignorance and a surefire recipe for disaster. But who knows?

In trading only 5% are making money while the rest e.g. 95% are keep losing because they don't know how to trade and analysis doesn't help at all, now you're borrowing your funds with the terms and interest you will need to pay, the risk would be higher than 95%.You need to think what will you do if all goes wrong than your speculation.",

In fact, it is the opposite, a good system to lose it and end up much worse off than when you started.The best ways to get rich are usually slow and boring, with some exceptions.",

It's a risky thing to do and if you want to trade, trade only with your own money that you afford to lose.",

Conversely, if you pay attention to your experience first, then you will be more careful in coming to conclusions on loans to increase capital.Remember that crypto is very volatile, certain types of trading can wipe out your entire portfolio like day trading. Borrowing capital is actually a difficult choice. The shorter the trading term, the greater your risk, on the other hand, you will be charged more interest if you increase the tenor.",

It depends, since if you don't have money or capital to start trading, then your only solution is to borrow funds, and if you wouldn't borrow, you wouldn't have anything with which to start. As I previously stated, taking risks can lead to success, but in this case, it is a do-or-die situation because if you lose it all in trading, you will undoubtedly be in debt that will be difficult to repay unless you have another source of income. I know most of you will say it's risky, so only spend your money or spend what you can afford to lose, but what if you are a talented person and your path is truly trading?

If you knew exactly how to manage risk then borrowing funds to increase your capital is a wise choice for more profit opportunity. Billionaires and all successful businessman do loans to fund there business. They use other people money that stuck in the bank to use on there own business to earn more then just pay the small interest rate for the capital borrowed. Loan can be helpful and at the same time very dangerous if you invest on something that is very risky.It’s better to make sure that you have another source of income for paying the loans as back up plan in case your investment/trading didn’t go as plan because interest rate will gonna eat you alive in the long run.",

It can be but it was not advisable especially if you are new to this (trading). Huge capital - can possibly earn more but also it corresponds to high risk. If you are just new, better to start in small amounts and use your own money. Only just think about borrowing if you are capable enough and sure that you can make a profit from trading. Besides, it was not all about capital but also, it is how a trader manages their trades and the strategies that are used.",

I totally object, why don't we start with the smallest amount and in case you don't have the money, you can also work a short time to get it as capital? Although trading is not gambling, but I can say its risk is almost the same, you can lose it all overnight. Its too high a risk to try, while I believe we all have better solutions to begin with. It is not wrong to take risks for the sake of success, but it is not the right thing to do in every case.",

You already stated it, trading is considered high risk so trading with borrowed fund isn't advisable.  There is always an advice that only invest what you can afford to lose.  Trading with extra money saves you from lots of headaches when trading goes wrong.  While trading with borrowed money may give you headache when your trading performance fail.  You lost the money plus you have to pay for the interest if the lender charges interest per month.So it isn't wise to trade when you have no money to begin with.Quote from: palle11 on December 24, 2022, 11:35:06 AMQuote from: Okereke on December 24, 2022, 08:49:05 AMIt is true that some people have become rich through crypto trading in the recent times.
