  "content": "I'm definitely a junkie; I admit that I look in Japan for Bitflyers. Saw a lot of five once but I couldn't get the purchase to go through because of restrictions on sending items with currency on them out of the country. You could worry about me...  Anyway, I started seeing the prices being asked for physical bitcoins. Here are some samples I thought you might find interesting:",

We need a \"Bitcoin 2025 Tokyo\" conference",

      "body": "Kryptowerk and MJ,  A Japan trip would be perfect, especially if we returned with bitflyers, and Mrs Bitcoins I didn't show you the Satoris for sale. They are not cheap, but they are going for what you might see on Ebay USA. This is to say, they are not being listed with the outrageous prices of silver shields and other common coins. I bought an interesting Rhodium Bitcoin. I will post it when I return from a trip. It made it to to my house with no problem. Great coin.",
