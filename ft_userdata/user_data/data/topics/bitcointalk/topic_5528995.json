Just how many very similar topics are you going to keep spamming the Forum with this same question over and over?he cant even be bothered to do the most basic 3 second google searchs to learn about bitcoin.. its obvious now that his attempts to spam the forum to get answers, is so he can build up a con-artist story whereby he wants to later create an alt account to sell a story that he is a early adopter and wants to sell someone something worth billions... (he is not the first that done this, so this pattern is obvious)he is obviously a newbie scammer he wants to gather info of the past to try to find a feasibly realistic story to con people with. by taking facts of history and tailoring them to be part of his 'early adopter story' he will create later.. but he is one of the lazy con men that cant even be bothered to research for himself and just wants others to spoonfeed him info",

As you can see,  members already begin to wonder if you really take out time to read the rules as it relates to this platform. This made me to look into your posts and virtually all you post looks similar and this would have been better you ask your questions in one thread would curb all these unnecessary spamming as already mentioned by some members here. Take your time to read more about this platform, you could see materials that could give you answers to your questions and also expose you to more information you need about bitcoin and crypto currency at large. Read and abide to the platform rules to avoid being flagged by moderators.",

(he is not the first that done this, so this pattern is obvious)That's extremely an extremely specific speculation. Can't tell if your trolling.Anyway, in my opinion, the guy is probably just some 40+ year old who barely knows how to use google though stumbled across the forum, and is now using the forum as his own personal search engine. It's not a bad thing, he's asking questions that people can answer, maybe questions that haven't been asked before...if he is just spamming for a sinister reason I'm sure that eventually his time will be rendered as pointless with a ban.OP - use OpenAI and Google.com for majority of the questions that you want to ask in the future, and if neither are giving properly sourced/certainly correct answers/answers you aren't satisfied with, THEN come here and ask those questions, as I'm sure those questions will make for good conversation.",

Can't tell if your trolling.he has also been pestering me in PM's asking more questions of a specific amount and time frame (new year period end of 2009, start of 2010) asking specifically if someone could buy $1000 of crypto, and from where and whom had enough coin to fill the specific order amount. his highly specific questions and scenario and wanting to know how realistic and feasible it is for such a trade to occur, reveals much more than 'just a noob' mentality of wanting to learn about bitcoin, he wants to form a story thats beleivablehe is trying to form a scenario of an early adopter event that sounds realistic and feasible to have occured, as someone who could have been a early adopter would say, he is also trying to learn the wordage to sound plausible too, and learn the historic events of the period to sound experienced of being involved in that timehe has yet to learn that when he does try to use his scenario to con people, other can just ask for signed key signature proof. and his con is over. so all of his attempts to form a scenario are just wasting his time and thus ours",
