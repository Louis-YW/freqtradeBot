Especially since your list contained currencies with high market capacities, and therefore a hundredfold means billions of dollars to rise>?You can get it with of pump/dump coins, but such currencies are closer to scam than investments.Also, most of the altcoins that rose in the past fail to rise again independently, and therefore the possibility of rising from this leader is very weak.",

      "body": "If it were an altcoin, it would be hard to decide which is worth buying because all altcoins provide the same expectation, even for the altcoins currently occupying the top spot. All altcoins can increase greatly and some can surpass other altcoins, so it will be very difficult to find them.Maybe you need to concentrate on the altcoins that are on the top 100 list in the market. But my advice, you better focus on buying bitcoin and saving bitcoin because bitcoin can give hope for profit. But that's up to you and I see you already have a list of the coins. So you can start buying it at this time.",

But I can't agree more, those other coins that you have listed looks very solid, maybe just Shiba though. I'm not a fan of it, I mean clearly it's just a meme coin.BNB as well might be a good coin to add to your portfolio.Anyhow, there could be other projects that could really give us good profits in the next bull run.

Not without reason, because if I do something like that when I don't get what I want from my analysis it will make me feel very disappointed. I prefer to let the water flow without targeting a specific year or time. I prefer to target the profit I want to achieve. For example, from $100 to $110, that's more reasonable in my opinion than targeting a certain year.",

But since 2024 is still a long run, it would be better to pick coins which has potential to have a price increase based on their utility or  their involvement with different peojects such as ETH, and BNB. I guess I'd stay away from meme coins; it is so hard to predict when will the demand on such coin will rise. Most of the time, uprise movements on those coins are sue to whale manipulation or if someone like elon musk would mention it. But measuring the possible rate of increase I guess is not necessary; just the chance of those coins to increase in order to avoid over expecting and miscalculating investment movements.",

I don't think it's possible for Shiba to go that high again because that project is one of the very few that brings the highest returns for investors in last bull market.The next real gains will come from projects that are less known to the public, nothing beats buying Matic at 0.01$ years ago but now the chances of bringing such insane returns is lower.I will prefer something new if 100x is my target for the next bull market.

It's also over rated as a decentralized application for sure. I don't even know what's your reason to give all of them possibility to increase a lot.",

In general i think that a bear market like the one that we are in right now is of course never a good thing, but at least it provides an opportunity to invest into projects that are already pretty big like the ones that you have mentioned. I personally would never invest into Shiba Inu though and i also heavily doubt that it will make a x100 from here on. I think the time of meme-coins is over and Shiba Inu will slowly but surely lose relevance because in the end it is just a useless shitcoin. Your other predictions are also very optimistic i would not expect a x10. I mean i hope that but i don't think it will come that way, so only invest money that you can afford to lose.Cosmos (Atom) is also a good project in my opinion.",

The answer for me however are Bitcoin and Ethereum. They're more into long term as they are capable of bouncing back stronger no matter how long the bear market would be. BTC is very popular and widely adopted worldwide while ETH is more into Dapps. These are the only ones I see worth to DCA (dollar-cost averaging) in the long run until we see another bull run especially that the halving period will come by 2024.",
