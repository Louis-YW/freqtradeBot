The bigger part of the learning lies with you. You have to make out time to read and make more research to develop yourself. Without that you will be constantly waiting for people to always direct your every time decision. Take up yourself and decide your faith. And anyone telling you to chat them up on any other platform is not to be trusted. Beware of them because they will want to take advantage of you.",
