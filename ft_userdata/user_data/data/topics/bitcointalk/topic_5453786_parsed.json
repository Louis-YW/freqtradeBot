I'm happy for you. Most altcoins for me also are just for hype. I already experienced this before during the early days of my experience in cryptocurrency.I regret too much before because instead, I kept my Bitcoin, I exchanged them for some altcoins.Another thing why there are some people are being lured to buy altcoins instead of Bitcoin is because of the ROI they can see versus Bitcoin.",

Quote from: GreatArkansas on May 23, 2023, 03:46:10 PMAnother thing why there are some people are being lured to buy altcoins instead of Bitcoin is because of the ROI they can see versus Bitcoin.Exactly Alticoins have the potential to increase in short term than bitcoin, because this is the only way its developers can lure investors into it. The same way it has high return it also dumps in same way, and that is why it is mostly advice to treat them as pump and dump coins and not assets for investment.",

However, I cannot hide the fact that some altcoins also have the potential to generate returns regardless of whether they are investment or trading assets. You and I may be fine to be 100% on bitcoin and not diversify any assets into altcoins, but of course many altcoin investors also believe in the potential and the returns they will generate.Regardless of whether altcoin prices follow bitcoin trends or not, what is clear is that the end goal of most traders and investors is to generate profits, not use cases. In fact both bitcoin and altcoins have such prospects because of their price volatility, so someone will definitely consider them regardless of whether we like altcoins or not.",

Altcoins has made some people rich, but it has also made some people loose their investments, that is why you should always be sure when you are about to invest in an altcoin. Individuals who are not interested by huge and sudden profit invest in bitcoins.",

Normally, Bitcoin will be volatile because that's one of its characteristics, and anyone who holds Bitcoin in their wallet will definitely experience a depreciation or an increase in their capital, depending on whether the market is rising or falling. I usually advise people to always make sure they have Bitcoin in their portfolio before adding any other altcoin to it. Bitcoin is not a pump and dump token just like every other shitcoin; most of those coins, after pumping for the first time, may not pump again after they have been dumped, and if one mistakenly ends up putting their capital there, it will be an absolute waste of money. Whoever thinks Bitcoin is too expensive to buy should still remember that even with $5 they can buy Bitcoin, and with a constant DCA strategy, they will be accumulating Bitcoin gradually, and before they realize it, they will have a huge amount in Bitcoin.",

However, it appears that a significant portion of individuals who claim to adhere to this ideology are, in fact, deceiving others. I distinctly recall an occasion when I requested Adam Back to publicly affirm that he had not invested in altcoins, challenging anyone with contrary claims to come forward. Surprisingly, no one was able to present such evidence. This experience has led me to believe that every coin has its price and can be sold when the conditions are favorable. Therefore, I do not believe in holding onto any particular coin indefinitely, not even bitcoin, especially if I can acquire it at a more affordable price in the future",

Although the price can fluctuate and the DCA has to be done many times, it is at least safer than following the current meme coin trend. But I find that you all in 100 percent of your assets in bitcoin is really a waste of the money and time you spend. In addition, it is unlikely that you will also gain significant profits. So please expand the source of investment assets such as ETH or BNB, they still have good value and potential. That way you can make more profit than just bitcoins",

I just have 1 or 2 altcoins that I have invested for this year (no meme coins or shit coins for me). And I guess I have been long enough in this market that I'm no longer affected by the volatility. I just continue to buy whichever way I can, and just HODL.For the majority if might be the case or not. Specially for newbies because it's really difficult to do that, buying in years and just day by day grind or weeks or months and seeing your portfolio growing when the price goes up, and then in this bear market, sideways this month alone.",

Depends on your entry level, if you have been keeping BTC since it's bottom last year, for sure it's been great already. Bottom price is $15,500 and current price is $27k, so that is a big jump in price movement.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on May 23, 2023, 03:34:34 PMKnowing that Bitcoin is volatile in DCA pricing and also having a balanced market that shows not too much of a sign, e.g. 50% price movement within a few hours which is a sign of pump, or a drop in price significantly below 50% which is a sign of dumped. Doesn't matter if it is volatile though, If you are here for the long haul, then you will just continue to do DCA regardless of the price.

The motivation that will be the main thing is to buy and keep buying when the price is cheap. I think your option is to hold back until you really get a sizable profit from the investment you make.Btw, I'm interested and quite agree that the DCA strategy is good enough to apply to our investment pattern because this will increase our confidence to buy btc in every period that we do. Do not measure progress in the short term with any other coin than btc because it can affect your mentality to hold in the long term. I think roi btc is more promising than other coins like following the coin hype which will have a bad impact in the future",

The good thing on dealing up with Bitcoin is that it cant be easily be dumped unless if all the whales would be deciding on dumping it on one go + the market is really been that having the feeling of  FUD which wouldmake the situation gets more worst. This is why it wont really be that shocking about or in speaking about volatility because we know that this had been a main reason on why people been dealing or holdingtheir bitcoins because into its potential possible price movement in the future. We cant really just ignore on whats standing on the top of the market which does indicate that it doeshave that huge main community support which is already sitting around on a decade.

I'm glad to hear, you managed to form a clear idea of the crypto assets worth adding to the portfolio. Even though there are many other competing crypto assets, the cryptocurrency market is still dominated by Bitcoin. Overall not all cryptocurrencies are created equal, although there are some Altcoins that investors may find useful, Bitcoin remains the top choice.Bitcoin has better investment fundamentals than most of the other altcoins.

Bitcoin truly is a good choice when you have a good amount of $$ to use as capital. Saves you from a lot of headaches. It is indeed volatile but not too much compared to other altcoins though, specially sh*t/meme coins.While I think that going for bitcoin is a good choice, it would also be great if you'd try to venture into other altcoins as well and expand your portfolio for better opportunities in getting higher profit percentages. If sh*t/meme coins are still too much for you right now, there are also well reputed altcoins available out there that are not as risky. Afterall, placing all your eggs in one basket isn't really a wise decision.Just always remember to create a different investing strategy for altcoins though, since altcoins are a lot more volatile that bitcoin.",
