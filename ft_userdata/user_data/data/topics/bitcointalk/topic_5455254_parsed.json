Well, if you can offer valid collateral that can cover your loan repayment if you default, then those might not be looked at.",

Besides I think loan are likely given to those that are in a campaign or have something doing here in forum, maybe that offers services to people so that after they get paid for their job they will pay back their loan. Secondly his account is member rank so I strongly have this feelings that op might not get accepted for a loan because is not a reputable member. There are other factors lender's may consider which I can't say it all.",

There are other factors lender's may consider which I can't say it all.Being in a signature or having a higher-ranking account is only most times needed if the person wants to apply for a non-collateral loan. Those are a little bit convincing that the person will pay back, but it's not a guarantee; a loan defaulter will always be one.But if the OP has valid collateral that is even higher than the requested loan amount, then the lender doesn't have anything to worry about because the collateral, if it's in any coin, will be deposited either in the lender's wallet or in an escrow account that will guarantee repayment, and if repayment is not made, then the collateral will be sold to recover the loaned amount. It's as simple as that in such a scenario, a high-ranking account or being in the signature is actually not needed to get a higher chance of getting approved.",

Did you specifically just log into this account so that you can request for a loan?",

      "body": "I have to agree with previous members, its very hard for you to find a loan when you don´t have more feedback or are active in a campaign.Also that your password was reset recently & you woke up from a long period of inactivity does not make anything easier.I learned that the hard way that you don´t should give a loan to a person with low rank that not are in a campaign.I think it´s better if you just use this forum as a forum and search for a loan elsewhere. Good luck!",

That sudden wake up evidence doesn't look nice on the OP at all, even if their intention were genuine. Those who run loan services here know how to sniff these things out (even if we don't say it here) but I doubt if they even have any considerations for noob accounts asking for their services, let alone an account that suddenly woke up.",

Besides if op has something like that why not he just sell it off to usdt than coming to take a loan, just as i have said earlier it will be better for op if he had a higher rank. Just take a look at me for instance, i won't accept giving a loan to an account that hardly post or have less activity over here who gain no reputation.",
