But if this is only aimed at each individual without involving many people or countries who want to receive it as a whole, financial freedom will still exist even though there are a few restrictions for everyone when they want to use it to pay for certain goods or services.",

Personally, I also aim for financial freedom through bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. To achieve financial freedom, we have many different paths, but with cryptocurrencies, it may be shorter, but we need to accept risks.While many people always say that cryptocurrencies are not a get-rich-quick place, it is clear that we invest in them with that in mind.",

People that are not responsible for others or anything but themselves can't really understand that bcos no major billing is accrued to you, however, I think until you have been able to get those earnings from crypto you could reinvest even into other sectors and not waiting on your initial investment and this is outside the fact of \"Not your keys, not your coins\"",

By keeping crypto as an investment, they can sell it at a high price. Of course, this will apply to coins that can really increase, for example, bitcoin. By holding bitcoins, people can get huge profits by selling them at peak prices.And when the price corrects after hitting a peak, they can buy more bitcoins, and the cycle starts from there. With the benefits you get from bitcoin, you can be calm in enjoying your life and not worry if bitcoin experiences another correction.",

You also need jobs spots or online tasks paying in crypto in order to achieve the so desired financial freedom. Otherwise, to rely on volatile investments expecting x100 and x1000 returns for a living isn't a solid alternative after all. The point is that crypto helps connecting the entire world financially, giving you access to opportunities you didn't have before bitcoin's existence.",

Inflation in most of the EU countries is between 5 and 10% at the moment and Bitcoin lost 60% from its top. How is that an inflation hedge? Can we achieve financial freedom with bitcoin? Of course but not the way most newcomers think. Bitcoin is not there to make you rich. Financial freedom is your freedom to transact with people all around the world fast and cheap with no limits and no need to exchange currency. It's not you buying bitcoin and becoming a millionaire in a year",
