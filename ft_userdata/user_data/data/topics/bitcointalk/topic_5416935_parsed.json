A base layer is the essential one because of the \"base\" or the foundation of the system. For example, Bitcoin, ETH, BNB, and SOL, can be categorized as layer 1.By permissionless, it means that in order to participate within the layer or even interact with it, there is no authority that filter who can or cannot access it, and there is no obligation of someone to prevent anyone to not interacting with the blockchain. The word open can be synonymously perceived with permissionless. Fast could mean it has a high TPS. And lastly, scalable could be simply interpreted as the layer able to be updated with scalability improvements.",

By means of scalable is a broad topic whereas some exhibit a huge difficulty when it comes to scalability.",
