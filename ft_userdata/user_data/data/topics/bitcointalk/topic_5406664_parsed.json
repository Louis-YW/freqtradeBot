  "content": "The Bear market season has extended more than we would like causing losses of up to 80% for several weeks. This affects all of us but some of us end up more affected than others.Especially when those responsible for protocols in which we trust our money act irresponsibly causing their collapse (Terra) or confiscate our savings to declare bankruptcy (Celsius).As one of the thousands of people affected by these situations, I find myself in the need to sell a very precious intangible asset, especially for those of us who believe in Ethereum, its history and what is being built with this technology.It is a very important part of the history of Ethereum since it marked the historical change of the network.I am selling 200 Tokens of TheDAO in a single sale to the best bid received by DM in this Post.To make the sale effective, the privatekey of the address containing the 200 Tokens will be delivered so that the buyer can send them to another wallet or keep them at this address.This will be done privately under the conditions agreed with the winner.I agree to remove the PrivateKey from all of my records no matter what the buyer does with the tokens.To validate the holding of the tokens the user with a formal bid higher than the Floor Price can send a small amount including the transaction fee on the ethereum network, bnb or polygon to the address where the tokens are located and will be refunded the amount minus the transaction fee.The address containing the tokens will only be indicated to users who contact by DM with a bid higher than the floor price.The result of the sale will be announced to the winner by DM on Friday 07 / 22 at 23:59 PM (UTC).TheDAO tokens have no functionality at present and are only sold as a collectible intangible asset with a historical value of the Ethereum network .However, some collectors are still looking for these tokens so there is a market and a price reference. This price will be taken as the Floor Price for those interested.The current reference is 1 ETH for every 100 TheDAO Tokens.https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413The amount for the purchase of the tokens can be received in ETH, BNB, Matic, DAI in their respective blockchains.To send by any other Sidechain or L2 you must consult first.TheDAO was the first DAO experiment deployed on the Ethereum network, which suffered an attack that caused the first Hardfork of the network.Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb9bc244d798123fde783fcc1c72d3bb8c189413Vitalik Buterin on the Biggest Ethereum Hack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea-BViqHgUchttps://0xtycoon.github.io/thedao-museum/#https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/Any suggestion or donation is appreciated:0x6A8562afc63416320DEbF93B62f7FeD8D9d7785a",
