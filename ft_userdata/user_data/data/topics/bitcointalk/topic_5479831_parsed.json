We use BTC as a means of freedom from the US dollar.Bitcoin is indeed decentralized making it very difficult to control by any institution or government. But this doesn't dispute that the US crypto market is the biggest and most influential. Currently policies by US regulators always significant impact on the price of Bitcoin. The common truth is that the Bitcoin ETF is one of the biggest upcoming events in the crypto industry and almost every investor or trader is anticipating the positive impact it will have on the price of Bitcoin. As we are all aware Bitcoin's survival is not dependent on any event because they.will come and go. However, we will always enjoy the freedom and privacy that this currency offers.",
