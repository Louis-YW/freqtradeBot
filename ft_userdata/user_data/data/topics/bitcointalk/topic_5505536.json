When you hear that Biden (and now Harris) are \"anti-Bitcoin\", you are hearing campaign rhetoric invented by the opposing party. There's no reason to believe Bitcoin will not go up another 500% under Harris, and that the Bitcoin universe will be just fine overall, like it has been in the last four years.The safe bet is to stick with what has worked, not take a chance with a divisive figure who will turn the US economy upside down in his quest to stop abortions and deport immigrants.",

There is simply no evidence that the Democrats have been \"horrible\" for crypto.Don't confuse a few big-business lobbies--who don't have the needs of average Bitcoin consumers in mind--with actual support of Bitcoin. Every big business is going to lobby and spend a lot of money to bribe the government to make their profits a little bigger. That's what we're seeing with a few of these companies supporting Trump with millions of dollars.QuoteI don't think anyone would believe the democrats when it comes to cryptocurrency!

Those campaigning for Trump in the Bitcoin universe here and elsewhere must prove why Trump would be better--and they continue to spread the lie that Biden has been bad for Bitcoin, which is not supported by the facts.I'm all for the US government letting the crypto market continue to thrive, as it has done over the last four years. I love the idea of all of us not caring who is going to be the next president, when it comes to Bitcoin.But to hear Trump's supporters here tell it, Bitcoin has been outlawed in the US or something. But Bitcoin is legal to hold and trade in the US, we have thousand of brokers operating here, a huge chunk of mining happens in the US, and most Bitcoin investors are in the US. And now Democrats are getting overtly on the Bitcoin train--and yet Trump's supporters here can't handle that. That tells me that they support Trump, not Bitcoin.Based on the momentum right now, it would appear that Harris is on track to win in November. If she does, Bitcoin will continue to do what it has been doing, which has been great over the last four years.

They now know that the industry is important to their ambition. Donald Trump has already stolen the hearts of a large part of the crypto population due to his glamorous promises. Haris and the Democrats have so much work to do to convince the community that they have a better package for the crypto space. Appointment of some experienced professionals in Harris' advocacy group such as David Plouffe and Gene Sperling is not a bad idea.

That's probably part of the reason Bitcoin did so well under Biden.And Bitcoin, being an asset worth over a trillion dollars--mostly owned by Americans--is in fact an issue of national security. As we discussed in another thread here, any major nation-state e.g. Russia or China or Iran could attack Bitcoin by going after the hash rate through force or clandestine means--and it wouldn't be hard to attack the network and make Americans lose billions.
