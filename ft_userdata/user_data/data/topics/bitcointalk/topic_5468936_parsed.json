But nobody knows tomorrow.What I think is that bots can not do everything, humans are needed.I think I will hold you on that statement as you said \"nobody knows tomorrow\" which is quite true because with the way the world is advancing it's just a matter of time before so many things run out of place or their usefulness. The use of bots have been there ever since but as the more technology is improving everyday that's same way these bots do get upgraded too and as per cost of the new technology well I think time is the only factor that tell because I believe their is a time when all this new technology will be easily accessible maybe not now but it's eventually going to happen.",

Â Yes you talked about blockchain technology, Online jobs like YouTube, Facebook etc. But the problem sometimes is ilitracy and lack of awearness. If you are doing online job today does not implies that everyone is doing it.So now how do you go about people who can not cope with the New online jobs? Because many people have concluded that any online job is a scam. and hard work pays. And they want to see there money cash. So they don't have that patience..Many people are stocked with what dey know and can't give room for anything else.",

There's absolutely no way that the knowledge of mankind will not increase because we are born to bring solutions for the future and the only way we can run away from danger is to understand the problems that are most likely to occur in the future then we start finding lasting solutions to the problems, so if you know what our problem will be tomorrow and start solving them today when that tomorrow finally comes we won't experience much challenges again because we have already given the solution.So no matter the negative things that modern technologies might bring to us we also have to applaud the positive it brings towards enhancing a better future in as much as the positivity superceed the negativity.",

      "body": "I doubt those talking about the crypto investment and other related digital marketing investments because this is about exchange of goods and services within, around and amongst its traders and the consumers(humans) which robots doesn't have those aids otherwise robots would take general charges over the affairs from humans.There is an AI capable of doing the BITCOINS campaign but because it is an affair supposed and meant to be a P2P as an exchange otherwise even Bitcointalk wouldn't wait on our imperfect and and tolerance guestures here jobs and posts as maybe a campaign here and not even on the the trading.Honestly technology has been on the track of minimizing human stresses and the State of eliminating the imperfections of human activities while on the other hand, it is Â brings about redundancies to humans means of survival (jobs).E.g. An excavating machine & the manpower excavating scenero. At this point, there would be a choice of struggles to alternate your survival as technology is revolved and its advancement would even profer more threats to the labourers that tends to survive lives through the ability of manpower.So I guess the fear of substitutes of a man(human) to machines(technology) lingering to minimization and the redundancies of a mans means of survival is what the OP is pointing about and not that humans would totally lost it course of job(s).",

Oyibo don creat plenty robots to help man kind to solve many problem or treduce stress, but in the other way round go affect negatively.Nothing bad with AI or robot getting advancement in the country, how many head wey oyinbo dem get wey you say e no go affect them but e go come affect us. Aren't we all humans, we need to let go of that mentality or we can't achieve what they're achieving. The jobs wey you think say Robot go get, no forget say some of this Robot are going to to be manual wey be say dem go need operating and also dem go need maintenance so na job wey humans go dey do be dat. Robots go dey make us too relax, lazy and dependable on them and na the only thing wey I fit say na the negativity be dat but the rest are manageable. Instead of looking for our normal jobs wey we sabi, we go up our game and get skills in the ways of the new trend. Robots go actually make our Life better and instead of depending on man power, we go now depend on robot which equals more productivity. QuoteIf you be driver as a profession and driving robots come 9ja come take over all driving job, how you go do? Also if you be delivery man and robots come take over delivery how you go do? What about people wey say them be company or factory worker? Robots go replace man power there by leaving you with no choice. because your line of business don dey outdated and you Don dey old.Those robot go do better job pass you so why you go vex when the rebot makes life easier and now you fit go find another job wey robot never take control of or you you go learn skills for services of the robot or or robot related skills wey go dey helpful to you in the future. Physical business are getting outdated so maybe e go good when you lose that job so you fit dey reason things wey you fit do online to make money. The world dey evolves and one day most jobs wey we dey see people dey do, na robots go dey do am so e better you start to dey learn skills now to help you when robots begin dominate the workforce. Technical advancement brings civilization to a country as everything get dey digitized and not living like we're in the stone age.",

Enough work dey wey human fit do wey robot no go fit do. For instance, so many jobs dey wey need human brain to think on how to go with the work, robot go only do wetin them program am for. So many tech work dey available outside wey need human wisdom for execution, so many people need dpecial adviser for one thing or the other wey them fey do and robot no go fit do all this one. Abi robots go fit play football to entertain us the way we dey enjoy entertainment from various leagues. We are in the digital world and we need to follow up for the advacement to these technologies so that we go fit also benefit from am to make our lives easy. Imagine say you get you get robot wey dey fo everything for you for house how you go feel, you go spend less because, life go dey easy and nobody go dey grumble when the work wey you assign to am don too much.

      "body": "Smile... Technology came to help man and not to suffer man. Op I understand what you means. But the disadvantages and advantages of this technology are all equal. In my university days early 2019, there was a serious debate on this issue and it was said, the matter what technology can not remove human labour from the working place mostly in the teaching field because at the end human is the who will still carry out the instructions. And if you really look at it from the agricultural revolution to the industrial revolution what we said in the class was real because in the agricultural revolution, landlord were using serf to cultivate farm land and when industrial revolution break out from the talented workers from the agricultural era, philosophers mostly those of the capitalist school thought were arguing that human labour would be fading away but industrial revolution took overy the world economy with the spearheading by capitalism, yet human labour is still needed everywhere till date. Op what you have created was discussed last week between me and my cousin in a moving vehicle. And I told him that, the disadvantages of dis new technology which is very big and the day when accident will take place it will be disastrous. We discussed all the things you mentioned. And one I told the worst is the cooking robot, the day when fire outbreak will happen, it will be very dangerous, because the robot is not a human being so to control the fire will be difficult. These robots are already programmed so human intelligent is still more than them. Though they are helpful. According to physics. \" MACHINE is anything that reduces human effort\". So they can reduce the effort of human beings but we should take precautions when using them. Machine, Robot and technology cannot replace humans in anything.",
