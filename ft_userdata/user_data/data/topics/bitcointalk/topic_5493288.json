Today, we’re going to look at the first and still the most famous cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Born out of the 2008 financial crisis and finally coming into existence in 2009 by a figure known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin started as a geeky whisper on Internet forums and has since become a global phenomenonIt all kicked off in January 2009. Satoshi mined the first block of the Bitcoin network, called the Genesis Block. With no fanfare, Bitcoin quietly stepped onto the scene. Still, Satoshi embedded a cheeky message in this first block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks.” This was a reference to a London Times article about the U.K. ready to prop up banks again. It was a clear jab at the failing financial institutions of the time. This showed Bitcoin was the knight in digital armor here to save the day.Bitcoin is actually fun to read about.",

Okay other members realised that your work was plagiarised This action is actually frowned upon in this forum Is better you create your on post that might be sub-par than stealing another without acknowledging them. Atleast the more you post and listen to constructive criticism the better you would get.",

This is the biggest mistakes by other users especially newbies cause they think that it is okay to copy some other articles and pasted it here without knowing that this is is a serious thing cause it the same as plagiarism. And we are all know that what are the possible outcome if the user try to copy and pasted it here. Anayws OP always remember that it's better to be ourselves rather than thinking  that we are the best but we copy some works and claim that ours .",
