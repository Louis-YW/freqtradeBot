You can mix your Bitcoin there and split it into your preferred different wallet without it being traced back to your old address, and no one will know you own them again.",

You can use private coins like Monero to exchange your Bitcoin to Monero, withdraw Monero. Sell Monero somewhere and convert it back to Bitcoin if you only want to store your money in Bitcoin.The final wallet you use to store it should be a very new wallet.Challenge to achieve anonymity if you don't want to use mixers is higher fee from on-chain transactions for deposits, trading fees for a few times, withdrawals.",

If they are centralized exchanges, they can collect user data and can give those data to governments when time comes.If you use a mixer to mix your bitcoins, it does not lead to privacy and anonymity. It depends on how you pick anonymity set, how you use your coins after Coinjoin or Mixing. It depends on how that mixer service is valid and good, how they keep their promise for user privacy and anonymity, do they keep user log-ins long enough to cause data leak.",

You should as well ensure your not sending or receiving mixed coins on same address or having this exchanges done directly with exchanges as this calls for suspicion and a need to keep an eye on the wallets involved.Creating 3 wallets and spreading these coins between them makes no difference.
