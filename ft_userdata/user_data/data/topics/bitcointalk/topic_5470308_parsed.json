      "body": "Yes HONDACD125 you are right... but it is what it is you have to live with it Anyway I will suggest use online BBCode editor for example I have used https://www.sceditor.com/ many times.Not only for writing Urdu but when you are dealing with large tables or lots of quotes. It helps you to generate normal text in WSIWYG style and at the end get the code by clicking \"< >\" button on the top right and paste your code in the reply.Some time you need to adjust some specific bitcointalk related codes but those are rare and applies in special cases only.Quote from: cafter on October 14, 2023, 10:58:12 AMStep 1. Search on google for \"urdu notepad online\", Write what you want to write from right side, copy it and paste it Step 2: Write what you want to write from right side, copy it and paste it on the forum like this: Yeah cafter but if you have have Urdu keyboard installed on mobile or pc then you don't Urdu editor. But if Urdu keyboard not installed or you don't want to install then yes you can use Urdu keyboard online for example https://urdukeyboardonline.com/But this will make your life slow so it's better to have Urdu keyboard installed on your device.",

I don't know if our friend @PowerGlove has any idea how to solve it.It can be frustrating for those who write in Urdu or Arabic, as we all know these languages start from right to left. I don't exactly remember where, but I recently saw a thread where it said the subject titles of bitcointalks were also misplaced in Arabic. If I recall correctly, you were there too.It would be much help if the administrators patched this problem. Like when I'm writing in a certain language, the forum should adapt itself to that writing style.Many social media sites and forums have this kind of feature. If your account name is in Arabic, your writing will automatically go from right to left.",

I faced so much difficulty write Urdu language and wasted more then hours just for correcting error.Yes, bro, you made a good decision to raise a crucial and important issue in front of people. This problem is very common for Pakistani local threads. Because when we try to write in our native Urdu language, firstly, writing starts from the left side, due to which the sentence is fragmented, which presents a big hurdle in correcting it. So I also have this opinion that there should be an option in the reply for this problem through which we can change the writing stance from right to left, so that will make it easy to write a post or quote for Urdu writers. So far, only a few respected members have reviewed it, but no tangible justification has been found to solve this problem.QuoteI faced so much difficulty write Urdu language and wasted more then hours just for correcting error.Apart from this, my dear OP, if you had added one more thing to discuss this problem, we would have got a little guidance, or these staff members would have considered our problem. The problem is that there are word limits for writing Urdu in our local thread, due to which we cannot write the whole post once. Our member had also opened a thread on this topic(words limitations?), but no response was received from the staff. So the purpose of saying this is that the forum moderators will be very kind to find a way for us to solve this problem or make a local board for us in which we do not have to face these difficulties. Apart from this, you can also see the performance of our thread, which is much better.Moreover, if the staff helps us get a new independent board for Pakistan where our opinion will be taken as a serious. Our respectful senior shahzadafzal made a huge effort for our local board, but all in vain because theymos hasn't given a single piece of attention to us. So kindly put some sight on our case for the local board and make it as soon as possible.",

MS Word should be the latest one as the previous one didn't have that many functions through which we could do our work. Do you need it just for numbering or do you need it for the whole sentences?",

You will face this issue everywhere e.g. Microsoft Word, Facebook comments or any where where English language is default ltr, I have seen this issue on twitter too. I will suggest when you are writing Urdu you have to type the numbers also in Urdu/Arabic,for example instead of 1, 2, 3, 4 5... you should write Urdu/Arabic numerals €± €≤ €≥ €¥ €µ...I know it's difficult to write/understand numbers in local language but for now you have live with and avoid mixing English Urdu text.",
