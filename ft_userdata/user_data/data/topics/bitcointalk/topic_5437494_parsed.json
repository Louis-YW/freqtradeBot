They will both look like the bottom. I wouldn’t want to be sitting on the sidelines if that’s the case. Sure, it might fall in the short term, but that’s why you have to weigh the risks and reward. I think I’d rather take the ride than watch where it goes.",

      "body": "Trying to time the precise bottom price is a false perspective, you will make less money trying for perfection.  Better to regularly be involved in a positive price progression and also trade some of that, hopefully in time to avoid some of the negatives.  Overall most people wont have perfect aim, its arrogant to think so.Higher price creates greater possible selling so the momentum of the trend must be maintained.   The question is not if we pullback but the quality of how we do so on every opportunity I think.   So right now BTC has some selling, its wavered some and then today recovered a bit also.Here 1hr bars, the yellow line matters more its a slower weekly average and blue is faster movement.   I think we're in the orbit of FED news, that event having gravity to keep us here until market has resolution for its direction.   We can go higher of course but overall I think we explore all 20k prices.",

The previous dump was surely FUD sell. However, more data is needed in order to make a more precise prediction. Bitcoin is currently at the resistance zone so its price will be volatile a lot. Anyone who bought bitcoin low on tomorrow might be cheering right now. The recovery strength from the crash was outstanding. I thought we were in bearish season...",

I guess it's obvious that it's a recovery.",

Comments like the OP's are short-sighted. He is thinking about whether it is going to go up or down in a short period of time in order to buy or sell accordingly, which only a small percentage of traders are capable of doing profitably over the long term, and the OP doesn't look like one.It is necessary to think more in the long term, with a view to at least 4 years from now, and if it is 8 years from now, even better. You ensure profitability and avoid headaches.",

      "body": "If you weren't buying in after the FTX crash, then yeah you've almost certainly missed the absolute bottom. But in general the whole <$25k range is the bottom of the bear market. Bitcoin still has some work to do and very possibly a fair bit of time before it breaks out of the bottom. But yeah the post FTX <$17.5k bottom is almost certainly gone for good.But if you're buying now you're still buying the bottom. Nothing wrong with missing $15k/16k/17k and buying at low $20k's. In 2025 price will probably hit $150k-$200k so you don't miss anything buy buying in under $25k.",

But in any case still a goo price to invest, projection for the next bull run is 6 digits, $100k-$200k so you can still make a good profit if you invest right now.But I will say that we are still in the bear market. Probably is just just some recovery that we are seeing and maybe the next stop for the price is $25 k. And then maybe we will see if there is a correction (most likely), to around $20k again before moving to the next price level of $30k-$50k at the end of the year.",

I can understand someone's hesitation if they want to invest a lot of money and maybe buy 0.5 BTC or more, but most of those who waited for the right moment invest several tens or hundreds of $ and actually will not save any significant amount in such calculations.Quote from: Yaunfitda on February 01, 2023, 08:27:49 AMBut I will say that we are still in the bear market.

If we're talking six-figure speculation after the halving in 2024, it really doesn't matter if someone missed the $15k bottom or if they're buying today, tomorrow, or a month from now.",

All that aside, I'm happy to see bitcoin's current price movement and it's making a lot of people who bought at the lowest price smile quicker than they should.  We can't say for sure if this is the start or if the price will reverse, but there's no problem with that as long as we plan to invest in bitcoin for the long term.",

Closing January at $23,139 is a new achievement since so long the price chart has played below the price of $20K or above $16K.I was happy with the price at the beginning of the month and now the atmosphere is still going well with new support prices this year.This situation is not yet decided where it will go, there could be another correction.If you've ever made a purchase at the selling price of 1 BTC for $17K and chose to hold for the long term, that would be a good strategy.",

If you had seen the price of Bitcoin on the market at that time, of course you would know that and also be able to conclude at the current price where Bitcoin is already in the $23K range.

After all, the lowest bitcoin price has been passed and is $15k. But you don't need to be sad because bitcoin will still experience a correction so you can buy it. At this time, you can decide just to invest and not trade if you don't have enough skills to analyze bitcoin movements because that can get you in trouble. It's better to set aside a certain amount of money every week or month to invest so that if a bull run rally occurs, you can join other people and profit later.",

Considering last year was filled with crashes and the previous cycle was left incomplete we already have an accumulated demand waiting to enter the market too.But the price is still going to be affected by the ongoing recessions in many countries and that may make the bull run slightly harder.
