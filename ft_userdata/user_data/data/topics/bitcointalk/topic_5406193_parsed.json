But it is no offense to join discussions even if most of those who are sharing ideas are high rank members. Just make sure you're bringing something relevant.",

Even those high ranking posting there also been criticised and undegone correction but thats normal no ones perfect to know everything and this is a forum and discussion of opinion is openly accepted. If you think you are correct and the one you saw is wrong then justify it and show its support and people here will back you if you are right.",

However, if you are able to rationally back up your argument, provide real life examples or relevant hypothetical situations, or if you simply have a solution in mind for the discussion's topic, then post.Personally, you are only going to make a post if you have something interesting to say regardless of your rank, and that's it.",

In your case, as long as you know what you are saying then you don't need to be intimidated by these higher rank users. Now to answer your question, there are some like Beginners & Help, Off-topic and Local section as well. Don't hesitate to share your opinion here as long as there is nothing wrong with it whether it is a negative or a positive one. Learn to accept criticisms because I myself can't accept criticisms years ago but throughout the years, I learned it and you should as well.",

Aside from that, you can post anywhere you wish. Newcomers that are not just bounty hunting tend to post more, I believe, in Beginners & Help and Bitcoin Discussion, but it’s not so much a question of where you want to post but what topics you feel more inclined to participate in, which lead to determining the appropriate boards.Now it’s true that it is not trivial to participate with some non-trivial comment, and the best way to overcome that is to read a fair share on the topic to gain some background knowledge, and to try to read through the whole thread (within reason) before making your post.",

Apart from the ones listed where there are restrictions due to ranks, you are free to express yourself in any board you are comfortable and have knowledge to share, however as a newbie, in your early days especially if you are new, with little knowledge about crypto and have never been in any forum, the most appropriate board where other forum users here expect you to have more activity in is in this BEGINNERS & HELP board where you can gain visibility before you begin to try out discussions elsewhere. But say you are an experienced newbie with very good knowledge of crypto, particularly bitcoins and that was what lured you to sign up here, you can participate in Development & Technical Discussion and Bitcoin Technical Support.",

Some have earned their ranks for knowledge, some only by simply being very old here (but not necessarily knowledgeable). Even newbies can ask or tell smart things, even legendary members can ask or tell stupid things and make mistakes.Quote from: Mate2237 on July 13, 2022, 11:55:56 PMAnd some of the threads I saw there are very good for me to at least make a comment but my fear is that, wether is is an offend to do so.

And if there is please provide those boards for me so I will be properly guided.As said there are no restrictions, just, if you create a topic, make sure you create it in the most suitable subforum, hence increasing the chance of being seen by relevant people (one example is that you better ask about mining in the Mining areas than in Beginners and Help).Then... you should never fear of offending some. It's a free forum. Some get offended easy, some not at all, learn to care less about such things.So as long as you are on topic, you don't repeat things already said and as long as you don't spam, .. you should be okay.",

I am pretty not sure how it worked, but I believe as the name implied, it was a restriction of newbies to some specific boards and their inability to do some things.Since the idea of newbie jail is no longer invoke and theymos is unwilling to re-introduce it, you are free to post anywhere that allows you to post including the meta.But don't abuse the privilege.
