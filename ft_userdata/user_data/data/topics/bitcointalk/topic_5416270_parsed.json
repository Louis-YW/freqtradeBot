It has happened before to other popular altcoins before, so it was just a matter of time to happen with BSC as well. I just hope people will take it as a warning that BSC is not the best blockchain to keep your money on, but knowing how people tend to have short memory I doubt that will happen and soon this will be forgotten.Quote from: Awaklara on October 07, 2022, 05:35:59 AM but it looks like Binance has also announced that all funds are safe.Of course they announced the funds are safe, I wouldn't expect them to say anything else.",

Many shitcoins have suffered from hacks, exploits and other problems in the past... The Binance chain is no different in that it couldn't happen to them.And, as for \"all funds are safe\", that's decentralization - In Binance style!",

And if loss of funds of users then binance will never take responsibility.According to Binance, its not that hacker took someone else's money, but instead BSC was exploited and attacker created bunch of BNB out of thin air. Then again, if someone can do that you should ask yourself how much is your BNB actually worth and should you even have any.

Binance was already hacked before so, another sequence of hack is no longer a surprising moment to those that have been aware of it. Well, if this new to you then it's really surprising but for everyone that have seen them getting hacked before, nothing new.Quote from: Lucius on October 07, 2022, 10:39:44 AMCheap PR that costs nothing more than a few tweets, job done successfully.You said it so, and even there's no other team that will work for it just to tell their customers shouldn't worry at all.

I believe they can easily freeze the hacker wallet address or there blockchain just to recover the hack funds. CZ has a dedicated team for crypto security especially on large scale hacked like this. I don’t read the article yet but centralized exchange works that way and it’s one of the advantage of centralized blockchain in time like this since they can target hacker wallet address to freeze as long as the issue was reported earlier.",
