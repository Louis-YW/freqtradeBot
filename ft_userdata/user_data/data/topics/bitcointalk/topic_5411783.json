  "content": "So, as many of us have already noticed, Preev.com is frequently going down. In an era ruled by CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko/Nomics, Preev.com was still a thing for many of us. We liked it for its simple interface. But, now, as the boat is sinking, we were looking for an alternative. Interestingly, many have sprung up quickly to fill the void. So, I collected them from various threads discussing those on BitcoinTalk and putting it forward to all of you for a vote.Which one is your most favorite alternative to Preev.com?- Preev.com- myri.io- pnnv.com- 100bit.co.in- oh.gold- coinconvert.net- preev.net- btc2fiat.meAfter you cast your vote, please mention the WHY in a comment below.",

Simple interface2. Dedicated domain3. No advertisementThe first option, given by you, can be still be considered as a dedicated subdomain. But, the second option simply does not cut it. If I include that, I'll need to include many others like https://nomics.com/markets/btc-bitcoin/usd-united-states-dollar etc. In any case, if more people mentions https://preecs.coolstorage.org, I'll include it in the poll.In another post on BitcoinTalk, I came across two more domains, running the same script. These, I believe, can become alternative to Preev.com. So, I am including those as well...i. https://coinconvert.netii. https://oh.gold",

In terms of functionality and design there is not much difference. So, I got with domain which is easiest to remember for me. And it's Preev.net. Though, I must admit that Oh.Gold is good one, even if it's not related with crypto. And most important, it's original.",

I hold this domain since 2013 and it is already renewed till the end of 2024. You may check details @ https://domains.google.com/registrar/search/whois/100bit.co.inMoreover, those of us, who are into serious development for long, have enough abundant server space to host multiple websites like this.So, effectively, neither domain nor hosting renewal will become a roadblock in near future.",
