I wonder if he has changed his tune now. Warren Buffet seems to have similar thinking to Paul Krugman, he believes bitcoin is a scam and isn’t worth investing a penny in. True, he is a self made billionaire and a renowned for investment success, but that doesn’t make him an expert on all things.",

It's wonderfully hilarious, but frankly speaking most of us probably had comparable situations in their private environment or somewhere else when someone was bashing cryptocurrency due to ignorance or a lack of understanding and then unknowingly demonstrated that knowledge gap by criticizing something that Bitcoin would be the solution to.  I just can't give a concrete example now, but I realized this is not the first time I come across something like this. But as I said, this one is really awesome exactly because it comes from a Nobel prize winner.I have often been thinking about some joke articles and one that came to my mind was to approach a specialty market and suggest them to sell rat poison in a containment that loos like a physical Bitcoin on one side and the other side of the coin would be a cartoon of Warren Buffett. I guess if ever someone comes around and understands the joke because he or she is a Bitcoiner, they would probably buy it for the lols. It is no problem when knowledgeable or even Nobel prize winners express skepticism, but what is hilarious about it is just how short-sighted and fluffy they talk about stuff while everyone would think they went for an intellectual deep dive before making weak statements. Awesome you put this one together!",

Many Chinese citizens thought their daily routine is work, shopping, dinner with family and a movie in bed. Then they realized there will be no shopping and no dinner because the bank doesn't allow them to take money out and there are tanks protecting it so you can't even protest.You're doing fine until some shit happens like your country goes to war and says that you either go to war too or to jail, so you have to run away, but there's a line to the ATM and withdrawal limits.",

But they sure want to look down on innovators.But luckily future doesn't rely in the shoulders of old farts but newcomers with fresh ideas. And there has always been a gap with new innovators and old money / young trends and old people.If i have learned one thing, that's not to overlook any innovation as pointless because the prototype isn't working as good as it should. Sometimes tech isn't ready for innovations but that changes quickly. There are some fellow old people i know that seem out of touch in some things but are following the cutting edge of tech industry, their mind is open and wondering like a child's mind and that's a goal worth pursuing. I try to do that even if i am totally out of touch and can't comprehend tech. I am not going to push it down just because tech makes me uncomfortable.But now i am generalizing. It's not only old farts who are against new tech, you can find plenty of close minded yöung people as well.",

He's called for more crypto regulation for the sake of protecting consumers from the predations of crypto because he's under the false impression that government acts more efficiently than the market can. Of course, he's rather silent about rapidly inflating fiat currency as a result of poor fiscal policy by the central banks.",

It suggests laziness and an unwillingness to do the tough, necessary work. But when it comes to the looming sequester--$1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts set to occur in three weeks--economist Paul Krugman says it's the best plan we have.\"The reality is, we should do nothing,\" Krugman said on The Last Word Thursday. \"The best thing to do right now is to kick the can down the road. We should not be having any spending cuts right now...The sequester is not serving any useful purpose that could be served better by something else.\"https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/kick-the-can-down-the-road-says-krugman-msna18692Paul Krugman is a legend.I've followed Krugman for more than 10 years. He has many interesting things to say. (Although I don't know if many agree with him.) His stance and message has always been direct and consistent. Yet many appear not to know who he is. They don't know Krugman is one of the leading architects and founding fathers of modern monetary theory. As well as many modernist ideology concerning finance, economics and money.The contrast between Milton Friedman and Paul Krugman is also an interesting one.",

Almost all macroeconomists around the world hate Bitcoin/altcoins. There must be a reason for that. Bitcoin/crypto cannot be used as a tool for imposing monetary policies. Bitcoin is designed to have no central authority that makes decisions about the future of the BTC blockchain.
