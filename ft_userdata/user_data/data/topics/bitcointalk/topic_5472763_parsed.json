With the amount of money involved and the number of people who have been victimized, it is very unfair for the victims to see that the person who was victimized is free to go wherever he wants and the situation is still good, right?So for me, that's good news; I just don't know if it's bailable or non-bailable. I just hope that no one is bribed with money from people related to that investigation.",

      "body": "It is sad new for Sam Bankman and his family but good news for cryptocurrency fraud victims.  SBF story was a fraud in the first place.  I always believe that his story as a kid genius is all made up for the founding of the so-called FTX which later filed a bankruptcy due to the leader's mismanagement of funds.  It could have been more than 115 years if clients filed a case individually since punishment is made individually and not collectively and I believe the sentences piled up.Quote from: gunhell16 on November 03, 2023, 10:20:29 PMSo for me, that's good news; I just don't know if it's bailable or non-bailable. I just hope that no one is bribed with money from people related to that investigation.I think whether the case is bailable or not depends on the jurisdiction and the severity of the case.  There are also factors that contribute to whether the estate will acknowledge the plea to bail or not and the risk of the person fleeing to another country or there is more risk involved if the person is out of jail.",

Sadly, he's not going to meet that because the sentence ain't enough, much better if the judge has added it and made exactly how long he needs that.This is like justice to the ones that have been victims of his fraudulent activities and the result of swindling people's money.

It is as simple as that, many of these services are run by shady and corrupt people and since they control a lot of gullible people's funds, they would try to use that money to make more for themselves.",

If that happens, fraudulent exchanges will no longer exist, but it will also mean that we will once again be controlled by the government. That's the scenario I'm thinking of. The collapse of FTX and the imprisonment of SBF, is not a warning to the remaining CEXs, it is a good reason for the government to have the right to intervene in the market and regulate things.",

I think they didn't repay anyone. This should also serve as a lesson to those that have been keeping their assets on the centralized exchange. I know that there were a majority of crypto investors who lost a huge amount of money during the crash of this exchange, and they will never get back that much money because it's gone.",

IIRC, they also sued Binance and CZ a few days ago, CMIIW. I guess they believe anyone who doesn't follow their rules is doing shady things behind the scenes.At the very least, you have the option of going P2P or using a DEX.

If we look just at that side (without of course considering that SBF ruined the life of thousands of people) is kind of funny how the US got tricked by its own people, they were so focused on accusing Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, etc etc, at the end they were the problem.",

Bankman-Fried's complete lack of concern for the safety and trust of his platform's users was not only unethical, but also a sign of how cocky he was. He really thought that his deal was unbreakable and that it couldnt fall apart. That being said, pride comes before a fall. Now he has to deal with the very real results of what he did.The court of public opinion often gives the harshest punishments, even if the law has already made its decision. Fraudulent actions like these have effects that go beyond just losing money. They make investors and users afraid of the system and make people less likely to trust it. Other markets and financial institutions should learn from this: if you do something wrong, it will always have consequences, no matter how big or unbeatable you think you are.",
