Bitcoin’s fourth halving is projected to take place on or around April 24, 2024. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the halving’s effects and what to anticipate.The Countdown to Halving and Understanding the Halving MechanismBy current measurements, 193 days remain until the halving, set for April 2024. In essence, the Bitcoin halving, coded into Bitcoin by its founder,Satoshi Nakamoto,  happens every 210,000 blocks, roughly every four years. When the network hits a certain block number, the mining reward — the bitcoin amount miners earn for verifying transactions — is halved.For instance, the initial mining reward was 50 bitcoins per block, and it fell to 25 bitcoins per block after 2012’s first halving. This system ensures a regulated supply rate that diminishes over time. To date, Bitcoin has undergone three halvings: the first on November 28, 2012, the second on July 9, 2016, and the third on May 11, 2020, when the reward declined to 6.25 BTCread",

      "body": "Wow, there are just around 200 days left till crypto-Christmas, is that right? So, here's the situation: we're all waiting for the halving, rubbing our hands together, thinking about charts, and attempting to predict what will happen. However, we understand that the rewards for miners will be cut in half, which should theoretically reduce supply and increase demand, possibly leading to an increase in prices. Its fundamental economics, but the word \"theoretically\" should be kept in mind.Now, the prior halves have featured some incredible bull runs after the event. We observed it in 2013, in 2017, and, with a delayed effect, in 2020 as well. But, (and yes, there is a \"but\") the price of Bitcoin is affected by a wide range of variables. Therefore, even though the halving—a planned mechanism for creating scarcity—is a foregone conclusion, its effect on pricing is anything but predicted. Heck, unforeseeable events (like global pandemics) and the macroeconomic environment can all change the trend in unexpected ways.",

      "body": "Miners don't only make money out of Block rewards (Block reward is the reward in BTC which currently is 6.25) but a miner makes money out of the fee that people pay while making transactions. Because miners are the ones who validate TX and process TX and spend their useful resources (machinery) and spend a huge amount of energy just to earn money. And with halving, there is no doubt that the block reward reduced to half, which of course a loss for the miners, but as you can see, with each halving, the price of BTC improved and the amount that miners were making in BTC did decreased but in fiat (USD) it increased. I hope there is no need to give an example. So, I think when the halving in April occurs, the price of BTC will improve and reach to a height where it will be making them the same or more money even from the fee which from another point of view, might be a problem for the TXs makers. But it can be solved using the Lightning network.",

But you said, that's not how it works --> that would be in a way to emphasize the bad side of it, which is high hash rate means more machines and more energy, and more expenses. If it exceeds the profits then obviously the business will go bankrupt. How can you say, it doesn't ensure a price increase, I mean, after each and every halving, back in time, the price of BTC improved and reached new ATH or isn't it? Maybe I am missing something. Would love to hear from you. Just to be clear, I am not being too optimistic about the BTC price, and of course, I accept the possibility of BTC not touch new heights but the probability of this possibility is negligible in my mind.",

That's probably why hash rate has skyrocketed comparably to previous halvings. But, that doesn't mean history will repeat itself. We can't make schedules based merely on Bitcoin doubling in price every four years.",

If it exceeds the profits then obviously the business will go bankrupt. The result of halving is reduced hashrate not a higher one. The price of Bitcoin does not instantaneously rise after the halving is done, but the new coins awarded to miners is halved immediately, causing miners with a business to run to encounter difficulties finding their mining gear and electricity.By history, many miners lose interest in mining immediately following the halving and close down their rig. This results in a lower hashratr and some period of difficulty adjustment to make it more accessible.",

Because miners are the ones who validate TX and process TX and spend their useful resources (machinery) and spend a huge amount of energy just to earn money. The question would be, as the block reward diminishes, will the transaction fee make up for the reduced reward?  If there is not enough transaction to compensate miners for the reduced reward and miners experienced shortage of profit, this would be a big problem on the Bitcoin ecosystem.QuoteAnd with halving, there is no doubt that the block reward reduced to half, which of course a loss for the miners, but as you can see, with each halving, the price of BTC improved and the amount that miners were making in BTC did decreased but in fiat (USD) it increased. I hope there is no need to give an example. This is the reason why adoption and Bitcoin integration to companies as mode of payment must sync with or even goes further with the halving to compensate for the reduced reward.  Relying on the price increase alone is not sufficient because somewhere down the road price increase will meet its choke point and as the mining reward goes to zero, it will only rely on the transaction fee for the reward, reason why adoption and integration is very important.Quote from: Faisal2202 on October 15, 2023, 03:02:13 PMSo, I think when the halving in April occurs, the price of BTC will improve and reach to a height where it will be making them the same or more money even from the fee which from another point of view, might be a problem for the TXs makers.

I hope that the increase in price will make mining more than profitable because I think as of now tx fee reward cannot make up for the reduced reward due to halving.",

I am sure a not of newbies will find it informative. Halving occurs in every 4 years roughly. The expectation for miners is the hike in price. As the mining reward will be reduced by 50%, the price of bitcoin should get increased to compensate for the miners. It's a risky thing because, unless the price increases, it will become difficult for the miners to make profit out of their mining activities.
