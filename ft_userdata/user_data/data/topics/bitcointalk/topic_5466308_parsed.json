Firstly, if such a trend appears, there will be a lot of scams along with it. Secondly, it is not very clear what utility such coins will provide. I remember that a long time ago such projects have already been, but they were not very popular. I think that if some popular social network makes its own coin, it may not be needed either.",

Use that money to invest in other established coins. I have 100coins on my reddit, I do not how I got the coins, but I did, so I am keeping the coins to see what they could be used for later. I do not know exactly how I got some the coins, but I will not mind having more on my account, maybe it will be useful for something on reddit or for something reddit related.",

The only SocialFi project that has any traction whatsoever is friend.tech. It's very early and the bonding curve makes it like a ponzi, but I guess that's the main attraction for crypto community (aside from the airdrop promise). We'll see whether this project will survive in the next few months.",

Just from how I see it there is no reason for Reddit and Twitter to even do this. I did not even know this will happen. I know Reddit coins are for rewarding people on Reddit. And Elon Musk did say there is no Twitter token so I do not think this will happen.",

I dont think that they should be considered as a good investment, as they are used only to award users content. Frankly speaking, they have a huge value on impact on a post. I think badges (gold or silver) are more valuable. Their value wont grow, as this is just a like, it has not much difference from a regular thumbs-up.",

If you're talking about DONUT and the same stuff. I wouldn't suggest anyone invest in it, but if you're a Reddit user making a MetaMask to get it will not harm you.

I'd still stick to Bitcoin if it's about investing on them if I don't have much spare money. But if you're someone who's got a lot of spare money, do so. IIRC, there have been a lot of these projects that were introduced during the ICO days but not all of them became popular. I guess if it's reddit and twitter, they're different because they're part of the most popular social platforms. And what if Facebook does that? They've already failed with the Libra project they've started.",

I was only aware that there was like a subscription stuff going on in there. Not like I really checked my whole account since I only wanted to read stuffs in there.I am already aware of Reddit coins though and I don't think it is a new feature in Reddit considering that I usually award people for free there with their free claiming of Reddit awards and stumble upon buying of Reddit coins to buy Reddit awards (what?). Anyways, I don't really suggest though unless you're into like buying any Reddit-related items which I could have invested instead to a better game I wanted or....yeah Bitcoin.",

Purchasing it as investment doesn’t make sense since it’s not an investment token rather than just a native currency thatyou can only purchase on reddit.I believe you are being mislead by some random shitcoin that use the name reddit coin to attract investors since reddit doesn’t have any investment coun aside from their current coin that you can purchase on the site.",

When users exchange their community tokens for rewards, Reddit will cover the gas fee needed for the transaction. In addition, tokenholders can participate in governance proposals that introduce new functionality to the tokens. .https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-community-tokens-soar-kraken-listingWe never know in the future if they will launch their own governed coin for the whole community, The two tokens are doing great, so there's a possibility that they create another one and make it a form of incentive for their content creators on the whole community.",
