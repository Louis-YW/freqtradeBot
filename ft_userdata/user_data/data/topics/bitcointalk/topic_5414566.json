When it rises, it is rising like a bomb and would kill all shorters. However, such rises only occur after so many months of accumulation.Bitcoin temporarily is in its accumulation and we can not expect too high recovery at the moment. When lot of people expect of recovery, it won't recover strongly. We must wait for angry phase when most of people lose faith and hope, then suddenly Bitcoin will start its show.",

Nope. It would be too risky. This is how most people loses their money. They FOMO everything have into coins that are trending and then they end up losing everything because they invest at the wrong moment. Never buy the news. If it is already trending, then high chance you are already very late.The price of XRP already went up 70% within the last few days. Too risky to be investing now since there are lot of long term holders who have been waiting for this moment to pass on their bag and exit with their profits.",

Bitcoin remains the first to be seen for anyone to own, because Bitcoin will still be at its best at this time. And if that choice were made for me, maybe I would choose both without forgetting Bitcoin. Because to me it would be very silly to have to leave Bitcoin just because of the current price drop and choose another one (Ripple) just because there is a pump in the price.",

This time it's still remain speculation. People buy in rumour and sell for the news. that's pretty much the same like what happened in luna.

Look, even to say that they are winning in their SEC issue but this won't change the view of this coin and it was too far to compare to Bitcoin and even ETH. You don't get wrong with what you think about this project. Well, I don't weight much on its rank but certainly, I'd just look to the projects that are really capable to do a good market because, in the end, this will affect our profit margin.",

So those who want to invest should still wait, no need to rush.XRP winning the lawsuit will have an impact on its price in the short term but there is no guarantee in the long term, if XRP continues to develop its project seriously its future has hope. Remember it is a centralized blockchain and is applied in financial institutions like banks, many people don't like this because of that, its development is still a question.",
