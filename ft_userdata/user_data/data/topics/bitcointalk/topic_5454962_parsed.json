The only thing we need to be focused on to really move crypto forward is finding ways to anchor governance protocols into the real world. This is in fact the scaling solution because once we're able to effectively decentralize territory we can then put data centers and routers in this decentralized territory and now you're scaling is only limited by compute speed processing speed",

Governance protocol works on dex projects through voting by every users of that community. Government wants restriction due to a lot of scams and until the problem with that will stop they wouldnt have harmonious connection with decentralized people. Plus they wanted to have a tax whenever opportunity like this becomes a reality.",

I'm not saying that this is a bad idea, but comparing it to a bank? I mean that is where why we are in crypto though, and now we are going back to the same principle that we don't like? have central authority in the middle to control everything?Regardless though, crypto has becoming a business now, so whichever protocols we implemented, there is a way that \"decentralized\" territory will be tap and obviously, someone entity will have to make money out out it, sacrificing processing speed and power.",

It may not be perfect, but we get a witness a live example of decentralizationAnd I think bitcoin could be the only true coin to achieved decentralization, yeah as you have said, it has flaws, but as far as perfecting it, I think it's all good. Unlike those projects who in the beginning we thought that are decentralized, and yet it has change a lot in the last couple of years and now beginning to be control by someone or some entity like the corporations or the wealthy.So I think there will be some logical or killer app for blockchain. Bitcoin could be the closest that we can see, but it will remain that old school but that's one of it's strength and that's why it remain the dominant crypto for many years.",

I believe I have a solution. Yes, this does sound absurd, I myself do not believe in most Proof of Stake systems.

That's why most of the government officials of each country are opposed and they think that it is not good and will not bring any help to their economy because their motive is different and it is to control it like they control Fiat.That's why some countries are adopting blockchain technology and others are not. Why do El Slavador and other countries recognize this as additional help to their country's economy?",

I just feel the risk is higher than the rewards. The only attack vector against what I've built has \"mirror properties of nakamoto consensus\" I'm willing to have the integrity battle tested.Quote from: bettercrypto on June 05, 2023, 06:17:29 AM their motive is different and it is to control it like they control Fiat.This isn't really something you have to get permission for  unless they wanted to invoke violence after realizing what the physical setup of this system is capable of . But by the time they realize that, it's a global network and they wouldn't put a dent in the system.I understand the skepticism about the fairness of the governance asset and that's why my first usecase is going to be using the protocol as a \"dirty oracle\" for a betting platform. That way people can get a sense of the protocol's physicality first.",
