      "body": "After I had read through the first paragraph coupled with the topic of the thread I did not bother reading any further because you have already passed across your message telling us who you really are. Scammers really do this just as you have done introducing yourself and that speaks of much volume. I would not be surprise if you succeed in getting what you want and at the end your signal community starts complaining of your acts. There have been lots of threads of this nature in the past and similar thing repeating itself in a refurbished and well packaged way to deceive newbie traders to joining their community and when they do that they start requesting for what they can not process but a product of already generated signal from another group. So tell us any difference from yours?",

Trading signal groups have nothing to offer than to enrich their pockets with your money, they do not care if the trader will lose it win.That's a 100% valid assumption because I also believe that those trading signal groups are mostly copy/pasting the signals to many groups only to fill their pockets with money. I know there can be a few valid signal groups but surely they will also have their models to generate income because without any income why should those traders waste their time to share those signals. Most of the signals aren't even shared by good traders because good traders would most probably do trading themselves rather than sharing those signals in groups like that unless they can earn some kind of revenue from such thing. I would recommend @OP to be warned that the members of this forum are not naive enough to join those signal groups because I can smell some kind of scam activity in your offer and that's why I'm warning you to stop promoting such bogus services.",
