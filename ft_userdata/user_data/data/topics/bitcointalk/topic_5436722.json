Then, the price of Bitcoin cannot fall to Zero as they're many lost bitcoin in different addresses which will help the price of Bitcoin to stay ahead of zero, even if everyone moved ahead to another technology. You should be asking if they'll ever be a time when no node is running on the network. Such things are what could affect the Bitcoin network, but it's almost impossible to have no running node in the network and zero price of Bitcoin.",

This will be possible only if BTC Blockchain be completely damaged and have no chance of recovery And there is no chance of that happening.",

Will Bitcoin ever fall to zero someday?people might think Bitcoin will be just like any other crypto. market entry, pump, dump, and die. but Bitcoin is different, Bitcoin has a really strong market. if it goes down sharply, there will always be those who believe in Bitcoin and buy it. and when it gets cheaper, it will also be offset by higher demand. it will stabilize the price again.Quote from: Sakanwa on January 25, 2023, 12:48:07 PM2. What happens if it ever falls to zero?it's hard to think about that. but if the fate of Bitcoin is like shitcoin which eventually has to be 0 (although I believe it will happen), it means that there is an alternative solution that is technologically and in use better than Bitcoin. of course, that can be a bridge from the problem of managing money as a transaction tool in the world.",

Since BTC teams are seriously working every night and day to ensure BTC still remain the king among other cryptocurrencies which will be some of the reason the price will not dump to zero level. I will advise you to invest in BTC now so that you will be part of those that will celebrate soon because, you sound like some people that will regret when the price of BTC hit $100k soon.",

The reason for which Bitcoins won’t fall to this extent is due to the marketcap of the coin. It simply indicates what the trading volume or amount of Bitcoins that is being transacted all over the market. So yes if Bitcoins fall at certain level, it will gain back in price, or more people will buy it as soon as they see a drop in the price. So yes Bitcoins cannot come to 0 if we see in real life.",

And if indeed the value falls to zero, there will be extraordinary panic in the market because many people have bought bitcoins at various prices. They will experience depression after seeing the bitcoin price become zero.

The second question I would formulate differently: what should happen for the price of bitcoin to fall to zero?1. Well, if BTC will ever cost 0, then the consequences are obvious. Humanity will lose interest in this and, therefore, bitcoin will be destroyed as a currency, investment tool and technology. Nothing is forever, which means that even btc will cease to exist. Once.
