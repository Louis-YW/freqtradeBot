      "body": "He might be not satisfied or maybe he doesn't want to wait for 360 seconds wait-time. Since the OP is a newbie he can't able to respond right away.Or maybe he just doesn't know how to go back or find his old thread.For the main topic about CryptoPay, they are offering cards since 2016 based on their official thread that they created here on the forum I don't know what you mean by a new card program or you might be talking about their app?Before there is a signup or join button on the site but right now they force you to open an account through the app I don't know what's the reason but it is way easier to use than before.Why not check their social media accounts about their service from the official thread below?- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1384807.0",

Because i did not prefer to check the OP's profile but after reading it i suspected and then i read your and i was right about it.I have also seen many other members were trying to make posts and trying to include the KW of Bitget in there post. I also reported some not to moderators but just like this one you just mentioned/reported. should we report them to moderators too?",
