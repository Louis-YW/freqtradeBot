  "content": "I'm selling my personal Stake.com Plat3 account.  It's ~40% to plat4 which means it has around 1.5mil wagered on it.Benefits of this account include:Weekly bonus: Minimum of $20 with minimal play (under 1k coin in)Monthly bonus: Minimum of $50 with minimal play, I personally have never gotten under $75 except for months where I literally gambled only weekly bonus amountsPre and post monthly: $30 each, seems to be no minimum play qualificationVIP Host: Grandfathered in since I hit plat3 before the changes.  I've never received a bonus/lossback so it's possible that there's one coming if you put the volume in.  I do receive reloads pretty much as frequently as I ask for them, the average seems to be around $5/day, although it's subject to volume.  I'm asking for $500 (.031BTC at current price).  You can easily recoup this in three months with very minimal play (just leave one or two weeklies on the account to spin with).  If you are an active player you'd recoup this in under two months, and freeroll the lifetime of the account.This account has only ever been accessed using a VPN, so you can play from pretty much anywhere.  It has \"passed\" Lv1 verification (fake Canadian address) and has never been asked for anything further, so it's a pretty safe bet that it's not going to be touched for a long time as long as you aren't betting massive amounts.Why am I selling?  Since stake.us opened I have no real use for my stake.com account and don't have the patience to spin a few spins a day and claim $20-30 bonus' once or twice a week.  If you have the patience to just collect them and cash them out and not punt them off like me, it's a win-win situation.Escrow mandatory, must be a trusted BCT escrow and you pay the fees.  For the host, I will attempt to pass them over to your telegram name, but if that doesn't work/you aren't interested, I'll make myself available to you via PMs for at least a year and will ask for reloads/lossbacks/bonus' on your behalf.",
