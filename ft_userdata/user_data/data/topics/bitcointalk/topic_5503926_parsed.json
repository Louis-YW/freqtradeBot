  "content": "Let's discuss crypto today and how it could help poorer countries enormously.We all know about crypto, how it is still very new and it is very advanced by technology, but also requires a technical infrastructure which is not available in all poor countries.It is important to have expansion of infrastructure, and when it happens, crypto is also becoming more famous in more and more poor countries.Because crypto is global and if the standard of living in New York is very high and an apartment there is very expensive, you can get little value from it despite many cryptos. The situation is quite different in poorer countries, where it is very easy to achieve a lot with little money and therefore It's a globally averaged standard where crypto helps poorer countries disproportionately. This is really good and therefore you should promote crypto.It can help to address inequality and improve living standards in poor countries, being of benefit to everyone.  Let’s discuss today about Crypto and how it can extremely help poor nations.",

If the country is poor, the first thing that should be done is for the government and its citizens to help them upgrade to a certain level where they can help themselves. If you are living in a poor country, how can you afford to buy the crypto that you think can be used to come to the person's aid? Crypto is not always the solution to everything. No doubt it can work for some when they spend a few pennies picking a few shitcoins. Luck can be on their side, and it will be a life-changing story, but it's not always like that. Crypto doesn't eradicate poverty; sometimes it can even make you poor if you lack the proper knowledge, but if you have it and also have the right resources, you can also make a fortune out of it.",

Just like in projects that generates new jobs and as total new economy. That's how it goes in general although many opportunities are in different forms. Many don't like the idea that there are full time airdrop people but to be honest, I've seen a lot of them in the past and even until now and fortunately, they're able to survive with the little that they have. Success rate there is quite small and that's why they shouldn't just stick to it but to find more and better opportunities once they're able to make money from it. So, in general, this is about having a new form of source of income from those nations and that's helping each individual to have a better personal economy and uplift their lives through earning crypto in various ways.",

In order to reduce the poverty rate of a country, the economy needs to be strengthened and diversified to meet the growing demand of the population. Most third world countries are poor not because they lack natural resources but because of bad and corrupt leaders.Cryptocurrency is not going to end world poverty. Even Bitcoin has its limits. Bitcoin is a currency and currencies do not reduce poverty. Bitcoin is also an asset, and you need money to purchase it and hodl as an investment. There are opportunities for holders to make profit from the market and improve their financial status. Trading is not the only way to profit from bitcoin, there are you can do any of the following; Become a P2P trader by just buying and selling cryptocurrencies on P2P platforms.You can become an educator, this is also one sector to leverage on, You can teach people and get paid. You can start a blog or a channel on YouTube and teach people how to navigate the blockchain and other crypto related matters. You can become a product developer, designer, coder( building smart contracts), website designer e.t.c. and charge for your services in Bitcoin. The opportunities are limitless you just have to find your niche and work hard at it.",

Adequate education is also crucial so that future generations have the skills needed in the job market. In addition, innovation and technology should be used to boost productivity. Every individual has an important role in economic improvement, and if all elements of society move in the same direction, the hope for achieving prosperity is not impossible.

      "body": "There are some ways Bitcoin can help poorer countries, but not all may work in all cases.The \"El Salvador way\" is mainly to try to attract investments from foreign Bitcoin-related companies. I believe this approach will only work for small countries, where even a few investments by large crypto firms could impact the country's GDP. And we still don't know if it worked in the case of El Salvador. I've still not really seen big exchanges or other crypto firms establishing themselves in the country. But at least their reserves are growing For other countries, of course the \"crypto economy\" can bring opportunities for local startups and entrepreneurs, like @Pokapoka124 wrote. Another example are ICOs. While most will think about scams when they hear that word, if accompanied by adequate investor protection measures, it can be a cheap and efficient tool for fundraising for local companies, with potential global sourcing for the funds. I like for example the approach they took in the European Union: if you present a whitepaper in a certain format informing your potential customers -- a simplified \"prospectus\" -- then you can fundraise money via ICOs. This makes scams and rugpulls much more difficult.In general a crypto-friendly regulation in poorer countries can benefit the local economy more than in rich \"industrialized\" countries because it allows local entrepreneurs to take part of a globalized technology sector. Trying to find financing from global capitals for a African, Asian (outside the \"tech hubs\" like South Korea or Singapore) or Latin American company is often quite difficult, the crypto sector can simplify that task. It's a pity for example that the Central African Republic scaled down their Bitcoin and crypto initiatives (even if the first approach may have been fueled by corruption).",

      "body": "The most important part about crypto that cannot be underestimated is that it holds value no matter what, just like gold and silver. The difference here is that gold and silver have very low margin profits; people who live on daily trading of those must have 100K nonetheless. Stocks, on the other hand, may give more profit, but they're far more dangerous. If you buy a company's stock and the company goes bankrupt, your stock won't be worth the ink. So, crypto is a very good investment in general. No matter how low it goes, it won't reach absolute zero; it will always have value, and both the margin profits and losses are changing much faster than gold and silver. This is why so many poor countries and even developed ones are starting to adopt crypto in their sovereign funds.Poor countries are poor for a reason; it's not just their government and the colonization history; it's the people themselves. Those people only understand the old school of creating money. In fact, they don't even understand the old school at all. Once Bitcoin reached the 20K line, anyone who understands jack about economy should've jumped in. Bitcoin is nothing but ones and zeros. What gives these ones and zeros value is the supply and demand in the most free decentralized market. Anyone who could've jumped in back then and did not take the chance doesn't know anything about economy.",

It isn't something for people that are living below poverty line or governments with low GDP to grow in.In terms of business investments, even cross border ones; It probably wouldn't be that straightforward because funding is one thing and having sustainable FDI is another. Most of the countries living under the poverty line has fairly poor governance, economic stability or business prospects. These are the key factors that investors have to consider and hence that's why companies or investors are generally more interested in areas where they are able to have a stable foothold to grow their businesses or invest in. I find that it would benefit more with Bitcoin or even better, other stable coins being a more sustainable form of transaction currency to facilitate more fluid and ease of local and cross border capital transfers.",

They will send back home money every month or every couple of weeks. In the case of El Salvador, more than 20% of its GDP is contributed by these migrant workers.[1] Bitcoin plays a vital role here. Before, a family member working from abroad sends via a bank or money transfer services. For somebody back home to get the money, he/she has to travel. In some situations, it takes hours and after 2 or 3 rides. They spend much for it and for the ridiculous fees charged by these third parties. There's also a lot of risks involved in this setup.With Bitcoin, they will get the money from the comforts of their homes. They don't have to pay for the fares going to and from the banks. They don't have to pay exorbitant charges. They can spend it right away.    It may not be helping the country itself, but it is already a lot of help to its citizens.[1] https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/02/remittances-money-world-bank/",
