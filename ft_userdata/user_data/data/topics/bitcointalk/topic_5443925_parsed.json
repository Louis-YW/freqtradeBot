  "content": "Banks all across the globe share a similar interest in making money; disregard the pathetic services they provide; if it doesn't involve money, they wouldn't offer it; everything must be profitable, even if it appears that they are assisting people.Bitcoin and banks both have the power to transfer money from one person to another, but Bitcoin provides for people's needs without considering itself, unlike banks, which do so constantly.I've been contemplating how little the general public knows about bitcoin and banking. They don't realize that bitcoin operates on a double standard and will do anything a bank could do without asking for permission, whereas banks will require you to present identification documents dating back to your birth in order to use their services.When you examine these two institutions, you will find that bitcoin is more appealing than banks, even if some people believe that banks and bitcoin must coexist for acceptance. The observations include the following: (1) Borderless transactions: Have you ever thought about sending money to someone in another country? Have you gone through the procedure of transferring money to another country? It takes at least 48 hours in every country. Other neighboring countries may speed up bank transactions, but two odd countries/continents need time before payment. Here is where bitcoin comes in; you don't have to register, you don't need any application to carry out any transaction; all you need is your private key to sign that transaction, it goes through miners, and you're done without any interruption or questioning.(2) Excess fees on transactions: Banks charge you for transactions, and the government charges you for using banks. For example, in my country, we pay VAT(known as Value added Tax) when a transaction exceeds a certain threshold, and you will be charged for that transaction. This is what the government and banks do to people, whereas Bitcoin is free. Transaction fees vary depending on how busy the network is; you may pay as little as a cent when the mempool is nearly empty.(3) Extra charges for bank notifications: I'm not sure if banks in other countries provide similar choices, but when you enroll for transaction notifications, you will be charged for SMS and email messages. Assume we have to pay some sats to use bitcoin explorer; everything else, apart from the transaction fee is free with Bitcoin, and that is the freedom of using it.(4) Banks Network Failure: I can relate to this very well because, before the election season in my country, practically all of the banks experienced failure, making it impossible to use mobile banking and transmit transactions across states. Many shifted to bitcoin and USD as an alternative since there is no middleman or point of failure with bitcoin.(5) Banks' freezing of accounts and limitations: You wouldn't understand if your account had never been frozen before. Banks can make life difficult; you might lose everything if you fail to read their terms and conditions, and there is nothing you can do except follow due procedure; this is what happens when there is a middleman on any platform. Bitcoin overcomes this limitation by granting no constraints to your wallets; you may spend as much as you like and no one can penalize your account because you possess the private key.There have been lots of issues with banks in the past, although this varies depending on where you live, but they all have similar objectives and people fail to check into these things, this is what bitcoin provides you without any constraints or limitations.",

Transaction fees vary depending on how busy the network is; you may pay as little as a cent when the mempool is nearly empty.Heavily depends on country and banks. In my country banks usually have zero fees when doing transactions with other customers of the bank, and 0.5% to other banks inside the country. This is through Visa, if using direct bank transfers the fee is 0.5-1% but capped at $15 max, so you won't pay thousands if you send millions.Bitcoin on the other hand can have pretty high fees on mainnet sometimes. And there's not much you can do about it.Quote from: HajiBagi on March 07, 2023, 07:10:38 PM(3) Extra charges for bank notifications: I'm not sure if banks in other countries provide similar choices, but when you enroll for transaction notifications, you will be charged for SMS and email messages.

Bitcoin does not cost more if you need to send it to someone living next to you or if someone is living across the world from you. I have not heard of banks charging for notifications usually they notify you for free on their banking apps but Bitcoin does not notify you unless you check the address yourself which you can do with a bank so I do not think there is a benefit to Bitcoin in this example you have posted.",

I would think that these are some of the most popular things that drive people toward using it. One thing I can agree with, is the accounts and limitations that are overlooked. If this aspect was not overlooked, everyone would use their own self-custody wallets and the effects of exchanges/services going under or running away with coins would be much less. A new campaign more effective than \"not your keys, not your coins\" needs to be created to also include the banks while putting them next to exchanges, with a push to self-custody solutions.",

Where's for Bitcoin you just have to go to through your wallet software's transaction history or blockchain explorer.Also, people complain about Bitcoin transaction fees being expensive at times, but I have never seen a bank that can charge less than a dollar in transaction fees for $500,000 transfer across the borders",

So make sure you're need to hold on your non custodial wallet and use reputable P2P platform in order to prevent from the centralized exchange ask for additional fee to proceed your transactions.",

Precisely compared to saying \"more superior\" I agree more that Bitcoin complements the current global financial system and makes innovation in the financial sector faster, for example in the past traditional banking platforms seemed reluctant to innovate their systems and switch to digital, but now there are many banking platforms that launch digitalized systems to make it easier for their customers and even now central banks are already planning to launch their CBDC and this is all thanks to the presence of Bitcoin and Altcoins which accelerate innovation in the global financial sector.",

This is because, even with Bank apps that are supposed to make transactions as quick as possible, banks networks became very slow. This has even caused problems when trying to sell cryptocurrency for fiat using some exchange p2p transactions because the seller will not receive alert early to release cryptocurrency to the buyer.",

I never heard about down time in any bank server ever but there could be some cases as happened with you. I love bitcoin and that's why I am here today but it does not mean we can just let down the banking system and its infra just like that. I mean we gotta say the engineering behind the banking system is slit, and it really maintains heavy load on it's server all the time. The real time gross settlements to automated clearing house, everything works in synchronization even after all the billion peoples are using it at the same time. However, in case of Bitcoin, that kind of scalability issue remains till today. Now I dont want anyone to tell me we have lightening network and shit, that's actually bad excuse one can get over and over again. We know very well how congested the networks were back in 2017. Its horrible management. Hope so we compete soon though its not a race of any kind.",

I would be better if the banks did not exist because they are scams and have complete control over your money and if they decided to go bankrupt you cannot argue to get your money back you will lose it. Some countries in Europe and the US protect the money up to a certain amount but you do not get it instantly and it can take a very long time for you to be compensated for a bank going bankrupt. At least that cannot happen with Bitcoin and you have the complete control of the wallet.",

Not exactly 3 cents as that transaction not only would need to be set at 1sat/b but also to have just one input and one output with no change.But transactions at 2sat/b or 5cents in case of simple tx are getting confirmed even now, I just picked some random ones :https://mempool.space/tx/c24fea79350b0773f4a238dfcf9d8368f12f1bc7cca135e1f5d9c4224778f80cFee   292 sat $0.06https://mempool.space/tx/1e69f38f18a6f8ed3d8f6e192ab05c56eb1b0a1575ac200a15d2492b0495f319Fee   222 sat$0.05Anyhow, the thing is that most wallets won't let you choose a fee that is under 1 sat/b, that's the minimum relay fee set for most, so for the average Joe is impossible to even send a 1 cent fee transaction or 0.3sat/b at current rates, not speaking of it getting confirmed unless a miner makes a special case.",
