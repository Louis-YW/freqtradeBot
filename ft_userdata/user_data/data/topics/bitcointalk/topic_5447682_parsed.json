  "content": "There is an Airdrop trending now where you earned $100 and above for participating. The Token name is Ai Trader (AIT) . It's almost a month since it started and now is spreading, most people do post it on their status lately.I did some research checking Their Telegram and Twitter account and also did check Coinmarketcap. My research prove that it an Honeypot token Scam. Honeypot scam are scam that attract people and then trap them, in this case the user trying to swap the Token will be unable to swap and also loses his/her gas fee, This gas fee will go to the scammer account because that how the scam was program to work. I know gas fee seems small but imagine collecting gas fees from over 1k persons Aside from losing your gas fee, Your wallet key can be stolen especially if your wallet is not secured Here is what I found and this proof shows its an Honeypot Scam:",
