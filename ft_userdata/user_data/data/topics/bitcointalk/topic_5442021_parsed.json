You are probably adding more risk.I wouldn't do it.Changing one word randomly will probably not validate, as there is  a checksum (not all combinations are valid).You can make a few tests here (https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).I don't think this will add any particular risk to randomness, but I think that just following basic procedures is always safer. If you wanna be safer, buy a hardware wallet and use the seed generation from the device.my 2sats.",

After changing that one word I could use a tool like Seed Savior (https://3rditeration.github.io/mnemonic-recovery/src/index.html) to get the cheksum, and thus a valid a seed.I could use the same method to generate different seeds just by changing one word and the checksum.Does it seem crazy? Is it unsafe?Thanks again!K",

Would it be safe to create different seeds just by changing one particular word?I appreciate your comments.As said, you cannot change like that one of the words. What you can do is to add passphrase to the wallet = one or more words separately from what the hardware wallet gives.But I think that the hardware wallet has to support that. My Ledger HW supports it.However:1. The common procedure is that the passphrase should be stored differently from the seed.2. Because of (1) there's a high chance you'll lose or forget about the passphrase and since the wallet from only the seed is also valid (but with different addresses) you may think at some point in the future that either your coins got stolen, either you wrote down the wrong seed.All in all there are benefits and risks too in using it, however, it can help you if you thing that the seed provided by the HW is - for some odd reason - not safe enough.",

A better solution is to use the BIP39 passphrase, which is the industry standard, but be aware of the potential negatives.",

You can't verify that, so if you don't trust the seed generation to be random, why would you trust the hardware wallet not to leak your seed?Anyway, changing one word doesn't matter much.For consideration: you're probably much more likely to lose your funds by trying to create your own encryption system, than by using a standard hardware wallet.If you don't trust a piece of hardware, don't use it. You can for instance use Electrum offline, that way you don't have to trust anyone. But it's much less convenient to do correctly than using a hardware wallet.",

      "body": "If you don't trust the seed being generated by your hardware wallet, then changing one (or two, if you include the checksum) words is utterly meaningless. At best, you are introducing 18.5 new bits of entropy (11 bits for the word you change, 3 bits for the checksum word, 4.5 bits for picking one of the 23 non-checksum words to change at random). 18.5 bits of entropy is trivial to brute force. If someone knew your seed phrase, which is the assumption we are working on since you do not trust it, they could break your system in a few seconds.If you don't trust electronic seed generation, then the best alternative will be to use a physical source of entropy. A single coin is the best option here, since dice introduce a larger bias which is harder to control. Flip a coin 256 times and write down \"1\" for heads and \"0\" for tails, or vice versa. If you want to be extra safe, then use a von Neumann debiasing approach to remove any bias from your coin (although you will now end up flipping the coin on average 1024 times instead). Once you have 256 bits of entropy, use an open source tool such as this one to turn it in to a seed phrase: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5373505Although the question remains that if you do not trust your hardware, where and how are you going to import this seed phrase in order to generate a wallet?",

My doubt is, will that change break dangerously the randomness and security of the process? Is this as safe as creating a new seed completely? Would it be safe to create different seeds just by changing one particular word?I appreciate your comments.All the responses here are good; however, nobody has answered your question.The answer is that it is ok. But a more precise answer is that it can depend on the software generating the checksum for you and how the new word is chosen. First, the 24-word phrase is an encoding of 256 random bits plus an 8-bit checksum. The last word, which contains the 8-bit checksum, also contains 3 of the 256 random bits.If you assume that the original phrase is completely random and was generated securely, then here are the issues:1. Changing a word to a different random value can lower the security by an imperceptible amount. Instead of 2048 choices, the word now only has 2047 choices. However, if the attacker has no info about which word was changed and what it was originally, then there is no reduction of security.2. Replacing a word with a non-randomly chosen word lowers the security by a small amount, no more than 11/2563. The software generating the last word must also generate 3 random bits. The randomness of 3 bits (out of 256) has an imperceptible effect on the security of the phrase, but for the pedantic crowd:a. If the tool sets the bits to 0, it can lower the security of the phrase by three bits.b. If the tool generates 3 new bits, then the security is affected by the randomness of those 3 bits.c. If the tool keeps the original 3 bits, then the security is not affected.4. Of course, if you give your recovery phrase to a tool, you must determine that the tool and the device that you run it on can be trusted to keep the phrase secure.",

If he has generated a seed phrase securely then great, use it. If he has doubts as to whether his seed phrase was generated securely, then tinkering around the edges like this is dangerous and he should instead discard it entirely and find a new method of generating a secure seed phrase from scratch, such as by flipping a coin.",
