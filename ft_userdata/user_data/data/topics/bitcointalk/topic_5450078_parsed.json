So, you can base the possible altcoins that are listed there and hover through each of them. It's easier to identify the coins that you can mine with that old GPU if you say the actual model of that GPU.",

As the other guy in the thread has already mentioned, you can always go to sites like whattomine and check which coin out there is giving the best return at the moment, when you mine it with your old graphic card. That being said, I don't think, that there is a coin out there which is more profitable to mine with a old gpu than with a new one, because that would just not make any sense at all.Older GPU's simply have a lower hashrate than new ones and this means they are providing less hashpower to the network and therefore also get less rewards per time. You can look for very old projects that are almost not mined anymore, but i would guess that would also not really be profitable, because you won't be able to sell those coins then.",

I sort by 24 hours profit, if you're using sort by profitability, the result is bias because it will not give a real result.Keep in mind, it will depends on your electricity price in the country where you living too.",

      "body": "There have some cons and pros to this one.Using an older GPU will give you a lower hashrate, If you looking a coin example is being listed on \"whattomine\" most of them listed a coin who are already listed on exchange or at least big enough. With old GPU who are giving you low hashrate, you are cannot mine a big coin because is not gonna profitable. If you want to do gambling, you can tried new coin without exchange.With some hope, listed on a small exchange but there has some chance have a small volume and you can sell it. My friend doing this in around 2018/2019, because he cannot fight against other company/user who have highest hashrate if mining a big coin.",
