  "content": "The highest APY I ever saw was from a project called Pylon. They made a lot of promises but in the long run, the returns were unsustainable and just used to draw new investors in. Now I'm considering MAXX Finance, because it has better fundamentals as it is a tokenized CD with profits coming from validator nodes and withdrawal fees. It's supposed to have an APY of up to 80%, plus 10% if you get their free booster NFT. So my question to you is, what is the highest APY you have ever seen and what is the highest APY you are getting right now in DeFi?",

You must aware that if this time big apy highly become a scam projectWow, that's a lot of %. I know it attracts people like a mouse to cheese but you have to ask yourself before jumping in, where does the yield come from. On most yield farms the profit comes via depositing your LP token to get a governance token. Most of the time these governance token have no total suppy cap on them, so your high staking APY returns are inflated away. I think the 80% APY return is reasonable as long as it is clearly explained where exactly the returns are coming from. For example, if I invested in a gold mine that I knew had gold, I would reasonably expect that kind of return but I would not expect it lending BTC on AAVE. The way that MAXX gets its APY is from validator node profit sharing, inflation, early withdrawal fees, and token transaction fees when buying and selling the token. It's a sustainable system. Any project with high APY should be looked at with suspicion though, definitely.",

Exactly, that was what I was trying to say. Yield needs to be sustainable. That's why staking platforms like HEX, while it did make many people rich, have adjustable yield and may not be sustainable long term. MAXX has fixed yield and generates revenue from validator nodes, token transaction fees, and ecosystem DApp fees. So it's a major advancement over other staking platforms. Additionally, I should state that APY that comes from staking in POS blockchains comes from validator rewards, so it is part of securing the network and sustainable as long as TVL on the chain increases at a faster rate than the rate of inflation.",

Just for curiosity I searched for it right now, as I though the highest APY was 1000%, but for my surprise I've found an above 100,000% fixed APY project!It's called Titano and I have no idea if it's still operational or not. Anyway, you shouldn't invest on it for obvious reasons, right? Even if you receive the APY as promised, you can expect the token is going to devalue on the same proportion. That is, if a currency pays 80% annually, it will devalue 80% annually or more...Just for informational purposes, this is the official website:https://titano.finance/",

This is not enough, there were many projects that offered hundreds of thousands of percent, and of course these are all scams.In general, in staking, if the APY is more than 10%, it is already considered an increased risk group. In my opinion, the most adequate and honest APYs that projects can offer are those that offer a rate in the range of 3-7%. Such pools are good as long-term partnerships and have strong fundamentals. All projects that offer tens of percent APY sooner or later come to a lower APY, they introduce floating interest and have a very large Impermanent Loss. All projects that offer hundreds and thousands of percent APY are more like ponzi schemes and work as long as there is a steady inflow of new cash from the outside.",
