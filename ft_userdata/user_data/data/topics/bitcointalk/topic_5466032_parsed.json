  "content": "BASERIUM as a cryptocurrency project started its journey using the same strategy adopted by catly. All that is required is to register with an email address and password you're eligible to their free token. They request their participants to submit their binance account BSC wallet to heighten their hopes of legitimacy of the fake project and hopes of it getting listed on Binance exchange. All these are the perfect plans which they saw has been played out by catly which also reportedly ended up being fraud.After the rumour of catly being scam, BASERIUM changed it's plan and now adopting a listing on UNISWAP which isÂ  launched one hour ago. Do not interact with the token address to avoid exposing your wallet to risk or to avoid being rug pulled on.A scan of its contract address on dedotfi shows that interacting with the contract is of high risk and any wallet can be blacklisted from trading the toking it is holding.",
