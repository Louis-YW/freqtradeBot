So, I teamed up with another silver artist and made 10 more \"Silver Keys\" in a different style.Only 5 available on BT. PRICE is $260 Buyer Funded or 0.0089 BTCPaypal Venmo Cashapp or BitcoinWill ship from Puerto Rico. If you are within the USA they will ship directly to you. If you are over seas, they will ship to MJ and you pay him to ship it to you.  Public Key will be hand stamped into the back side of the bar. Private keys will be under a CT hologram on the front by the \"Teeth\" of the key.These are some of my favorite style bar wallets and I have held many",

I was the one who derailed that other thread IIRC, so sorry about that again, but these are cool af. What is the load amount btw? The pictures don't do them justice at all.   no problem.I left them open for people to determine what they want the load amount to be. They're Buyer Funded.  I can customize them and hand stamp the load amount into the bar if you'd like. Hand stamping gives them that old Caribbean Treasures style look with hallmarks. Some people want them as low as 100,000 Sats or up to 2,500,000 Sats for this type of piece. They remind me of gold bars off of the Atosha shipwreck....but in silver... silver stix, silver bone. whatever you want to call them. They all have great patina from using liver of sulphur.I will message you a deal.",
