However, you would not be able to trade on our platform. To become an advanced user and start trading, please click on “Continue” for the next level of verification.I don't see myself using them currently since I could find a better offer out there for my use case. Perhaps if we had more freedom with their no-kyc/level 1 tier, I would.",

There are a good number of platforms that support the Lightning Network, is this the only feature you're looking for? They don't have an excellent rating on trustpilot but looking at the one-star reviews:There is no scam reported which is good.Many users reported technical problems.The platform lists a lot of coins that do not have any future pump and dump coinshttps://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.bitmart.com?stars=1It is not a scam platform, there are better alternatives and withdrawal limits are not encouraging, you can consider it as an alternative.",

      "body": "I used them in the past but shortly leave since their liquidity is low for coins that I want to trade with. Granted it is not the top 10 or 20 coins, but the experience is still not great. I also recall seeing some reports about deposit or withdrawal problems in the past. Most of them are caused by technical issues iirc. Personally, I'd put them on my last resort exchange if I can't find any alternatives for my needs. The lightning network is also supported by more exchanges now, so I don't see it as a unique feature that would attract me to comeback.",

If you are looking for an exchange that supports Lightning Network, then I think you can already use that feature on Binance if you already have an account. At the end of July, Binance also announced the successful integration of the lightning network into their exchange. https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-completes-integration-of-bitcoin-btc-on-lightning-network-opens-deposits-and-withdrawals-eefbfae2c0ae472d9e1e36f1a30bf340",

Asked support, they were clueless as well, Jesus!! On dependability, it should be used for coins that are not tradeable anywhere else and funds should be withdrawn right away. I'm not exactly sure if you can even trade there without kyc as one of trustpilot comment says, non-kyc users can only buy/sell crypto using fiat on-ramps and not actually trade.",

This information is reliable, I myself have recently made several withdrawals from this exchange and they did not request KYC.Thanks for correcting me, since you say you have withdrawn several times recently from BitMart without KYC, you are definitely correct.Since I'm banned because of the country, I can't try the withdrawal, but I took my information from some people in a telegram group, but it seems that their information is inaccurate.",
