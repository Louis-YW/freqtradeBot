The forum signature space is not limited to just gambling, mixers or exchanges alone but the reason why you see those type of services here is because of what the forum is related to and the type of users present here. It will not be wise for a service that has nothing to do with crypto or that has nothing to do with the things that bitcointalkers are interested in to come to the forum and start advertising their service by running a signature campaign, they’ll only just be wasting whatever money they’ll be paying.The main aim of running an ads is to target people that will be interested in your service if you’re aware that the people present in a community will never patronize you no matter how you approach them because they have no need for your service then you’ll have to look for those in need of it, and that’s why you majorly see crypto related service here.

I believe altcointalk still run signature campaigns and bounties but it’s not as active as Bitcointalk, and most of the users there have migrated to bitcoin while the ones left are majorly those that got banned from Bitcointalk and now engaged in bounties over there.",

Still, most of the signature campaigns are run by gambling sites because they know that this community is the best place for promotion of their platforms and launching of a signature campaign is the best way to get exposure from all the users of the forum.

From here we find that advertising campaigns are looking for those people, and almost all of us used or is using cryptocurrencies, so it is a suitable place for anyone who wants to manage a crypto advertising campaign, although the advertising here are not limited to signature campaigns.",

Just because gambling campaign are popular on the forum doesn't restrict signature campaign to only gambling platforms. The reason they find the forum more preferably is because there are alot of bitcoiners on the forum that are interested in gambling so they target their advertisment here because it'll be more impactful. As others has responded, if you visit the service board you'll see different campaign so I hope that answer your question. Just for a side note, signature isn't moderated by the forum therefore all project are welcomed on the forum except those NSFW. Mixers are another common project on the forum because they can't be advertise on most advertisement platforms as they're illegal in many country but the forum is like a safe heaven for them to advertise on.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on September 18, 2023, 07:19:28 PM° Is there another kind of forum for online businesses that accepts Bitcoin as payment, which is similar in concept like this forum? There has been some that tired to copy Bitcointalk but failed due to them focusing on paying users to draw their attention to their forum and when that payment stops or reduced, this platforms will crumble. Also when they don't get the inflow of advertisers as they thought they'll get when they launched their platform, it fails. One reason Bitcointalk has survive this long isn't because they're paying their users but because of the value of the platforms. People join the forum to seek for knowledge and there are constant improvement on the forum to keep the quality and activities on a constructive standard. When the forum notice the increase in spamming and quality was reducing, the merit system was introduced but those other platforms only care about activities and not quality that's why they're failing.",

To me, that's obvious. Bitcointalk.org is the first forum created specifically to promote the Bitcoin project and is a direct successor to the original forum created by the creator himself, Satoshi. It holds tremendous historical value and remains the go-to source for all information related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.There are days' worth of reading material on the forum, and there's nothing on the entire Internet that can quite compare to the wealth of information you can find here.
