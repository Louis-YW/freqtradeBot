However, USDC and BUSD seems the most trusted .What do you think? Thank you.",

This topic for example https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5407643.0 has four pages of discussions already. It pays to read similar threads and learn from them.

The fact that if it's supported by newyork regulators. I just remind you that of regulators will not be randomly choosing the token or coin that will be worth to be supported. You must also search some articles and official announcements by newyork regulators about that.",

If you are a P2P trader on Binance, then you also have to admit that the volume of trades is mainly made up of USDT, and not the remaining 4 stable coins. It's risky but we still can't give it up.",

The fact that some of it is value is stored in something else then usd is just weird fud as banks themselves are way worse in this comparison (if everyone for some reason tried to withdraw their money at the same time, they couldn't)Fud will come to other stablecoins too.

There really weren't any big issues as well that troubled me when I was using them (If there were issues with it, I wasn't really updated with it most of the time). If you consider how stablecoins are though, I don't think you should use trust on them with how they can basically pull out and ruin whatever amount you have to oblivion.

USDT had a history of admitting they were not fully backed by assets. and somewhat, the 3rd party auditor of their platform is not very clear with things. but at the end of the day, it is your money, much better if you will not store your funds in stablecoin for long-term purposes. as they are mostly centralised, your funds can be frozen anytime. this is why some are going into decentralised stablecoin like DAI.",
