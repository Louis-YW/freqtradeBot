That applies to just about everything in life so, your point is?...You are saying right that using Bitcoin is easy but understanding how it works is harder and needs special knowledge. That is good point. Many people can use Bitcoin without knowing all complicated details just like how people can drive cars without knowing how to fix them. Most people who use technology like smartphones computers or microwaves do not need to know how they work to use them. It is important to separate using Bitcoin in practical way from understanding complicated technology behind it.",

Just like in dunning kruger effect, the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know about that. Even myself, I don't completely understand mining and technical thing.",

The Bitcoin white paper is probably one of the easiest to read and understand in academia.The concepts explained there can be grasped by the general population.If you want to read the original problem that Bitcoin solved, read The Byzantine Generals Problem, a paper from 1982 stating the problem:Quote from: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/357172.357176Reliable computer systems must handle malfunctioning components that give conflicting informationto different parts of the system. This situation can be expressed abstractly in terms of a group ofgenerals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicatingonlyby messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of themmay be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure thatthe loyal generals will reach agreement. It is shown that, using only oral messages, this problem issolvable if and only if more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal; so a single traitor can confoundtwo loyal generals. With unforgeable written messages, the problem is solvable for any number ofgenerals and possible traitors. Applications of the solutions to reliable computer systems are thendiscussed.The \"unforgeable written messages\" bit is why you have to sign a transaction with your private key when broadcasting it to spend your coins.",

If it is information you wish to access, it is not difficult because everything is available in the internet and for free. If you just continue to read around this forum alone, you will have a better understanding of bitcoin. I am not saying that understanding bitcoin is as easy as a walk at the park but if you are curious enough and you have enough determination to really understand bitcoin then you can do it. Anyone can do it. The basic concept of bitcoin is just alternative currency that is digital. Obviously there is more to that but like I said, a lot of resources are already on the internet and all you need to do is find them and read them diligently.",

What are the things that you have difficulty in understand though? I'm just curious because if you have that thought then maybe the majority of us are not here. So just take it slow and maybe read some books about Bitcoin. Or better yet, just go around in this community, for sure there are tons of information here as most of us started just like you with no idea at all but then we gravitate towards Bitcoin and learn a lot of things along the way.So don't be just so negative in the beginning and says that it's for professional developers. Maybe you are referring to the developers of Bitcoin or those who are maintaining it right now. Or maybe professional traders who does it for a living.",

But when you're confronted with a truly interested and inquisitive newbie who makes follow-up questions on your explanations, you might find yourself realizing you haven't really understood it at all. As far as access is concerned, however, it's not very difficult. It's actually very easy. I'm referring both to resources that make you understand Bitcoin and Bitcoin, as in the coin, itself.",
