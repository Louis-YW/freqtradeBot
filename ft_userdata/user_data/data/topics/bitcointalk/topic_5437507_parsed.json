  "content": "Going to be a huge bowl game here, I heard Rihanna is doing the half time show (ooooooo aahhhhhhhhhh) thats always fun to watch. Also, the Kelce brothers are competing against eachother! Can you imagine being at the peak of your career headed to the superbowl and be playing against your Blood brother on the other team? What a wild game it shall be! You HAVE to bet something on this one!!!!!Saw this article from the NY Times today: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/sports/football/super-bowl-odds-line.htmlA short excerpt from that article that popped to me: \"To bet on the money line — a straightforward wager on who will win the game — Philadelphia backers must bet $130 to win $100, while Kansas City supporters bet $100 to win $110. This translates into Philadelphia being given a 54 percent chance of winning the game against Kansas City’s 46 percent chance.Depending on where you look, the over-under on the game is around 49.5, so bookmakers are looking for more scoring than in the A.F.C. (43 points) or N.F.C. (38 points) championship games, or indeed more than in any of the divisional round games (which produced a combined 31, 37, 45 and 47 points).If you are impatient, you can bet over-under for the first half (24) or even the first quarter (10).What’s next for the betting line? While there might be a little more movement, the major action is probably over. “I doubt the line will flip again, but it could creep down,” DuBreuil said, perhaps settling at something closer to Philadelphia by 1 or 1.5 points. The biggest moves of any line, he said, happen early.Unless there is disastrous news, that is. If, say, it were announced that Mahomes would miss the game, a 7-point swing would not be a surprise, DuBreuil said. In that case, the Eagles might enter the game as much as a 10-point favorite.\"",

      "body": "With the Eagles looking unstoppable they're probably the best bet to go for IMO but I think the lines won't shift that much because the Chiefs at plus odds is too good when Mahomes didn't look like he had an injury during the Bengals match. For now, it's best to wait for different bookies to launch their unique promotions because I remember last SuperBowl there was a bookie that offered boosted odds on match-winner markets.",

The Eagles could very well possibly win the bowl game! I recently came across a new connection in an English pub who has a gambling hussle. Anyways they gave me $50 to bet for free, so I might as well throw $100 at it and try and get a nice bag for the bowl game, let’s see what happens!! And that’s great to hear about the influx of people on Phoenix getting ready for the game this weekend! That sounds exciting.",
