The only way this current trend will stop is when Bitcoin ETF is denied or when one of the institutional investors such as microstrategy will finally take profit since they are the only entity that has the ability to dump the market using their current holdings but I doubt this will happened soon because they are still accumulating even on the current price which means they are thinking long term.",

So not right for us to categorize Bitcoin in the class of other cryptocurrencies since Bitcoin is the primary coin and also the king of the industry,  all other altcoins are just in for short-term speculation and hypes,  many times we have to look at some obvious fact about Bitcoin before we associate it to other crypto.",

We do know that Bitcoin is the main coin into this market and whenever it do makes some pump then you would notice that most coins in the market would turn out to be green, although the percentage gains wont really be that much high but on the time that you do see that Bitcoins price is consolidation then you would really be able to notice that altcoins prices do really pump out. Why? because we do really have that so called \"Altcoin season\". You would really be able to experience for yourself if you haventable to do so.This market does have those kind of cycles on which not all the time it would really be focusing on Bitcoin alone but there comes a time that there would really bethose altcoin ones. For now that Bitcoin halving is going near then this kind of market movement isnt really that shocking honestly.",

Gox to the current one. And then the first purchase of Pizza, crypto gambling and others.As for the price, yeah, why not? $50k is just around the corner this year. The market is very positive up to this point because of so many good news like approval of Bitcoin Spot ETF and then the block halving next year.",

We are already in the bullish trend, we should be more confident about the price of Bitcoin, and look forward for a more peak price.",

Bitcoin's market capitalization growth is even faster compared to other stocks that first appeared. It only took 12 years for Bitcoin to reach the $1 Trillion Market cap and prove that Bitcoin's growth is faster compared to Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft stocks.Even today in Real-time, Bitcoin Market cap $856.25 B which overtakes 3 companies at once Meta (Facebook), Berkshire Hathaway and Tesla. in the last 7 days, Bitcoin's Market cap is up 15.81% and is in 9th place with the largest market cap.https://8marketcap.com/",

Everyone starts to understand the cycle now that we're in and that's why everything is possible, could even be higher than $51k but could just be stuck to $44k until eoy.",

Some had grown over x10 in this bull run, so I do not know where you see it only in Bitcoin which has not grown x2 in the recent bull run. I have my sizable amount of money in Bitcoin and the same goes for the altcoins, so it's so easy to know what is happening within my wallets without any sentiments.That said, Bitcoin is a very good coin and will continue to grow for the next 1+ years. This is already known before now which is why people are pumping and pumping it especially this time that the FOMO is all over the place. I didn't know it could reach $40,000 this year, but it hit it effortlessly, so reaching $50,000 cannot be an issue anymore. Bitcoin has moved so well in recent days and has peaked at $44,500+ this year.For this, I do not think that anything can stop it from buying further as people have now continued to see it as a good investment opportunity so they will continue to pump it till next year.",

I think the potential for it to continue to increase again is still there and will continue to happen this month, while for altcoins I think at the moment there are not more people who want to think about it and want to buy more of them.

So what is happening now is quite normal when we do not see altcoins moving simultaneously to increase simultaneously with Bitcoin in the market. Because now there are many people who prioritize Bitcoin over altcoins to get better profits at the end of the year and also the new year.",

That is why if we want to invest in crypto for the long term, we should choose Bitcoin over altcoins but if we just aim for the short-term and enjoy the hyped, altcoins seem fit for such criteria. However, with the current situation and if the momentum keeps going, Bitcoin price could reach $50k this year.
