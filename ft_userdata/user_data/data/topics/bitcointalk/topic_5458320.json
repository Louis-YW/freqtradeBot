They do this for fetish purposes.come to think of it. Is it safe for someone to sell or buy used underwears (pant,boxers...)I believe, nobody in his or her right senses will buy such item's but, i've seen people posting foto's of used panties on craigslist, ebay..And the more dirtier and no. of day such underwears has been used, the more chances for the seller to attract buyers who are willing to pay for it.■□《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《《",
