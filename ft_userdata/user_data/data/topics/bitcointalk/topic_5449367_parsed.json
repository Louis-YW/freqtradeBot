      "body": "The answer to that depends on many factors like Phil mentioned. If you're looking for rock bottom prices, your best bet is to buy directly from a Chinese wholesaler. Some of them have high MOQs, so they may or may not work for you. At AltairTech we are a US based mining retailer. We also operate our own mining farm and provide competent technical support if needed. Check us out https://altairtech.io/product-category/miners/",

      "body": "Quote from: elvisrene10 on April 19, 2023, 12:47:41 AMHi guys if anyone can help me with this issue many thanks Whatever place you choose to buy your miner from, it is imperative that you make sure that you are buying from a reputable miner seller and not some random ebay or alibaba merchant and do not use any strange software that they give you. Once you find a seller, it would be best if you were to double check by posting the source link on this thread so that the Bitcointalk community can tell you whether or not the seller is reputable.The problem here is that you could buy a miner from a sketchy individual who could try to find a way to sneakily scam you out of your coins or sneak spyware through, along with your bought miner.The scams can be quite diverse and complex. Here is an example: https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cryptoscam-fake-antminer/39398/Be aware of fake websites!The above recommendations from the Bitcointalk members philipma1957 and MikeyWith are trustworthy.",
