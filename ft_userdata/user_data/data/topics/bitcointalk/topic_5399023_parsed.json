  "content": "Decentralized Finance has evolved and Defi users need to know this and move in the direction that the defi ecosystem is moving towards. Defi 1.0 have been broadly accompanied by problems like:1. High slippage tolerance2. High impermanent loss3. High gas fees4. High cost of joining liquidity and staking pools The above-mentioned problems have resulted to heavy loss in capital for DeFi users, and even made a lot of defi users switch chain networks in search for cheaper gas fees and any possible capital efficient features. For example, Pancake Swap of Binance smart chain could offer gas fees that are relatively low compared to Uniswap of Ethereum network, the protocol could not provide an entirely capital efficient protocols because the protocol still support high slippage tolerance, high impermanent loss, and high cost of joining pools which usually requires providing two coins or tokens to be part of pools.Pioneers if Defi 2.0 AMM DEX like Blueshift dot fi have deployed protocols that eliminates all the problems listed above, now staking and liquidity pools requires index token participation, high impermanent loss and high slippage tolerance is eliminated. So you have any other projects providing DeFi 2.0 protocols? Let's discuss them in the comment section.Piece!",
