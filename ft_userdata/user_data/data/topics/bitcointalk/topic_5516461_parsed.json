Know which exchange that suits you, CEX if you don't care about privacy and want to make more profit or No KYC P2P/DEX if you care with privacy and don't mind to spend extra, check kynot.me3. Know basic digital security and how to use Bitcoin wallet [GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum [Guide]4. The last one is learn how you save your seed phrase.But, if you're asking how to get rich, my answer is none. There's no secret or ways to get rich.There's a person living with frugal lifestyle, he always try to learn new skill, invest as much as possible, but he lack of relations which make him can't find high salary jobs because not all jobs are posted in jobs portal, so no one will recommend him.There's a person with moderate lifestyle, he invest quite much and spend some of his money to get more relations. Now he work in high salary jobs because of a friend recommend him, he choose to resign and open a business. Unfortunately his business failed and he need to start from zero.There's a person with low education and only work in blue collar jobs, he didn't invest a lot, but he choose to buy lottery ticket. Surprisingly he won and he got $1 Million, then he resign and start a business, now he's successful.It's all about luck.",

There's more to it, so I was toldTry to understand how it works, risks involved,how to save you seed phrase, the list is endless I know this may sound unnecessarily stressful, but I believe this forum will come in handy in that aspect I have been going through the forum during my free time and actually found a lot of interesting topics that have helped For instance, I saw a topic talking about how a person was scammed. I had no idea someone could be scammed that way ( from an online account)You could also try reading some books on it Most importantly, don't use all of your income.

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this topic.If you are now working and earning money every month, you can start your crypto investment journey with the DCA strategy [1]. There are 2 types of assets in crypto, the first is bitcoin & the second is altcoins (coins or tokens other than bitcoin). Altcoins can make you earn x2 - x50 in a short time, but it requires in-depth analysis and luck to get it, if you feel you are not worthy enough for it, you can try your investment in bitcoin which has been proven to be safer. Keep working & accumulate your bitcoins, one day you will definitely get the benefits of all your hard work so far.[1] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp",

Right now, Bitcoin is around $70k, though, which is a mere 5.6% away from the ATH. So perhaps now isn't the best time to start, but then again, it might be a start of the bull run, in which case the price can get much higher in the future.",

You also have an advantage since you have a good job that can make you save and buy Bitcoin. You should have an emergency fund depending on your expenses for like three to six months. You should also diversify your income to enable you to have a more financial backup. Use a monthly DCA strategy to accumulate your coins and be patient to wait for your investment to grow. Bitcoin has a four-year investment cycle but you can decide to keep it for more years.But you should know that using the terms Bitcoin and cryptocurrency interchangeably is wrong. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and there are others called altcoins. I will advice you as a newbie to focus only on Bitcoin until you have understood the complex and highly risky field of altcoins.",

But I will advise to stick to only investing in Bitcoin alone, because there are over 10,000 cryptocurrencies out there, which are highly volatile, and you could end up losing all your money in a blink of an eye. However, Bitcoin is not an asset you venture into only after you have earned enough money, but it is literally an asset you can invest in even with the smallest amount ever possible to acquire a unit of Satoshi, (i.e Bitcoin in it's smallest fraction). Because inasmuch as it's good to invest in Bitcoin, it's also good to be consistent, and likewise know the meaning of most of the terms been used in a Bitcoin/Crypto environment, such as KYC, DEX, CEX and Blockchain. Hence, I will be sharing a link to the most common Bitcoin terms, so you could get familiar withBasic Crypto Terminologies Everyone Should Know - Let Me Know Your Score",

That's the first thing that you need to set to your mind because too many newbies are being misled by their own thoughts that when invested in Bitcoin, expect tremendous gain so fast. As you are still studying right now, all you have to do is focus on your studies and if you want to read some things about Bitcoin, maybe a few hours or times of browsing here is quite fine. As long as it doesn't harm your studies, you're good. Once decide to put some money to invest monthly or anytime you wish, just do it and you don't need someone to do it for you but only to guide you like which wallets you're going to use and what exchange is supported in your country. Because that's where the risk comes, when you are asking for help and that person gives you specifics of which wallet to download but it's not from an official website, be observant and always check the resources where you are downloading from for your wallet.

Your approach to learning now and taking it slow with realistic expectations is solid, trust me, that's a huge part of successful investing.Since you’re already familiar with Bitcoin, you could consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into it, meaning you’d invest a set amount each month, regardless of price. This strategy can help you avoid trying to time the market and keeps you invested without stressing over every price move. Over time, BTC has shown resilience, but as you probably know, it’s important to only invest what you can afford to hold long-term, especially with the crypto market’s ups and downs.Wishing you the best on this journey!

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this topic.Hi.Since everyone else is talking about how you can make investments or learn about it, I would like to provide you with some warnings and things that you need to know and understand as you delve into this world of cryptocurrencies and online financial markets. There is no doubt that there are a lot of lucrative earning opportunities available online, cryptocurrencies being one of the most trending ones at the moment, but you need to understand that nothing comes easy in this world. So there are certain things you need to understand to stay safe in this world.The very first thing is to understand how you can safeguard your funds when you start buying Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies. You have already received suggestions about wallets, you can use a non-custodial wallet at first such as Electrum, and later when you see your funds are getting higher, you should switch to a hardware wallet which is generally safer.The second and most important thing is to never trust anyone you meet online. The online universe is full of scammers and scumbags who are always looking for prey and you wouldn't want to be their target. Don't talk to anyone, especially about what you are doing and that you have money, and, never open links or download any apps or games on the device where you are keeping your cryptocurrencies. People use malware and viruses to get access to your funds.",

I'd honestly recommend it more than trading really especially since I don't think you'd have enough time (or money) to learn trading itself, so yeah, just DCA. Honestly a lot better than when I was 19. First things first, I'd remove any sort of unrealistic expectations with trading. Even people who've traded for years may not necessarily have to not work after a few years. Just do and think what you can do for now. Next is just the basics. Wallets, streamlined processes to buy, thinking about fees and stuff like that. Personally I'd say it's a good time ish to start since the market is expected to go 100k by next year. Maybe decide then and there whether you're going to sell out after that and then just start the DCA again when the price dumps down, or just continue. Former you can take some immediate profit, latter makes you stable but you probably wouldn't profit for the next couple of years.",
