I'm not sure if you have great faith in them, but my portfolio with crypto is almost always BTC, even when altcoins go up, it never gets past the 50% I own. But honestly, looking at what you're suggesting here, I think it's more specific in terms of what they're going to produce in the future, rather than giving a price gues",

Of course, this isn't financial advice, lol.Solana has some issues regarding their priorities and lending protocols.

I've checked the ATH for Mina protocol but it seems that it's not $9 but $6. Still, it has gone low today and just around $0.7. I've got also my own alts to bet for the next bull run and cycle and hopefully they perform very well. But if not, that's okay and the money that I've allocated there as good as gone and that's part of investing.Quote from: Z390 on June 25, 2022, 08:54:08 AMWhat do you think?

There is a lot of L2 project on Ethereum but Optimism has the closest feature that really can help to boost the Ethereum slow network.
