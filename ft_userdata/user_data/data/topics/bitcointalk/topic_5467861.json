It is actually a huge offence that discourages ingenuity and originality. I don't know why people make that mistake of not giving credit to source of any content they share idea, it does not really reduce us but rather mean we appreciate the works of others. When I want to make a statement that is not my original idea, I do use statements such: \"as it has been stated by\". In this case, they will know it's not your idea but you are merely referencing... just for emphasis. I just hope others can learn to avoid getting banned.",

Another reason is that they do not know they can be known until they are known and banned. Some newbies even reword the plagiarized words in a way to mask them from not letting people know, but later they are banned because they did not know how easy a plagiarism checker can easily reveal their plagiarized contents.",

Ohh' Newbies should notice such warnings, but they post without thinking about all these things. Although they are called warnings, are taken under maximum punishment, but they may take them lightly otherwise they would have acted cautiously in the forum. u are right that forum rules should be read at least once a week or once a month, as the rules change from time too time, and it is very important too keep them updated. But a new user doesn't repeat the same thing over and over again. And for such mistakes they have been penalized before, and their accounts have been banned, but they are not careful about this. It is important for a new person too follow the rules before posting on a forum, but breaking the rules and doing the wrong thing will not last long, getting their account banned within days. However, those newbies should be careful reading such messages so that they avoid such mistakes in the future.",

You can use intellectual property but you must cite or quote them properly to avoid being called out.

Could the person that reported him not have been merciful enough to PM him and notify him of his errors instead of using him to shine and collect merit?.

It  means we're not our brothers keeper as that person should've corrected him and not just set him up like that. If he fails to take correction, then you report to the moderators for action. Just like those days in primary school when you report to your teacher if your colleague fails to sit properly in class after correcting him/her.Lastly, a word for anybody who intends to copy contents online.
