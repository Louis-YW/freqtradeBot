  "content": "TerraUSD is a stablecoin that previously had a value of \"1 USTC = $1\". At the moment it worths $0.03Crypto market is very unpredictable and dangerous, every company is chasing power and influence on the market but the problem is that if any of them make mistake, their product and the assets of millions of people fail.At the moment I think that BUSD and USDT are the safest stablecoin pairs for regular cryptocurrency trading but I'm afraid that Binance has so huge influence on the market that if it makes mistake, BUSD may get fucked.USDT seems to be the safest, am I right? What are the possibilities that USDT may end up like TerraUSD? Which stablecoin do you suggest for crypto/usd trading?",

For algorithmic stable coin like UST, never go for that type of stable coins, they are often known to lose their peg. On exchanges, there are few options to go for, I would have preferred Dai, but on most exchanges that I know, the two most common stable coins are USDT and USDC which are also the two stable coins with the highest marketcap. Traders do not have options than to go for the coins to trade, but fiat would be better. BUSD is a common stable coin used for trading pair on Binance.Coins like USDT and USDC are fiat backed, unlike algorithmic stable coin, they have not lost their peg with the fiat they are backed with, unlike algorithmic stable coins, they are almost stable with US dollar price.The stable coins can be freezes by the company that created them, but it is exchanges that we are talking about, traders do not consider that because using exchanges also means that you do not have complete control over your own coins.",

That done, now to the question. The two stablecoins you mentioned are the only ones I've been using. I started with Tether when the stablecoin option became a thing and then moved to BUSD. It's my favourite now because I do trade often on Dex using the Trust Wallet Dapp. For me, BUSD is ok. I tend to tie it to BNB. Seeing how BNB has come to stay, I believe BUSD too won't go rogue since both are from the same platform.",

Talking about how the value is preserved for so many years now, however, there could be a case of slight dip which usually do not go below -5%. It has been suggested that fiat tie with stable is the safest. We also need to be careful with new projects in stable coin straight away, this has been the highest/oldest form of fraud in cryptocurrency with printing of virtual currency without government's involvement.",

A long time ago, my local exchange have using my fiat currency (So it's really guaranteed).But, now they created into a token to make it easy. USDT with fiat backup still recommended until now.",
