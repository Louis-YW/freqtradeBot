Though tried to avoid reply but can't avoid giving you a lesson since you are a newbie. Keep in mind, always try to keep your post too short, so everyone will be interested to post. All of us know about Google ads, but don't necessarily describe them anymore. Because those aren't familiar with Google ads they won't be interested in your product. So please edit your post and make a decent topic what are you offering exactly? Don't try to cheat, the account would be flagged.",
