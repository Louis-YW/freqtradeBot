  "content": "For over a months now my cousin has been in the hospital in coma. We have spend almost all we had for his treat, he fell down in a field where they're playing football and he was rush to hospital half dead, doctor said he have kidney failure. So I often go there to check on him and spent sometimes.Last week Friday I went their as usual to the ward where is responding to treatment, on my arrival I saw my best friend rushed to the same hospital same ward as a result of gastric motor accident on his way traveling for a journey. When I saw his situations I couldn't move my legs, doctors are shaking their heads refusing to treat him, I didn't know when tears came out from my eyes. Several test was carried out from his body which doctors confirmed he has sustain a lot of internal injuries that he may not survive it. But we put in faith that they start treatment, the bill charged was so high to start treatment because they needed to invites my medical expertise outside the hospital.So friends, on my own account I need to do something to support, do anything I can to support but I was very well on me, like am dammed broke because of my cousin experience inclusive, but they I had no choice than to sold my btc as soon as possible, though is not much but I prefer his life to be save than my investment, so I gave everything and support the parents of my friend. Am just dam empty but I pray for their quick recovery.As for my investment I can always replace it in time coming, life can not be replace when is loss. Am grateful I have project like Bitcoin that has supported me on several occasions. Please pray for them.",

      "body": "Sorry to hear that mate, actually I had the same case with you, 2 years ago, my sister suddenly fell and we thought it was a heart attack and we brought her to the hospital, it was still in the heart of the pandemic, so you can't just go visit the hospital that time. And then after a whole week, we finally get her out of the hospital. But we have to foot the bill obviously, so I have to sell some of my BTC stash to help her, and I didn't second thoughts of selling that time and the timing was perfect as we are in the bull run, regardless though, I will sell no matter what. Unfortunately, as a result of her being hospitalized, lots of findings pops up, including cancer that is in the advantage stage. And last year in November she passed away (sold some again). For sure, positive karma will go on your way and I will pray for your cousins speedy recovery.",

It is very rare to have a friend in need, even some blood relatives sometimes look the other way. @OP I hope for both of them to be well and strong on their feet to go about doing what they love doing. Health they say is wealth, only of you are healthy should you be able to pursue life vanity.  I wish them speedy recovery.",
