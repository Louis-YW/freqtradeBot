  "content": "Hello everyone, I am an upcoming backend developer with the zeal of solving the world's biggest problems. Many weeks ago someone sent me a link about this place that I could easily learn how to buy Bitcoin and keep it safe. I was very happy but I noticed that I have no one to talk to because it looks more like big community than what I was expecting to see. I thought I could easily come here anytime and find someone to teach me how to go about it. I was told I could only learn by reading good posts of other members. I am not in a haste since my learning is going to be consistent as I keep coming here. I am happy to be here but how can I find able person that will guide me through my stay here. I want to learn all about the Bitcoin network so that I can also reciprocate to my friends too. I want to learn as fast as possible so I can easily share my knowledge to my colleagues and family. I never knew Bitcoin has a community as big as this and I am ready to make my contributions as I grow in knowledge. How do I commence my learning in the most subtle way?Is there addictional materials available? Like link, videos, PDFAny outlines of those important topics to learn about Bitcoin and it's network? Thank you community for your replies.",

If you don't want to be misled, no further response is required. Most of the guys on this forum are unfriendly and don't trust anyone. If you do not want to be a victim of a scam.
