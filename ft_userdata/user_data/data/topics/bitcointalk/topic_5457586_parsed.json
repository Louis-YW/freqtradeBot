Furthermore City will definitely start as the favourites but Arsenal will definitely push them and while I thought that this would be Manchester United’s season but now I feel that the takeover saga is derailing their transfer plan’s and at this rate it might be too late to get Ten Hag desired targets which will definitely have a negative effect for the club as the season continues.",

I don't know if that is OP's intention since the title is not specific.There will be six teams competing for this mini tournament and both Manchester clubs are not part of it.QuoteFrom July 22-30, 2023, six clubs will compete in the first-ever Premier League Summer Series.Five East Coast States will play host to nine matches, as Aston Villa, Brentford, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Fulham and Newcastle United head Stateside.Does anyone know a crypto bookie that offers line for this? It looks like they haven't caught up to this event yet as I can't find them.",

Better to create the new thread as the new session 2023/2024. I'm even more interested in reading a new thread, I admit I'm bored reading old threads with hundred and thousand pages.I don't know what I can sell there if endorsing the signature.Why did Chelsea sell Kovacic to their rival?",

He did well at Chelsea, and his departure from the club will be deeply felt. It is indeed a mistake to let go of such a talented player. Kovacic's departure from Chelsea is undoubtedly a loss, but Chelsea fans can remain optimistic about the club's future. However, Chelsea fans can hope all will be fine. Boehly might have plans in place to build younger generation of players. Kovacic's move to Man City definitely a perfect signing for them. After losing Gundogan, Kovacic can fill his position. Kovacic is undoubtedly a good player, but, Gundogan may possess a slight edge in terms of overall performance.",

Actually the Op can decide to lock the thread but even if the thread is active, I don’t see anything bad in it, people will keep on using all the threads, and let’s wait maybe @Trofo is going to lock his own thread since the thread is too long already, maybe new thread can be created and let’s start next season afresh. But I will even recommend we even leave the thread, anybody can comment on any thread which they think they are convenient with. I don’t know what you mean by if their will be clash between the two threads, how will the clash happen, anybody can choose to comment on the thread which they want and I don’t know how clash is going to happen.",

When a club shows interest on a particular player and it becomes obviously clear that such player also wants to move to that club, it is best to allow the player leave.If Chelsea decides not to let Kovacic leave the club now that he's very interested in going to Manchester City, the player would be very unhappy with the decision and would not passionately play for Chelsea again. So I think the club management was right to let him leave",

However, I do believe there will be some issues because PSG and mbappe have agreed to stay for another year. However, I believe where a significant sum of money is involved, everything will settle down, so it will be good to see mbappe in another team very soon.Real Madrid will be quite disappointed by this because they were the first to express interest in Mbappé in recent years, and Liverpool came up to seize the opportunity from them by spending a lot of money. I believe this will set up a rivalry between real Madrid and Liverpool.",
