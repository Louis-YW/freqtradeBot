Otherwise events like what you said will repeat and continue to repeat.But most of them start out unprepared and worry that they might miss out on some amazing momentum. Unfortunately, they made the wrong decision because they missed the momentum and ended up making a loss because the market was expected to go up and in reality the market went down and they sold at the wrong time.",

Bitcoin's case is peculiar because it will take some years before one might start making a profit. And within this year there is a lot of negative news which can generate FUD. Only the patient would be able to keep hodling even when everything is pushing you to sell.  QuoteAlso have in mind that it takes continuous work.It's like owning a plant or pet, just like every other business, it requires attentionSo in this case research need to be made constantly as the results of these researches would shape our decisionsGood research would often always produce good decisions which in turn gives good resultsMoving on, also have in mind that it is safer not to dive in on your ownYou don't need to know the technical aspects of Bitcoin before investing in it. However, it is important to keep learning and relearning about the Bitcoin space because there are always discoveries and inventions. This forum is an ideal platform to gain relevant information.QuoteGet a coach or mentor or whatever you want to call itGet someone experienced, someone whose experience can be seen in how much success he has had in the bizDo you really need a coach or mentor when all you need can be accessed in this forum and on the internet? Another challenge is that most of these so-called crypto experts might not be reliable. However, you could identify and learn from anyone who has a good reputation.You can identify some of the in and outside the forum. I am recommending Andreas M. Antonopoulos if you want to gain information about Bitcoin outside the forum.  QuoteThis would reduce the risk of rash and rushed decisions based of ignorance and inexperienceAnother is self controlIn holding Bitcoin it is not easy to turn a blind eye when you see people selling and making gains Self control makes you optimistic to the expectation of the price increasingThough I would say your coach or mentor should recommend on how you holdIt is good to have an investment plan and follow it judiciously regardless of the pressure from the media and other anti-Bitcoin forces. Every investor has their plan, therefore follow your own and don't be influenced by other people's decisions.",

Bitcoin investment never be the shortest means of making money, its people who misunderstood bitcoin and it's investment, actually when you learn bitcoin and comprehend the concepts of bitcoin very well you will see that bitcoin is not something we can say that you will venture into it with clear understanding and you fail to make profit..but the problem is that, the kind narrative people are understanding bitcoin as investment, is not what bitcoin ride about, their no investment you venture into and you don't know the rudiments and it propagate for you or flourish for you...many people experience losses in bitcoin investment depending their ability to code bitcoin technologies.Quote from: Zanab247 on March 11, 2024, 04:46:59 PMBTC investment is the best investment you can invest to make a good profits during the bull season because, whenever the price is pumping in the market make investors to earn from their different investment either long term investment or short term investment.You can only make profit in bitcoin when you know what's short-term duration of bitcoin investment and when you also know longterm investment of Bitcoin, actually we have to understand the strategy of investment before we invest...unlike people emphasising on long-term investment in bitcoin that is the best of making profit in bitcoin, the thing is that have you try to understand the chat of bitcoin first, so that you will know when is proper to invest on Bitcoin and hold for long duration, the most important thing we should know concerning bitcoin is to notice when you as investor suppose to purchase bitcoin and when you are not supposed to purchase.",

You are right that one should let a person they are teaching about Bitcoin know that it involves risks, however, I don't think a person can lose money after investing in Bitcoin if they are not getting into futures or other trading types and are just buying and storing and also are patient enough to keep holding through bad times, but then again, it's a matter of guidance, if you are talking about Bitcoin investments to someone, let them know each and everything so that they don't face problems, because if they face problems and incur losses, you are the one they are going to blame for their losses and then you won't be able to say anything because you didn't guide them well.",

But at this people think investing in bear market is the most dangerous one because they are afraid of losing money without knowing fully well that bull run is where people lost more money, because they always pick interest to invest when they have seen changes in bitcoin price without knowing then is the worst time to go investment since they can't predicts the future of what would happened next and immediately they invested and market turned against them it result to lost giving it bad representation since they fails to understand the mechanism or the principles that controls bitcoin price.",

You made mention of investing in Bitcoin to earn profit, yes and absolute correct.You made mention of Bitcoin investment requiring patience to hold, yes and correct.You made mention of research, it's important as most newbies don't know when it is very suitable to invest. Yes, every Bitcoin entry price is profitable but by deploying some certain strategies one can get better portion than when being ignorant, so a close research is needed and not actually necessary, having someone to guide and pilot you during making investments, for maximum profit and security benefits.Quote from: Thehallows on March 08, 2024, 12:17:54 AMHowever this hasn't always been the case as some tend to record more losses than profits and end up being far worse than how they startedThis be the contradicting point, when dealing with Bitcoin investment, it is very difficult to loose funds from investing only on the condition of selling too early, meaning one lacks the patient to hold longer. Even investing from the pick dose not stop one from making profits as long he/she understands the cycle, there must always come a bull run reaching different all time high.",
