You know that weighs about 400 kg in $100 bills, right?We're talking about $40 million dollars here, and you're concerned about the rental fee for a forklift?  Besides, think about how much cocaine you can clean off of all those bills, that's got to be worth a few hundred thousand more.  Kinda like buying a used car and finding the ashtray full of coins.",

We will be glad to assist and fulfill buyer's request, once we verify buyer's CIS and validate the funds, if the client is REAL and RWA we will get him a comprehensive program, bulk coins at discount etc.Contact us for further discussion - bitcointalk or directly through our website www.cryptorolla.com Kind regards,CryptoRolla team",

Most likely, the account will be frozen and you will be contacted to verify the source of the funds, let alone about 40M. It is a sufficient crime to imprison you for about ten years if the second party is unknown (and if you can prove that you are trying to sell bitcoin)As for cash, it is absurd to be discussed in a public place.In general, can a person with 40M ask in an anonymous forum on the Internet? What accounts create such topics?",

If you want to buy such heavy amount than use Peer to peer trading in Biggest exchanges like1. Binance2. Kucoin3. Houbi.pro4. MEXCIn this way this large amount could get exposure and also a lot of Scammers can turn to you and also law enforcement. Cause they can ask what are you doing with so much money and how you got it.",
