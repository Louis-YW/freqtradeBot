But i think these days it's pretty easy to push any such things into your device. This is just one easy to spot instance, creating a fake sms is the easiest way. I think if you haven't been subject to phishing these days it's just because you are lucky not to encounter it so far, no one can be aware enough to smartly ignore it.",

      "body": "Telegram, WhatsApp and other platforms are full of scammers. If you don't know the person sending you a message then block that person. Never believe in those messages as they are fake. If you have any doubt then search for source to authenticate the message. It is another example of how easy it has become for scammer in manipulating your mind and then getting the desired results. I am pretty sure many have fallen for this trap.",
