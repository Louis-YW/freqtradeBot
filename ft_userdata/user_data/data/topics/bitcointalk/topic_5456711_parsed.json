  "content": "First of all I want to say that I am having a lot of fun browsing the forums and learning and understanding a lot of interesting informationThere is no need to verify email to create an account and is there no 2FA facilities about which I opened a topic about it before. and changing email is also very easy and old email is not required to change email. and I saw the account recovery format where it says to sign a  message. so I think a wallet acts like oxygen to your account. So to keep your account safe, first use or stake a bitcoin wallet in the account and keep the private key / security phrase of that wallet safe and think of it as a backup of your wallet as well as the forum account. then your account will be safe for life and even if hacker hacks 100 times you can manually recover your account very quickly. I understand now that this is a decentralized forum, so there is no security like email verification, number verification, 2FA, KYC etc. So the first crypto wallet used in your account is very important to keep your account safe. Because that wallet will act as the primary wallet for your account. So keep your wallet safe.How to sign a message -  How to sign a message?!

In one wallet, you will have many private key and you can sign a message with a private key for one public address.What you need is a private key of the public address you sign in the message which is staked in the forum.Quotethen your account will be safe for life and even if hacker hacks 100 times you can manually recover your account very quickly.I doubt that!If your account is hacked 100 times, I am sure you will have more difficulties with account recovery.

Seems recovery system working fine now if someone able to provide valid information. If you have staked address and control original email then it's very easy to recover your account.Quote from: Kavelj22 on March 10, 2019, 10:52:24 AMAccording to users who succeeded to recover their accounts, two fundamental elements needed to start the manual recovery process:- Signed message from a staked btc address (not altcoin) in an unedited post.- Full control over the original email used for account registration (may be more important than the signed message) .The new system seems to be smoothly running without problems. Thanks Admin I made a thread to record all the data entries in SecLog about manual recovery of lost/hacked accounts: All the Ownership-Changed and Restored accounts67 accounts have been manually recovered for the last two months (+2 recovered late in December 2018) . Scroll to the first comment of the thread to see reports sorted by month basis.Report for JanuaryReport for February(Emphasis mine)",

This has two steps: 1. You need to show that the PGP key or Bitcoin address is associated with the account, for example by referencing an unedited post in which you posted the address. 2. You need to sign an appropriate message with that key/address.Quote from: dzungmobile on June 18, 2023, 02:44:00 AMI doubt that!If your account is hacked 100 times, I am sure you will have more difficulties with account recovery. The 100th time would not be as easy as a 1st time in recovery process.One member like Hero or Legendary member had his account hacked two or three times and at the end, abandoned to recover that account.He signed a message from his alt to announce the main account was hacked for a 2nd or 3rd time, then never came back to recover it. Anyone can bring that case here, please. I forgot the name.",

Also, this topic has been touched on previously many times, whether in dedicated topics or through discussions. I would be encouraged to give you some merit points if the subject was unique.",

This would also help in protecting your account from being hacked, I believe some of these has been shared on your previous post.",

I remember that when I started in the forum I lost the password for the forum and I recovered it via the e-mail associated with the forum account.It is good for everyone to learn this method, whether old members or beginners, because this method is decentralized and really cool. In fact, I have never found such a method in any other forum except in this wonderful forum. This feature is really befitting of the largest and oldest Bitcoin forum",

The goal of that custom page was to check if my IP match, now sure what was in their mind for TOR users.",
