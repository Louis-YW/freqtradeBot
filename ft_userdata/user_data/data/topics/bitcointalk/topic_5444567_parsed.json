You'll just fall into a black hole and I don't think I need to explain what's going to happen after that.You also should not look for collateral if you just need money, as loans are only efficient when used for investment purposes. Otherwise you'll also be paying interest on your loan. Better to just earn the money directly - neither loans nor gambling are income. They are liabilities.",

Minimum wage in Sweden is $12.62 per hour.Quote from: GiftedMason on March 14, 2023, 07:15:39 AMI NEED for new capital to start over againg and planing to earn about 50000 $ untill the end of the yearSo you'll either need to work 4000 hours, or find a job that pays more than minimum wage. Either way, it sounds like you've lost it all gambling and want to win it back chase your losses. My advice: do the math on gambling: if you could win, you wouldn't have lost in the first place. Give it up, the math in a casino is always against you.Quote from: ps34 on March 13, 2023, 10:35:19 PMso if you can't put something besides the loan as collateral your fucked right ? ¬† you have NO chance in hell to get a loan?Why don't you give OP a loan?",

You should go to your bank and take a credit card from them and use the fund as you need and at the end of the month repay the outstanding credit card balance. I think it will help you, thank you. Also, it will be the easiest way for you to arrange a fund.",
