  "content": "This is not to preach lawlessness, yet the fact remains that there are many countries' governments that are less informed about Bitcoin and the benefits therein, thereby depriving their citizens of these benefits. But the good part is that some of these countries do not ban the accessibility and domains of crypto wallets and exchanges, which makes it possible for anyone to disregard the government and use Bitcoin, but carefully.Taking Nigeria as an example, the most suggested approach is through P2P, it is working well, but I read that many have had their bank accounts banned, especially when there is a huge inflow, or the amount becomes much in its accumulation with time without a good explanation for it. What are your suggestions for me and other beginners/users that are in this condition but want to participate in the technology and benefits that Bitcoin brings over the banks and government interference?",

The people that are still turning it to business means can find their bank account blocked, but bitcoin is not illegal to be traded among people in Nigeria. There are some countries like China, two to four countries in white African countries (the Northern Africans) and some other countries in the world, which totalled 14 countries as at last year that totally banned bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. But China makes it known that bitcoin can not be totally banned because of its decentralized design. But it would have been better if bitcoin is not banned in these countries.",

And such precaution is ~ to not include any pointer to Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in your reference box while sending money or paying for crypto services, and also let those who are sending money to you for your crypto services take the same precaution.Once you are able to keep to this rule, I believe you are safe to transact in bitcoin without government or banks interfering.",

There is a big difference between a bank banning bitcoin usage and the government banning bitcoin. Correct me if I'm wrong but I haven't found any evidence saying bitcoin is banned in Nigeria, there is only a \"statement\" by the central bank saying it is which doesn't make it a law. So all it takes to solve the problem is to not directly use the banks.

As the times progressed, crypto began to be known and developed by every country. Regulations are also set as flexible as possible so that they can run side by side with Fiat.
