I have looked all over Dicesites.com and anywhere it says contact us there is nothing. No email address, no phone number, and no live support. Anyone who can get me in touch, send me a pm please. Thank you.",

Or try to email info@domain.PM is not possible since the user last active was October 2020 while his last post is on 2019. He doesn’t leave any contact info besides his ANN thread. His thread receives a lot of pending request like this.@Yahoo, maybe you can try contacting the registrant info on his domain registration. Here’s his who.is result.https://who.is/whois/dicesites.com",

I thought surely someone on here would have his contact info though. Thanks for the suggestions @all.",
