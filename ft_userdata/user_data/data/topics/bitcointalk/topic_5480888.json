It is one of big factors make people to believe in Bitcoin.ETF, VanEck cause Bitcoin hardfork, it sounds too much exaggeration about impacts from VanEck.Recent months, if you follow the Bitcoin blockchain, its mempools and read reports, you know the biggest problems are from Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and Inscriptions. They cause mempools become bigger and bigger and transaction fee becomes more expensive.If any hardfork happens, it will be to resolve Ordinals annoying issues on mempools and transaction fees.Inscriptions, mempools and miners",

I mean look, Monero's development fund was hacked somehow and they didn't try to roll back the chain like the Ethereum folks did. So why assume that everyone will be like that.",

Bitcoin has faced (and is facing) much more adversarial situations from both within (e.g. the blocksize debate and subsequent fork wars) and outside (e.g. accusations of money laundering, fraud, wastefulness); so the threat of a \"rollback campaign\" due to a financial loss event is imho miniscule in comparison.What I do believe we need to be more vigilant about when it comes to Bitcoin ETFs is a kind of regulatory capture. If ETFs become the main way people invest in Bitcoin you can expect further steps that will make the private ownership and transaction of cryptocurrencies more and more legally precarious. That is to say, while ETFs may be a way for Bitcoin to get deeper into the mainstream, they may also result in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being engulfed in the tradtional banking system to the point of uselessness, even without changes to the code or enforced rollbacks.",

Bitcoin is too global for that.You are right for being worried about ETF, but I'd be more worried about market manipulation and how centralization is slowly infesting the Bitcoin world. ETF is just one of the small signs of it. Not to mention that I'm more worried about some form of fractional banking starting in this world (ie. when the centralized authority that holds the funds only has a small fraction of what they are giving people). They could easily end up selling 42 million bitcoin to idiots who buy their centralized IOUs (in case it isn't obvious bitcoin supply cap is 21 million).",

How many people would you need to put on the payroll and for how much money?Some Bitcoin Core devs are already on payrolls of Bitcoin service providers (Blockstream being probably the most well-known example). When we talk about developer influence on the public opinion in the community, then quality -- i.e. that these devs are \"respected voices\" -- is also more important than quantity. I believe from the current Bitcoin Core team nobody would agree to a rollback. But it's perfectly possible that a group of new developers in the coming years gain influence who don't consider immutability as that important anymore. If some of these devs are perceived as \"the voice of Bitcoin\", like people like Greg Maxwell today, then a handful of them could be actually quite dangerous.Just to be clear: I don't consider such an attack likely, only possible. I think there's a high likelihood that we'll never see such an attack. But the community should be aware of the danger (see also my answer to HeRetiK below).Quote from: goldkingcoiner on January 14, 2024, 01:46:10 AMHow decentralized does something have to be to make it 'technically impossible' to attack in such a way?There isn't such a \"number\" or \"limit\". All decentralized systems can eventually degenerate. Bitcoin has however fortunately a quite good balance between powers, so the probability of a successful attack is much lower than it was in Ethereum where the rollback finally occured quite fastly.Quote from: HeRetiK on January 14, 2024, 10:32:42 AMTrue, but fortunately the Overton window for making a Bitcoin blockchain rollback acceptable seems far, far away.I'm not even sure what kind of apocalyptic financial loss event it would take to nudge the community's openness towards a rollback in the slightest.I agree, fortunately in the present and probably in the coming years such an attack seems highly unlikely.I think however that this may change in the future if certain developments materialize, like a growing dependance on centralized providers (be it ETF operators or our good ol' exchanges, doesn't matter) and possibly if the connection to the cypherpunk movement and other groups which were essential for highlighting and defending Bitcoin's qualities like censorship resistance is lost. Thus the community should be aware of these dangers.There's an (imo erroneous) belief that Bitcoin due to its current qualities, or software-related characteristics, is completely immune to such attacks. Bitcoin is a social system, and thus can be deeply changed and harmed if changes in the social composition of the community and its \"values\" change the way people perceive what Bitcoin should be. The Overton window thus could change in the future. I honestly was myself a bit shocked as a highly respected member of the German subforum once wrote here that he considers a rollback scenario quite likely (I hope he was wrong there).In general I'm optimistic though.",

The amount of payroll money alone.... How many people would you need to put on the payroll and for how much money?Some Bitcoin Core devs are already on payrolls of Bitcoin service providers (Blockstream being probably the most well-known example). When we talk about developer influence on the public opinion in the community, then quality -- i.e. that these devs are \"respected voices\" -- is also more important than quantity. I don't see it that way. Without real authority over Bitcoin, popular devs are just members of the top influencer club. And their values must align with the values of Bitcoin. Otherwise it would be like running for president of the US while wearing a North Korean flag pin. I think if devs want to stay popular, they do what the community has committed to their values.As I understand it, the Blockstream conspiracy is about the Bitcoin Cash community being butthurt about the Bilderberg Group aquiring a company (supposedly) soley dedicated to Bitcoin. And they are going completely insane and claiming that Bitcoin is now somehow being taken over because they already had a conspiracy theory about Bilderberg and this new conspiracy theory about BTC, which builds on top of the first conspiracy theory about Bilderberg, somehow proves the first theory and therefore also proves the second one.Quote from: d5000 on January 14, 2024, 03:04:52 PMThere isn't such a \"number\" or \"limit\".

Bitcoin has however fortunately a quite good balance between powers, so the probability of a successful attack is much lower than it was in Ethereum where the rollback finally occured quite fastly. I mean the amount of effort it would take to attack Bitcoin is much different than the amount of effort it would take to attack some random unpopular altcoin (based on a clone btc blockchain). And even then, the damage would be reversible.The more decentralized something is, the more secure it becomes.",

For this reason, in my posts before I clarified that there has something more to happen for this attack to succeed: the community becoming indifferent about the \"values\" of Bitcoin. And then, if the \"top influencer club\" moves slowly away from Bitcoin's original values it could become an attack vector.Quote from: goldkingcoiner on January 14, 2024, 07:18:23 PMBlockstream conspiracyIsn't really what I wrote about. I believe the Blockstream-Bitcoin model (paying devs to maintain an open-source software project essential to the company's business model) is similar to the Google-Linux model for example and thus completely legit. I only mentioned it because it shows that a company can definitely afford to pay high-profile Bitcoin devs - the \"top influencer club\". And I wanted to emphasize that if something similar happens with a company with values not entirely compatible with Bitcoin's, and additionally the community not caring about these values anymore (because all they want is BTC going to moon ...) then it could become dangerous.With your last sentence I agree though.",
