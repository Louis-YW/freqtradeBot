I want to +Merit, but it shows QuoteYou have received a total of 1 merit. This is what determines your forum rank. You typically cannot lose this merit. You have 0 sendable merit (sMerit) which you can send to other people. There is no point in hoarding sMerit; keeping it yourself does not benefit you, and we reserve the right to decay unused sMerit in the future.hahah.",

      "body": "Also, take note if the network is congested the transaction speed also depends on the transaction fee you set and the weight of the transaction. If you have a bigger size transaction with the lowest fee you will be put in the last queue. Pools are manually selecting transactions or they prioritize transactions that pay a high transaction fee.So all of them have a relation to confirmation speed, not just the hashrate.Just adding this video to make sure you understand how the transaction works https://youtu.be/6yIqXMaeEJ4",

The biggest drop was -28% in July last year, during the Chinese mining ban. To hit the limit now, we would either need to suddenly discover over 1 zettahash of new mining power (which will never happen), or we would need to lose 200 exahash in the space of a few weeks. Even with the largest mining country in the world banning mining, we didn't even come close, so to lose this much hash power at once would require some global catastrophe, such as a massive solar flare knocking out electricity for most of the world.But even after that -28% drop last year, after the hashrate quickly recovered in the subsequent few weeks, the lowest the average block time came down to was ~9 minutes, which would be largely unnoticeable over a period of 10-20 minutes as you are waiting for your first confirmation. So if you are hoping for increased hashrate to speed up your transaction, then you are barking up the wrong tree.",
