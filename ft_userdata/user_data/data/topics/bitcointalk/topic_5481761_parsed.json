  "content": "I've been longing to Open my dream business for a very long time now, my dad is an influencial politician in my state. He has companies and some businesses and I've been pestering him to assist me with some funds to start my dream business of having my Own Bar but he never gave me a listening ear. Just on January 2 2024, He sent me #2,000,000 in my local currency which is about ($1560 currently in dollars and 0.037347 in BTC) to start up my dream business.              I was so happy and thankful to him for giving this assistance after a very long time I've been requesting money from him to start up a business. Now I've furnished and equipped the bar with different brands of drinks. I was thinking of using Bitcoin as a medium of payment for my new business since there have been massive involvement of people from my country in Bitcoin after the initial ban placed on cryptocurrency in my country was being lifted.My major setback now is the high transactions fees and congestion in the mempool but I've made provisions for my BTC Address to customers but for now they're still patronizing me in fiat.The picture below shows the transaction I received from my dad and the setting of my bar: please help wish me well in my new achievement for the year 2024.TRANSACTION OF THE MONEY RECEIVED FROM MY DADTHE SETTINGS OF MY BAREdit: after much deliberation and suggestions from responsible members that gave their individual opinion to me here, I have therefore retorted to use TRC 20-USTD and BNB for payment hence, I've removed my initial wallet address i made available earlier as my intended payments method but however, I'm optimistic to use bitcoin as a payment method for my business in the future when transaction fees will definitely reduce to a considerate price and probably no congestion in the mempool.",

I am not completely sure whether Bitcoin Lightning Network is available in your country as your customers have a habit of using LN wallets. If they are then start using layer 2 to become a profitable entrepreneur. The main chain is currently bombarded with spam and the confirmation time can vary from 10 minutes to 24 hours, sometime it might exceed. Until this spamming of the main network goes down either use Fiat or the LN. It is my recommendation to you and since you are the owner of your establishment think before and do your math. I am happy that your dream has come true and for your growth, you should think about profitability and not about Bitcoin in the current scenario.",

Good thing that you have the upperhand and you pops is an influential politician in your state, that really helps a lot when someone wants to start a business coming from the policies, permits and not just with the capital that you've asked.Now, going with the acceptance of Bitcoin. You can always put that logo of \"Bitcoin accepted here\" but you can have many ways that you can do, if some folks there are aware of Lightning network, you can accept that as well and that's ideal for small transactions that are typically normal in coffee shops and bars like yours. Next is to have a Binance pay or any exchange or you can actually just set that for Binance pay and let your customers that you are accepting pay from there to save fees. Do not expect that a lot of customers are going to come and pay for Bitcoin but expect them to come and pay for the experience. The first six months to a year is going to be the most challenging part of your business but again, I wish you all the best and keep it up. Raise the flag of Bitcoin there and praying that your business is going to thrive and successful.",

Back to your bar business I will say congratulation for setting up your dream business but I will say why not keep another means of payment option like stable coin it could be trc20-usdt payment or matic or bnb with this it would help people to patronized you the more than just only making option of bitcoin. With the current  network issues there is no one who would want to incur a gas of 4$ to $10 over a bottle of drink $0.5 this looks very crazy and no one will or would want to patronized you. Here you need to make provision for another network maybe after much receiving payment from that network then you could convert them to bitcoin using your centralized exchange or through the help of p2p over here.",

Moreover, I have some other expensive drinks that one can use crypto to buy.",

Bitcoin transaction fees are extremely high in recent times. No one will try to use more money to buy a bottle of wine in this situation. Also another thing that @Agbe told you is that since your father is a social worker it will be insulting to him if you run the bar as his daughter. Common people will make negative comments about him. But I will tell you that if you are profitable in this business then it is good and if not then you can set up another business which I think will be better.",

There are many reasons for this. Like as already mentioned, it is easier and faster to pull out fiat and pay for your drinks than to log into your wallet and enter the bitcoin address of the recipient. A solution to this would a Point-of-Sale machine and app. Additionally, we Nigerians would rather save/hold our bitcoins than spend it as it makes sense to hold it than spend it. The last point is also a response to those who are recommending Lightning Network.",

Using  Bitcoin for the payment of goods and services in developing countries is unpopular. Many people in this part of the world invest in Bitcoin to make a profit while others use it as a hedge against inflation. Before you include Bitcoin as an alternative you should consider the demand for such as an option. Even using Lightning Network for payments that are as small as $1 for a bottle of beer will be a waste of time and effort. I think you should consider using fiat until your country grows to the level of using Bitcoin for payments.
