Price shouldn't be a criterion when you are investing and getting quick profit shouldn't be what you put in your mind. Anything that has high profit and very cheap to buy wi not last as it will put you in a big loss. That is why you should think wisely and settle down for something unique and with great potential which is bitcoin. With bitcoin,you can be assured that you will make profit in the long run based on the amount that you invested. Don't be deceived with the price of altcoins and make sure you understand the market before investing on them. I don't think I have ever thought of any altcoin to invest in. Bitcoin price is volatile that is why you see the pump and dump in its price. It is a better to buy a small fraction of bitcoin and hodli than to buy a big fraction of shitcoin that can dump to zero level at anytime.",

Yes you right, but the risking very high.There are some shitcoin that will surely do more than 10x of their current price if Bitcoin price keep going up, but which of them will do such movement?We are always not sure of which one to invest in that is why most times I chose to keep Bitcoin since I am sure it will be the one to drive the price of other coins.QuoteI'm not an investment adviser that will tell you what coins to invest I only stated my observation why most people consider smaller altcoins rather than btc but I may also be wrong with my observation so please share your views I'm here to learn. A very good observation indeed; this your observation is very important because as Bitcoin halving is approaching, there is a possibility that the cryptocurrency market will take a good shape soon, and altcoin with low price if it has a good team, roadmap and good development with hype will grow very fast in the market, but must importantly; do your research before investing in any coin.",

Reliability or advertisement, bitcoin is not struggling to compete with any other cryptocurrencies, they are rather struggling to look like bitcoin, deceivebothers and scam their investor victims, but if you think bitcoin is less valued or profitable, try alts and learn your lessons.",

If we removed stable coins that are pegged because this is about unstable coins and tokens, the dominance will increase.Bitcoin volatility may not be as high as those altcoins, but this may even be deceiving at times. If you noticed, when bitcoin fall the last time to $24800, all well known altcoins and others fall to almost the price they were when bitcoin was at $17000 last. Also any altcoins willl not get to all-time-high.In short, altcoins are gambling.",

The project can even go as far as listing the token on some known exchanges like Probit, Lbank, MEXC, Pancake Swap, etc. But all that, doesn't really guarantee that that project can be profitable. There are thousands of Altcoins in the crypto space, and a lot of them are competing among themselves, but Bitcoin is incomparable to any of them. Perhaps those Altcoins you see out there are either built on the Ethereum or Binance networks. Bitcoin is on its own blockchain, and as such, altcoins are not in competition with it.",

Point of correction my friend, I must say you are totally wrong on this very concept of yours, as both the price of Bitcoin & altcoin move in respect to percentage (%), which even if it's a huge capital or smaller capital you invest in either of these two coin, the profit or loss you may make is directly proportional to what percentage the price of the coin you invested in moves. For example;1. Assume your capital is $3000, and you invested that amount in Bitcoin, and let's say the value of Bitcoin than rises by 10% your profit will be,10/100 x $3000 = $300, and means the available balance you will be having in your wallet will be $3300 (i.e an addition of $300)But if by mistake, then the price of Bitcoin happens to fall by that same 10%, then your available balance will be; $3000 - $300 = $2700   (i.e a subtraction of $300)And same goes to altcoin, but just that altcoin have a high volatility more than BTC",

Your observation are actually right concerning investor investing more on other altcoin than Bitcoin, but that does not mean they are scared of loss from Bitcoin investment as those shitcoins are more volatile than Bitcoin, I see one of the reason investors go for other altcoin than Bitcoin in because most of this investor are short term holders and they tends to profit from the volatile nature of the coin/ token within a short period of time while, Bitcoin profit more of long term holders.",

You know the problem be say everybody get choice because life na all about risking it all and that's why so many people prefer these altcoins because their level of pumping when it comes to bull is way faster and bigger looking at their price market cap. But the issue like you have already stated is that the risk involved is just two much as some of these coins might just die off resulting to you losing all your assets.",

Your topic should have just been bitcoin vs altcoins and not “other altcoins”. By saying other altcoins, you’re already referring to that some alt coins are superior over the others. This could be true but in true sense and as a bitcoin enthusiast that you are, bitcoin should be treated differently from other altcoins and shouldn’t be interchanged or interpreted wrongly with them. We see bitcoin as the only dependable coin and every other ones as centralized and undependable coins. The ulterior motive of most of them is to earn profit from people’s investments in them, once they achieve their goal, most of them exit the market and cook up another altcoin to lure people into again. Only few altcoins survive market volatility, investing in the existing altcoins in the market pose great risk and should be done at caution.",
