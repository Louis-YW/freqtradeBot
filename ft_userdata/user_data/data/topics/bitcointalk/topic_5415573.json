The country have got independence from the colonial masters, but the people of Nigeria weren't enjoying the real independence. From the source it is astonishing to see 27% of the population into cryptocurrency usage. In all aspects slowly cryptocurrency usage is bringing freedom to the people who are getting used to it. For now the country needs freedom from the corruption, and the same can be made possible through blockchain technology. Hope the country with lot of resources grow good.",

How do I know this? Lots of news and articles online about this.Yeah, you tried to throw some shit on the wall but unfortunately, you left 'em stucked between your fingers. I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with some points. I mean -- we could disagree to agree.When you talk about a country's independence, does it necessarily encapsulates any fact you stated above? I don't think you've really been enlightened on any democratic proceedings neither have you allowed yourself sometime to be taught how to compare and contrast its (independence) ambiguity; Which will then broaden your sense of perception towards the said word. With that, you'll understand how it stays as part of a sentence and its meaning, depending on the context next time.I mean , where the hell are you from, huh? Are you trying say that in your country, the gubernatorials and their Entourages are saints from heaven? Even American still has corruption problem, so if America -- with all the exposure, brilliance & infrastructure -- is still having corruption CONTROLLED,¬† not evacuated, who TF are you?Haven't you seen alot worse? How bout afganistan? That hasn't known how peace is kept? Make some reasonable points next time ( especially about a country's name) Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

Lots of news and articles online about this.I will not crucify the OP for celebrating the Bitcoiners in his country on independence day though it's kind of off to me too, yet the way we think varies, hence the respect for each other's views. As there might be nothing to celebrate in Nigeria as regards independence as you are concerned, many, including the Bitcoiners here might still think otherwise. Nigeria might not be getting everything right, but still, one of the countries you can enjoy the lowest cost of living in the world. This might not be if they are still under the colonial masters.",

I really feel that the presence of many of your nationals here can be additional proof that Nigeria is one of a number of other countries where many people already know about bitcoin. I don't know how your country's government regulates bitcoin so far, but I believe that Nigeria has had a fair share of the bitcoin market so far. You can expect legal adoption in the future, but I think it will take a lot of time from now.",
