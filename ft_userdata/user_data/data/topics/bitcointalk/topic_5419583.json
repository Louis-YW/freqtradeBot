What about any other change on the bitcointalk forum ? Have you seen any recently. Changes in Bitcointalk software rarely occur. Except for spotting OP at a glance and no more forum ads. But we hope theymos will also take a look at Member filtering widget [◇/◈] (SMF patch) it's a nice feature though.

What about any other change on the bitcointalk forum ? Have you seen any recently. OP being on the user that starts a thread is no more new. I have not seen any recently. Talking about new changes to the forum on a single thread like this is not necessary. If you do not understand anything about any changes, you can create a topic about it and ask. If you do not know about any changes, you may later know, but if you do not know about it, it is not necessary knowing it until you know it.The changes are not often but rear and any active user of this forum will know about it, only users that are not active may not know about it fast.",

Have you seen any recently.There are several, but they may have been discussed and known.The factoid slot is no longer at auction and advertises various sites other than those oriented towards forums, forum statistics and knowledge about bitcoin.The OP's feature was added to recognize who created the topic when he replies in his own topic.Not yet, but will soon be.The rest, just modify it as you want with some user extensions.In my opinion, any newly implemented changes in the forum will be announced by the admin. I don't know if it's important to have some sort of new change update log thread for the forum, but if it's for referencing users to know what has changed over a period of time then I think the OP needs to have the list and the official announcement.",

What about any other change on the bitcointalk forum ? Have you seen any recently. Is this thread necessary? Probably it might be to some users, but as for me the thread is not needed because there lot of threads such information can be discussed or reported. As it was said by tranthidung, you can report on those threads. If is to report here what about those threads.

Anyway, in the forum, we also have that one: Unofficial of (official) .... and my topic can become another unofficial one.  All information need on the changes and the add ads are there to discuss so, is there any need for the thread. OP I am not condemning your suggestion but I'm trying figure out the reason of this thread when there are other official and unofficial threads to discuss such issue.OP. After the OP identification add in the forum there is no add or changes has been found in the forum.",
