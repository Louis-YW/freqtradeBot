  "content": "Newbie now learning about seed phrase generation.I'm familiar with BIP 39 and its use in generating 12 and 24-word seed phrases. I'm also familiar with Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, which at least one company (Trezor) has implemented using a 20-word seed phrase based on SLIP 39. I'm not clear, however, on the relationship between BIP 39 and SLIP 39.What I think I understand, however, is the following:1. BIP 39 is still the official bitcoin standard.2. BIP 39 is implemented across many hardware wallets. If you lose a hardware wallet manufactured by company A, you can buy a new hardware wallet from company B and rebuild your bitcoin keys from your 24-seed phrase.3. SLIP 39, at present, is a company-specific (Trezor) standard.4. If you lose your Trezor hardware wallet, you will have to buy a new Trezor hardware wallet to rebuild your bitcoin keys from your 20-work seed phrase.Does this sound right?",

      "body": "Of course Op BIP 39 is the official and most common standard for generating seed phrases for Bitcoin wallets. BIP 39 is widely implemented across many hardware wallets that's why it's the most common though Electrum uses a different seed type.SLIP 39 is more like an extension of BIP 39, developed by Trezor, to support more advanced features like Shamir's Secret Sharing. Although Trezor's implementation of the  SLIP 39 format  is kinda specific to their devices, the standard is open-source and can be adopted by others too but I kinda think the likelihood is thinThe key difference is that SLIP 39 adds an additional layer of security and flexibility, but it's not yet universally supported like BIP 39. Though it's similar to how ELECTRUM uses a specific algorithm for seed creation. So if you lose a Trezor wallet using SLIP 39 you might need to replace it with another Trezor device to restore your wallet using the 20-word seed phrase.",

If you lose your Trezor hardware wallet, you will have to buy a new Trezor hardware wallet to rebuild your bitcoin keys from your 20-work seed phrase.No, not even all Trezor wallets support SLIP39, only newer models.You can recover to any other supported wallet, and you should find more information on Trezor website:https://content.trezor.io/slip39",

I hope that enough wallets eventually adopt SLIP 39 so that it becomes as ubiquitous as BIP 39, perhaps even replacing it.Although SLIP39 is an innovation from Trezor that aims to solve the problem of lack of trust in delegating recovery actions to a certain number of people or places and determining a minimum threshold to rebuild the wallet, I don't think it should be replaced, BIP39 is still very useful and the most trusted by people and wallets, what we want to see here is an additional option and not to exclude one that already exists, it's worth remembering that SLIP39 does not make the BIP39 standard obsolete.I personally will continue using the BIP39 standard, I do not see a specific reason to use SLIP39 other than for testing for now.Remembering that in BIP39 it's possible to use the BIP85 standard to derive child seeds, which can be very useful if we want to use only one seed as a backup and this will be used to recover the child seeds.",
