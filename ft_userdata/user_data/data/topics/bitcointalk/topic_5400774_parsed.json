The data presentation could be improved without hyperlinking the account name but only uses a straight row, much easier to notice.But what is your goal aside from to view who are entered the forum?",

It seems like a pretty time consuming manual task.In any case, If I were to be inclined to do so, I’d probably try to use ninjastic as an accelerator. It doesn't have all you’d need, but it should save a lot of time. For example, the following query lists 455 profile names that have posted in B&H this month to date. From there on, you’d need to enter each profile and check its \"Date Registered\" value of the user’s profile (*):https://ninjastic.space/search?after_date=2022-05-01T11%3A07%3A17&before_date=2022-05-31T11%3A07%3A17&board=39 (go to user's tab and press \"Generate\")(*) Ideally, you’d be able to cross the above 455 names with another source to automate deriving the \"Date Registered\" dates. I don’t recall their being an already existing and updated file generated by anyone with this information, so with time, you could eventually adventure into scraping the said profiles …",

For example, what percentage of new users who are asking about their ancient unproven bitcoin who have < 5 posts? How many claim to be Satoshi? How many ask questions that actually appear legitimate (and not fishing for information to scam users)? How many move onto having signature campaigns?There are interesting questions here if you are willing to look for them, and perhaps you are doing so but it is not evident yet. If you ask questions on this forum, I'm certain experienced users may have be able to recommend additional tools. Good luck",

Some people kept track for a while longer, but I don’t recall anyone tracing  the numbers currently. In any case, in order to do it yourself, you’d need to play around with the User IDs on the profile URLs to find the Ids that correspond to the first and last users created on a given month (i.e. April 22 (*): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3462332 .. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3472054). Trial and error. It took 2 minutes for me to find the prior Ids for accounts created during April 22.Nevertheless:-   The number of Bitcointalk created accounts per se is not really that representative of too much: many seem to be bot created and stay forever with 0 posts (more than those accounts that do post). -   You were targeting those created and participating in B&H, so having the total global amount isn’t really the goal on this thread (unless you want to contrast the ratio between the two sets).Quote from: Agbe on June 01, 2022, 06:15:41 PM<…> I am also writing a project in University on Bitcoin so the demographic analysis needs the population of bitcoin users in this year. <…>That’s quite a chimera. Obviously you’d be using sources outside the scope of the forum itself. I’ve seen various attempts here and there to estimate the population of bitcoin (not Bitcointalk) users per year, and logically they all resort to a wide range of hypothesis to try to estimate the figure one way or another.(*) Exact IDs for the begining and end of a given month may vary in different timezones.",
