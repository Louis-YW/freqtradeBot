If it will be a world currency, how many transactions can fit into a block? Depending on how many can fit, if we can't fit all current transactions in a few blocks, how will we adjust them in the future, assuming Bitcoin becomes the world currency? i.e. it can process its current transactions, but what about 100,000 more per block? If they're limited and it can't fit to 100,000 per block, this is one way to \"fix\" this, as there's no way the world will stick to an extremely low number. If the transactions keep overflowing the blocks, it will only lead to a huge backlog that can never be made up.",

When toilet first come out, people are also resisting in not using it, they prefer to shit everywhere. The adoption is here, they'd have to fight it over and over until they finally quit and governments adopt it too. IMF will be mad but what can they do?  The countries making BTC as legal tender will increase whether they like it or not. That article is old was published way back Nov 2018.",

Let's assume that they took and replaced the dollar, which is backed by the economy, the army and the US printing press, and bitcoin, which is not backed by anything or anyone. Today Bitcoin is worth $33,500, and more recently - $60,000+. Answer - such a \"quasi currency\", with such jumps in value, can be a global means of calculating and estimating the cost of goods / resources? This will be the answer to your question.",

It had been battling to exist in this world while others are trying to erase it, perhaps we should start with that. Not that I doubt Bitcoin's capability of being adopted by small countries but it is the human mind that I doubt to accept it. The belief about a physical money is still clinging to the brains of the people. Traditional way of trading money for food or other things with the use of a paper, plastic or a metal.

These are very small countries with Similar smaller contribution ti the world GDP. What they are doing, is for their own benefits and the world doesn't follow their footsteps. So having bitcoin as a world currency, is not possible. For such small and economically weak countries, there is not much difference in using dollar or bitcoin, since their own local currencies are subject to significant inflation. Therefore, they choose bitcoin, since from a standpoint of profit this is a better solution. It has nothing to do with world currency and I think it's too early to talk about it.Quote from: avikz on May 09, 2022, 05:51:55 PMBut yes, if suddenly US adopts bitcoin as a legal tender and remove dollars from their economy (won't happen), then bitcoin has a chance of becoming world currency.

Not because bitcoin is bad for that or anything like that, but because I assume that BTC will serve a different role in the future than being used as the world's currency.",

Just like you said also, their own fiat system represents their economical power in the world market. Let us just be grateful that bitcoin adoption is growing worldwide. We don't need to aim for BTC to become the main currency because for me, that's too much to ask for a digital currency which is just more than a decade old. And the main concern here is BTC is decentralized, which makes it difficult for any government to get a hold of its actual movements.",
