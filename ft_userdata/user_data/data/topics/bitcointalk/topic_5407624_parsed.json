There are few prediction sites of your choice that you can use. Even people can make their own analyses. Also some people do not bet on leagues they do not know about.

      "body": "Something like a subscription in Telegram just makes me think that it's about increasing the numbers of followers on your channel then eventually will abandon it, selling it, putting a paid subscription in the future after establishing a good winning rate, or something like that. Not saying it will be the case for you but while doing that on Telegram and if you don't mind, you can also add and shared your picks here on daily basis for users to see your winning rate. It will just take a few seconds of posting.Anyways, welcome to the forum.",

Or they call it something else like a membership fee or something.  I am clearly stating that I am very dubious of anyone advertising tips and predictions of any kind. Whether Bitcoin, stocks or gambling. In 99% of all cases it leads to the same profit scheme of taking people for fools while also taking their money.How do you make these predicitions? Do you have a system? How does it work? Can you show us proof of past predictions you have made which turned a profit for the person buying in on the prediction? How do you plan to make money with this idea?All important questions that need answering.Welcome to the forum.",

Eventually, they give up and go away.  Honestly, the tips you posted are nothing special and anyone who gambles on football could reach the same conclusions. How about posting a preview of the matches that led you to those conclusions, so we can understand your way of thinking? If you have years of experience in booking, I guess there are other communities and platforms you are part of where you can show proof of your expertise? Could we see that?",
