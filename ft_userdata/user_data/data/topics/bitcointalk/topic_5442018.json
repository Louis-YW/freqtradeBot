  "content": "Foreword: I think this is the first time I write on this board. I'm not really sure if my topic would suits better on Reputation or on Scam Accusation, but since one may argue that the person in question did not directly scamming the community and instead just facilitating the scam projects through a very careless DD --if they did any-- for the campaign they managed, I think Reputation fits better.Flag type-1 against Crypto Bountyes: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3185I've put this case on my plate for a few weeks since the first case against ahmim raised, took a glance at their post history, and frowned upon the findings of the bounty campaigns they managed. Couple that with a negative feedback given for bounty abuse [though at that time I didn't look at the reference link], I commited myself to give their projects a sweep when I have time at hand.Today's the day.So, first thing first, ahmim and Crypto_Dotar was found to be a connected bounty abuser by Stalker22 back in 4th of February 2023.Now, these are the campaign started by each of them, where most of them are followed by red flags found by several users:ahmim:Bounty thread:[Bounty] ðŸ’¥EPNOC The Next-Generation Hybrid Crypto Exchange ðŸ’± 10000$ Token, found to be plagiarizing whitepaper by yours truly, holydarkess, a.k.a. meðŸ’¥[Limited]ðŸ’¥ Pi Chain Bounty Campaign. Budget: 7000$ BNB | 4 Week., found to be plagiarizing whitepaper and fake team profile and several other red flags by, uhh... I think it'll be more to the community effort as everyone is pitching in[ðŸ’¥ Limited OpenðŸ’¥] Lamina Trade Bounty | 100k$ worth of LAMT Token | 4 Weeks.ðŸ’¥, found to be plagiarizing whitepaper and fake team profile, first unearthed by albon[ðŸ’¥Bounty Open ðŸ’¥]Fratun Coin Bounty | 5k$ Busd + 5k$ Fratun Coin | 4 week ðŸ’¥, well, haven't thoroughly check this one, but a quick scan informed me the project is an MLM with no team and a very vague roadmap, which I wouldn't be surprised if it ended an exit-scam as wellCrypto_Dotar:Bounty thread: [Open] Millennia Token Community Bounty | 350$ Usdt | 1 Week, found to be plagiarizing whitepaper and fake team profile, by albonThe interesting thing about those projects is that all of them didn't have a representative here, didn't create an account or ANN, simply doing bounty --which I think will not be paid at the end of the period-- which I believe was done deliberately Â in order to make their exit-scam easier, with the bounty's purpose is like what examplens said,Quote from: examplens on February 28, 2023, 12:05:47 PM[...]They are obviously not interested in this forum, except to collect more retweets and sharing of their story.a.k.a., more exposure to the clueless to invest on those hit-and-run projects. I wouldn't even be surprised if all of them were ran by the same team --if not one person-- who deliberately choose these this bounty-manager-wanna-be with poor reputation, knowing they won't bother doing any background check.Edit: ahh, almost forgot, the purpose of this thread is to ask whether it's fair to leave both of the account --owned by the same person-- negative feedback for this issue, or would that be seen as unfair, given some more reputable BM also has one or two questionable projects which passed their screening and leave a dent on cryptocommunity, and they didn't tagged. So, does a negative feedback deemed appropriate or should it be just a slap on their hand with a ruler?Edit 2 [13 June 2023]:Another of their alt, Crypto Bountyes come with another questionable project, Plagiarized Whitepaper - MetaSystem TokenEdit 3 [15 June 2023]:Adding a flag against Crypto Bountyes on the top part of this post",

They obviously don't care whether project is scam or not because if they did, they would lock bounty campaign threads immediately after finding out that projects they are promoting have serious red flags.They --and by \"they\" I'm referring to one person with two different account-- have four, not only two projects with similar red flags. I think it is quite agreeable that they don't care, like you said.Regarding their reaction towards a warning, that's a bit complicated, aibon as the OP of Lamina accusation thread had warned them on the 28th and they locked the thread after. But if we inspect closely, the campaign has ended on 26th, so it doesn't really matter whether the BM locked it or not.Thank you for the input, though, I'll leave a negative feedback with regards to their campaign quality.Edit:Jay-suss, I think I really need my sleep, my brain started to working slower and slower, I forgot that I want to add one interesting thing I found upon slipping into their tg channel.I've never joined a TG campaign --at least not that I can remember-- so I'm not sure if this is normal or not. Is it? Wouldn't it mean the participant spamming and unethically talking and promoting their projects on other projects?Edit 2: for aibon's reply below mine.Upon leaving negative feedback on Crypto_Dotar I just realized that someone has raised a type-1 flag against them, and it's currently active. I wonder if it's necessary to raise similar flag for ahmim. I have to say that your argument has its merit, and a part of my logic agreed with it, but the very last part of my opening post prevail on the battle with myself for the ethic on raising flag; which is why I also still abstained from Crypto_Dotar's flag.I think I'll take it to sleep and think about it more thoroughly tomorrow with a clearer head whether it's appropriate to raise a type-1 flag against ahmim with consideration of the long term sake of newbie investors... if no one had raised it already during my beauty sleep.",

You prove that and I'd be on board. Seems like a lot of users are quick to get pissed off and lynch a manager. Usually it's the bounty hunters.I think nearly every manager has been fooled by a team. We can do a call or 2, check LinkedIn profiles, escrow/hold the tokens, or whatever and it still end up not working out. Unless you escrow/hold the value of the bounty campaign in a stable token, you are risking everyone not getting paid. Now I can agree that a decent number of the bounty managers are shit and likely do not do any sort of check, but I don't think they legit set out to scam participants. I think they get contacted, accept the job, get paid their $50 a week fee, and teams disappear on them and the hunters. The teams are the scammers. The manager should do a little more to protect the hunters but what? most companies are not going to agree to escrow 100k in a stable coin. Most managers that get offered these jobs are low ranking and accept them trying to build a rep IMO.Best thing for hunters to do is stop joining these bounties ran by unknown managers. We all know that's not gonna happen.",

It literally takes 1-2 minutes to retweet a few tweets, same for facebook, only a few minutes to do other tasks such as copy/paste an article, discord, instagram stuff, or whatever else is offered. So this is why they join the lottery of every bounty out there. They know they only waste a few minutes to join and hope they get paid on 50% of what they join.",

Nonetheless, they updated their group with a rather positive note that I hope was made as the outcome of this issue, as seen on image #3, which followed by the absence of any bounty made by ahmim or Crypto_Dotar ever since.However, as it turns out, instead of refraining from bounties without escrow and/or avoiding questionable projects by conducting a tad bit of research before accepting a project like I thought they did, I stumbled upon another project managed by their alt, Crypto Bountyes, with yet another whitepaper plagiarizing project and no team, details can be found here.So far, they currently managing three campaigns, MetaSystem Token which mentioned above, Pi4ur#4 which... quite easy to tell how it'll end up [image #5], archived \"whitepaper\" is here, just in case, and CCFI#6, that had a previous campaign managed by other bounty manager, which upon glancing at their own group, I don't think has a bright future either [image #7 and #8].#1 #2#3 #4#5 #6#7 #8So, with this recent development, I once again resort the community's decision and advise. I left a negative tag on both ahmim and Crypto_Dotar --and Crypto Bountyes soon after this-- should a flag to warn clueless investors also be raised? In one side, I think they're not the owner the project, thus they're not directly scamming anyone and no one is --directly-- at a risk of losing money by dealing with them, nor there is a casual or written contract being breached, so none of the three types of the flags matched their case here. But, I'd like to think there is a fine line between naive due to the lack of experience and couldn't-care-less-as-long-as-I-get-paid in accepting to manage bounties. I am well aware that the bounty hunters participating on their campaign mostly are newbies who couldn't care less with the quality of the project, they'll just protest later when the bounty didn't pay. But I think, if there is at least a yellow banner on every thread this manager raised, newbies will be more carefull on enrolling, thus less newbies will be likely to join and less exposure of the scam projects they're managed to the cryptocommunity.Will a flag be considered appropriate or will it be considered an abuse of DT system?",

Whether it be participants in the campaign not getting the promised tokens, investors getting the rug pulled out from under them, token not ever getting listed, rewards decreased in campaign, or whatever a very high number of bounties turn scam. The managers should do as much research as possible before accepting a job, but even that doesn't save participants or investors from what the team has planned in the end. Most of these no name managers probably do not do any sort of research, they're only looking for a paycheck. If you'll notice, a lot are newbie accounts these days, so tagging and flagging them makes no difference. In the end, it's the participants responsibility as much as the manager to do their own research and not promote a project they find out is a scam. Does that happen? Nope, people just blindly join bounties and pray they get paid the promised reward. I think a flag is fine, but i think it'll be a waste of energy. I think the community needs warned that the manager accepts any and all projects that come their way, but i also think it is a hunters responsibility to research. So when I say wasted energy I just mean the manager will abandon their account n make a new 1 and hunters will not research anything.",

It's pretty clear he couldn't care less.[...]It also came to my awareness that the participant of their bounty group had also mentioned the scam accusation against MetaSystem, so it's quite safe to assume Crypto Bountyes, or whoever pseudonym they choose to use, is well aware of the current situation.",

I would suggest the forum makes a user have a SR member account or higher to be able to manage, but the admins wouldn't ever agree and get involved. That would also just lead to more account sales most likely.",

That also makes me feel like hunters will have a hard time getting their rewards. [...]I am sure they're very much aware of this thread and the latest accusation thread raised against them. I looked into my DM with them on TG earlier today and found that it's read [double checkmark] somewhere in between I sent the DM and today, which means they've been aware of the re-invitation and choose to be silent. On their group, they also made a post replying a user about CCFI and yet ignored the inquiry made by someone else earlier --the screenshot is on my previous post-- about the scam accusation thread of MetaSystem, further clarifying their stance of this allegation.As such, I had to resort to the drastic measure of labelling their account and the threads they made --as well as future threads and evasion-account they'll make-- with type-1 flag banner with reference to this thread for a \"more\" in-depth explanation why I think the flag is justified as well as serving as the \"single flag-explanations topic\". I hope members of the forum can see that it is not my attempt of abusing DT and flag system, noting that the flag was raised not under the belief that anyone dealing with them is in direct possibility of losing fund, but rather indirectly, as in if they invested on the project whose bounty they managed, they're exposing themselves to the said risk. Flag Type-1: feel free to exercise your judgement to support/oppose",
