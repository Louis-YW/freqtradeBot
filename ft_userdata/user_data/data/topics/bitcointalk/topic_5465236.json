  "content": "An example is in February, 2021, the CBN (central bank Nigeria) prohibited banks from engaging in any cryptocurrency transactions. At that time the restriction or ban affected the adoption of bitcoin, which was fast gaining ground as an alternative to fiat, for a while, people became afraid to be associated with bitcoin, because of the negative things that were attributed to it, like being a means of money laundering . Some were even thinking that the CBN ban meant that the country has banned cryptocurrencies. Despite the perception and challenges in some countries, the adoption of bitcoin keeps increasing everyday. Thanks to P2P which has widely gained ground as a decentralized means of transactions and reliable exchanges like Binance and Remitano, bitcoin users are increasing everyday. https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/cryptocurrency-usage-soars-in-nigeria-despite-bank-ban-70497781These are some of the factors that can be responsible for the increase in the number of bitcoin adoptors in countries that have restrictions.1; Curiosity, naturally people are inquisitive to know why they are restricted to do certain things, therefore the more they learn about bitcoin and it's advantages, they will engage in it and tell others.2; Unemployment, where there is high rate of unemployed people, especially the youth, they will see bitcoin trading as a source of earning income.3: Alternative source of income, they can trade and invest in bitcoin, without loosing their day job.4; Convenience, they can stay in the comfort of their homes and engage in bitcoin speculation and earn money.5: Innovation, using a globally accepted decentralized digital currency, that has no boundaries like centralized fiat, gives more freedom and privacy to the users.With these and other related reasons makes bitcoin adoption to be increasing everyday, despite all odds. This is the reason why countries like Nigeria, has one of the fastest rising bitcoin adoption in the world today.",

      "body": "A very keen observation you have made and to an extent, I'd agree with you. We all know that Bitcoin gaining prominence and recognition was like a threat to the government and the local fiat, especially as they saw that if nothing is done they will lose control and the fiat would continue to depreciate in value.But there are countries whose Govt have banned the use of crypto use like Algeria. In such cases, knowing fully well that such is frowned upon can limit the usage and adoption.Â But since you used Nigeria as a case study, I feel using the instance of curiosity as a reason for dabbling doesn't just do it justice. People will like to get value for their money and storing up the local fiat, which is the naira isn't the best form of investment as on a daily basis, its value depreciates.If you ask me, I feel crypto and bitcoin to be precise was more accepted by Nigerians simply because of its ability to ensure your privacy while you conduct transactions. Something the traditional fiat can't give.",

      "body": "Since there is no hypothesis to check whether or not Bitcoin restrictions can or have led to Bitcoin adoption in those countries that have publicly made some negative pronouncement regarding Bitcoin, it is quite clear that ordinary the rate of internal growth and popularity of Bitcoin within such countries won't be as that of a country that made public legal adoption of bitcoin, such countries like El Salvador and the Central Africa Republic this countries are already innthe forefront of the whole thing, and by that, their counterpart who have hard some misperceptions about bitcoin will not be meeting up with the policy demands that will allow the integration of bitcoin into their internal economy.What you listed above are all very correct but they can all be viewed as retrospect from previously kicked against technologies like the internet when it was still at its early stage of development but yet since people saw it as a great tool to better their lives m, they embrace and thereafter the government have no option but to also do the same.So similar thing will happen with Bitcoin in the long run, when the world economy will not have any other option but to rely highly on alternatives which Bitcoin is one of such alternative to fiat.",

The ban had it's negative effects but the positives actually superceded the negative because it was around that time that more people became aware of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's just like PRs now, even a bad PR might good for long term growth and awareness.Anyway, the ban was short lived at it wasn't implemented at the core level since currencies are fungible. There's no way to tag users who participate in P2P ans users who don't since anyone can just send money to a recipient for products and services.Same government approved Blockchain and Blockchain related services for National Development.",

So had the government embraced bitcoin instead of restricting it, it would have grown more adoption than it did when the other was passed  Much like what happens in countries like bangladesh or something. People in there aren't particularly aware nor supportive of bitcoin in the first place, but the fear of the government lead them to inadvertently steer people into becoming curious of what bitcoin really is and in turn invest in it. Stupid if you think about it but sometimes governments really do this for some ulterior motive. Some of them are trying to fish out bad actors who are more likely to use bitcoins to transact in private, some countries I think are banning bitcoin and then holding the people curious about it, so they could use bitcoin to jumpstart their economy altogether when they lift the ban. It's all a meticulous game of cat and mouse if I do say so myself.",

Some might that be tending to obey those rules and regulations but there are ones who would really be tending to dig in depth.Each corners of the world couldn't really be having that same decisions and jurisdictions that would be made out and this is why its not something new that there would be places who do allowand accept out Bitcoin or crypto and there are ones who do ban. Its up on a certain individual on whether he would proceed on learning it or would really be going in line on what their governmentbeen telling about.",

Some means to let people know of its existence and you can trust on intellectual forks to go the length in finding out more about this innovation and just as they are met with the bad, surely they would establish truth at some point and the coin gets more investors.In another scenario, it could create a panic sell situation for weak hands, there by creating a perfect buy condition with a slight change in price towards the bears and thatâs very much a viable condition for those looking to invest too.",

We still need to ask how big the growth would be if the government permits mining and use of renewable resources. Bitcoin is growing in Oman and the middle East because it has been given wings to fly. True that the crackdown may be a blessing in disguise because of what the OP has mentioned but we should remember that it would have been even bigger in these countries if it was permitted.

As far as adoption is concerned, it will certainly be faster without restrictions rather than with restrictions. The factors that you mentioned don't answer why restriction is a blessing. The level of curiosity, for example, would be a lot higher without restrictions. And whether such curiosity would translate into another Bitcoin user would also be affected to a significant extent when there are restrictions in place.Quote from: Kelward on August 31, 2023, 10:17:38 PMThanks to P2P which has widely gained ground as a decentralized means of transactions and reliable exchanges like Binance and Remitano, bitcoin users are increasing everyday.

Because actually this is very humane, because when something is banned like bitcoin, people don't leave and stay away from bitcoin. But instead I'm wondering and want to know more clarity. So people's curiosity is indeed one of the things that makes bitcoin more and more known to many people in the world.Because as the saying goesQuote\"The path to innovation starts with curiosity.\" -Robert IgerSource: https://www.bola.com/ragam/read/4957826/40-kata-kata-bijak-seputar-rasa-ingin-tahu-buatmu-moving-majuSo curiosity or curiosity, is indeed the beginning of everything, as well as people who are curious about bitcoin. Even though it has been banned and warned not to use it. But they still insist on using it, because these people are curious about the truth about bitcoin, the potential of bitcoin, and the reasons why bitcoin is banned.Quote from: Kelward on August 31, 2023, 10:17:38 PM~SnipThe last four points are clear, that bitcoin is attracting people because in general bitcoin is an asset that can make money. Apart from that there are several advantages that bitcoin has, such as decentralization and privacy which can indeed be maintained. So in essence, when it comes to profit and income, it seems like the majority of people will definitely pursue that source of profit. Because of this too, even though bitcoin is banned, from a user point of view and the popularity of bitcoin is rising to the top.So in conclusion, the ban on Bitcoin issued by Nigerian bank, it seems like this is actually like Nigerian bank advertising Bitcoin. Because people who previously didn't know about Bitcoin, became aware of Bitcoin, and in the end everyone in Nigeria became curious about Bitcoin. Amazing reality.",

This means that he(or she) can't afford to lose his/her savings. Cryptocurrency trading is very risky. You can't replace your job with crypto trading. I've always viewed cryptocurrency trading as a side income, that supplements the income from a 9/5 job.Anyway, I agree that the people simply don't follow the rules and don't abide by the laws in many countries around the world.\"The forbidden fruit is sweeter\". Maybe that's why imposing a crypto ban has the opposite effect and leads to bigger crypto adoption in most underdeveloped countries.",
