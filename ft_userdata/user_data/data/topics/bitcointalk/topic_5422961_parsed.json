Anyhow, maybe that initial price can still be bargain for. Best of luck to those who are interested on it.",

I'd bet 3-5 years ROI is considerable for any business.You are right It's too expensive for $1.5 m to just make an annual $94k year the stats maybe are not be enough to convince potential buyers to go for it, they need more stats and an industry position does it has an official announcement here, and how they market the casino is also important these are stats that should be considered, so the new owner will have the grasp and implement what could be done to increase revenues.If the ROI of investment of any business will take 5 years or more then it's not profitable to run that business at that huge cost.But a mention of the name of the casino will give us an insight into its potential and standing in the industry and if it's worth it for $1.5 million.",

I understand that generated refers only to revenue.

If the price of that site is lowered, will you buy that immediately? I mean, you can't just say you hope the price is bargainable but when seller lowered the price, you still don't want to buy it.Price is too high or not, not our bussiness, if you want to buy the site but you can't afford it because the price is too expensive, you can just shoot pm to seller, the problem is, people keep saying price too high but you have no any intention to buy.

The 1.5M$ amount is very expensive for a gambling casino, it wouldn't matter if the return profit is big within 6 months according to what OP said. But even if there is an offer there, it will certainly not allow it to go below 1M$, but it is still expensive to say even so.We don't know if the only capital in the casino that is being sold is their real capital there is only 100k$-200k$. But I hope OP will think about changing to the same price battle.",
