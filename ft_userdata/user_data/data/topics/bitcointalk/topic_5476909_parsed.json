But for an average person who are not aware of AI, can get confused and convinced easily. Personally I would not suggest anyone to investing meme coins. It is more like a gambling rather than investment. So if someone is prepared to lose their investment, they can go ahead and invest in such coins.

In times like this, when we are entering the bull run or halving, I really think there are many influencers who are pretentious and self-proclaimed that they are crypto experts even though they are not.  A lot of people who pretend to be experts are actually in the era of halving and bull run. If you don't know anything about cryptocurrency, you will definitely believe these influencers. Therefore, it is better that we ourselves know and have knowledge of trading in the cryptocurrency business.",

Your investment should  have careful research, diversification, and a long-term perspective.It's not a bad idea to listen to people who know about the finance but you should also know that they may have their bias. You need to take decision for yourself.",

I would have to agree that they are some of these experts that are actually good at what they do and some of there calls are most at times corrected but just as you said the social media is wide and many fake projects utilize some of them to either create or advertise there projects. I wouldn’t stop anyhow from actually looking into their projects or calls but what I will advise is be careful of who you follow. Stick to the old guys and not the just recent. Influencers. Also do your proper research and make sure the invested amount is something you can lose",

We should be careful about this kind of person not only in crypto but also in other types of investments. Most of these people only sponsor videos and don't invest in those projects by themselves. What they are good at is making video and talk like professionals to convince people. Before following any influencers we should look at their background first. I think an influencers needs to have experience of  two bull and bear market to consider expert in these fields still it doesn't guarantee that they will be 100% correct all the time.",

Yes deepfake and other AI tools has been utilized for purpose of scamming and someone who is not much into technology or upto date with AI will be fooled. It's more about there cheap so called influencers who are paid by certain project to hype their project and there will be heard of sheeps following them.Instead of experimenting with memecoins or NFTs it's better to stick to Bitcoin and ETH as the success ratio of meme/NFT are very less but once one out of 1000 projects rallies then it becomes talk of the town and there will be dozen more coins launched with similar name.It's better not to heed to any such marketing tactics or ignore the prediction during bullish season all together and just go with market trend.",

They just generally speak about market movements, fundamentals and technical analysis. Any of the descriptions you gave as examples deserves mostly   -emoji. They can tell how big of a probability it is. But phrases like top altcoins that will make 100x is shill talk, and never to be taken seriously.These \"experts\" can't even pretend to be experts because that's not their forte. They are showmans for fast paced media, like tiktok and youtube. They wouldn't have enough substance to seriously fake it. If you don't know who to follow and you need to follow someone, pick people who are humble and who owns their mistakes. That obviosly comes to top of the fact that they know what they are talking about.",
