  "content": "Planning is a very important tool and a very essential managerial function. It’s no wonder it’s there amongst the managerial functions and the first function at that. Planning as an activity never ends and is very important in the management circles as well as in our everyday lives. Wikipedia defines planning as “the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal”. I would define planning as the process in which goals are set, thoughts and actions on how best to achieve the set goals are deliberated upon, the best course of action is chosen and then comes how best to implement the chosen course of action effectively and efficiently. Planning cannot be said to be overrated as planning is essential in both the workplace and the home. Also very essential in the running and management of a business organization. Here are some of the benefits of planning in the workplace.1. Planning facilitates control: Control, also being a management function is essential and very important in an organization and a good plan helps keep everything and everyone running optimally 2. Planning helps solve foreseeable problems: With planning, problems that would be likely to arise during the course of the business year would be prepared for, easily avoided or solved with ease 3. Planning facilitates creativity and innovation in employees: With planning, thoughts and ideas are brought forward and the best is chosen. This would awaken creativity and innovation in employees that are tasked with bringing up ideas4. Efficient use of resources: Planning helps ensure that scarce valuable resources(both human and material) are efficiently and optimally, thus eliminating waste. 5. Planning brings about commitment: Employees following a good and well structured plan would be committed to the job in order to help achieve the organizational goal. As with benefits, there are also some cons to planning. 1. Rigidity: A plan can be said not to be flexible but rigid and this could be disastrous as employees in the workplace might feel bound to follow the laid down plan even if they know it might not work 2. Unforeseen problems: Unforeseen problems that may arise may very well not be handled effectively cause these problems weren’t foreseen and weren’t planned for. 3. Control: Control can also be said to be a disadvantage of planning. While a certain level of control is needed in the workplace, some employees may frown at being controlled and some perform better unsupervised or in a less controlled environment. 4. An effective and efficient plan can very well be time and cost consuming. On a personal note; planning is more advantageous as it’s an essential process that we must all indulge in for if we fail to plan, we’ve already planned to fail.",

Kennedy said  “The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.” which to me simply means, best time to plan is when you are alive, because a dead man can not and has no plan.For Richard Cushing said “Always plan ahead. It wasn’t raining when Noah built the ark.” this simply tells us we dont have to wait for the future we want before we start planning for it, the planning is how we successfully step into our future.",

But I had never heard that saying before, because I assumed that if a person fails to plan something for himself, he is not actually planning himself to fail. It's just that maybe a person is too negligent in his life that he meets failure at something.Quote from: odunybiz on October 30, 2022, 11:58:28 PMFor things to work out well for us in life, one definitely need to plan ahead. This is one of the secret to be successful.Making a plan to get success is very important in everyone's life, because it is a very needed part of life if one wants to be successful in the future. So it is very important to make every necessary step as the initial stage to be achieved to achieve success in a shorter time.",

This is the word that I was hoping to introduce to your topic and it is true that if you don't plan it means you have on the other part planned yourself for the failure coming in future to the inability to plan. This is a philosopher saying that you hear in motivational seminar speaking or public lecture on planning for the future. People plan for the future that is yet to come by investing in different areas of life. Buying of houses, land properties are very good for the future. Some people are hodling high value cryptocurrency like bitcoin, this is a good planning for the future. It is helpful to save and saving is part of planning. You need to plan for the future because not to do that is disaster waiting, the reason for the word not planning is planning to fail.",

We are still individuals who are not tied to interactions with the environment. And environmental factors should make you have a plan B.

We have recently experienced hyper inflation, high rate of unemployment and high cost of goods and services. Most businesses that have carryout viable plans are closing up because the uncertainties of this world is becoming uncontrollable. Regardless of these challenges, it is very important to plan because it helps us to control what we can and adapt to what we cannot. It is also important that we become dynamic or receptive to change. That is why it is important to have a shot term plan that can be reviewed base on the current realities.",

As you progress through life you really see the benefits of planning in advance with many things and you'll often find it is a trait that the wisest people use to their advantage in many ways. Just take holidays for example, those people who strategically do research and purchase many months ahead of time will naturally find the most favorable pricing, as those who leave it to the last minute will pay a premium as the remainder are often in high demand the closer the date gets. It applies to many other areas of life, such as Christmas shopping too - if you buy earlier then you can pick up presents for cheaper and there is also higher availability before all the best gifts disappear.",
