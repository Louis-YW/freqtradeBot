This many people do not really understand. If one listen and does this, it shows that they are good at wanting to develop their capacity in building more and in learning more about their Â strength.All feedbacks, reviews are good for the growth of every individual and organisations as the case may be. Only those that are willing to grow and develop accept their flaws and lapses to work on them.",
