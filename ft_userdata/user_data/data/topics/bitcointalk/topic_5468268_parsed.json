      "body": "Hello fellow traders,It's been an incredible journey since the launch of the TradeHive project three months ago, and I'm thrilled to share the latest updates with you. The project has not only been successful but continues to evolve, with over 5,000 active crypto traders now benefiting from it.Here are some of the key developments over the past few months:Enhanced Order Book Heatmap:The Order Book Heatmap feature has undergone significant improvements, becoming faster and more functional than ever before.New screener \"Coins\" - TW alternative with more functions:Introducing a brand-new tool called \"Coins,\" providing a comprehensive list of ALL coins with selected metrics for each (volume, correlation to BTC, volatility, etc.) over user-defined time intervals ranging from 5 minutes to 24 hours. The Coins tool also automatically identifies support and resistance levels across all timeframes.Email and Telegram Notifications:Stay informed in real-time with new features like email and Telegram notifications for price crossings and new limit orders.Expanded Functionality:A plethora of new settings and tools have been added, including a Trend Screener and Order Book Screener, offering even more ways to analyze and act on market trends.Server Optimization:Behind the scenes, we've optimized the server infrastructure, resulting in a significantly improved overall service speed.TradeHive offers cost-effective subscription at just $12.5 per month. This low cost is intentional – my goal is to make our service accessible to traders of all levels.For any inquiries or if you simply want to connect, feel free to reach out to me on Telegram: https://t.me/dmitrijslvYoutube channel about the project - https://www.youtube.com/@TradehiveLiveLink to the project - tradehive.live",
