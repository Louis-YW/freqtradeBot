But if it has more information, evidence, chat logs, etc. and trying to seek help, scam accusation board should be better and the thread should be moved there. But of course, creating topics on the 2 board is okay too as long it falls on what i have mentioned. Just my opinion.",

I know your points, but the forum doesn't work that way they always moved every topics and post where is belongs. I actually really love your suggestions so that gamblers could have a clearer view of any already existing scam accusations.",

I personally do not mind to see those threads on the gambling section and if we think about it, it is true it is more likely for both gamblers and agents of the casinos to notice those cases if they are shared there. However, with the volume many casinos can have and the amount of people which could claim to have been scammed when actually they tried to broke the rules of the casino or simply lost much money, could lead to spammy behavior in the board. So I don't know, I assume it has both pros and cons. I'll wait for an official answer as well.",

Then It also means scam ICO's and tokens should have their scam accusations posted in the Altcoin discussion board?Scam services, should their scam accusations posted in the services board? Scam HYIPs and Ponzi schemes should have their scam accusations posted in the Investor-based games board?Scam exchanges should have their scam accusations posted in the exchanges board?Then what exactly would be the point of the scam accusations board?I think it's all about organization here.

So while all scam accusations go to the appropriate board, it's left for someone who really wants to get the best out of a gambling platform to use the forum search and type just the name of the casino they want to know, and they will see all the boards or threads where the name of the gambling platform has been mentioned.",

Like a new child board in Gambling board with a child board name like \"Scam accusations (Gambling).\"Before you raise your proposal, you must think that whether the forum need more child boards of other scam accusations such as Scam accusations (Mining), Scam accusations (Altcoins) and more.Personally, I see the current Scam accusations child board is enough.",

Answer from a moderator would be much appreciated.This is not a bad idea because these accusations will be viewed easily and it could also serve as a reminder and warning to gamblers to avoid some platforms. But the forum has different sections mapped out for specific purposes. These sections help to make the forum more organized and easy to use. I think it is the responsibility of every gambler to do research on gambling sites or casinos intended to use. Therefore, the scam accusation section should be a regular section every member should access before choosing a service, product, or gambling operator.",

Most of the complaints just seem to be from sore losers or those who have been caught trying to abuse accounts etc and then when their funds get withheld they turn to the board just to try kick up a bit of a fuss and hope that will help. Any genuine scam accusation against them should just go in the Accusations board.

How many gamblers actually go to the scam accusations board just to check if a site they have been using is still working as it should? I would say not many. I would say there are a portion who probably do not check the scam accusations board or even do a google before depositing...however I think that is just a small portion of people who are a little careless or reckless (as gamblers generally are). I support that scam accusations or disputes should be in the gambling board for the sake of exposure directly to those who are using the casinos/games in that board, it would be a lot cleaner if a board was created specifically for them though.",
