Thank you!  Of course to say the safest is definitely bitcoin, not the other 2 options. There is no more secure coin than the bitcoin. But to say which coin can bring the most profit it can be ethereum or it can also be sol because bitcoin is safe but can't grow faster than the other 2 coins, on the contrary, the other 2 coins are not as safe as bitcoin. Risk and return always go hand in hand, so depending on your investment needs, you prefer safe or high return. Ethereum and sol are two potentially risky altcoins, so you should consider them carefully, just to be safe, I will put 30k in bitcoin and 10k in the other 2 coins.",

As Btc ATH was more than $65k+, i believe its possible that btc retun you 3x in 2years. But for 5x return, you need to choice ether and bnb. Less safer than btc but they are fastest-growing & possible to give you more than 5x returns in 2 years. I'm not sure about solona yet, so no statement regarding this coin",

The next bullish market to take the price reach new ATH were scheduled for 2024 in connection with the halving. This will assure with good return on the bitcoin. Followed will be the growth with altcoins. Solana have reached $260 as the ath in the past. Right now it sits around $33 which to reach 4X to 5X is easy thing on a bull market. It is good to DYOR prior to investment.",

Thank you!  When it talks about the safest investment - the answer would be Bitcoin.But if we talk about possible 4x leverage for 2 years - not from your list. You are just simply referring to hyped projects which is totally risky and you are just like gambling win/loss, but I suggest not to look at that. If you are very particular in regards to safe investment, make yourself aware also that it was a slim chance to multiply your money in a short period of time, maybe doubling it is possible but not 4x.",

If you're just going to think of 3x-5x of return then bitcoin is the choice now where we'll have a halving soon on 2024.And that means that there will be a push to its demand and lesser supply which will make the price higher. Amongst them all, it's always safe to pick bitcoin whenever you're going to say at least long term investment. In 2 years time, halving will take place and the effect of it could be the same as what the 2020 halving did.",

Ethereum needs around the same multiplier like bitcoin to achieve ATH and solana already dumped so hard. I think that would better if you are adding more tokens in your list. this can be some top 50 CMC. all of them in your list are safest bet for now. You must diversify your portfolios. I see that those coins have potential to give you huge return in the future.",

The fact that people are accumulating all of coins in the market for now. Ethereum will give you less compared with solana. I think that you can calculate this easily",

Thank you!  Out of the 3 coins you mentioned, of course bitcoin and ethereum are the better choices. I can't tell you how much profit you will make in the next 2 years or when the bull season comes but I can assure you that if the market bounces back and you buy at current price then these 2 coins will definitely bring you profit. As for solana, I think you should consider carefully, just yesterday it outage again and that is the 8th time this year, solana is a project that used to be highly rated and known as an ETH killer but unfortunately a top project outage 8 times and they have no other way to fix it.",

Thank you!  The safest bet? I would definitely say Bitcoin, it has proven already, 2017 and 2021 bull run. In 2020 see it plummet to $3k because of the pandemic then going to a massive run of $69k.Ethereum went below $100 in 2018, and then also have a magical run to $4k and up.Not sure about Solana, it's just new as compare to those prime movers. So I would same both of them are the safest and could give you a good returns in the next 2 years. And your timing is just about right because it is project that we will have another massive bull run in 2024-2025, so it's better to start now. And simply buy and hold, nothing spectacular.",
