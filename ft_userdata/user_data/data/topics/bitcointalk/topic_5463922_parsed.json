What I really like the most in terms of return is slow games because it can give you a possibility of high return on small bet in random manner unlike dice and mines that you need to setup the difficulty just to have a chance to get that target huge profit.So you are looking for games with the possibility of random result in each bet as well as the possibility to bet small? Slot is already the best game for your preferences but there are some other games such as plinko and keno. In these two games, you have the possibility to win random multiplier in every bet but the max multiplier is not as big as in slot. Most keno and plinko games are limited to up to 1,000x but there is one plinko where you can win up to 10,000x, this is the plinko game in duelbits. Quote from: AbuBhakar on August 20, 2023, 01:48:33 PMWhat micro games works well on your gambling style?Both games as I mentioned above (plinko and keno) are the best for me, I always play these 2 games in my gambling session. Works well or not will be a different thing because it will be depending on our luck, but I do love these two games.",

I don't know the reason, but it is the one that feels easier and gives the comfort. When I experience continuous loss switching of games takes place. Particularly I prefer switching to crash or other luck based games.The best thing experimented is playing Dice with 9999X with the lowest betting value for specific number of rolls. Till date haven't won in this, and once I saw the roll getting won on a void bet. Micro games makes people easily addictive, so we need the control and have our own limitations.",

I really hate slots the most and definitely not a fan of dice and other probably fair games because I’m suck on that kind of game.",

You have to play with very low winning chances to make the odds worthful and in the end it's likely you won't succeed doing any progress on it.It's a similar strategy compared to that one gamblers used years ago, when crypto casinos offered faucets on their platforms which could be claimed every X minutes or once your balance was fully drained or below Y amount of satoshis. So they expected to turn pennies from the faucet into thousands or hundreds of thousands of satoshis.After a while many gave up, because the time spent just doesn't worth the profit made, besides it's not being so funny and exciting to play this way.",

Quite of just killing time and callibrating my mood before playing again in sportsbetting. What bores me with micro games is obviously how boring it is. It is a bet and go type of gambling game. You'll just have a win or lose scenario and no \"almost\" moments which I think, hooked up ne with sportsbetting.",

I know that usually when wagering small amounts people try to go for relatively high multipliers, since they can lose those cents, but I apply the same strategy I would use with higher amounts and try to set small or medium multipliers, so I can enjoy the session before running out of satoshis.In the case of plinko I prefer to go with medium risk as well, though I would not mind to set high risk if I feel like it.",

So when you are gambling with $0.02 on a slots game and hit a big win, you might get $20 but if you were playing the same game with $0.2, you would get $200 for the same win. However, the only advantage that you might have for a game that allows you to bet with smaller amounts is that if you have a small bankroll, you still get to play a lot of spins and that might give you a chance of hitting some big win.I personally don't gamble a lot, and when I do, I don't do it for money but I spend a very small amount and I play slots where as you said I can bet with a small amount like a cent or something so that I can play as long as possible to pass my time when I have some, and I barely manage to win anything significant.",

I hate the flashiness of slots cause it burns my eyes, plus the fact that there's literally a lot going on when you pull the lever just doesn't sit well with me. dices are straightforward. It's thrown, you choose which side of the die you like, and you win whether you're right or wrong. No bullshit, no beating around the bush. I don't necessarily like it most, but if I were to really choose I'd pick it over any other micro-game out there.
