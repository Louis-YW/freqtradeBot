SmartNode need staked SLK to reward coins, while user need lock the coins to use the virtual private nework for free. When smartnode and user grow smooth,reward will be to balance,the network will be healthy and the coins will be useful!COIN DETAILS- Coin Symbol: SLK- Reward: 60 SLK- Max Supply: 210,000,000 SLK- Block Time: 1 Minute- Smartnode Collateral: 50,000 SLK- Free Connect: lock 1000 SLK2023-Q4 Roadmap1.launch the chain and genesis nodes2.grow the network 'smooth'3.deploy cpu miner   ✅4.deploy explorer   ✅5.deploy network monitoring dashboard   ✅6.deploy smart-node ✅7.whitepaper8.Announcement on bitcointalk9.deploy the web wallet10.listing the coin",
