  "content": "Hello Bitcointalk Community,We're a group of students from Politecnico di Milano who have recently completed our thesis project - the Crypto Antifraud Rating Score (CARS). CARS is a free online tool designed to assign a fraud risk score to Bitcoin addresses. We used AI and signal theory to analyze account statements, extract behavioral patterns, and provide inferences (https://carscore.io).We're eager to receive your feedback and hear about any similar tools or projects you may know of in the Bitcoin community. We are open to finding synergies and exploring collaborative opportunities.Looking forward to your insights and thoughts!------ NEWS/UPDATES (14 July 2023) --------1. Login removed! This change is based on numerous requests and concerns we received from various channels.2. Scam Search Engine Section Added: We now report results from google.com, reddit.com, and ChainAbuse.3. A technical document explaining the technology behind our service has been published on our main page.4. The algorithm now responds in real time. The inference calculation on an address, if it hasn't been in the database is now calculated on the fly.Through your feedback, we will build a roadmap of features to be added. Our aim is to provide not only predictions made with an AI model but also to create a one-stop shop for scam analysis.Thank you all for the contributions received so far./Michele",

I'm going to run the rating evaluation script now, so you don't have to wait for 24 hours. Meanwhile, I'll modify this setting to run it more frequently. Would every hour be alright? Would you be willing to wait 1h to receive the assessment from our AI?Thank you for the feedback, your results are online./Michele",

Well, here in our country you can't create many emails because each email that is created has an attached personal mobile device number that is registered in our name. So it means that it is difficult on our part to create more than 2 email accounts because there is simcard registration here in our country.The only thing I don't understand much about CARS is that we only see log in and no sign-up, instead it looks like we just copy and paste the address, right?",

Not all report in bitcoinabuse is legit, someone can just blindly report it including you, me or anyone else. I think you should add walletexplorer.com as one of your source, that's a good explorer because you can search the particular address and you will find the wallet, you can also track the other address associated with the wallet as long as the address have been used.",

For example, giving reasons why the number X or Y is safe, and which transaction is considered suspicious, and so on. I do think there is a formula or algorithm at play even if you use AI. The basic one would be \"transaction linked to previously known scammer address is likely to be a scammer\", or something similar. CMIIW.",
