      "body": "The topic of leadership is a very complex topic and we could easily debate on it for much time.So I will just share my point of view. The status of leadership implies there is a state of nonconformity or there is a challenge to be overcome. A president can be a bad or good leader, but saying a leader must be a dreamer implies there is a vision forward the future, if there is no vision forward then we could say a person can be a good president? Probably not, because it would imply that person will make things to stay the same or even get worse for their co-citizens. The leader is supposed to push forward to a state of perfection does not exist.A dreamer can be a good leader? Not necessarily, because there are other characteristics which are important to have in a dreamer to become a leader: communication skills, patience, confidence on themselves and mental strength to make choices under relatively high pressure. If a dreamer fails to have what it takes, then the vision forward the future cannot be put in use, unfortunately it is probably the story of many dreamers out there.",

      "body": "A leader must have his dreams on how to lead his people and provide for them with the right resources that they need at the right time,either through actions,words or other means. A leader with no dream will end up not being a good leader because he wouldn't add any value to his followers but  he will be proud and arrogant to his people.When one is a good leader he will make sure that he achieve his dreams by staying focus and committed to whatever goal he is chasing and will always put the interest of his followers first. Everybody has dreams but how can you turn your dreams to reality depends on how you believe in yourself.",

One who can imagine a brighter tomorrow for their people and their organization, and who can ignite the spark of inspiration in others to join hands in chasing that dream.But they should also be grounded in realism, blending their idealism with practicality. They are a responsible dreamer who can consider the consequences and impacts of their vision, and who can adjust and adapt their vision when necessary.",

And the success that one will get isn't just easy to get and they won't stop working on it until it is finished. Even finished, they never stop and that's what a dreamer and achiever is. As for the mindset of a leader, it's all about the entire team that s/he will lead.Quote from: MarissaLopez on August 30, 2023, 10:21:37 AMLike great success activist,when they have a particular dream,they plan out how to achieve and attain that dreams, inorder to get results and evidence.Leaders are not afraid of practicalizing their dreams,they are practical dreamers,nevertheless they oppose every forces and make that dream a physical reality.What's sad truth is even how hard you want to get that success, leader or not.

In other words the future comes in as very important for the leader. A leader who doesn't have clear positive future for the people obviously will crash the people on a place they won't be able to move away from in a long time and this includes economic stagnation and redundancy. But having a positive dream for the future will improve the lives of the people and the generations to come because of the positive policies that were implemented.",

They make a daily plan, weakly  plan  , monthly plan , and yearly plan. They make a progress report. In comparison, dreamers are people who see a big dream. They don't  take action to turn dream into reality, they don't work hard. Leaders are people who don't quit, if they get no result from work, for which aim they are doing hard work. They stick to their aim and after they become successful in their aim. Dreamers only think hypothetical and do not not struggle and quit their aim if they do not get any reward. Leaders are awareness of moneymoney. Talktive persons cannot become leader. Wisdom is necessary to become a leader. Leaders unite people and can speak openly and can deliver their message.",

Nelson Mandela George Washington Abraham Lincoln Mahatma Gandhi Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Yasir Arafat is the longest winning leader Those whose leadership qualities made the nation dream and laid the foundation for realizing the dream are the present and the qualities that attracted people Through them, we still see the true aspects of leadership.***The first characteristic of leaders should be love of country*One should separate oneself from kinship*The most important quality is tolerance it must have*The opinion of others should be given importance and the interests of the country should be looked after by abandoning one's own interests*The quality of a great leader is that country, religion, caste, and time should not be separated.**Finally, I want to say that the leaders will be dreamers. I hope that if they can manage the country like the great leaders who were there before, then when people hear the words of the current leader, people will not look bad and believe like before Many leaders in many countries are trying to do good things. They will one day be written on the pages of history by their actions.",

      "body": "Just remember, decades and decades ago, the general was the water-boy-like in the military. He was the lowest class, even lower than a private. He did all the disgusting jobs that nobody else wanted to do. Wherever a 'body' was needed for some menial task, the general was the guy that did it. But look at what the general is in today's military.The general of long ago became the people who knew what was going on throughout the whole military operation, because they were the guys who did all the jobs. After a while, when some menial task needed to get done, only the general knew what to do. He instructed other soldiers in ways to help him get jobs done, because the generals were the only ones who knew it all.Gradually, over time, the generals were recognized as the people who knew what was going on, because of their experience doing all the crappy jobs in the military. Their position became important, and gradually arose to what it is today.Of course, today's generals often don't know what is going on. So, the real generals in the military should be the ones with the most and best experience. I think it should be this way in the rest of the leadership world.",

That could be identified in two folds. One, is for the leader to have set up an idea and ambition to pursue their visions while the other one is to put up a team of technocrats and experts that will help you actualize your dream. These team becomes your Cabinet members. The quality of the people that constitute your team, determines the success and failure of the leader's vision.",

Being a leader does not mean that you will have to command and control people in their thousands and millions. It is not only the president and the governors that are leaders. I will appreciate it if you see leadership from the grassroots. If you understand that the father in aby family is the leader of that family. If you also understand that the first child is also a leader. Among the play group of children, there is a leader inside. In the denomination and workplace there are leaders. They could be controlling just two persons. It doesn't matter. But once they are in charge to make some certain decisions at that time, they can be called leaders at that level.",

The leader can't build whatever he's trying to build on his own. He needs support and if the people giving him this support don't understand or even believe in his dream they're all wasting their time.In my country leaders are not dreamers, they're just people who are good at playing politics. A lot of people mistake good politics for good leadership which is so, so wrong. The fact that someone is a good politician doesn't mean he/she will make a good leader. A good politician knows all the right things to say and do to buy the minds of the people. They know how to lobby people in strategic positions to get what they want.",
