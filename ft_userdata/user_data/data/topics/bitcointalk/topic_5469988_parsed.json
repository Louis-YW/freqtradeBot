  "content": "If you've not been following the FTX trial, you really should, because the level of fraud on display is enough to even rival that of CSW. Here are two snippets of code (pictures courtesy of https://nitter.cz/molly0xFFF) which have been submitted as evidence in the trial. This code is regarding FTX's insurance fund which was widely publicized:     The first picture above shows how the value of 5,250,000 FTX Token supposedly in the insurance fund was \"calculated\". It wasn't. It was just coded in. insuranceFund.size = 5250000 FTT. The second picture above shows how the value of USD in the insurance fund was \"calculated\". The daily trading volume on FTX was multiplied by a random number, and this was used to adjust the insurance fund to a new size. This is the kind of bullshit centralized exchanges are using in their \"proof of reserves\", \"safu funds\", \"insurance funds\", \"collateral funds\", \"1-to-1 matching reports\", and all the other trash they peddle to convince you your funds are totally safe. Literal random number generators. They will do and say anything to get you to hand over your coins to them. Don't fall it.",

      "body": "This is definitely not shocking to me. It's very obvious now that centralized exchanges / service providers will do anything just to trick users to patronize their services. If FTX went as far as publishing insurance numbers out of thing air with no actual asset to back it up, I'm convinced that some CEX available today still indulge in those practice.In response to FTX collapse, tons of exchanges rushed to start providing proof of reserves. The way it works is that they simply publish some numbers at specific intervals - they leave no way to verify but want users to trust them. \"Here's the numbers: trust us, we already verified the numbers so you don't have to. \"",

Their other wallets got millions of Bitcoins which is not their funds. Those funds are user funds. Imagine you woke up and saw Binance was shut down for some reason and the market kept dumping. That will be great chaos in the crypto market. People making this exchange more and more powerful by using their service without understanding the risk.

Proof of reserve my foot, the only time I'll believe a centralized exchange has a proof of reserve is when their reserve/insurance fund are in Bitcoin and held in a multisign offline wallet which they'll sign a message including the Bitcoin address which can be verified by everyone and we monitor the address constantly. Without that anything they say isn't worth believing. Moreover why would they hold insurance funds in their native token. Obviously they're doing so for them to easily manipulate the price (of funds said to be in reserved). No centralized exchange should be trusted irrespective of how big they're. They're here to make money and they'll lie, deceive everyone until they finally get exposed and exit scam just as FTX did.For newbies that'll come across this thread, if you still have coins on exchanges, get them off right away. Exchanges aren't wallet to store your coins with them and don't believe whatever excuse they'll give to make you believe they'll look after your coins. Take the security of your coins as your personal business and store them offline in a hardware wallet.",

When we add someone like Bankman to that, then the whole thing looks even more tragic considering his real competence to run such a company. What these people are really good at is creating worthless tokens, and that's something they have in common when it comes to selling their nonsensical ideas to anyone naive enough to believe in them.It really amazes me that such a company could even do business in the US, because what we are seeing now, someone should have noticed and reacted earlier and prevented everything from going to hell. How realistic is it that no one knew about all these illogicalities within FTX until it was too late, isn't there someone who oversees such things?",

I think you have a good point here because these centralized platforms can always provide fake proof of reserve. They can get funds from somewhere else into their business, conduct audits, and publish a healthy financial report. They will later pull out the funds which they borrowed to balance their account. An example is crypto.com which withdrew about 280,000 ether ($400m) from its account after publishing its PoR audit report. The funds was transfered to Gate.io's address fueling speculations that the funds was just borrowed to deceive their customers. Most of these firms show only assets without a comprehensive breakdown of their liability. So having a verifiable and constantly monitored wallet would be a good way to start. But even with this, they can still scam thier customers.",

It means that centralized exchanges are out here to scam customers of their funds but pretends as if they have the safety of customers funds as their priority. They claim to have SAFU funds which the numbers are not through because they know that customers will not bother, if it is true of not. They gain customers trust with lies and this shows that they can come up anytime with an Exit scams. One needs not to ever leave a penny in a centralized exchange and also advice whoever that leaves their funds in Cex that it is not safe and that they are manipulators.I pity for individuals and institutions who finds it difficult to keep their funds in their self custody but needs exchanges to keep their coins for them, because they will be the victim if the exchange crashes, many of them should have learnt their lessons from FTX crash but they are still ignorant of it.",

So let's say Binance \"prove\" they have 500,000 BTC. How do we know that is everything they are supposed to have? How do we know that covers all customer deposits to Binance? We don't. It doesn't matter if they prove they are holding 500,000 BTC, if collectively all Binance users should be able to withdraw 750,000 BTC. Proof of reserves without proof of assets is meaningless.Various exchanges have tried to do proof of assets as well, but it is completely trivial to fool by just having a handful of accounts with negative balances, which is exactly what FTX were doing as well. Alameda's account on FTX had a balance of negative $8 billion.Quote from: Die_empty on October 11, 2023, 01:52:14 PMAn example is crypto.com which withdrew about 280,000 ether ($400m) from its account after publishing its PoR audit report.

And the same thing again with Bitfinex propping up Tether just before their \"audits\". Every centralized exchange is the same.",
