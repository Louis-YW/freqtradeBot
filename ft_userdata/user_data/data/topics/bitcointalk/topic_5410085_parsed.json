  "content": "Hi everyone!We are running an open beta test program for Zenland escrow app and will gladly reward all eligible testers for their honest feedback. Here is a link to the website: https://zen.land/. Currently, the app supports browsers compatible with Metamask on desktop. You are also welcome to read our official announcement thread.So, what will you test?Zenland is a blockchain escrow with the potential to replace existing centralized escrow services. It is a web application integrated with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC and other EVM-compartible networks where users deploy escrow contracts and send stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD) as escrow payment. Unlike traditional escrow services that store funds in private accounts, Zenland users send and release them from the blockchain through a smart contract.We will pay test rewards to Bitcoin wallet addresses provided by the testers after posting a report in this thread.- Members will receive $10; - Full members $20;- Senior, Hero, and Legendary members $30.What kind of reports do we expect?After completing a test escrow contract (from creation to execution), you should sum up your feedback in the form of a public report in this thread. We do not have many requirements but we would like it to be:- constructive (we want you to show us how to make the tool better);- have at least 150 words (screenshots are optional);- express an original opinion, not based on other reports.As of October 10, 2022, rules have been updated. For more, refer to: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5410085.msg61095391#msg61095391 What to write inside?We are looking for your thoughts on the functionality of our escrow tool, its usability, and the concept. Feel free to point out the flaws and screenshot the bugs. Your report should briefly describe how the test contract went through and whether or not you found it useful and why. Let us know if there are any technical issues or difficulties in understanding the escrow process.So, how does this testing work?To use the tool at its full functionality, you will need two Metamask accounts (to simulate buyer and seller). If you have two different Metamask installed browsers, you can go through the whole process simultaneously; otherwise, you'll need to switch between two Metamask accounts on a single browser. - Log in using one Metamask account (as a buyer) and fill out a one-page escrow contract;- Log in and approve the contract from the second Metamask account (as a seller);- Switch to buyer's account, deploy the contract and transfer $1 USDT or BUSD into it (trial funds will be provided by us).- Switch to seller's account and confirm the deal's completion.- Log in as buyer and release $1 USDT/BUSD from the contract to seller's Metamask wallet.If you are having any difficulties please message us on Telegram @zenlandofficialHow to apply?If interested, reply to this thread or DM to our Telegram @zenland_support with:1. Your Telegram username, 2. One Metamask address (as a buyer), and 3. Specify the network for test funds (Rinkeby or Binance Test Network). As of October 5th, Rinkeby tests are no longer possible. While we're working on adding a Rinkeby replacement to our system, we ask testers to use Binance Testnet. We will DM you and provide the necessary trial funding to cover escrow payment and other fees associated with the use of the escrow tool.DisclaimerWe hold the right to approve any application we like and refuse reports that do not comply with the basic requirements (even from accepted participants). All newly registered accounts will receive trial funds to pay the fee we charge for using our escrow tool. If unused for tests, funds will be zeroed out after the beta stage is over.",

As an experience, it certainly felt strange when I started, instead I placed an order with the Polygon network where the buyer's position did not have a balance. Finally, I tested with the Binance Test Network as above. I have summarized the whole process along with step-by-step screenshots. If it is still unsatisfactory and does not meet the requirements (no problem). I just wanted to participate and at the same time test how effective the escrow tool you offer is. Because the assessment is objective and if from 10 to 100 from me for your escrow tool is 75.Seller's address: 0xc4A02f06717462AeE3bA97FB81523B7736baC9D8Buyer's address: 0x4f3e744b0e43c0a37297f47fe61de8176c439ae8Transaction : 0x583b4761681844fbcf682dbe9f2cdb29661091d463f10b134bf65d9bd2fb1063update: payment has been receivedthanks",

Binance Test NetworkI like the concept behind the Zenland Blockchain Escrow Platform simple and easy , contract 101 stuff ...seller initiates the whole process which is an invitation to treat and Buyer accepts by virtual of accepting or going through the approve process which is going to be a game changer indeed! Only concern when setting up the contract is the possible adjustment of the fee to show were the zenland fee will be deducted from as the Zenland platform shows another balance in the top right.. Clean and nice contract, I like this !this is what the buyer sees after seller initiates the contract, and I like the fact that if any changes are made to the contract then both parties need to be in agreement to avoid any misunderstandings before approving to proceed to the next stage....... and I must say this is a super clean interface which I tried out on PC, wonder how this would look on a mobile phone .No sure if I should call this a bug or just a small backend error that needs adjusting, but when you get to the Transfer stage I have noticed this says USDt when I used the BUSD token as my agreed currency, btw amount is correct but currency is wrong..Otherwise so far so good, looking forward to Zenland going live!------------------------------------My only question would be which wallet or currency covers the Zenland fees knowing that other tokens can be sent on the platform and by the way why doesn't Zenland show the balance( 20 BUSD) am having in my wallet when drafting the contract?And lastly who can see the reviews left after the contract is fulfilled?........... Update: payment has been receivedthanks Team Zenland",

I will just add other thing that hasn't been on that reply. Overall my experience is pretty good, the process is not over-simplified, it still require multiple confirmation by both party to finally release the fund, however if I could skip 1 or 2 step that would be very much more comfortable, but if it will compromise the security then it's not necessary. I want to make some highlight and maybe some suggestion. 1. 'Dispute' feature, as a freelance graphic designer a lot of time my client want some revisions on the design so this feature is essential. However, what lack in this feature is additional 'Due Date' for the dispute, after Buyer dispute the contract, neither Buyer / Seller could set a 'Due Date' for the dispute, and there is no information whether the initial due date before dispute is still applied. I haven't tried to 'Invite an Agent' and I suppose that's how the Buyer will be able to get their money back.  Before Dispute Â After Dispute2. 'Review' feature, I have small suggestion on this one I will prefer to distinguish between account review as buyer and seller, some time people are good seller but when they have the money and become a buyer they do silly and ridiculous thing. Also, I don't see any feature to spot/tag a fake or paid review, I wish the developer will find some ways. 3. Last but not least, I would like to have a dark mode option. It's just my preference Â As I said that I am a freelance graphic designer, so when this app finally release I will definitely use it, the fee is less than 1% and we can even choose to split it. I would also recommend it to other if the dev working on my suggestion number 1 about the dispute feature. Thank you.Code:Edited on August 18, 2022, 03:28 PM Forum TimeI have received the payment from the Zenland team, good luck with the project.",
