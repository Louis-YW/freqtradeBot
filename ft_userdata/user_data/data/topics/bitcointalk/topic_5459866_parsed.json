  "content": "I read and saw a lot of people who forgot their bitcoin wallet keys. Could there be a bitcoin wallet that has a key recovery feature someday?Yes I know if there is a recovery feature then it definitely requires kyc or credentials like email. On the one hand this might make the account owner not completely anonymous, but it is necessary for double security. What do you think?",

      "body": "Technology is fast advancing but seriously i doubt if there will ever a better way to recover keys without recovery software holding something important to that wallet. To recover something you have to prove ownership, and that means saving that stuff on that platform and they provide you with possibly pins to access it. If you look at it now this still looks more dangerous then saving it offline, because not only could the software or wallet be compromised and exposing your keys, the pin provided to locate that keys are still at the risk of being lost just like the keys it self. So I don’t think there will ever be a thing that would actually make you to recover keys without having to hold on to something more important on there serve which still brings the fear of losing through centralization",

Does any mechanism like this always allow third parties to access our keys? maybe an encryption method or some other method can be used so that these third parties still can't figure out our key?Yes, maybe if the email link is okay, we can create fake email data to keep the data safe",

You may think that remembering a password is easier but that's a mistake because if it is easy to remember, it can be weak and can be broken which means low security.Besides, relying on third parties defeats the purpose of Bitcoin and not only it lacks privacy it is also less secure.",

If they have the access to grant you your own key, they essentially own your key. The closest thing to trustless storage would be a client side encryption but that'll be complex to implement for it to be truly trustless. It is far, far easier for the user to just make their own backups of their key. Its that simple.",

It's as simple as writing it on paper and storing it somewhere you or those you trust can only access it. There shouldn't be a problem if people followed the proper steps like it's their fault for not backing it up. Most wallets, IIRC, have the appropriate instructions when generating private keys.There's no use in having a key recovery feature someday if it's susceptible to possible hacking etc. It should be just you or a way to remember those important keys.",
