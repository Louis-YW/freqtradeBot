  "content": "Hi, I found this token in a telegram giveaway. So I did a little bit of research and I can see this have a great potential in future. That is not because of having a low max supply or a significant market cap. Seedify became the blockchain ecosystem's first gaming-focused incubator and launchpad.Its also includes an NFT launchpad for gaming and metaverse assetsSo I would like to have opinions about this project. I already have a little bit from this SFUND token in my wallet and planning to invest some more 100$ if it's entered 0.7-0.9$ price levels.",

So, is gonna to be hard for the token to increase.If he launchpad result is always bad, probably people are gonna to sell the token launchpad due have a lot fail launchpad.",

If you had followed this same token last year and what it was able to achieve, you would've known that it's a token sought after. Yes, I know some will say it doesn't have utility outside its launchpad use but then every token with utility has its specific use; isn't it? Come to think of it, the IDOs from the SFund launchpad are mostly successful. For me, it's a great token to buy into. More so, it's just around 100 units of it that gets one qualified for a tier on the launchpad platform. It's easy to get into unlike most launchpads in case one is considering that. Besides that, one can still hodl without staking it for project launch and sell once it appreciates.",

Sfund is good like last year, but the hype on ido projects are way gone off now.Â  Not only for sfund but every ido project since the market is highly volatile and down and it can produce such masisve investments from new retailers and players. I suggest that you pick another project with utility that fast and keep moving forward.Â  I suggest you shift from ido utility to defi products which produces a lot of profit from staking or farming.",

They like to do community events and actively communicate with their supporters. One of its utilities is the launchpad, once the market turns better. It will boost the sentiment and will push the price up. Reaching back to its peak is just a small matter, the only problem here is can you afford it for a while?But if you are looking for a quick gain, go look for another one. It is definitely not your best option for now because the IDO trend has cooled down and the market is unpredictable. People will not participate in any new project unless it is backed by a big VC or Names.",

I can only speculate that its price will climb higher if there are series of IDOs on SFund's launchpad. I guess you should find that out as I haven't been on that site for some time now. The fundamentals should be that there will be demand once a product is sought after and that will invariably affect price positively. That's vice versa also. If you've checked ATH for this token, you would realize that it got to around $16+. At its current price of less than $3, I think it's already a gift.",

Yes I know even every altcoin has decreased in price since Bitcoin went down. But this Seedify token is a different case if we compare it to DAOMaker.DAOMaker has ATH of almost $9 and currently the price of DAOMaker tokens is around $2, which is about 4 times the price drop of ATH. On the other hand, we have Seedify which is 5.5 times lower than the ATH price. Isn't this a sign that the Seedify project isn't getting enough public attention?",
