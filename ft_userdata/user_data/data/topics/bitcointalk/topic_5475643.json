  "content": "I understand the merit system in the forum is not to be appealed for as it violates the very understanding and purpose of the merit system, hence, I am not directly or indirectly appealing for it and I also made a comment to state what should trigger merits as I believe it conforms to the norms of the forum.The merit system is awarded based on meaningful contribution but not being a source of merit limits one from awarding merits in some cases. One must get two merits from a source for one sMerit to be birthed and only then can one send sMerit to a quality post. The merit sources can not reach everyone/every board in the forum at all times as they are few  but people who have received more than one merit can send out sMerit to posts/comments in various boards much easier and faster, it becomes a division of labour in the forum and the merit system circulation will flow easily. I didnt give much attention to merit sending and I am not the only one in this shoe, which is actually a fact stated by LTU_btc  in this comment until a few days ago when I came across a thread about merits and it struck me, I promised I was going to pay attention to merit system after that day and I started by giving out a few I had, and I noticed that giving 1 merit didn't mean much as compared to when I gave more. I got 2 merits from comments and posts from the likes of Cryptomultiplier, Pmalek, Pooya87 and Truthlovecoins although I also got 1 merit in two different posts from JayJuanGee which also helped to birth another. These merits helped increase my sMerit which is what helps me reachout to quality posts even better and that has changed my perspective after I did brainstorm on it.I'm grateful for the knowledge I have now about the merit system and all those who have helped me arrive at this juncture. Henceforth, I will take it upon myself to scout the forum in search of quality and informed content and ensure the merit in my custody is appropriated in accordance with this stated concern.Conclusively, I suggest merits should be sent in 2's by sources and others rather than 1, to enable sending to other quality posts possible and easier.Just my humble opinion and suggestion and not an appeal for merit in anyway.~wallet4bitcoin~",

You will receive 1 sMerit per 2 that you accumulate, no matter when you accrue the 2 individual merits.The suggestion will probably not be implemented, and since (as far as I know) this is how the system works, there is really no need for it.I'm sorry you wasted your time creating this thread",

Obviously giving out 2 sMerits per post has a potential quicker possibility of generating sMerits for the recipient to send over to others, but each person has his own scale of thoughts on how much to award, some being in ranges way above 1 sMerit/post on average. This is a summary of everyone’s sMerit/TX habits during 2023 insofar:https://public.tableau.com/shared/XN6SJC685?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_linkYou’ll notice that there is quite a mix, ranging from averages of 1,03 to 10,72 in the top tier of sMerit senders.sMeriting habits are going to depend both on personal preferences/scales and the amount of sMerits available, combined with time on the forum and a certain degree of tacticism (specially from accounts with few sMerits available).",

If we get to a point where merits in circulation drops massively more merit sources will be added to complement the system.Merit sources should merit based on their quality judgement, if a post earns 1 or 50 merits, they should give it to the user.- Jay -",

Well, it still doesn't change anything. Users here would give merits how it suits them and if I've noticed how sone users dole their merits, some give in twos and after a period of time, give another set of twos. This pattern is peculiar to @DdmrDdmr meanwhile others have their ways but it doesn't mean your sMerit won't come. Sometimes, after about two or three users must have merited you say 1 merit each, you end up having 1 sMerit and  for me it doesn't make any sense for you to \"suggest\" how one should give his/her merits.",

Regardless, it's nice that you now know and I hope you will send the ones you have judiciously.But for the number of merits to be sent, I think it's 100% self-discretion based. The merit sources need to check the worth of that quality post to ascertain the best merits for it.Although, this is not often applicable, still, it's not all posts that are worth 2 merits and above, and it's not all posts that should be down-appreciated with just 1 merit.",

But still, it's better to leave it up to the sources. In that case, OP should complain to theymos:Quote from: theymos on October 21, 2018, 02:28:55 PMIf they complain about amounts, tell them to complain to me.QuoteIt's best if sources try to exhaust their source allocations, even if it means giving posts higher amounts than is typical. If you have 150 source merit and you only see 3 merit-worthy posts in a month, then I'd rather you over-give each of them 50 merit than let the merit expire. That way there are more people capable of sending merit, and the \"merit economy\" is less top-down.As a Merit source, I started by giving one at a time. Nowadays I mostly give 4 or more, because I can't keep up with less. So it will depend on the user's source amount.",
