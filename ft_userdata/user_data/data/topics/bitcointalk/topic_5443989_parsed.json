But i hope they'll be careful about expanding their business quickly since in past year many similar company went bankrupt.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on March 10, 2023, 11:21:14 PMIf Nuclear Energy is cheap, why aren't we seeing widespread use of it as compared to fossil fuel?Probably because high initial cost and push back from some environmentalist and people who afraid Chernobyl disaster will happen again.",

Of course there are also accidents and disasters, like Chernobyl, 3 mile island, Fukushima... They are rare, yes, but when they do occur, those areas tend to remain devastated and desolate (radiation half life, isn't a meme game).Don't forget there is a bunch of ships floating around with such reactors, even if you don't see them much, there are plenty of them moving around the globe.While most of the waste is kept underground, there are chances to use this as fuel for \"breeder reactors\" as well, so hopefully that stuff won't remain forever buried and can be consumed so it doesn't pose a danger either in the future.Of course humanity is longing for fusion power, like that ignition event that was demonstrated with lasers not long ago, which is the same that floating thing we call \"The Sun\" does with gravity from being massive and all...About distance to generation, that is true. A long high voltage line can easily lose about 20% just from the transportation. NIMBY means more waste in those lines. But this is not a problem for Bitcoin mining which can go to the generation itself.",

As for discounted tariff: Ja. As others have said, the mining farm is right next to the power plant so in a sense the farm is 'behind the meter' in that there is next to no transmission costs involved. Yes obviously the power plant is metering the farm, just separately from what is being sent out to 'The Grid'.Now one might ask, \"why would a utility give such a low rate to the farm\"?. Simple: Any power plant needs a stable base-line load to run at best efficiencies. Mining farms pulling 10's of MW are as stable of a load as it gets. Couple that with the power plant being in a region that is not heavily developed with heavy industries or cities near it (yet) and a rather long distance to The Grid's high tension lines it becomes simple economics with the Utility who is running the power plant making more money by supplying power to the farm vs selling it on The Grid.EDIT: Being a brand-new fully-fueled Nuclear plant and therefore immune to the fluctuating costs of natural gas/oil/coal and for the next decade or so, uranium,  The plant 1st went into operation in 1983. the Utility is able to provide TerraWulf that sweet 5-year power contract.

If you consume it locally (at the generation), then not only you have that extra 20% capacity back, you also skip the maintenance cost of the lines.In the US the transmission systems are owned/ran by 5 different regional authorities who buy the power from power plants and then of course markup what they charge the end users (your local power companies). Those Public Utility Councils/Commissions (PUC's) are for-profit businesses. After the PUC's comes your local electric companies - again, for-profit businesses. Yes they are all regulated to limit net profits to be no more than a few % over operating costs (which includes what they paid for the electricity) but it all adds up quickly.All of that brings us to the main advantage of 'behind the meter' power for data centers & mining farms: The fact that pretty much world-wide the typical output of utility-scale power generators - as in the actual generators used - is either 4800 or 9600 VAC. To be sent out to The Grid that voltage is stepped up to several hundred kVAC or more before leaving the power plant through massive and of course massively expensive transformers. Now it just so happens that your local utility will be feeding most of their large power users who use up to several 10's of MW per-building with <drum roll please> either 4,800 or 9,600VAC coming straight from a local substation to feed each building's incoming power transformer(s). That means the power plant only has to provide needed switchgear & breakers tied to the generator buses to feed normal incoming power lines and transformers for each building. End result is of course dirt-cheap power for the adjoining data/mining campus.",
