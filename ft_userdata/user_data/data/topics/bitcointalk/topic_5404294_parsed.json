Do I have to worry about getting kicked anytime? (This applies to Spotify)A. No. Unlike other upgrade sellers who sell invites from cracked family accs, my accs are completely owned and pre-paid by me. It will last a whole year.2. Are they shared or cracked?A. Nope, it is 100% white hat and no tricks/methods are involved.3. Do I need to provide a new account or an existing will work? (For Spotify)A. You can provide your existing one as long as it didn't join any family plan in the past 12 months. If it has, I suggest you create a new email and give me that.T.O.SAll sales are final. NO REFUNDSAll accounts come with lifetime warranty , if account dies before you , just contact me i will replace itChanging Password will void warrantyI go first for very trusted memberAccept All crypto currency and no paypal",
