Yet it isn't small enough that you could use exchanges to buy from and you need OTC? Anyway, this post should be moved from trading to more suitable section like https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0",

      "body": "Well this is most likely a scam since it was made by a newbie. He probably wants people to private message him and he will scam them that way. These days whether you are a small firm, there are tons and tons of custody and institutional services out there that he can use. This isn't like 2012-13 where if you were a small firm and wanted to load up, you had to buy it privately OTC, nobody does that anymore these days because there is just too many risks on shady deals.Imagine buying some tainted coins because you didn't do your due dilenece. Hence I would be very careful if this person private messages you and wants to deal OTC and will give you a discount. Its a classic sign of a scam.",
