Then I took the number and dial it and I spoke with the Director and he told me to go to the office in the following day by 8:30 am. Then the  following  day I went to the office and the director told me to fill a form and pay $3 which I did. He said, before I would start work, they had to orient me. So he directed me to the orientation hall where I met other people like me. In the orientation hall, there were 4 instructors. One person was to teach how to print recharge card. Second person was to teach forex and crypto currencies Trading. Third person was to teach agro allied and the fourth instructor was to teach technology (computer software and hardware). And I chose forex and crypto currencies trading. In the trading class I learned only bitcoin. And it was just the preamble because of time factor and it was one day orientation class. So since then I had not gotten the time to learn again, so when my friend introduced bitcointalk and said I will learn a lot from it in my free period, then I signed up.",

This happen often in my country and it is just a scam if it is just a day training. There is nothing better like knowing these yourself or having someone that will devote time to teach you. Although I have known most myself including trading by using some trading guides and experiences. But trading is risky, using the money you can afford to lose is very important. For start, use very low amount of money to practice.If you are interested about bitcoin, it will be good to buy bitcoin in bear market like this and hold for some months or few years.Forex and crypto trading is not the same as bitcoin, do not get that confusing, but you can trade/convert fiat, altcoins to bitcoin and convert bitcoin to Fmfiat or altcoin. But in trading, it requires more training and very risky. Quote from: pooya87 on May 24, 2022, 04:21:50 AMDon't you mean Forex?I'm curious as to what you learned in that class.

But let us say they teach too but in a way not helpful. I will not call it scam too though because the money required for it is not that up to the amount it would be called scam.",

I would be more careful when it comes to such offers, because there are some much more expensive courses that last much longer, and in the end, no one guarantees that you will be smarter than at the beginning. The forum is definitely a free option, and if you really want to learn something every day you have the opportunity to do so.",

It could have been one of those useless classes where they don't even know what they are teaching themselves although these things usually take place online.They might have introduced them to trading lessons on very basic levels portraying them as expert but only sounds like a fake orientation programme where they didn't give you anything useful.There are many fishy things in this case like :1) He just saw job opportunity board named under Wealth creation and he called on which it was responded by Director himself and asked him to reach the office directly the next day.So he asked $3 and fill out the form so it's like some training programs not providing jobs in first end.2) How many people were there who paid $3 or more for these useless training programme? So they might have indirectly scammed so many people through this if we see it this way.3) What was further learning with them or just $3 one day workshop where they said bitcoin is good and nothing more of trading aspects to it?I think there main motives is to fool people who are in hunt to find new jobs and they make them lucrative offers or will ask them to enroll for courses which have rather less educated instructors or scammers many times so it's total waste of time according to me and don't join them or were you able to find job after that?We are saying it was $3 so he didn't loose anything but if we see broader picture then assume thousand members will have $3k with them and so on the numbers increase.Be safe @OP from these but if you are keen to learn about bitcoin this forum is best source for you to seek help and gain knowledge on technical, economic, trading of bitcoin but you have to take your time out to find out and enhance your knowledge through it.",

Welcome to Bitcointalk - a place where you don't have to pay anything because knowledge is meant to be free.What happened after that one-day training course? You never ended your story. You paid those $3, listened to a seminar on Bitcoin, and what happened in the days and weeks after that? Was there even a job on offer or did the \"company\" disappear after the interview?Whatever your experience was, I hope you understand it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. You were obviously tricked to pay money for something and that's where it ends. Bitcoin isn't to blame. Neither can you blame blockchain technology, or its creators. But this forum has plenty of resources that can teach you how to spot and protect yourselves from obvious scams and schemes.",

There were people he met teaching different skills and Op admitted that he was taught bitcoin trading. Besides, Op paid only $3, who pays $3 to learn full stack skill. I saw it as just an awareness campaign that after the day or two days campaign, the willing candidates would be given a proper skill with an equivalent amount of pay.Op, the difference between 2017 and today is much, hope you have learnt other things about Bitcoin since after then, or you lost interest?Meanwhile, welcome to the forum where knowledge is shares for free.",

Well, those that are offering on the streets have leveled up and they're doing these like 1-day classes on the internet now through webinars as they say.But on your case, it's entirely different and you've managed to get an information likely for $3. Although most probably that you've learned there can be learned for free but you have the idea now in crypto. Are those guys that you've met still do what they've done to you?",
