This is a good read for your interest https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/It doesn't make sense if there's a user need to write any explanation about technical things since it's too lot. You can start by reading someone thread on Development and Technical Discussions and read the replies too. It's better if you're also doing a practice after you learn, to make you more understand regarding what you've learn before.",

Why are you removing Youtube as one of the platforms to learn Bitcoin?Why not recommend it when you can still learn about it? I, myself is a proof that Youtube is still a good platform to learn anything with regards to Bitcoin and crypto in general because I used it when I'm starting and in fact, I heavily watched documentaries in Youtube. You are just focusing on the negative part of it, which are the distractions, but still there are some Youtube videos that is still good for newbies to watch, and they can learn from it.",

Anyone can just come up with his own information without proper studies or evidence. But it would also be wrong to conclude that the web is not a viable source or information or channel of learning. It has been proved that YouTube is one of the best platforms for the acquisition of knowledge, especially for beginners. It has the potential of teaching users practical knowledge because of its high quality audiovisual functions. Learning on YouTube is simplified that one book can be summarized in few slides or videos. YouTube saves a lot of time for learners. But it is important for learners to verify what they learn from any internet source from other reliable sources.   Quote from: Jason Brendon on October 31, 2022, 06:24:56 AMhi there,the community can only grow strong if one keeps learning more and spreads knowledge around.Are there any good resources to learn BTC, preferably some youtube tutorials? I am not referring to some basic things like how to send /receive money or connect to a node or stuff like that.I need some more advanced technics like OP_RETURN and so on.Good wisdom, please?The truth is that you are already in a forum that has materials on almost everything about Bitcoin. The founder of Bitcoin was once here (maybe still here), therefore you can get firsthand information from this forum. All the thread in this forum are filled with priceless information about Bitcoin. You just need to be patient because learning is a gradual process. If you hang around this forum for few months, you would be surprise that you have learnt more than you imagined.",

It's also weird to say that a video is empty in information if the video is about teaching something else or giving an information but there are so many click-baits on there and then paid influencers who just shill a random coin. That is the one that we must avoid. Our forum is pack of information but sometimes they are scattered and not compiled in one thread.There are also people who is just slow to comprehend things if they are only reading it but they think they can easily digest the information if they are only watching and listening to it.
