Different countries have different dates. The www.poloniexfairfund.com site is for US people. Users in other parts of the world that are still entitled to getting something got different notices from KCC. If you did not get a notice from them or someone else you were not entitled to get something in the settlement. It's a large convoluted legal mess. I know someone in the EU who in theory *was not* entitled to anything, but since when he setup his Polinex account he was living here he did get a notice. -Dave",

I don't know how many people are eligible to the compensation, but the amount shared and distributed seems to be rather large. I don't think you will get this kind of reward from Bittrex since they are already closed and will only share the remaining money they have between customers who had still funds onto their account when they've closed their doors.QuoteThe Commission ordered Poloniex to pay $8,484,313.99 in disgorgement, $403,995.12 in prejudgment interest, and a $1,500,000 civil money penalty to the Commission. The Commission created the Poloniex Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, so the penalty paid, along with the disgorgement and interest paid, can be distributed to harmed investors.",

( in fact, the transaction fees charged by Poloniex will be returned back to the traders).",

But the amount stated there is most likely not the amount we'll receive. With the fund being, what was it again, 1.4m? If the claims amount to, say 14 million, then everybody will only receive 10% of the amount stated in the mail.And now that the time frame to register a claim is over, they should have that information and at least be able to give a rough idea for what we can expect.",
