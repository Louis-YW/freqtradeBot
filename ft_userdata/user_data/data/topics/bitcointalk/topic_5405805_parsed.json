It is a significant achievement for Binance and BUSD if you know other exchanges mostly don't support BUSD. They want to fight seriously against Binance.It's very hard to get trading pairs for altcoin/ BUSD on non-Binance exchanges.",

      "body": "Main reason? That's the thing they trust, the exchange itself, nothing more. Do not listen to all those people who are trying to make a logical argument, sure those all matter but the reality is that exchanges want a profit in USDT, much better and easier. Do not think exchanges are in love with cryptocurrencies, they even dislike most of them. Because, they get a trading fee in that coin, and how would they be able to sell that and get out?So, let's say binance has doge, which means they make doge profit, how would they even turn that into usdt or btc? It would crash doge price if they kept selling every day, if they collect it and sell in bulk, that would be even worse. Hence USDT is better and easier for them.",
