As I see, you guys tag people with high trust rating, those who left the forum and those who passed away. When I checked Blazed's profile, it seems he is still in DT list but October 27, 2020 is the last time he was active. When I viewed his profile, he has never mentioned that he left the forum, also, when I saw his trust rating, he didn't have any trust tag that would mention that he has passed out or is not active anymore.As it seems, he was one of the most active and trusted member of this forum, I have no idea why the fact that he left the forum went unnoticed. Has anyone any idea how is he doing? Is he alive and doing well? Just wondering.",

I decided to just remove my entire list and get removed from this whole DT disaster moving forward. The never ending drama of this stuff has gotten old and just ignoring it all makes life easier.it is better to let people live their lives.Quoteit seems he is still in DT list but October 27, 2020 is the last time he was active.It is not surprising that he is a DT. I have added a number of inactive people to my trust list because them feedback is worth reading and I think everyone does that.",

He is a user who has contributed heavily to the Collections board and to several other boards. Of course that means I never remember if I ever once in a while quoted his post or perhaps asked him something, but I think people may have ignored his inactivity since 2020 because they were busy thinking about themselves.Someone who deals with him frequently might know more about him, but I'm inclined to wonder about TMAN rather than the user you're referring to because of his forum contributions.",

Yes, zepher was a soul of greatness, and I still can't believe it's been almost 5 years, I knew him quite well, we spent time in real life together etc. It was hard accepting his passing as well, due to the short notice after he vanished a few months earlier.  Anyhow, I would not get too deep into this sort of thing - as I said, there are many reasons people leave this forum, intentionally or unintentionally. Why bother? That is 100% their own business. Someday I will leave as well. Will I inform anyone? Maybe, maybe not. Who knows? You see where I'm going right?

It does not happen in one day when someone loses interest in something. People slowly lose interest, and they disappear slowly. If you look at his post history, he was pretty active in May 2019, and then he started losing interest in the first week. He made only 23 posts from June 2019 to May 2020. At first, the posting gap starts from a week, then a couple of weeks, and then months! Now, it's been almost three years since he left.

They can't all be dead.More likely, I think, is that they lost interest in the forum for some reason or other.Just think, if they did things half right, many would have gotten rich in the early years. Those who mined bitcoin for example with their laptop. Or someone who bought in 2011 at $1, just holding on to the investment until 2013, 14 or 15, where the price traded for hundreds of dollars (peak being $1,237.55), got rich, and lost interest in the forum.",

Probably, the user is still good where ever they might be.It’s also nice to know that, we’ve got communities outside our various local boards on the forum. Communities in the aspect of your active participation of a board or sub board to the forum and you can still build relationships to worth the while and other users having memory boxes of you.It’s not easy keeping up with the forum for years nonstop and to the few or many that have, congrats for shared interest.",

I doubt that he lost interest in the forum since he is very active on bidding on different auction thread here based on his last post. His last login has a 5 months which means he might check the forum for something. Possibly he has something to do in real life such as work or family matters that makes him less active in the forum since he is jist collecting here with physical collectibles. He is also super rich. Maybe he is enjoying now his wealth but I think he certainly not dead because he mange to check the forum few months after his last post.",
