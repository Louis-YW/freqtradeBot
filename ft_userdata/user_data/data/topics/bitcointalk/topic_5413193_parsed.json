Have you ever thought others would be lost due to your fake reviews? Does Google allow you to fake reviews? It's against Google's standards. For example, you gave positive reviews for a phishing site and someone impressed based on your reviews. Eventually, that person will lose funds. Who will be responsible for that?",

A fake review in this context means that you are writing a review based on a non-existent experience with the company. Regardless of how \"the market works\" in your opinion, your service is in obvious conflict with the terms of use and good practice of the mentioned platforms.",

I think what he means by real reviews is that they come from real users and not bots. The reviews are obviously bought so they can't be legit or honest. Dunno tho i could be wrong.",

For a few bucks, he will ruin someone's reputation. For what? someone wants to weaken the competition or just doesn't like someone's business. I would like to know OP's page on Google, and Trustpilot to give him a couple of free negative reviews. but not fake.",
