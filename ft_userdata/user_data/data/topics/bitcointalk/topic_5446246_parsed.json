I also mention this during a conversation with him, I already change my password account and un-link the connection device (It's from Italy). I don't know how, but I have 2FA active on my account and he still can get into my account (edits, seem like the bot requested token that's why with 2FA still can be bypass).The only one who are getting hacked is my discord account, and that hacked is after contacting with him 1-2 days. Any interaction it's only from his group, and guess what the verification MEE6 it's from domain .app",

I had a feeling that something was off with his questions that wasn’t about moderating exactly. I suspect that his intention was to steal valuable Discord accounts as his inquired about my status as a moderator in other servers when i told him about me moderating more Telegram servers he was focusing only with Discord servers knowing it’s the same knowledge and service any moderator would offer from any platform . Most likely his goal was to hack into our accounts and attempt to extort payment from the servers that had hired us.It's important from us to be extremely cautious when dealing with offers like this particularly when the other party begins askig for personal informations. And I'm sorry to hear about your experience and I appreciate you taking the time to warn us.",
