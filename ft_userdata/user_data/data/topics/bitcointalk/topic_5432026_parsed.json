I was planning on downloading it but it was unavailable in my country and from what I have read the game is only available in US and Canada.anyway, the main reason I posted this here despite the app not being a gambling app is because the Idea of the game is good and I thought this could be a good game that can be included in gambling casinos one day. img sourceEDIT:I found their Youtube channel and here are some clips on the game's gameplay.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtRH4QQTTdkcan be downloaded herehttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fiftyfour.e.oneshotgolf&hl=en&gl=USjust to be clear guys, I am not advertising the game.",

The only instance I guess golf would be included in this industry(if there's none yet), would be on sportsbetting wherein a gambler could bet for final scores or winning player in a golf tournament or league. Another instance wherein players are the ones who would play are with traditional card games or with roulettes and such. But as this industry is growing or having advancements, I think casinos might find a way to align such concepts with this industry. Even at this moment there are gambling games to some sites which are new on an old gambler's eyes, which are also more of a typical computer game such as with gonzo's quest.",

Having Tiger Woods in the in the US doesn't mean it will only be available in the US, that's a different story I guess.",

When I saw these pictures it reminded me of tennis, it's a much more popular game here (probably because of Djokovic):Tennis Clash: Multiplayer GameThese games are not gambling, they just have in-game stuff that can be bought with money... you make a lot faster progress if you buy equipment, and your \"player\" can be a lot stronger... which gives a lot of advantages to some players!

Games apps in general always have cheats being advertised on youtube, which are developed by players who have informatics' knowledge and want to have improper advantages in game they shouldn't have or should pay to have. An accuracy bot would definitely kill the idea of using this game for gambling purposes. Besides that, even if the game was adopted by gambling platforms, I imagine there would be a lot of disputes between players and the houses, payments being denied due to bots' usage accusations and casinos being considered scammers for punishing players improperly.",

Anw I don't think it's going to work, I've probably said this a few times and it's rather similar to how eSports isn't included in gambling because it's skill-based, or at least, the majority of the factors involve skill instead of luck. I actually don't see this lasting long enough, unless they have some kind of gimmick (or they made it free, I just don't see it being paid being worth in the long run). On one note though, I'd much rather consider those online crane games Japan has released (idk since when, I only knew them these past few years). The element of luck would be on the randomness of the prizes they get, they can even add some random gimmicks with regards to what they get and what it can result in as a prize.",
