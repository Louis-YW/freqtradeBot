It was a great celebration in my area today for the pronouncement of the judgement because, some people still have old naira notes with them that made them to feel  this is the best opportunity for them to make use of them. Are you happy about the supreme court judgement?",

But I'm angry that the current government played Nigeria in this way. From the rumours I heard, I understand that this policy was targeted at Tinubu as Atiku is the person behind this lack of cash flow policy by the CBN. I heard Atiku vice was from the same region as the CBN governor and they tried to make money not available to tinubu for rigging of the election but guess their plans failed as he still successfully rigged it and has been declared the President elect.When you reason this rumours and see how the supreme court running came immediately after the presidential election you go begin see some point for the matter. Them dun reason am now say their plans dun fail and there's no reason to keep the cash out of circulation. This na almost a year grace oh so what was them the need to make people's life miserable with the cashless policy if them know say e no go take effect from this year. This na just my problem with the Nigerian government, them no dey follow wetin their mouth dey talk and that makes it too hard for people to trusts their words.",

Perhaps, would have this development been made if it was a different candidate from the current winner of the just concluded election, who won?Will POS charges reduce now that the old notes have been called back?These are questions we need to find out, because we are going to be on a really long thing if charges remain same, no new notes in circulation.

Putting it into consideration we are about +200m did he think is only 200m plus are just in circulation?No. Because it will be very hard to change the mind of every one in the country and coupled with the new note scarcity how did they want her citizens to cope.Abeg I loved what they did to pass the judgement to use it to end of December at this people will bear it in mind as same time the new notes will keep circulating., Dem try to help our old mama and old Papa wey no dey save money for bank.",

Despite the information circulated in the media, I do not believe the President made any decision to negatively affect Tinibu’s campaign. I have always said the idea of naira redesign had nothing to do with fighting corruption or even the elections. It was only a means for the Presidency and CBN boss to steal money in the guise of printing new notes. It was strictly business. Now that an incoming government, they have increased the date.",

Because as president and Commander-in- Chief, na him get the final say on matters like this, without his approval CBN cannot commence with this useless policy. But Buhari approved of the policy, and even when APC governors were pleading with him to do something, baba kept mute and only agreed to make old 200 naira note legal tender again, the whole matter they confusing sev.Having said that, Supreme court don give their verdict, but since that day we never hear anything official from the CBN nor the presidency, even if Supreme court talk say make the old 200, 500 and 1000 naira notes become legal tender again until Dec 31, we still need the CBN to release the old notes wey them been collect, because as e be so there is little or no old notes in circulation.

The update wey you drop make sense well, i been no they aware say banks don they reissue the old 1000, 500 and 200 naira notes back into circulation, or maybe banks for my side never really start, but i they sure say very soon all banks go begin mass reissuing of the old notes, the problem now na why the presidency and the CBN never talk anything, tbh i don they believe say Buhari they like to implement policies wey go make Nigerians to the suffer, because if no be so ehn, tell me why since Supreme court give their verdict e never talk anything, even the CBN governor just they mute. These our leaders just they show us everyday say we they live for lawless country, and if e continue like this, people no go see any need to they go court again to seek redress on any issue, them go just take matters into their own hands.",

There is nothing Supreme about the supreme court because their ruling keeps getting flouted and ignored by the people in power.

You would think they have the people and the economy of the nation at heart with the whole speech by the CBN governor and president, but when you look deeply you would see that it is a case of political witch-hunting",
