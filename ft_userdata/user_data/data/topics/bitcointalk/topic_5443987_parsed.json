  "content": "Something caught my attention lately and I haven't been able to shake it out of my mind. It is this topic, but I don't know if it has been discussed here.It concerns gambling advertising and its impact on gambling addiction.Here's my take:It is rather common to have ads pop up without warning on ones smart phone, tvs, but mostly when using apps and visiting sites that require ad permission before it functions properly.Have you for once ever stopped to observe the kind of ads that pop up?I did some shallow digging and found others who shared same concern. Here's a snippet:Quote'The prominence of gambling ads in the media are an issue for many reasons, including the fact that these ads target people who are most vulnerable to gambling ads. For example, people who show interest in gambling-related topics, such as sports, are more likely to be targeted with ads about sports betting.Studies have also shown that people with gambling problems report more exposure and impact from gambling advertising. Once a player places a bet online, betting companies collect the player’s activity data, and tailor their offers to the specific player. 'From my own screen observation, I have had more frequency of ads on gambling online, casino gambling, sports betting and the likes pop up more than I can count. Literally everytime I try to download movies or even apps, mostly some apps that use crypto exchanges for payments, these ads just pop up until I perform my instant magic of refreshing and canceling before they stop.The gambling adverts and mouth watering bonuses even run on tv commercials too.For someone who has stopped gambling or undergoing the process to quit gambling, perhaps for bad reasons of sure, these ads that pop up about gambling and their bonuses, is a big trigger with the urge to gamble on without a damn for quitting.*How does someone who intends to stop gambling control these ads or stop them from popping up or seeing it on tv?Visit reference link for more:https://www.algamus.org/blog/gambling-ads-problem-gambling",

Anytime you watch on such videos, there is no way you will not be exposed to that kind of advertisements, unless the government of the country warns people not to advertise gambling companies that way. Another one are on TV channels. Like 5 years ago, I was annoyed to see the most known gambling site on many TV channels advertising the gambling site. Not only that, also that the most popular reality show in my country is also advertising the gambling site. I do not know what you can do about that, but for children, you can use parental care so that your children will not be able to watch such channels as it would require pin which you will not tell them.As for the gambling sites that do pop up while browser, you can use ublock origin to block it. There are many browsers with built-in ad blockers today too. Only what you just have to do is to block ads which is also good against malware and many types of scam.Even on this sites, if you are an addict and going through self-exclusion and rehabilitation program, you can at that time disable ads and signature campaign ads on this forum as well.",

So in my opinion, stopping gambling advertisements from being seen on television channels or on social media platforms will never happen, especially if the gambling companies are legal.",

There's no way to stop it since there's no law that will control gambling advertisements. Also if I personally avoiding gambling, I will definitely stay away on my computer since online gambling is one click away and that gambling ads is just least of my concern when I'm online and avoiding gambling on every form. We can't blame the ads to target gambler. The gambler itself should be the one to make away to avoid those things.",

In principle, I think adapting plays a big role in gambling advertisements that appear so we don't get addicted.",

I use the brave browser to block annoying ads, but I'm not sure that it can prevent us from gambling ads, sometimes there are some close friends who play gambling near us and in the end we fall into it, but it all comes back to ourselves want to play or not.",

I'm pretty sure most people versed on the net know that the ads that mostly show up on your browsers are ads that are deeply related to the stuff you search about. OR, you can find a good adblocker. As for television, I reckon you can just watch online, the amount of ads there is deeply reduced and if you were waiting for news channel stuff, then most likely they also won't have gambling-related ads. Well if you're also like me, who's mobile number is(was) pretty much known to all damn casino marketing teams (I get bloody casino messages almost everyday), then you might also want to change contact numbers or something.",

Gambling is almost now a general activity so even if you managed to somehow find a way to control the ads that you receive on your mobile phone and television,  it will be difficult to control other external factors like people talking about gambling around you, and you coming across gambling advertisements that you have no control over. So learn to control yourself, or seek professional help.",

If it is gambling site, then obviously it is to attract plaers into their platform. But that should not mean that platforms are encouraging addiction; it depends on the individual. Gambling sites are just doing their thing; in the first place there are countries wherein such activity is legal. The activity itself is not the problem, but people with bad ideologies of how gambling works. Once a player is hooked up with the idea of being rich in quickest way possible, then that is where addiction would arise.Adjustments should be done primarily with players and not to gambling sites or even land based casinos, alone. We have different industries and casinos are just making a living on their industry.",

Otherwise we could even say opened land based casinos are the reason why people get addicted, because they were influenced by the curiosity of seeing these shops opened, entered, started playing and got addicted.I believe to blame ads is a way to get rid of personal responsabilities over our own acts. Misleading propaganda is another matter and should be banned, though.",

If you were around during the ico and IEO then you will understand when something is the talk of the town as they say. Just maybe gambling and gamble is the talk of this time.Question to answer is how many signature campaigns are running through gambling companies and how many others are existing that are not through gambling companies. Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on March 08, 2023, 11:23:12 AMIt concerns gambling advertising and its impact on gambling addiction.As far as we can discuss this, I don't think we can do anything about this and like I was making a point above, the gambling business is fast growing and such companies scout for customers everywhere, moreover social media is the first soft spot because it is the abode of the young people who are mostly first line customers. One of the factors that have made social media grow very rapidly is the smart phone technology and so gambling companies like I said reach out to customers via smart phones to market themselves easily through their ads. Regarding addiction to gambling, I think it is a decision to click and follow the directions of any ads. You have the instructions to follow and provide certain information or data like names, email address etc, so you can actually stop or resist it at a point if you don't want to.",
