And now there are more countries replicating his stance like Brazil?Yes, Donald Trump’s move to make bitcoin a national reserve will attract a lot of countries to follow in its footsteps. The US government is a very strong one and a nation that has a more pivotal control and decision on bitcoin adoption all around the globe. It baffles me before, but now I’m no longer worried to see countries following in the footsteps of US.QuoteAnd as there any more countries going to follow what US has set? For sure as Bitcoin enthusiast, we love to see this kind of news and we all know that we have a lot of Brazilians too in this community.  This is great news and it’ll even become a more greater news of all this are passed into law and actively working. More countries will follow in their footsteps and that will bring some sigh of hope to the bitcoin community. For sure, these are the types of news we always love to hear about bitcoin.",

I believe countries are now seeing the advantages Bitcoin offers them and they will benefit more adopting Bitcoin than trying to be against it. I see some people giving Donald Trump credit for this, even though I believe US is a world power and has influence on other countries decisions, I would still recognise Salvador's contribution in all of this and I think other countries are seeing how the impact of their decision is favouring them.So I think Brazilians should just keep their fingers crossed and hope this bill is accepted and passed to law but I am very sure this would benefit them as a nation.",

And yes, some people made a visit and have a tour in their country. And if the US will be more vocal in terms of supporting this technology owed to the new SEC Chair, I highly believe that people will talk and will possibly change their stance over the crypto market.But we should not oblige people to take a look on this market and force them to believe because it is only a matter of time before they realize on their own the benefits of this new market.",

I guess this is another good development in the scene and provably once this countries will successfully made this action to happen more countries will also follow what they do.Can't imagine on where we are heading in terms of price turn out of more demands coming and lucky for those people who decide to hold since provably that they would earn more if more situation like this will be implemented.Looking for more good development to come in future.",

And now there are more countries replicating his stance like Brazil?Possibly, they're trying to do it even before Trump gets into office so, they're following the trend. I think that this is one of the best things in the world nowadays. We'd see country after country trying to make a law for their nation like this bitcoin reserve. Countries that will have it won't just have a gold reserve but also will have a bitcoin reserve. Are we going to see the race for who's going to accumulate the most of it? maybe we're already on that era and narrative and that's why the price will shoot not just for this bull run but this will be continuous.Quote from: Jating on November 26, 2024, 07:05:05 PMAnd as there any more countries going to follow what US has set?

I will say it's already news since it has been proposed already. The only difference will be that when it's passed ruling and the majority votes in its favour, then we will talk about it being good news and not just any old news.  We, it's good to see countries making such bold steps; Trump has opened ways for them, and once one finally starts the accumulation process for the reserve, which I believe will happen anytime soon, then more of this kind of proposal will keep on popping up.",

I mean it's a win-win so why not do it today? still not late even though we are aiming for a $100k price in this bull run.This is government though, they can simply put some money on them without thinking and then go on the next 4 years and see how it goes. Microstrategy has proven a point already, that buying and having a Bitcoin reserved is good as it can make a huge profits in Billions of dollar. So it's very effective method so why not do it by Brazil and other poor countries as well?",

There is also a Wikipedia site about him.He's part of the Partido Liberal (PL), which is currently in opposition to the government, but on the other hand it's the currently biggest bloc in the Lower House. This makes it probably unlikely for this law to be approved, but also not totally irrelevant.The PL was one of the parties who supported the former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is aligned internationally with Trump. It is thus likely that they want to capitalize locally from Trump's promise of a strategic reserve.Seeing the distribution of parties in the Chamber of Deputies, if they could unite all opposition parties and independents behind the project, then the law would be approved, as the center-left government coalition has no absolute majority and thus can't block it.I was also interested if the Brazilian mainstream media took note of the project. There seem to be few articles but at least I found this one (not very detailed, my Portuguese is not very good though).",

I don't know if it is enough to be worried, but we'll see what happens if the U.S. and other countries create a strategic BTC reserve.It is indeed a shift from the norm of keeping seized Bitcoin. The government is waking up to the fact that the Bitcoin national race has begun and they don't want it be left behind. The market is not restrictive, there are no avenues to stop the government from acquiring as much Bitcoin as they can. So we have to accept the fact that a large amount of Bitcoin will end up in the custody of centralized bodies.",

However, locals have more reasons to feel exciting with this new and this proposal bill than we as people from other countries.They as locals, understand more about their government, law and things are going on than outsiders like us. I agree with you that we will need to wait for opinions from locals in Brazil, and perhaps @bitmover will join this discussion with his opinion and more information for us.",
