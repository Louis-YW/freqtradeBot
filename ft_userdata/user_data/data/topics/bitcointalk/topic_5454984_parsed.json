It is good to tell our children about bitcoin in their tender ages but destiny is not something you force someone to achieve. There's no \"destiny\" involved (unless you're still treating Bitcoin like some sort of get-rich-quick scheme, in which case, you probably aren't fit to procreate and should avoid reproducing at all).  It's more to do with highlighting the perils of conventional wisdom.  Teach them the dangers of fiat and endless money-printing.  When traditional finance make their usual indoctrination play that \"the safest place for your money is in the bank\", make sure they're well informed of the potential pitfalls when banks hold that much influence.  Arm them with the knowledge that debt-based money is a zero-sum game and a certain threshold of people must go bankrupt in order for the system to continue to function.",

Just teach them how to save money, privacy and security, just a basic of life. Then if they're interested in Bitcoin, just teach them about centralization and decentralization, if they're don't like decentralization, they let them pick their choice to rely on a centralization.They will learn after the centralized site disappointed them e.g. bank bankrupt and they're need to follow a complicated steps to recover their money.",

Expose them to dancing and singing. Expose them to a lot of them. But teach them about personal finance and financial literacy. Break it down to their own level of understanding. In the same vein tell them about cryptocurrency and bitcoin. There are children's books for it. That way, they will grow up to be well rounded kids. And then, support whatever paths they choose to follow.",

As parents we can just guide them to the right direction without interfering.But as far as bitcoin goes, yeah, you can maybe give an eye opener about it to your children, and who knows, maybe down the line they themselves will give involved on it an for sure you will be a happy parent.",

Everyone has the freedom to choose whether or not to be involved with Bitcoin. Moreover, I think it may not be suitable to introduce young children to Bitcoin at a very early age. They should have to enjoy their childhood and engage in age appropriate activities rather than focusing on complex concepts like Bitcoin.Perhaps, when they reach a certain level of maturity you can start sharing interesting stories about Bitcoin and explore ways to spark their interest. However, if you notice that they show no interest it is best to respect their preferences and allow them to pursue what makes them happy.",

We can only introduce it without forcing them to choose it. we introduce and let them decide whether they are interested or not.And actually I'm pretty sure when they get old enough they'll figure this out for themselves about Bitcoin.

It’s not for the sake of drawing BTC-logo in the sand (like here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5454816.msg62341207#msg62341207) to talk about it, right. It is better to introduce children to bitcoin closer to a conscious age and better, within the framework of the topic of money, finance, investments. Some conversations may not be enough to interest. It is more productive if you, as a parent, show your bitcoin hobby by personal example, and even better if you create tasks for the child that will need to be solved with the help of btc. The simplest example: give a friend a birthday present with bitcoin (which may indirectly interest btc his friend too). It is possible that your child will not become a bitcoin enthusiast, but will at least be aware of the btc basics and be able to use them. Someday, this knowledge may be useful to him, as the need arises. There is no need to impose btc on anyone, including children, but you simply must familiarize him if you are thinking about his future.",

I must say that parents should not force their children to do a thing that they're not interested in, but if parents allow the children to do the things they like then most of the children would either be watching social media reels day and night or they might be playing the games like Pubg mobile most of the time. It's the responsibility of the parents to guide their children towards good things, and without proper direction children won't be able to decide that what's good for them and what's not. In case of Bitcoin I must say that the parents should discuss about it with their children and at the same time they would tell them the story of the two Pizzas that were bought for 10000BTC, so that they can develop some interest toward leaning about a currency that was very cheap in 2010 and in 2020 the price was really high that 10000BTC would be a treasure of wealth for someone. I'm against forcing children to do the things that their parents want them to do, but if you treat your children as your friends then you would discuss such great things with them as a friend discusses things with their friends. If your children are mature enough and they want to learn about Bitcoin then it's a must thing to teach them about it. You'll be very happy when you see your children adopting to a technology that could make their future better and would help them to learn about economics without even studying the discipline.",

I don't know why children below have to rush to be taught about bitcoin even though it's clear their abilities won't get there whereas in the sense of bitcoin it's quite complicated especially if the child doesn't like it from an early age then it's better to let him grow bigger and decide what you want.I'm sure if he is old enough he will know about the environment and also their finances so they will later decide after graduating from school or college it's better to prioritize education first when it comes to teaching about bitcoin then at that age he will definitely understand and have drawn conclusions her about her career.",
