  "content": "According to a report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission [1], PayPal held $604 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, as of December 31, 2022. Bitcoin is the largest part of PayPal's crypto holdings, accounting for $291 million. Ethereum was second, with $250 million, and the remaining $63 million was split between Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. PayPal's crypto holdings accounted for 67% of the company's total financial liabilities of $902 million. The company's total financial assets were over $25 billion. Despite offering cryptocurrency services for more than two years, this is the first time PayPal has provided a breakdown of its crypto holdings in its annual financial report. An article on Cointelegraph [2] reports that PayPal keeps its customers' cryptocurrencies through the use of a third-party custodian. The company emphasized in the filing that it has a contractual agreement in place with the custodian mandating the segregation of customer assets and prohibiting their mix with the custodian's proprietary or other assets. However, PayPal stated that they cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these contractual obligations in the event of the custodian's bankruptcy or insolvency.I'm not sure whether PayPal has enabled the withdrawal of cryptocurrency funds to personal wallets for all users. However, it appears that many still don't fully grasp the significance of the adage \"not your keys, not your coins.\"[1] - https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001633917/b562e712-8266-493c-8ae8-e28f93404d2f.pdf[2] - https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-held-604m-in-bitcoin-and-other-crypto-by-the-end-of-2022",

It is true for Paypal and Paypal users too. Both Paypal and Paypal users don't have keys of cryptocurrency and what Paypal users get is only a digital number credited to their accounts. The actual cryptocurrency amount is hold by a third-party custodian company, not Paypal.Risk to see the contract broken by that third-party custodian company is real. You can use Paypal to buy cryptocurrency if you don't want to use other platforms but withdraw your cryptocurrency to your non custodial wallets instantly after your deal on Paypal is done.",

However, it appears that many still don't fully grasp the significance of the adage \"not your keys, not your coins.\"Actually many people or crypto users knows about this line but still prefer to rely to these financial institutions (kyc required) because of so many reasons including laziness, no sense of responsibility, victims of false security and many more. That's why institutions like this still running and lots of users than non-custodial users. Well, with the previous shutting down of different institutions lots of these users lost their funds which is one of the risks of using them and the ideal reasons why \"not your keys, not your coins\" line exists.",

      "body": "So if you buy bitcoin via PayPal, then you don't even have an IOU like you do at a centralized exchange, but you have an IOU of an IOU. Some unknown third party promises to pay PayPal x amount of bitcoin, and PayPal promise to then pay you that amount of bitcoin. Somehow, they have made buying bitcoin involve even more third parties than using a bank, rather than the zero third parties bitcoin was designed for. That's so awful it's almost impressive.The SEC document is very clear, though - coins are not yours, PayPal have absolutely no idea how secure or not the coins are or what the unnamed third party is doing with the coins, and in the event of bankruptcy/scams/hacks/whatever you will almost certainly get nothing back (just like the users of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, etc.). No doubt when it all comes crashing down then just like every other centralized exchange in the past few months there will be plenty of angry users who did not bother to read any of this and realize what they were signing up to.",

Here it is:Quote from: https://paxos.com/2019/03/29/general-terms-and-conditions/Crypto assets are not legal tender, are not backed by the government, and accounts and values are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.So, doesn't sound like they are insured at all.And in regards to their \"bankruptcy-remote accounts\", here is another quote:Quote from: https://paxos.com/2019/03/29/itbit-terms-and-conditions/All crypto assets transferred to us by Members for use in trading on the Exchange are deposited by the Exchange into, and are held in, an omnibus client account, controlled by the Exchange. The Exchange enables Members to offer a trade at a given price, or to accept a trade at a price that another Member has offered. When the Exchange matches orders of its users (i.e., a Member accepts a trade offered by another Member), a trade occurs. This trade transfers ownership between users and is reflected in adjustments to Membersâ fiat currency and crypto asset balances on our ledger. All trading activity on the Exchange is âoff-chainâ and is not broadcast to the applicable blockchain. Â So any crypto is held in an \"omnibus\" account, and if you make a trade, all that is updated is your balance on Paxos' internal systems. Which is obviously the complete opposite to holding everyone's funds in separate \"bankruptcy-remote\" accounts, whatever that is supposed to mean.This is the exact same behavior we saw with FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager, etc. Claim in big letters on their main pages and all over social media that all funds are safe, insured, protected, collateralized, whatever, while their Terms of Service reveal that actually that is all complete lies and your coins are being spent and gambled.Quote from: mk4 on February 13, 2023, 06:34:08 AMLove em or hate em and call them centralized all you want, but at least BNB, TRX, and SOL are more usefull than both LTC and BCH.I don't own any LTC, but at least they are making interesting developments with mimblewimble.
