The guy is a scammer and scammed someone for $34. For some reason, you received two merits, and both came from TheChin0s. Quote from: alterra57 on July 03, 2023, 11:36:04 AMEscrow?I need around $50 in PayPal. Escrow for such a small transaction doesn't worth it. But if you can manage free escrow, I have no problem. I was looking for a 1:1 Ratio. However, I seek someone with a solid reputation who won't dispute later!I will send it up front.",
