There are a lot of posts that are referenced and yet given merits.Every reasonable person would know that whenever you borrow someone's work or idea, the need to reference and acknowledge the original author is important. Else it would otherwise be considered as theft. Although not everyone is aware of these and that's why there's need to formally educate them, because some of them do it out of ignorance and mediocrity but still suffer the consequences because ignorance of the law isn't an excuse. So they should be fully educated on these facts in order to avoid being penalized and claiming they were ignorant of the situation.Quote from: Churchillvv on November 21, 2023, 09:53:36 AMYou dey correct for this things wey you write so, and you make am look very interesting to write am for our native language wey be pidgin language but I for like may you wey don write am so make you teach less rather learn and practice this things wey you teach so.

I have seen instances of quoting a sentence or paragraph from an article or post of another person without adding the link to the entire article. There are some that also use quotation mark to indicate that certain phrases are not theirs but taken from somewhere. I think these are valid ways of avoiding being associated with plagiarism because you have indicated they were taken from somewhere and not your original idea. I don't know if you think otherwise regarding this.

There are a lot of posts that are referenced and yet given merits.This is true and a major problem for them. They struggle so hard to impress their audience and sometimes forgetting that giving credit to owners of the original ideas is the best way to impresses the audience. In academic writing,  a chapter is usually dedicated to references which is a repository of the materials and sources used in the particular study. This shows they understand the importance of giving credits to whom it is due.",
