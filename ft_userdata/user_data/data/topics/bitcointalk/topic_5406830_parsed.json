  "content": "NFT BETTING CLUB(NBC) is new and unique collection on Ethereum network. It consists of 777 NFT-s which are entry tickets to closed Discord group which will provide best informations in betting world.We are gambling syndicate who are in business over 13 years and cover different spheres of betting.From tipsters,bots, valuebets,surebets up to classified informationsÂ    Besides those services, we will also provide daily satellite feeds in our Discord groups which are suitable for latebetting. Each of 777 holders of our entry ticket will have personalised approach and we will help them with selection of their local sportsbooks, advices and much more!Before we point you to our socials, lets first write why did we decide for this approach in first place. Firstly, we are interested in finding more partners all over the globe as beating the bookmakers is getting harder by each passing day. Secondly, we believe that NFT will connect us as a group and bring profits for everyone. As profits from our members increase, as well as group DAO, also will value of our NFT-s which will be benefitial for all of our holders.The biggest issue in betting is that bookmakers can do whatever they want. They can limityour account in anytime they see suitable, they can take your money(even deposit) and ask bunch of documents which legally they shouldn't be able to.There is no one governing body against them all, \"wild\" gaming licences like Malta are cheap and beacuse of profits they bring them, they are always on the side of the bookmakers. If you have a dispute in UK, you can complain to IBAS but whole process is slowand tiring and you are left without even your deposits for years.Of course, it happens when you start winning.New people who start to bet lack informations. These bookmakers are making so much money that they took over even sites and forums which should be independent and help bettors. Sadly, lot of sites like https://www.sportsbookreview.com/, which were created to representbettors against bookmakers and be their voice, have changed their allegiance. They get lot of money from affiliate links(marketing method of bookmakers where if the bettor registers over their site, they get % of bettors losses), lot of money from advertising and lot of moneyfor giving better rank for some bookmakers.We can see on Serie A and Champions league football matches lot of ads from 1xbet which is known as most fraudelant bookmaker of them all.They is just one example where bettor would be \"lured\" into the trap. He would see ad on the match, consider it strong bookmaker as have moneyto advertise on such level and in end lose even his deposit.Another example of bettors being scamemd are on forums. When bettor makes a complain, bookmakers have large number of bots who make lot of postjust to change subject and put the topic of bettor in history. We have lot of disputes with bookmakers and lot of evidences to confirm these claims.   Biggest difference between us and them is that we fight against bookmakers. We are bettors for many years and we are still making big money despitetheir progress and monopol which Sportradar now clearly has. Value of our NFT will grow over the time because holders will profit from informations we give. Following our roadmap, in few months time we will launch Meta Sportsbook/Casino as well and holders of NBC will have a free mint which is extra benefit. We stand together against the bookmakers!Where:https://twitter.com/NFTBettingClubWebsite/Discord will be released in upcoming days.When: TBA, start of AugustHow many:777 What to do in meantime: Follow our Twitter/Discord for free tips from our tipsters,insiders, satellite feeds and competitions with rewards",

Yes I too donâ€™t want to get involved in a service which operates on Discord.It doesnâ€™t at all shows professionalism when coming to userâ€™s experience.I too like to advice all my fellow gamblers to do a great research before taking any bit steps.Moreover OP this section of the forum belongs to the organisation or sites or games that deals with Bitcoins and itâ€™s network. I can see that you integrate ETH network only. So it would be better if you can move this thread to Altcoins(Marketplace) Section of the forum.",

      "body": "Let me answer few questions to give you a closer look into what we do:I understand that many people doubt NFT's as such and consider most of them Ponzi scheme. I partially agree, but you cannot deny that there are lot of people who made money out of it, lot of EXCELLENT recognized projects and it brought more good to crypto space than bad.Secondly, yes we admit that we are betting group. We don't make group bets on same bookmakers so we don't violate their terms. We only exchange our ides, insiders, tips and more so mutually we all profit.Difference between us and lot of other NFT-s is that we actually generate profit for holders. We aren't piece of art or advertise our utilities(like t-shirts etc) but we offer our holders chance to make money and learn how to profit in betting. There is a big difference between betting and gambling and everyone in the business knows it. There are and will be tutorials how to do surebet,value bet, how to do latebetting, what to pay attention when making a bets from new accounts, which bookmakers to avoid etc.. So as our holders will make profit, value of NFT will rise aswell and create extra profit.Considering Discord and Twitter, it's the easiest way to promote in the NFT space. Also, Discord is good for our levels and for video streaming. Yesterday we offered satellite feed from South American football match and people could see goal and on some bookies make a bet on over goals or next goal. It's easiest to maintain and best for video sharing for such number of holders.We encourage everyone to do own research, especially on this forum where so many fraudelent bookmakers got own space and good grade.... we encourage youTo check discord, check twitter. We have losses on our tipsters aswell and we don't try to hide it as we already explained that they bring monthly profit,some days can be loss. Don't judge us before checking it out.",

But my doubts concerns your history @nftbettingclub how do you manage to prove your experience in this sector and your results? I see just a newbie that is claiming some stuffs... anyone can say they have achieved a certain result but as we know well in this crypto world... we always say \"don't trust verify\" Can I give you a suggestion? I would offer free admissions to well-known forum users who are able to give their opinion without bias and write a review. it's the only way to have some reputation. Otherwise I find it really risky to invest time and resources in such a project",

It has been hyped months or around a year ago and a lot of investors from it has been successful. On the other hand, there will always be users if there are winners some/most of them lost a lot of money when NFTs went down trend. For future, we can't tell what might happen, maybe those who lost can still have some hope and wait for their NFTs to have greater value than it is today.",

      "body": "I am not here to argue with you if Telegram and Discord are full of scammers as I am also quite aware of the facts.I have been using Telegram for years and on one honest person there is dozen of scammers.Why we use Discord? Answer is quite simple: Because NFT crowd are our targeted users. We want to spread beyond Telegram and contacts we already have and we noticed that NFT guys are quite good workers. They have no problems working 0/24 to do quick flips and make some bucks, to program bots etc and they have financial capacity to bet aswell.As all of NFT-s are working on Discord and Twitter, logical move was to do the same.And to answer question why we are integrating NFT, if you even checked the site, you would know the answer . Firstly it's to get clients, secondly serious partners who can get job offers with us(scouts at stadiums, runners at shops,workers) and thirdly its about another phase of our project in which we plan to open Metaverse casino/Sportsbook with our users as shareholders.So take your time, check the Twitter and ask whatever you want as I am here for your questions.Besides, we made over 7,2 units of profit today. It means that if you staked each match 100â‚¬, you would profit around 720â‚¬.To \"celebrate\" it and promote ourselves more on Twitter, we are organising a little giveaway, so it's worth checking out!https://twitter.com/NFTBettingClub/",
