  "content": "What an unexpected character arc for his story. Much of us who follow the news and the occurrences in the cryptospace more closely would certainly speculate that these characters would go buy a yacht and live a rich life or they might go to prison like Sam Bankrupt-Fried. However, not dumping Dan. He found Jesus and the bible hehehehe.Time is running out, #ww3 is here and with it the tribulation and judgment. All of creation testifies of our Creator. Seek Yeshua / Jesus before it’s too late.  Repent, ask for forgiveness and accept His sacrifice as a covering of our sin.Sudden destruction will befall the world and billions will die in a moment.  You could die at any time so make sure you put your faith in the only name by which we can be saved.Crypto currency cannot save us, the corrupt governments of the world will burn everything down before giving up their power. So if you reject Yeshua / Jesus then be prepared for global chaos and one world currency and tyranny.Source https://twitter.com/bytemaster7/status/1700013950522269996",
