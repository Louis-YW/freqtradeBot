  "content": "Satoshi Nakamoto holds 980,000 Bitcoins.. does anyone know their addresses so we know if he/she/they are active in the market? I would guess Bitcoin is their baby and they wouldn't do anything to manipulate the prices and hurt Bitcoin. But would they be taking corrective measures to fight off some of the other whales? Its kinda weird question but interesting to me if Satoshi Nakamoto is still \"alive\" and watching.",

All the bitcoins thought to be owned by satoshi are still held by the addresses in the coinbase transactions of the blocks that he mined. That means that there are 10 - 20 thousand addresses thought to be controlled by satoshi. The addresses in question are known (that's where the estimates comes from) and I suppose there are people watching them.",

This case is just like any automobile vehicle maker or producer who can not or never control the driver during driving saved precautionary safety advise or Driving method analysis to avoid/shun accidents or dangers that may likely occur.",

Thank you for sharing in this topic. I am also curious, right now what is the actual balance that Satoshi has?No one knows for sure since his holdings are split up over thousands of addresses. Satoshi himself mined the earliest blocks and hasn't moved the coins yet. However, with that being said, Satoshi Likely wasn't the only miner in early 2009. There had to have been a few extra anonymous early miners and they too likely never moved the coins they mined and disregarded their private keys. I mean back then Bitcoins were worthless and at the time it seemed just like a cool tech experiment/proof of concept.",
