  "content": "Today I'm happy to soft-launch a product I've been working on for quite a while. The core service I have is quite robust, and ready for real production use. Before a hard-launch, I'd like to get in contact with any (new or existing) casinos who might be interested. We have devised a clever little ceremony that allows us (a third party) to participate in a casinos provably fair game result generation. We call our service Vx (short for Verified-By). After careful design we ensure the following guarantees:The player is able to verify their games (all provably fair guarantees are preserved!)Vx is able to verify all games (immediately!)The casino does not need to trust a player (aka the status-quo)The casino does not need to trust VxA player and Vx can not conspire to cheat the casinoA player and the casino can not conspire to trick VxThe Benefits to the PlayerUnder a standard provably fair system, if a player is cheated, the burden falls on them to validate their games meticulously—an often technical task that fewer than 1 in 10,000 players undertake. Furthermore, even if a player identifies cheating, they lack tangible evidence to present. Claims against casinos typically are baseless, which makes any legitimate complaint without evidence difficult to present. With the introduction of Actually Fair, players gain a third-party who can verify their games on their behalf, without compromising the players' ability to validate the games independently, should they question Actually Fair's credibility.The Benefits to the CasinoOperating an online casino can be slightly terrifying. With so many possible exploit vectors, it's almost impossible to be totally confident in the security of your system. And to make matters worse, exploits can (and most often are) totally undetected/undetectable. Would a casino really notice if your cloud-hosting provider had a malicious employee that peeked at its server seed and proceded to carefully use it?Our service, Vx, provided massive security benefits by actively contributing to game outcomes. Thus, even if the casino's security is entirely compromised, Vx maintains a record of its transactions. This allows casino owners to conduct independent audits and reconcile the findings with their actual revenue. This newfound insight provides unprecedented assurance. Never again question if a players win was legitimate or not. Know.The Potential ChallengesThe most notable drawback lies in the fact that Vx becomes an essential component in the casino's game betting pathway. This means that for every single bet, the casino must communicate with Vx. If Vx's service suffers from any delay or disruption, all bets will be affected correspondingly. This is something we take very seriously, and have put a huge amount of effort on. We have designed our system to shard, so we can offer every casino their own dedicated service that is hosted physically close to their servers.For more information check us out at https://actuallyfair.com and don't hesitate to get in touch",

It's more of an alternative way of doing provably fair (while still being provably fair) that allows 3rd party auditing. It's unfortunately not compatible with existing provably fair systems, so it's not simply just a verification tool",

      "body": "Quote from: hopenotlate on August 22, 2023, 08:40:23 PMThanks for chiming in. Your explanation about the \"trilemma\"  that the system you have set up solves makes completely sense.May you please explain a bit more in details PH offer more guaranteee to dice game ( what do you mean by atomic?) than crash?Crash is actually quite a difficult to do well, because it's a \"realtime\" game, latency really matters. And because it's multiplayer, you have to keep progressing the game for everyone.There's a demo here of how to do crash with ProvablyHonest ( https://github.com/provablyhonest/vx-demo/blob/master/crash.ts )  but basically the casino simply \"finds out\" what the bust is at the *start* of the game (in a way that is provably fair, and wouldn't allow PH to cheat). Then the crash game happens, and then casino reveals the information to PH to show they computed the outcome correctly.So the main advantage here, is from the casinos point of view: They don't need to worry as much about storing a highly secret \"master seed\" that if ever was leaked/looked-at would compromise all their games. They only find out the outcome just at the start of the game. But they still need to keep that a secret during the actual game. It would be trivial for the casino to have a bug which leaked the crash-outcome during the game. And this bug could be maliciously entered by a hacker / compromised-employee / backdoor etc.A more atomic game, like dice, however ProvablyHonest does a much better job at. (code eg. https://github.com/provablyhonest/vx-demo/blob/master/dice.ts ). That is because the casino sends all the bet information (who is betting, how much they're betting, what they're betting on) to PH first and then it gets the outcome. Then it verifies the outcome (to make sure PH is not cheating). This is a much \"nicer\" design, because the casino never has a secret they need to store. They can't accidentally leak anything, because they never know it. Even if their software was compromised, the attacker can't really do anything that's not detectible.",
