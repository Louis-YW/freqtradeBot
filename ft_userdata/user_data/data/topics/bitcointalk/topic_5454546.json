My friends are excited and have already started stacking up more Bitcoin in optimistic anticipation that when the price increases as has been predicted already that they will be able to take profits or their return on investment would be 150%.

With the current nature of the cryptocurrency market where competition is stiff between Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrency no one knows if the demand for Bitcoin would increase which in turns increases the price. No one knows if there would be some crazy regulations somewhere that would affect the price. No one knows if some crypto firm that is already over leveraged would declare bankruptcy within that time and then Bitcoin's price doesn't rise more than 5%. We are all acting in good faith that everything would run smoothly, we'd take profits and everyone is happy in the end. This sounds so pessimistic but haven't you thought about it like this too? The what ifs and what if nots?",

There will always be people that will lose a trade even when talking about a long-term hold. Also taking note that Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets are no-where near deserve to be called efficient or \"smooth\". It's one of the most inefficient markets out there due to how undervalued useful things are and how overvalued crappy things are.",

Block rewards are going to be halved, and I'd have been happy to keep 6.25 BTC of block reward for a few more years   I'm half-joking, it would obviously be contradictory to sincerely want that, I see every halving as being extremely positive for the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin, which is one of its essences after all.Quote We are all acting in good faith that everything would run smoothly, we'd take profits and everyone is happy in the end. I don't agree with that. Those who understand the market objectively understand very well that nothing can ever be taken for granted, and will be the opposite of thinking that the market is smooth and predictable. Nobody knows, only those who don't understand their investments are 100% sure of themselves. Even if the previous halvings and the following 12 months (especially) have produced great results in terms of FIAT value, we have no guarantee that this is a foregone conclusion.QuoteThis sounds so pessimistic but haven't you thought about it like this too? The what ifs and what if nots?1 BTC = 1 BTC, this is the only real answer, no matter what is happening. I am like you, I would like to see a BTC with a high usd value, but this is not the priority. The only priority is to have access to more freedom from a financial point of view. If BTC is high in terms of fiat value, great, we could be rich, if not, it wouldn't matter after all.",

No one knows if there would be some crazy regulations somewhere that would affect the price. Firstly I don’t think bitcoin is and will be threatened by the Alticoins. Bitcoin will certainly be in high demand towards the end of the year due to the upcoming halving, although alticoins will also follow suit since they also go bullish in direction proportion with bitcoin. But the demand for bitcoin will be higher because people will certainly be looking more into the safest and less risky option even if they are in for profit. The only thing that would be the stumbling block for bitcoin not to go fully bullish will be stiff regulations by many countries against it. But certainly with the news from China, it doesn’t seems that things would head in that direction, although the Chinese are just one country. Another thing could be a sever recession before halving which would prompt people into selling off their holdings, and that is not coming too soon according to economists.",

Bitcoin is not competing with other coins for investors. Bitcoin is the most safe cryptocurrency, everything else is a huge gamble with negative expected value. Altcoins to Bitcoin is what penny stocks are to Apple. #1 reason why the bull run could be underwhelming is the fact that over 95% of the total supply is already mined, so further reduction of emission plays smaller and smaller role in forming market supply. The holders who missed their chance to dump at $60k+ the last time will do it now if the price will fail to skyrocket past that level.",

The what ifs and what if nots?Your friends seem more optimistic to have started investing in bitcoin and so should be someone who has followed the history of the effect of bitcoin halving especially after during 6 months - 1 year. Before the past halvings, there has always been fud that tends to instill fear on investors but only the strong willed invest for the long run and afterwards benefit from it. For example during the 2016 halving, there was the China struggle announcing ban on ico and bitcoin transaction and that caused the fear then and bitcoin price fluctuated between $600 - $700 in  2016  and after one year in 2017, 17th December it got an ATH of $20,089. Quote2020–2021 bubbles. From 8 to 12 March 2020, the price of Bitcoin fell by 30 percent from $8,901 to $6,206. By October 2020, Bitcoin was worth approximately $13,200.Likewise we also remember the third halving was in 2020 which was characterized by COVID-19, despite all challenges of economic stagnation, it was believed that social distancing worked in favour of online digital marketing and advertising, that led to the growth of bitcoin to an ATH of $64k. The next halving is around April or May 2024 , with my experience so far I don't think fud stop bitcoin price from over taking its previous ATH before another halving.  So it is a choice to invest or stay out",

Very big in the past and will be smaller in future, it is what I believe about effects of future halvings on Bitcoin price.3.5x from a previous all time high, I don't know but it is if you look at it from a previous all time high. If you look at it from now, with price under $30,000 that is half of a current all time high. If in 2024 or 2025, Bitcoin rises to $120,000, it will be 3x from today price.

If you follow the historical data, you will notice that the price did not rise in an instant after a day/hour or even month after halving, and therefore your friends who buy bitcoin to sell it after the halving will need to wait more time.After 6-24 months of halving, the markets will begin to move to achieve some gains, and here is the perfect moment to enter the market as the profit potential is high, the loss is low and the wait is not long, perhaps after a year from now we will only see 10% profits, but inevitably after two years we will see Profits at a higher rate, so if you have a better investment opportunity, invest it and wait until after the Bitcoin halving for a quick return investment.Deeper thinking: In each cycle, the price increase takes longer, meaning that the hypothesis of 6 months after halving for new ATH is considered less likely compared to 12 months or 24 months.",
