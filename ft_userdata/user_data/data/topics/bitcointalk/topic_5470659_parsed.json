Many of those are unclear. So any community serious about assisting adoption need to help with the homework.PS The issue of whether these merchants will hold the cryptos they take, or instantly convert them to fiat, is pivotal. Lots to discuss here.IndiaMikeZulu",

Also, from customer side problem : most of customer still not really aware about the adoption crypto we still have a few generation (old & new).

I've just taken a look at altcoin prices right now in terms of Bitcoin. They're all falling down hard. That's what happens when Bitcoin becomes aggressive. The pros are the usual irreversibility, verifiability, P2P therefore fast unlike fiat payment modes, etc. The cons are the usual volatility, transaction fees, confirmation time, etc. But the Lightning network is already an option. 2 confirmations for small transactions are also good enough. For volatility, you only have to keep them for a while for the price to recover. But that requires that you can absorb a sleeping money in your business operation.",

Join the conversation and be part of this valuable discussion!Many people has adopted the system of cryptocurrency payments in their business even also in their working place and it continues to move fine, but it's only the people who is not a cryptocurrency minded will basically condemn the act of receiving a payments eith cryptocurrency, in my country I have seen some of the business people established that accepts cryptocurrency for a payment but I don't really know actually if statistics of payments with fiat cryptocurrency the one with fiat is higher than the one with cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency received more payments. But what I know is that cryptocurrency and especially bitcoin has viral to the extent the news of bitcoin it's almost across every nation even though they are not participating in the currency of bitcoin but they have heard of bitcoin, another thing that is making bitcoin not to have more domination is because of government.Because government of different countries do state negative about bitcoin when they have noticed that the citizens embrace bitcoin and they began to castigate the existence of bitcoin and also ban bitcoin, so except that act by some the government in some countries may employee or workers would have ask the government to pay them with bitcoin.. some people is still investing in cryptocurrency with same payments they receive through government,  after have been paid by the government they go to ATM machine to purchase bitcoin.",

But based on my observation here and in other place, a lot of business owners who have tight cashflow, are in need of quick and direct FIAT conversion. So, they accept it via third parties and do not necessarily store cryptocurrency. They simply just offering payment options to their customers. Also, in some cases, if the business only offers the option for the sake of goods payments, they rarely use the self-hosted option since it is not suitable and expensive. It just has a high commitment to manage and maintain that.",

Share your insights and let's discuss the pros and cons of crypto payments for businesses.It's a given that every modern business should adopt crypto option for payment just as they've for fiat. I believe every business has to move with the tide or be left behind. Anyone who's stuck on the old school way of doing business will sooner than later be affected by lack of patronage as their customers who are into cryptos are bound to move away from them and to those who accept cryptos.The ease and convenience of paying for goods in cashless economy rather than handing over physical cash can be compared to the ease of paying with cryptos over cashless payment with fiat. People want what can give them less stress accomplishing. What matters to me (I believe for many others too) during transactions is ease and convenience. For that, any business that offers me that convenience becomes my regular.– In addition, I can't remember the last time I made a physical deposit in a bank or a withdrawal inside a bank. That's fiat. Cryptos can do much more of what fiat is offering, even with ease.",

For organizations contemplating crypto payment gateways, insights on the necessity of education and access to reliable information are critical. Before incorporating cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin into their business, entrepreneurs must completely comprehend them and their possible ramifications. Business owners may make educated decisions about whether to accept crypto payments, reduce risks, and possibly tap into a rising market of crypto-savvy customers by educating themselves and accessing credible information. Furthermore, learning from the experiences of firms that have previously delved into crypto payments, such as Pouch.ph, Sats Cafe, and the local clothes apparel store, might give vital insights for those wanting to navigate this ever-changing financial environment efficiently.",

No, not now.For entrepreneurs considering crypto, you must study your jurisdiction's ever-changing legal complexities. Beyond a craze, cryptocurrencies constitute a financial paradigm change.

First of all, that's what we want. As long as there's a business that accepts it, that means another extension and means of adoption. But let's get to the real thing, not all customers are for the crypto payments. While it's good to have an alternative payment system for the customers especially those that you've got the same interest as theirs.But, despite you being an optimistic crypto guy and making good things like adopting it to your business. This means that you can't please everybody. There will be customers that will be against to it because they'll insert their belief that crypto isn't a thing or two for them and they're against on it. And as someone who runs the business, you'll just have to respect whatever they say to that initiative that you do for helping the adoption in your area.That's okay, not everyone will be happy with that but the thing here is that you are just adding another alternative payment system and for your customers to have more options while learning who amongst them that are also in crypto.",

It's not the same to investing where we need to pick the best cryptos because we can choose to convert the cryptos immediately to fiat. But it's better to just go on which crypto is popular. Bitcoin is obviously the first in the list, which will be followed by Ethereum (for those who are altcoin lovers).Adding LN is great for small users who will purchase lite items only. Cryptos are not a secret anymore. As long as we are on a crypto-friendly country, it's a great addition to the existing payment methods that we are already accepting because some people prefers it more than the other.",
