  "content": "Hello ladies and gentleman! Looks like I am the most recent victim of this scam. My story goes exactly as dozens before me. I was mining to this wallet for years. Its finally enough money to justify a more secure method of storage. I bought a Trezor hardware wallet and attempted to move my funds to the new wallet. Apparently trying to withdraw my coins was suspicious activity and got my account suspended. I jumped through all of the silly hoops to prove I am me and where the coins came from (mining). Now the ticket is sitting with the security team, and each time I ask for an update they say that they cant provide a time frame and that I should continue to wait. I asked for a phone number or address for Frewallet and they tell me that they cannot provide any of that information and the only way to contact them is through email. Currently at 38 emails and I still do not have my coins released. I have proven my identity, and provided transaction hashes for the dozens of transactions deposited into the wallet. Its at the point where there are no more \"gotcha\" questions and are now just telling me that my request is being processed. Please do yourself a favor and if you have and funds on this service remove it immediately and if you were thinking of using the service you should not walk, but run away.Your ticket ID is 456898",

      "body": "Here again yet another complaint and accusation. This is the second l have set my eyes upon within a short time interval today. It is unfortunate that you got scammed of your hard earned resources by this scammer. For the first time I saw the above trust feedback of them and from what I am seeing, it is being long time the scammer was active maybe they discovered that their tricks been exposed so the ran away. Your complaint and accusation against them is nothing different from the truth based on the findings here and reports coming in but if you can as well upload evidence for us to see that would also go along way to so that they can not counter your claims if they eventually show up to clean up their mess.",

There are already unresolved complaints on Freewallet and it goes back to 2017 every year there are more adding to these accusations this is why Freewallet never take down their website because they always have a supply of victims because people like OP love to use custodial wallets and are not doing their research.The whole Crypto community always warn against the use of custodial wallet but so many people still ignore these warnings they will only stop when they face problems like this.",
