You know that this is actually the most egregious type of offense for most casinos? Despite your probably honest reasons, so far the practice of multiple accounts has been linked to system abuse and in almost all cases unable to recover funds.",

Usually blockchain evidence considers as solid proves. A casino prohibits multi account for many reasons and one of the most important reason is to protect bonus abuse. But as you are claiming you have not took their bonus. It's better to hear their side of story.Let's wait for their forum profile to response.",

I would be frustrated waiting on a decision or my money as well, but you cannot just go breaking sites terms to please yourself. If I'm a site I would confiscate your funds as well because you obviously knew the rules and figured fuck it i'll get a refund if nothing else. ToS is there for a reason and that reason isn't so that you can work your way around it, no matter how much you bet.",

If at least sending back the initial deposit is fair, Yas I think should consider it.",

Since you already verified your account and admitted your mistake I don't see why they wouldn't process your withdrawal request.There is nothing you can do for the moment but to wait.
