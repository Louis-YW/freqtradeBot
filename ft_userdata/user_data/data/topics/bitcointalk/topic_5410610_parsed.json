  "content": "While cleaning out my Google Drive a few weeks ago, I came across this screenshot of an old wallet I had from blockchain back in 2015 October. Around this time I was gambling Bitcoin and used many different wallets, and one I had forgotten about still had half a Bitcoin left in it. I found a couple others which had a combined ~$700or so that I was able to login to very quickly, but this is the one I am after and its one of the remaining wallets I have not been able to enter. Most of the ones I cant login are the earliest ones, i.e. from 2013-2016 and specifically one which I located on block explorer which has currently .48 btc in it. I am wondering about this now since I am almost sure that I should have guessed it by now. Even though I just learned few days ago to use btcrecover, I feel like I should have gotten in by now…I cant imagine I would have used some crazy hard/different password with the amount of times I was logging into this thing back in 2015.So, after toying around with tokens, I came to this arrangement:%[CcHhAaRrSs]%[ CcHhAaRrSs]%[ CcHhAaRrSs]%[ CcHhAaRrSs]%[ CcHhAaRrSs]%[ CcHhAaRrSs]%[CcHhAaRrSs]%[CcHhAaRrSs]%[CcHhAaRrSs]%0,2d%2d%[!@#$%^&*+?]It is to take 28 hours to do it, but if that does not work I will be even more sure the password is right but just bugged out.Saw this pertaining to some stuff from the btcrecover guide “Blockchain.com Wallets (Previously known as blockchain.info)Important Note Some older blockchain.com wallets (2014-2015 era at least, perhaps more) have a bug where some private keys were incorrectly encoded and saved to the wallet file... (Basically if the hex encoded private key included any leading zeroes, these were left off, leading to private keys that are less than 32 bytes... The current blockchain.com simply rejects these as invalid and assumes an incorrect password...) The symptoms of this are that your wallet may have correctly worked until about 2015/2016, BTCRecover will correctly match the wallet passwords (main password and/or second passwords) yet you will be unable to log in with your wallet at blockchain.com (Perhaps being prompted for a second password at login time, not just when sending funds) nor import old backups of your wallet file in to the platform. Blockchain support will simply dismiss your concerns and insist that you have the wrong password... (And given they are a non-custodial platform, don't actually have any visibility in to your specific wallet file file to be able to debug it...) The solution is to dump the private keys from these wallet files (or keys) and to import them in to something like Electrum.So how exactly would I start to do that is that were the issue here?",

There were a few ways around it.Standard comment: There are scammers everywhere, don't give people access to the wallet or your PC or anything else you will get scammed. Legit people will talk you through it.-Dave",
