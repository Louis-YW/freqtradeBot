  "content": "Few weeks ago, someone asked in our German local board, how we can take advantage for following transactions because as we know, all Bitcoin transactions are public (pseudonymous). For example, he wanted to purchase Bitcoin P2P from a seller but he didn't know where the Bitcoin comes from and if the seller lies to him. Now, he could ask the seller where it's from but obviously, the seller could lie to him, even provide fake \"proof\". Luckily, we have a public Blockchain and it can help us a lot to identify if Bitcoin is from shady sources and prove if the seller lies to us. Unfortunatley, it's very difficult for average people to figure it out. Most people are not coders and we don't have access to professional Blockchain analysis, like Chanalysis has, of course. But I believe, we have at least some basic sites, where it's possible to look up the transaction history, like oxt.me (but even here, we need to create an account and log in (I didn't try it so far)). Do you know some decent sites, where we can look up such information, like a public Blockexplorer? After all, the Blockchain is public, so I'm sure, some sites will be available (or at least some more sites should come up, when Blockchain analysis gets more professional). If you know some sites, we would be happy if you can link it below.",

I don't use them for any reason. I just run my own mempool instance on top of my node and I use this to \"check\" where my funds come from.Instead of trying to verify whether my P2P's funds origins are trustworthy, I follow these steps:Let's say I receive UTXO A from someone.1. I have a hot wallet dedicated to bitcoin mixing and coinjoins.2. The UTXO A does several coinjoins. The piece of the UTXO that remains non-coinjoined, I just sell it for FIAT. 3. I would never mix UTXO A with another UTXO from other source.4. Once I get multiple mixes I send the UTXOs that are created to separate addresses.The reason I say this, is that I believe this makes Chain Analysis a bit harder. (And I like that  )",

I'm not going to spend my cash anywhere that looks at the serial numbers of the bills and decides to refuse my cash because it was once used to commit a crime, and I'm not going to spend my bitcoin anywhere that looks at the on chain history of that bitcoin and decides to refuse it.The solution to your friend's problem is not to start attempting to investigate specific UTXOs before he has even bought them.

Should I buy a dog and hire a dog trainer to check absolutely every banknote that I receive, whether does it has traces of cocaine or not? Since when did that become my duty or anyone's duty? That makes no sense. When I receive cash, that cash can be used by top criminals but does that mean that if there is a trace of their fingerprint on my cash it should get confiscated, I should be left without money and face a jail? C'mon guys.To be honest, paid blockchain analyses have serious problems too and they don't function properly. And I bet none crypto related company will ban you if you receive coins from someone who has mixed it or has done some small shit, even if that's the case. By the way, if you type wallet address on Blockchain.com, you'll see that some of them are tagged with a name, i.e. wallet X belongs to Mt.

The objective viewpoint is to treat every coin equally, just as you would with cash. The ledger provides coin history, but beyond that it's utter guesswork to determine who owns it, what was exchanged etc. But, deeming mixed coins as \"tainted\", which is known practice by Coinbase, is insane. You cannot even argue the coins have \"bad history\", because it is completely erased in the first place. Mixed coins are indistinguishable; deeming them \"bad\", just because there is an x probability of being owned by a criminal is insane.",

Yes, a simple Blockexplorer doesn't help much here, especially for Newbies. That's why I'm searching a site like oxt.me (or even better), where also a Newbie can make a check.

Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 02, 2023, 08:52:13 AMAnd then what happens if the seller uses other UTXOs instead? That's no issue because from what I've read, the buyer was going to request which UTXO's are for sale (or at least from which address it's coming from), the seller sends his address, where the BTC is coming from and then, he (the buyer) could check on his own if he wants to make a purchase or not. By doing so, he would ask the buyer, where the BTC is from. Then, the seller tells him and the buyer could look up (by receiving the public address), if the seller has lied to him (by verifying it on the Blockchain). It's a great strategy in my opinion because if the seller is not a legitimate one or has something to hide, the buyer could catch him lying and avoid him for a deal.

Alternatively, everything he buys P2P goes straight in to Whirlpool or JoinMarket to completely obfuscate its history.Investigating UTXOs is in his best interest and I definitely trust him (the buyer), that he's not a criminal. He seemed very legitimate. Of course I've not asked him what he's planning to do with his purchased Bitcoin, as it's not really my business. He seemed legitimate and just wanted to make sure that he's not getting ripped off by a Darknet dealer. Quote from: Synchronice on October 02, 2023, 09:57:38 AMSeriously, since when do we have to investigate the past of our coins/money? Should I buy a dog and hire a dog trainer to check absolutely every banknote that I receive, whether does it has traces of cocaine or not? Well, cash is not based on a public Blockchain.  That's a big difference and we all know these shady Darknet criminals who are trying to rip off inexperienced people with any sort of bullshit. Trying to get rid of stolen or hacked coins is definitely an issue and Newbies are an easy target. Unfortunately, P2P is very affected by shady actors and that's really sad because P2P is very important in my opinion. Quote from: Synchronice on October 02, 2023, 09:57:38 AMTo be honest, paid blockchain analyses have serious problems too and they don't function properly. After all, I believe that these sites should be accessible to anyone because such information is public anyways. It's just a cash grab. Hopefully, some sites will remove their access restrictions and then, the remaining, restricted sites can see how it goes...  It's like paying for a Blockexplorer, 100% bullshit.

Looking at the history of the coins being sold doesn't tell you anything about the person selling them.Quote from: 1miau on October 02, 2023, 08:10:32 PMBecause he's owner of the coins.Do you know the history of every satoshi you own? I very much doubt anyone knows this.Quote from: 1miau on October 02, 2023, 08:10:32 PMIt shouldn't be any issue because if purchased, the buyer could \"spy\"* as well, because he'll get to know the address anyways.Yes, but that's different. If someone is trading with me, then of course they will see the address I sent coins from (although those coins will be either mixed or coinjoined, so they will learn nothing anyway). But someone who I might not be trading with asking me to reveal to them my address(es) so they can perform some kind of rudimentary blockchain analysis on them and then maybe not trade with me at all? I've just lost some privacy for absolutely no benefit to me. So I would pass and find a different buyer.Quote from: 1miau on October 02, 2023, 08:10:32 PM* I wouldn't  call it \"spying\", \"spying\" sounds more like with bad intentions, while the buyer can be 100% friendly, without any sinister intent.But that's exactly what it is. He wants to spy on the coins he is going to receive to see if they are \"good enough\" for him.If you are that worried about the history of coins you buy P2P, then just mix or coinjoin everything you receive. Simple.",

Aside from being anti-bitcoin, anti-privacy, anti-fungibility, and pro-censorship, they are deeply unethical, support attacks on bitcoin, sell your data, report you to your government, work with a variety of government agencies, insider trade against you, employ literal human rights' abusers, and will arbitrarily freeze your account and seize your coins with no warning and no recourse. Why anyone would voluntarily use them is far beyond me.Quote from: Wind_FURY on October 02, 2023, 10:25:49 AMTherefore \"taint\" from the real world's viewpoint is realTaint from Coinbase's view is real. Don't use Coinbase and whatever they classify as tainted does not matter to you in the slightest. I have a bunch of coins which I'm sure various centralized exchanges would class as tainted, but I don't give it a moment's thought and it doesn't affect me in the slightest because I choose not to support such anti-bitcoin and anti-freedom businesses. There are more privacy respecting alternatives available than ever before.A practical solution for you as a user, yes. But a solution from the perspective that \"each Satoshi has a history and therefore a context\", no. We need different layers of methods as a solution. Perhaps, Lightning + Mixers + CoinJoins?Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on October 02, 2023, 03:28:36 PMQuote from: Wind_FURY on October 02, 2023, 10:25:49 AMTherefore \"taint\" from the real world's viewpoint is real, and because Bitcoin is easy to track, each Satoshi has a \"history\" and a \"context\" because any entity can put \"taint\" labels in them.\"Taint\" is subjective. The objective viewpoint is to treat every coin equally, just as you would with cash. The ledger provides coin history, but beyond that it's utter guesswork to determine who owns it, what was exchanged etc. But, deeming mixed coins as \"tainted\", which is known practice by Coinbase, is insane. You cannot even argue the coins have \"bad history\", because it is completely erased in the first place. Mixed coins are indistinguishable; deeming them \"bad\", just because there is an x probability of being owned by a criminal is insane. From the viewpoint of the network, \"taint\" doesn't exist. But in real world, because the blockchain is transparent, then our UTXO history could be studied, analyzed, and \"labeled\". You could argue that it's subjective, but some of their history in the blockchain are based on facts. If a Satoshi actually went through an address that's verified active in the Dark Markets, then those UTXOs are \"tainted\".",

Should I buy a dog and hire a dog trainer to check absolutely every banknote that I receive, whether does it has traces of cocaine or not? Since when did that become my duty or anyone's duty? That makes no sense. When I receive cash, that cash can be used by top criminals but does that mean that if there is a trace of their fingerprint on my cash it should get confiscated, I should be left without money and face a jail? C'mon guys.I'll show you something even worse than that and that is your bank account balance.You got no way to check whether the bank is using the money in your and other people's accounts to help people do money laundering in return for a fat paycheck.Although to the government's credit, they know that investigating people solely because the money that they withdrew from the bank has traces of bank-sanctioned money laundering is a waste of time because it was not their fault to begin with.",
