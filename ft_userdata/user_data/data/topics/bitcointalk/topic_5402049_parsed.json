      "body": "Actually, almost all reviews from Trustpilot are fake all reviews are excellent which is an obvious use for marketing purposes. Also, the amount of sold courses/books are fake since you are using the Bookworm Woocommerce theme you can easily edit those sold value. So how can people trust you if you are trying to lie in the first place?Anyway, newbie traders can easily learn without spending money by research or using this link.",

Customers' privacy and intellectual property rights are our top priorities. How can you mission giving a course for a trader without get scammed while you're the scammer who offered this poor course? How can customers privacy guaranteed on your site while we need to sign up? you're recording our IP address, device, password, email etc. That's not protect any customers privacy, but you're collecting customers privacy. Moreover if someone using his credit card or bank account, he doesn't have any privacy anymore.",

In fact, it's normal for authors to link where people can buy their works.It's one way to make people less skeptic about your service. I highly suggest it.",

As I see the social media, only few on their audience, means they are not doing well when it comes to marketing.There is non progressive approach on these books which probably a revision or copy cat of famous books out there. Plus theres no trust on lying to the people.",
