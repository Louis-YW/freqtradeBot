One recent media appearance of Kennedy being interviewed by former New York Post reporter Al Guart has been taken off of YouTube due to a supposed violation of the website's vaccine misinformation policy.On the other side of the political spectrum is Trump, who has been banned from large social media platforms and yet has still found a way to get his thoughts shared by remaining active on the alternative microblogging platform, Truth Social.
