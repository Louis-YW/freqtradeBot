      "body": "If you're asking where to invest it means you have some money lying around. In such case, just buy bitcoin. It's already down more than half from its ATH and fundamentals are as strong as ever. Most obvious options are BTC, ETH, gold if you're expecting prolonged recession. A small apartment for rent is also a good option even though prices are high. If we continue to fall into depression people won't have money to buy houses, many will decide to rent and wait it out, which is why demand for small inexpensive places to live will remain high.",

I have seen that advice shared in a few places.I thought scrap metal could be a good commodities play but it looks like moonshot trends have recently reversed. HODLing gold or silver might not be the easiest to secure and store. But scrap metal doesn't appear valuable. Most thieves probably wouldn't bother stealing a 200 pound steel plate, I would guess. A heavier steel plate could be a good commodities play and anti theft deterrent rolled into one if steel prices continued to appreciate.Basic essentials like potable water could become critical issues if infrastructure and basic needs are not being met. An investment in water extraction/purification might be another play considering climate change is forecast to produce drought conditions and shortages around the world. Remember how Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle were moisture farmers on a desert planet. It is possible water could gain value in the future within a similar context. Electricity generation as well.",

And because the interest rate is also increasing, it is not a good time to borrow. Spending is reduced to what is necessary. Therefore, looking for a good investment option might not be the thing for many as they are even short of cash.But if you have the money to invest, the bearish market is not a problem. The market offers bargain prices nowadays. Bitcoin, for one, is still less than $30,000.",

So we should be happy with this bearish period, some of us sold at the top and now we are waiting for a nice price for buying, at least I still wait! Short-term trading or day trading, are like gambling! I guess people should invest in what they believe in in the end! Bearish and bullish periods are something normal, but good assets are surviving through the years and making progress! So bearish periods are great when you wish to add more to your investment, but with a discount!",

The risk of losing more is high if you fomo buy now. You should wait until the market has a clear direction of uptrend movement before choosing the perfect coin to invest because all cryptocurrency including Bitcoin are in the verge of collapsing and no one can predict if the price will up or down anytime soon. The current price is on the awkward spot so you should not doing shopping crypto right now and rather wait for the perfect timing. Buy whenever the price bounce back on the known strong support and not using your feelings as signal. Focus on blockchain project tokens if you want to accumulate during the dip because that's the most profitable token in case bull run happened due to it's utility on the dapps built on it.",

I chuckled out loud when reading these two questions, as if those tokens were backed by real pancakes.OP, I have no clue what country you're in, but in the US there's some kind of government security (a bond I think) that adjusts its interest rate according to the inflation rate.  I learned about it probably over 10 years ago, and it had an acronym (TIPs?).  Usually I would never suggest that someone on bitcointalk buy government bonds, but that's the one investment which popped into my head when you described the dismal crypto market and general lack of investing opportunities.However....the market is really low right now, right?  Wouldn't you think that now would be the best time to buy bitcoin and/or altcoins?  You might not make a quick profit like you would when there's a strong and sustained upward trend, but the whole idea behind investing is to buy low and sell high.  To that end, you've got to have the balls to buy assets when they've taken a downturn.  Quote from: Nrcewker on May 19, 2022, 07:27:53 AMYes I know, Bitcoins won’t give you profit instantly, but yes definitely it will give after some time.All you need to do is just wait and don’t panic.Glad someone is thinking straight (I read your post after posting the above).  Me, I'd rather buy bitcoin when it's just dropped $10k than when it's hitting a new ATH.  Doesn't anyone like to buy stuff when it's on sale?",
