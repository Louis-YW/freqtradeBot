      "body": "This topic looks good. As a college student I should try to do this now. There is plenty spending at the college especially as a Masters degree student or even the PhD. It only translates to a more funding and expenses because you are required to provide and make use of a lot of materials particularly for us that have the background on Sciences. I need to carry out experiments and samples from my research sites at very specific times. What that implies is that I will not need much time to prepare  for it and what that also means is that I will always need some cash around me.the only way out of this is through investment and the only investment plan that can fit a student like me now is the DCA approach. With that approach, I am able to easily save from my earnings for the dry seasons or unexpected expenses. It is really interesting to see topics like this as a student because that resonates with my temporary condition now aside from my business plans. I will need to think over this more heavily from now, Thanks!",

In my country a bachelor's degree is still very much needed to apply for jobs, and it looks like this will still be the case in the next few years so preparing funds for education is very important. Especially considering that the cost of education is increasingly expensive compared to previous years. It might be nice that in your country there are plans to remove the requirement for a bachelor's degree to apply for jobs, unfortunately that hasn't happened in my country.Preparing education funds by saving bitcoin might be a good solution, especially since my child is still small so it will take a long time before he can go to college. If I start saving bitcoins, maybe the price of bitcoins will be very expensive at that time, and saving bitcoins is the right choice. I like your idea, and in the long time I think saving bitcoin is more profitable than in mutual funds",

There are only a handful of companies where they do not look for a college degree to hire you if you have extraordinary talent. 99% of the companies still believe in meritocracy. The world you are dreaming of, is not going to happen in your lifetime. Probably few more generations will be needed to change this social system. So get a College degree and it is best if you can get a masters degree at least. Saving in Bitcoin should be fine because Bitcoin has the potential to give you a great return which can cover your education cost. But be a little conservative and probably divide your investment to invest in both Bitcoin and mutual fund.",

There are entry level tech roles that do not require a college degree. Companies are often looking for motivated individual who have the skills necessary for the job, you can easily transition into the job because recruiters look for transferable skills that can apply to the job they are hiring for.",

So I think that's more of a disadvantage on part of the students and those institutions that offer higher education.However, bitcoin is a good option for savings because its value appreciates every now and then. But I don't think one should only focus on bitcoin savings but should also consider saving in fiat as most of the necessities these days are still paid in fiat. Let's say let's put 60% on bitcoin and 40% in fiat, or 70% bitcoin and 30% fiat, depends on where you feel most convenient to save. College expenses are definitely expensive, so one should even save prior to that. Even if college degree will be removed, I still see advantage saving bitcoin even before college.",

      "body": "Whether university is necessary or not is going to be different for each person. My advice is to get the best education you can afford. It will benefit you in the long run.As for mutual fund vs. 529 vs. life savings vs. bitcoin, it all depends on your plans and your risk tolerance.A 529 plan is a way to save for future education. It is an excellent vehicle for saving for future education because the gains are tax-free. On the other hand, your investment choices are restricted. Also, its use is not restricted to only paying for university tuition. It can used for other expenses and it also be used for K-12, and certain trade or vocational schools.I think it is a mistake to assume that the price of a bitcoin will continue to rise at a rapid rate. Bitcoin may be a very good long term investment and better than other investments, but there is still a lot of risk. And while high risk/high reward assets may be appropriate for long term investment, investing only in Bitcoin is a mistake in my opinion.",

It is good but it would have been better to learn the skill early. It can also happen sometimes that the course that people apply for to study are not what they get to study in the school of their choice so rather than just accepting any course of study offered to you by the school of your choice, you can devote that time and the money that you will spend paying tuition for a course you have no interest in, into investing in learning a skill that really interest you.

These days, most people prefer to employ skilled workers who are only being trained through training over those who went to college and gained degrees in those fields. If one thinks that the money can be put to better use than using it for college, then we can divert those funds into something else, or better yet, one can save up for a higher degree, which is needed in the companies out there.",

You can always invest in bitcoin as much as you want provided that you know the risk that is attached to bitcoin investing, but I have this hesitation if college degree will be definitely removed as a basic requirement when applying for a job. I guess that remains an illusion, as there's no way that college degree will not be relevant anymore. Although I have this realization that skills and experience are much needed for a company to hire you more than your educational attainment. But we should also learn to consider that critical thinking and problem solving solutions are mostly developed having a college degree, that's why it's still essential for companies to require college degree holders.However, I have no against with bitcoin savings, but I still think that traditional mutual fund will not be easily replaced or eradicate. But you can chose to save in both without compromising one another.",
