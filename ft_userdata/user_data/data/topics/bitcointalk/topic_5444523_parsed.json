Will you go for less risk, or big profit?Risk is the measurement of how tough and difficult a certain investment is.Regardless if it's low risk or high risk, the success of any investment will depend on how we will properly manage it along the way.If low-risk investments are bound to be always a success, why are there still established and recorded failures at those considered a less-risk investment? It just means that as long as there is a risk, there is no success in any investment without having a serious approach.",

Will you go for less risk, or big profit?Real estate success isnt something that anyone could make out guarantees but i do agree into that point that it is less riskier considering that this is exempt when it comes to inflation, considering that propertiesdo really appreciates overtime but of course it would be depending on where it is located.Also, we know that someone couldnt really just be that able to deal up with real estates, why? The capital you would really be needing is no joke unlike when you do deal up with other investment ex. crypto on which you could really purchase out some coins on small numbers or in fraction which means it is lesson amount. In choosing in between then its up to your own choice but if you do have the financial capacity then having both is really that recommendable.",

Better is a combination of both always. There is obviously a meter of your life, in early ages with lesser responsibilities you have the bandwith to take more risks without any worries but eventually there will be a time when you won't have that much risk aversion. So take risks at the right time in your career so that even if things go wrong you have a lot of buffer time to regrow yourself.",

So as per say, venturing into cryptocurrency requires alot so is the profits also much, real estate has no stress or much worries over your investment.",

This kind of investment might be boring to many but to some, this is a process that they love to spend with. You can also go for crypto if you are more active investor or trade but its also good to diversify, so go take that risk either for a higher return or lower return, profit is still a profit.",

In my country there aren't that many chances to join real estate business not unless you have big amount of money. They even offer REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT), for small time or regular people to participate in real estate business, but what's the catch? If you only depend on that initial investment for sure you'll only earn a little bit, so in short you still need to buy more if you have an extra cash to earn bigger stake of that company. It's just the same as usual like traditional investments.",

In the same way, do all young people have enough money to buy real estate right away? It is for young people, since their age allows them to make long-term investments, it is wiser to regularly buy Bitcoin, and wait for their finest hour to purchase real estate in the future. We are all shaping our future in one way or another. When we are young, we build a name for ourselves, and later the name should work for us.

They say that during their younger years, a man is not measured by his profession or job but his land. During their time, a farmer who hasn't reached high school but has a vast land will most probably be more attractive to a lady than a professional who has a university degree and has a stable job. Wealth is measured by land and not by monthly salary.My point is that things have changed now. An old man might find it puzzling how his grandchild prefers to heavily invest in something like Bitcoin rather than a farm, or a young child quitting school to pursue a possible career playing an online game, or a university graduate leaving his job to focus on his/her side hustle.",

However, it requires great capital that most of us can't afford, but it's a lifelong commitment that eventually pays off. Under certain circumstances, it can be redeemed as low-risk. Personally, I'd rather have a low-risk investment that yields smaller rewards than take major risks, although this is a generalization and it depends on the type of investment.",

Can you afford to lose money if worst thing happens?What's good with Real Estate is that, the price most of the time appreciates because land can't be build, and with many buildings being built on lands, the supply of land is decreasing while the demand is still increasing thus, making the price even higher. Cryptocurrency on the other hand, can give you huge profits especially in the bull run, but the risk is very high especially when you accidentally bought at the peak of the bull run. You might incur huge losses especially when you bought at the wrong time.Age is a huge factor with this one. If you are older, you can't afford to risk into cryptocurrency because of the losses that you can get. On the other hand, if you are younger, you can just take a huge risk and invest into some riskier assets like crypto because you can still work with the losses that you can get. TBH, the question is a bit subjective and it will depend on which person you are asking that with. As for me, I'd go for bigger profit since I'm young enough to take some risks, and as I become older, I will lessen the risks from my investments.",
