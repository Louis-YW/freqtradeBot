Nice try, but I'm not doing to send you Bitcoin just to confirm Bitcoin addresses can't be blocked.This is not the first time this comrade has begged on the forum. Back in 2017 he tried to do it from another account trying to sell some bitcoin mining method (as I understand). That account got banned and he decided to try his luck again  So what he deserves is a ban for evasion.More here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5094661.msg62792751#msg62792751",

I think the lack of written English comprehension is part of the deception. Over the years many different tactics have been used to try to get others to part with their crypto and sometimes they have worked but now more and more people are careful.
