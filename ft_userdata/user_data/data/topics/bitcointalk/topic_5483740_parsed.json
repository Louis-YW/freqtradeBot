For a man who had a bitter approach towards Bitcoin and crypto currencies since 2014 only to change opinion in 2017 through 2019 simply because he wants to expand his line of business and possibly pave a way to introduce his dollar backed digital coin, JPM, should tell you a lot about his personality. You can read more about his journey with crypto currencies  here. The guy is a business man and these men will say anything that will favor them. Look at it this way; if I am a well known and respected figure in the society and I condemn a product, what have I done? I've succeeded in turning majority of the population in that state against that product and have dropped the rate at which demand and supply for that product will be and will garner enough response and attention if I decide to deal on that same product, provided I package it well.  What this tells us about him is just simple; don't take him too seriously when he drops hate speeches bout Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies.",

Fine traits of a gentleman who gives negative statement first and does the exact opposite of what the world expect him to do. Looks like he was trying to create a false narrative for his competitors who were cunning enough not to fall for his statement. In anyways he is running a financial organisation which is know for all the wrong things in finance in the world.",

I feel sorry for people who take the statements of people like Jamie Dimon seriously. He has consistently told people not to invest in Bitcoin but it is hypocritical to know that JPMorgan Chase is investing heavily in the crypto sector. Businessmen cannot be trusted because they can do anything for profit.  This is also the stance of fellow American Billionaire Warren Buffet who is a strong critic of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, it was discovered recently that Berkshire Hathaway is a major shareholder in a Latin American digital bank called Nu Holdings. This bank has launched several crypto-related services and is a well-known crypto-friendly bank in Latin America. Warren called Bitcoin rat poison, while Jamie pet rock, yet they are still investing and making profit from the industry, FUD mongers!!!.",

Or, maybe, there's something more at play, and he's actually making those statements to gain attention and to try pushing the price down, so that JPMorgan Chase can buy back at a lower price.",

I am personally not much positive about all these corporates coming into crypto market. Crypto should remain as people's money. He lies because he wants to be compliant with the regulators, especially the people in Congress. He plays both sides. On one hand there's people like Elizabeth Warren and Brad Sherman (both democrats) who work for Biden (because Biden has no idea how to regulate cryptocurrencies). Their goal is to weaken bitcoin and prepare the US for CBDCs. On the other hand Jamie sees other banks launch crypto custody services, like Deutche bank, or HSBC. Many banks do research in the crypto sector and so does JP Morgan. The problem is Jamie is a lying bastard that once said he'd fire any employee found trading bitcoin and a year later opened a bitcoin trading desk at JP Morgan and told in an interview that his daughter owns bitcoin.",
