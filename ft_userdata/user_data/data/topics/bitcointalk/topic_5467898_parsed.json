No one. The best is to make your own analysis and believe in yourself.I can see a guy recently on Twitter that says that bitcoin is going to $5000. Is that possible? That is not possible. I also see the guy posted a chart on Twitter that bitcoin will fall after 2025 halving, but which is not possible. Anyone can be an analyst as long as he is analysing. Anyone can analyze good or bad.",

It is difficult to trust in its accuracy in altcoins market, since only supply and demand control the price directly, but it can be considered an assistant to you in making trading decisions, as it has good accuracy in the long term, and the accuracy decreases as the time period decreases.In Bitcoin trading, you can start by creating a demo account, searching for people whose analyzes you trust, and then forming your idea about trading. After that, you will be able to draw the same charts yourself and you can rely on them at a rate of: - Technical analysis 25% - News and analysis 25% - Your study of the market and the nature of your risk strategy 25% - Your intuition is 25%Thus, you can get better results in trading.",

As far learning purpose some of videos are useful but for trading everyone has own strategy and way of analysis and there is no guarantee that any one analysis will also work for you.I know many Youtubers and twitter influencers who is just doing just for views and community interection, some of them will make daily 2-3 videos and if any of their analysis become true they will shill it again and again. Analysis is just one factor for predicting btc As hugeblack mentioned, other factor are also involved and we have to look for all these factors when we trade btc",

Do you still believe these chart reading? I don't trust price charts made by other people, because when they are wrong and we experience losses because we follow the graph lines made by other people. We cannot blame the person because we must bear all the losses ourselves. So that's why I still don't believe in chart lines made by other people and besides that, I also rarely trade for a long time, which makes me less interested in understanding prediction lines for various cryptocurrencies up to now.",

Many who predict chart on social media don't really know what they are doing but the essence for them doing is just to get audience that can generate income for them. One thing about chart reading and prediction, it is something traders are much interested to know when they see it. Some people just predict it inaccurately just for the  interest they will gain from it, it is important for people to know who they can take price chart from because taking the wrong one can lead to massive loss, traders should not see any price charts predicted as ultentic, most of them are wrong.",

We need to be critical with this kind of thing cause we can never be too sure. Most of the analyses are for self profits, in a way they will make money from it. Some that are accurate is not that the people that get it right are able to be accurate, but just that the market go towards the direction they take, it can be opposite next time. With how the analyses have been, I do not read about it again for me not to be disappointed. The worst are signal providers that only care about their pockets.",

Do you still believe these chart reading? If you are referring to Bitcoin then it is not that easy. Just by reading the charts it won't be easy to predict Bitcoin. News is another aspect to consider to determine the hype. I haven't seen anyone being able to closely forecast Bitcoin price and how it will react. If you are a shit coin trader, Twitter is the place where you need to be. Follow a few market influencers such as Elon Musk and you might be able to make profits. No, guarantee whether your investment would reach the moon, you can lose everything you invest.",

Charts show what is happening on the market but people may have different opinions and predictions because that will be based on their interpretation of the market trend. Of course, the chart but not fully to the person who interprets, I'd rather make my own than others. But also, we can't assure that we are right because predictions often go wrong due to the unpredictable nature of the market, so we never have to expect to be right.",

If you've been doing this for a while you get an idea of where the price will go in the next few years, but so do they, no matter how sophisticated their prediction. In addition, many of them make these predictions because they usually make money with the visits, and if they don't make money they are still looking for popularity, which encourages them to make predictions every now and then. If they paid me well, I would do it too.",

Because everyone's got a motive, and its rarely in your best interestDo your own research, be skeptical of online projections, and arm yourself with facts in a world of misinformation. Maintain an open mind, healthy skepticism, and choice freedom. And chart reading is not that hard, so spend some time to learn them",

If it was possible to make educated guesses by looking at charts, everyone would do it and everyone would become rich. Do you know a trader who is making 100% right guesses? Of course no. There are some people that make more good guesses but give enough time they will become losers too. (Assuming that they are making their guesses only by looking at charts) The truth is, successful traders use lots of other information too. They follow the news and sometimes they get insider information. Charts don’t tell you all that.",

In the end the unforseen factors of supply and demand in the market might swing to a different unexpected dimension that is not expected, so it is best to take charts as advice rather than facts.I can relate with your mathematical analyses of viewing charts, because a person needs to put some factors together in order to arrive at a decision. Charts are predictions to determine future occurrences, therefore, someone needs to have a formula that serves as a guide to arrive at the decision. Bitcoin price fluctuation as we know is quite unpredictable, so after taking analysis from different sources, this your 4/100 equation can guide the person to arrive at his own chart.",

Most of these readings are not close to being accurate and were just generated based on unrealistic values. It is a few of these very reading that are correct and near the estimated prediction. And that is why it is called speculation and no one uses that as a fundamental basics for their investment. The best way to survive, is to listen to all the craps and then do your analysis by yourself.
