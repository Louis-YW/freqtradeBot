  "content": "Has anyone seen this article?  Bitcoin has been getting a lot of mention on Yahoo Finance, some of it interesting, some of it not--but this write up had me scratching my head.There's a senator apparently proposing this, but then there's an explanation by some guy George Tung from CryptosRus, which I've never heard of (and I've not googled it).  In any event, this so-called reserve fund is supposed to be earmarked for repayment of the US's debt, something I'd find extremely risky at best given how volatile bitcoin is.  In order to justify the clickbait-y headline, there's some speculation that other countries might also start buying in an act of global keeping-up-with-the-Joneses, which in the media constitutes an arms race.  As to why those countries would need to follow the US's bitcoin buying spree, who knows?  No need to explain that when the writer of this can then add in corporate purchases and make the leap to this:Quotehe scenario Tung describes grows even more intense if corporations join the race, such as BlackRock's speculated involvement. He asserts, \"If four entities try to buy 40% of the supply...that alone will drive bitcoin into the millions.\" He highlights how limited the global supply of bitcoin is, mentioning that even smaller countries, like Bhutan and El Salvador, have already started acquiring significant amounts of bitcoin.Fundstrat analyst Sean Farrell recently used the same logic to say he may need to adjust his $115,000 price target higher.I'm curious as to what you all think about this article, this idea, or anything related to it.  Me?  I think it's total BS (though definitely bullish), but I tend to scoff at most crap that gets published online, especially if it's financial news--but I never rule out the possibility that I'm being a moron.",

It didn't stop them from entertaining the thought of it.

We're all in for a surprise of our life. Wherever this Bitcoin Reserve funds goes I'm down with it.",

Yes a scenario like this would be very bullish for Bitcoin and could create a kind of a ceiling that prices wouldn't fall lower than. If a country starts something especially one as big as the US is successful Other countries would want to do the same but all this are possible if US truly chooses to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve.",

With governments of different countries buying Bitcoin and trying to outbuy each other, the price of Bitcoin will only keep rising. If the US buys 5% and China decides to buy more, the price of bitcoin will only keep rising. if they could buy 1000btc at 100k, they wouldn't be able to buy the same amount of bitcoin at $1 million. So there will always be enough to go around. The same applies to normal people. The worth of our $100 while bitcoin is $89k would still be the same worth when it's 1 million dollars. The point is, that the higher the price, the more difficult it would be for people to purchase more of it.",

It's all related to money and benefit so if people as individual investors, institutional investors or governmental investors, have many reasons to join a good party.El Salvador is a first nation started governmental investment in Bitcoin, and some years later we have Bhutan.

      "body": "I don't even see the merit of paying their debts because they're printing the debts themselves right? Totally agree that it is volatile so I doubt that it's something that the proposed bitcoin fund is going to be used to pay off the debt and at the same time, I think that they know that volatility can go both ways which means that there's definitely a possibility that things are going to be for the long-term with this fund. It's a really good news for hodlers though, I mean with bitcoin being noticed by the US government and they have the prospects of investing in it (although the intentions are not yet clear or if the investment is confirmed), the patience of so many people are definitely going to pay off, hopefully I can still catch up to my goal of 0.1 btc before that big price pump happens.",

Yes Bitcoin value is changing due to changing views especially after US presidential election which led to its ATH. Now US is cautious while other countries are watching and waiting. This makes sense given Bitcoin history of going up and down. Bitcoin future depends on four main things more people using it worldwide and and big companies investing and changing laws and rules and people attitudes towards it. Bitcoin still has long way to go with predictions suggesting it could reach $200k by 2030.",

I’m not very receptive of the idea as if spells foul play, given that, Bitcoin would be sort out for in this regard, not for the technology but for the pump price of it. Where they would buy in with an aim to pump the price and surely, it would go bullish as, come the US, come other nations and allies to the US, whom would take there aim far off from the US, buy and like it’s said, used to pay debts. That would do much good for Bitcoin as if not properly managed, the sales could create dump in price.Quote from: The Sceptical Chymist on November 14, 2024, 08:31:03 PMI'm curious as to what you all think about this article, this idea, or anything related to it.  Me?  I think it's total BS (though definitely bullish), but I tend to scoff at most crap that gets published online, especially if it's financial news--but I never rule out the possibility that I'm being a moron.You use words in quite a beautiful way, would be reading much from you with an intention, hope that doesn’t call for anything.Yeah, lots of craps online as most is for clicks and mindless speculations just to have something up for views and clicks.",

The predictions of George Tung can happen only if Donald Trump decides to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve fund. Other nations are copycats of US policies, so we expect them to do the same thing. If this happens which is very possible we might see the scrambling for Bitcoin just as Western powers scrambled for African territories.

The good thing is that we are entering the final year of the bull run, so that could really be big for us, if US starting to buy more that will really push the price to above $100k in 2025 and we might really be in for a big surprises as to what will be the all time high this bull cycle.",

AFAIK Satoshi have 1.1 million BTC and most of the companies in US like BR, MS and all the other combined acquired more than these figures and if we combine the total amount of BTC seized from many project under the possession of US are in billions. Considering the amount of BTC are in USA they surely are the most adopted countries in the world and I don't think any other country could compete with them now as they are on the top and they own most of the BTC if combined. Another thing is them acquiring these much BTC will surely pump the price but when they will pay their debts back the price will dumb too. It's a risky proposal for the crypto market too but I want it to happen haha it will really pump the price to almost $500k. I might not make generational wealth but still haha.",
