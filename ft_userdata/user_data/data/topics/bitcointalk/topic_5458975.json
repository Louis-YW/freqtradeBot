  "content": "I am a member of a poor family. My parents work hard to sustain our household, But the family was not able to live properly with their income. Even my studies were canceled due to lack of money. Depending on my previous  academic results my college teacher convinced my parents to enroll me in college.  Later my teacher gifted me a smart phone. Then, my teacher explains to me about Bitcoin and how one can earn money from it. He tried to give me an idea about Bitcoin and assured me that if I know about Bitcoin and invest in it, I can earn good amount of money in the future which will remove my poverty. Since then, I make efforts to learn about Bitcoin. Besides, my teacher advice me about the Bitcointalk Forum where I can find extensive information about Bitcoin. He also mentions several other advantages. Intrigued by his words, I create an account on the Bitcointalk Forum website and try to gain knowledge about various important Bitcoin-related topics. Observing the discussions on the Bitcoin Forum, I become truly fascinated.I have learned to understand that any type of investment is risky but want to risk something that has the potential to change my financial situation. With this aspects bitcoin is much worthy to invest.I am trying to collect money to invest in Bitcoin for this I have decided to do agricultural work on other people's land and dreaming of investing some of the hard earned money in Bitcoin regularly. My money is small so I am trying to hold bitcoin for long term so that I can fulfill my dream.I firmly believe that there is a possibility of achieving a large amount of money in the future. My teacher advises me to hold my investments on bitcoin for longer period ‍so that i can achieve the greatest success in my life.",

      "body": "Welcome to the forum mate, your story is quite touching just like many others have similar story.Bitcoin has many benefits and one of them is the fact that it grows in profit if invested in for a long time. But to be frank with you, bitcoin is not the solution to your predicament right now. The first things you are to do is to look for an income generating business. Then if you have some substantial amount you can decide to save some to invest in bitcoin that is if the other part of the income can help cater for your basic needs. Looking towards bitcoin for poverty alleviation is bad because even if you invest the little money you have in bitcoin you wouldn’t be able hold for long because your condition won’t warrant it and one of the top tips to invest in bitcoin is to invest an amount you can afford to lose; so ask yourself this question the income you get from your agricultural earnings can you afford to lose them. Also Bitcointalk forum actually has some benefits aside learning about bitcoin freely which is to earn some bitcoin or other coins through signature campaign. Aside that it needs you to rank up your account, it is still not guaranteed to be used as the main source of income.",

Good enough you’ve devised a means and seems willing to go through the stress of not having yo enjoy your immediate earnings in hopes of better tomorrow.

Depending on how small they are it could be more than a decade. Holding on without selling for so long when you see that you have profits (or sudden losses) for someone who has a delicate situation is not easy, and I would say that few, if any, manage to do it.As I am in the habit of not believing everything I read in the forums, I will tell you that assuming your story is true and not just another one of the invented stories of this style that appear in this section every now and then, you should focus on improving your economic situation in a global way, in which the Bitcoin is only a part, although an important part of the plan. Don't bet everything on one card. Quote from: Yogee on July 07, 2023, 02:41:59 PMI'll play the devil here and say to you upfront that you shouldn't put all your hopes and dreams on bitcoin.

My money is small so I am trying to hold bitcoin for long term so that I can fulfill my dream.I have read that you are from a poor background, that you barely feed well. So, I doubt you will be able to raise a good money to dump in bitcoin for some years before having a good reward. At some point in time you will be needing such money to solve some immediate problems.If there is anything you do to earn, such as the agricultural thing you are talking about, just double your efforts there and earn real money. It will be far better than having a high expectation of bitcoin whose price is not stable.Quote from: Assiduous on July 07, 2023, 01:54:06 PMI firmly believe that there is a possibility of achieving a large amount of money in the future.

Don't you think it is time you make independent decisions in order not to blame your teacher much incase of investment failure.Research about bitcoin and make your decisions. But my advice is that those who made good fortunes from bitcoin were the early adopters who didn't look the altcoin ways. For bitcoin to be able to make you super rich now, you must be rich already and willing to invest substantial amount into bitcoin.",

As motivation, this would be great, and this is your first post. If what you said in the story is true, then you should really learn how to do financial management to achieve what you want. Investing in Bitcoin looks easy, but for those who are afraid, this would be the last place to invest. Bitcoin is good for the long term and not good for those who panic too much. You may be able to implement DCA, and every certain time you buy Bitcoin regularly, it will help you get a better-accumulated price.

Believing or disbelieving you will cause me no harm. But I want to encourage you to be strong and keep believing that you can come out of poverty through hard work and dedication. There is no assurance that Bitcoin will make you rich because the price is unpredictable and your investment might be too small to give your much profit. Focus on your academics and graduate with good grades. This will enable you to get a job that can help you raise more money to invest not only in bitcoin but in other profitable investments available to you. Welcome to the forum Assiduous.",

It's true that Bitcoin can earn you good money, but one thing your teacher didn't tell you is that, Bitcoin can also ruin your future. Investing in Bitcoin doesn't make you rich but makes you a holder of Bitcoin. If it's value appreciate, your luck.

The risks of losing more is greater though, I must warn. That is why the best advice you would often get here is to buy and HoDL. The pain of being patient for the HODLings to mature is what seems too unrealistic to many, especially those who don't know how to save or have too little to live on, let alone buy cryptocurrency.I wouldn't discourage you from trying out your idea.
