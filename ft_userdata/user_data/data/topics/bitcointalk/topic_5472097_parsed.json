Perhaps peeps should have raw houses made out of woods and puffs, and not the fixed one with high risers. That can help them during the act of war to the fullest. Even if they get hit they will only lose raw house that they can rebuild quickly and have proper settlements. I know this is not the solution but what we can do if humans are always fighting each other even after they saw billions died in the world wars. At least we can see new ways of living and acclimating to the surroundings through economic point of view. Yes, Bitcoin can be life saver to these peeps but there is a catch. Where they would spend it? Overseas? To whom? What they will get in return if they are situated in restricted zones. Even a bird cant fly during war.",

However, a war might be accompanied by blackouts, a food crisis, and a lack of trust into digital forms of money, in which case a person may find it hard to access the funds in Bitcoin sometimes, and that can be a problem. It still doesn't make real estate better, but it's something to keep in mind. As for mortgage in an event of destruction, I got interested in my country's case (Ukraine), and apparently, you still need to pay mortgage, but you can then apply to get a compensation from the state for the ruined property.",

It is important when you build your house whether through mortgage, you need to insure it with a reputable international insurance company or a local insurance company that is affiliated internationally so that even when the insurance company in the war zone is destroyed, you can lay your claims to the international affliate insurance company. Cryptocurrency no doubt has this advantage of not being destroyed but you can also redeem your house after the war if you have indemnified it, where you are safe and can produce proof through your insurance documents (if it is not burnt )",

You can always just make them repossess your property or continue to pay them until it becomes ruins when bombed especially if you live in the conflict region. Because banks doesn't care if the property is near or within the high conflicted areas, they will sell it even the lowest possible profit or just make even for that property. I'm not sure if property owners have any rights to ask for bank's compensation or provide any insurance for the property. I guess that's the best option they could give when selling it in the first place.",

Some countries who lose the war, like what happened to Japan and Germany in the 2nd World War, were forced to pay for reparations to countries that they invaded. Doesn't matter if they're fucked economically themselves, they have to do that as a symbol that they yield and as a little \"sorry g\" letter to the ones they committed atrocities against.

In my country, we don't leave in houses in that system, rather we live in a conducive house you can pay rent for and the price depends on the development of the area. Reason why we don't do mortgage here is because the interest rate and inflation will kill you while you are still alive paying for the house you plan to pay on installment for the rest of your life when the minimum wage is very little to survive. I believe this applies to some other countries as well.Real estate is not a small business to even begin with, but you are right about buying crypto instead of Real estate. However, it also depends on where you live, there are places that since there developing stage have not for once experience war or conflicts and are doing well today in that real estate you are running from but I agreed that it's not a wise decision to that in war zones.In addition, I hope you also know that cryptocurrency is also a risky investment, you have to be vigilant of the type of coin you buy, when to buy and where to keep them. More precisely, buy bitcoin because all other coins depends on its growth and it is circulated by institutional investors that want to see it grow in value because they also hold bitcoin.",
