Your best bet is looking for new games but the catch is that you'll never really know if it's legit until you try it.",

This is one of the reasons why most influencers try their hardest to promote the site or app they are using.I have also once participated a P2E game by being a discord moderator and  earn some specil perks. To be honest nowadays its hard to participate in P2E games if you don't have anything to contribute on their platform, some requires tremendous effort just to receive benefits while some just need enough cash to receive special bonuses like a VIP.",

      "body": "NFT games are your doing it already but of course you're not the only one doing it for free so you still have to compete with the others. And just like what they said it would be hard to earn what you wanted if you don't pay in order to get past with the other. So at some point in time you will have a problem getting what you want without spending some real cash in the game.It's hard to find a legit one nowadays since most of them are being hyped at first but the more you dig deep into the game the more it's getting harder to get what you want. Developers didn't just create a game where all of their user are earning money that easily plus not to mention the investors who will play with the market.",

      "body": "Important to note that most P2E games require some level of investment in order to earn significant amounts of money. However, there are some platforms that offer free play to earn options. I think, to withdraw tokens without depositing anything, many platforms do require a minimum deposit before allowing withdrawals. You need to more explore or need read whitepaper project for guide (DYOR). So, there are some platforms that offer no-deposit withdrawals. Maybe, other platform offers various games that reward players with WOM tokens, which can be withdrawn without any deposit requirements.",
