  "content": "2022 Ice Hockey World Championship 2022 in Finland started on Friday. I haven't found thread about it, so I made this one. Here is the current situation in both groups and so far there were no surprises:4 best teams get out of group to 1/4 final and team which finish last in each group drops to lower division. Russia and Belarus were removed from tournament because of war in Ukraine and they were replaced by France and Austria.All details about tournament on officila website:https://www.iihf.com/en/events/2022/wm",

But on the other hand, interest in hockey is low on Bitcointalk in general, we don't even have active NHL thread.Finland - Sweden is good game indeed, fight for 1st place in group, nothing surprising that it went to ET and penalties where only Sweden goal let them to win.Yeah, Kazakhstan - Canada should be fun, I'm going to look for goals over markets there .",

They have lost to Switzerland 2-3, which is kinda a strong last years, and even won last period 2-1. I expect something like 0-2 or 0-3 in first period against Canada. During the rest of the game, Canada will try to test unusual tactics, combinations and etc. That is why it wont be a total beating in this game. Team Norway is doing great so far. They have always end at +12th place, now they are already in quarterfinals. Which means they will be on 8th place minimum. So far this years tournament is rather quite. No scandals. No huge penalties. And I have watched only 1 game",

Games with direct competitors Czechia and USA will be decisive for them.About whole tournament so far, good point from you, I also would like to add that we didn't had any big upsets.Tomorrow's games doesn't looks very attractive, maybe Latvia - Austria might be interesting, but both teams isn't likely to fight for playoffs.",

As for the games on May 20, Latvia vs Austria will be most competitive and interesting  to watch. Germany - Italy, Germany will win obviously. GB vs Finland at 16:20. It is 5 o`clock time, which means Finland will win (just kidding ). Kazakhstan vs Slovakia. Kazakhstan havent recovered fully from game against Canada. We are left with Latvia vs Austria. Austria had 1 day extra to rest. In 2019 Latvia already beat Austria (Latvia dominated 3rd period with 4:1). That year Austria got kicked to Division 1. This means that Latvia is stronger, on the paper... Both teams have same number of points. Latvia need that win to get 3 points, then beat GB and finish 4th in group. Austria will face Finland this Sunday and definitely would lose. Norway, that are on 5th will lose to Sweden and Czech. Plus Czech will lose to Finland and if they lose to USA, than Latvia has chances to go play-off. In todays game between Latvia vs Austria the faith of Latvia will be decided, as other teams in group will lose to a stronger opponents. That is why todays game gonna be hot",

By removing a historic medal contender, the quality of the tournament is certainly not at a standard level. Everyone else has been given a boost and teams which would normally not be fighting for medals now have greater odds achieving better results.
