I don't see it as an ethical issue, the code allows it. I see Eth incompetance as the real villain. They allowed this exploit to exist and never tookany action to close it. Every pool should be exploiting it then everyone is equal again.",

One honest pool F2pool did its best to legally earn as much as possible.All other pools failed to do it.Thus if you are like me a miner and used viabtc you may be able to sue viabtc for its failure to legally do what f2 pool did.I earned over 45 eth from viabtc sounds like they owe me some eth. they failed to code for maximum profits.nice shit storm here. should be fun to see if class action is taken against lots of pools.and if those pools in turn sue eth for not closing the loophole.got to love it.maybe this will cause eth to halt pos not speed it.better yet maybe eth will need to reverse pos.remember eth rewrote the code to capture coins lost back in 2016.",

It remains to be seen if this was a feature or a bug but I don't see any possible litigation potential, just bad media attention.From my understanding, if everyone exploited this the result would the highest diff solution within the timing window wins the block'stransactions, other solutions become uncle blocks. The timing windows seems to start when the first block solution is submitted and it lasts for about 13 seconds. Any more difficult solutions during this window can be backdated and replace the previous solution.I briefly briefly scanned the paper and it seems they have a miner implementation for Gominer. It seems you don't need the pool.Now the race by all the miners to release it first.",

This is good, it proves eth devs left ways to cheat the mining system if you wanted to.i estimate there rewrite back in 2016 cost me 2 coinsand this exploit allowed by eth cost me 4.5 coinsso any time mr vb wants he can the 6.5 eth to me roughly 13000 usd. as of today.he can send me the coin via pmif and when he does I will let you all know. if he does not and there ever is a class action this is my notice I would expect 6.5 eth in damages.",
