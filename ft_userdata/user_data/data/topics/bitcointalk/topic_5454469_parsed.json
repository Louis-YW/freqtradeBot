On the other hand, if you are not guilty, I hope that you can get back the funds stolen from you.If I am asked for my opinion regarding these issues of accusing and banning players for breaking the terms of service, it'll be best to provide evidence that the user really did what they accuse him of.",

I find this a very stupid excuse from the casino's side.What is so hard with showing the player what he violated. I don't know about other members, but I am going to red trust them until they provide a clear answer.",

But, Casinos are supposed to answer them and refer to the T&C they broke. The Live support is for what? If they answer like they do not have further information, where is the player supposed to contact? I saw some casinos refer them to fraud team email and they take ages to reply. Isn't it better to practice that their support team will contact the fraud team and answer the player? The support has direct contact with the team while a player doesn't have any contact with anyone except for the live support. I don't remember if have seen this casino before. I don't know why people choose unnamed casinos. Maybe because they want to take some advantage of those casinos? I don't know. If their casino team is here (I am not sure if I have seen them around), they should explain to the player why they blocked the player and what T&C they broke. Edit: Just saw they are here in the forum. I suggest OP update your post with more detailed information. Follow the scam report format and invite their forum representative to this thread.",

In this case, they have confiscated the balance giving out the reason that the player has broke the T&C and then also fails to address the reason properly. This is not how a genuine casino should operate. I can understand them confiscating the profit over the balance because a player broke the T&C but ripping off the deposit of the customers in the name of \"breaking T&C\" is just straightforward scam.I would like to ask OP to follow the proper format of reporting scam and include the deposit TXID's as well.",

First of all we thank you that you are here to respond to the Op but  To clear yourselves, you need to provide some evidence of the fund paid to the player's account because this is an accusation and such accusation goes with reputation of the company. So do everything to retain your reputation here. Though from the images uploaded by the Op which rebroadcast by PP is not really clear because of the repeated image. So the forum might need your part of the issue between you and the player.",

Risking to sound repetitive, I am agree with two posts above me and asking if you can provide us with a tx id or at the very least, a screenshot of the proof of successful payment. OP, we can work this part from your side too. Can you clarify that you've receive what's stated by the representative?Second, agreeing with Agbe, can you please at the very least inform us what clause has the OP breached? I think informing us the point of the ToS being breached wont compromise your security and fraud detection algorithm.",

How does withdrawal ID affect your casino security? it just doesn't make a lot of senseif you don't care about a customer then you don't care about any customers, so i suggest OP create a flag against you and i will support the flag and recommend all people not to use your casino because it has shady behavior like a certain famous casino scam on this forum, I hope you recant and review your behavior and post proof of the accusations you made against OP, if you don't show proof your casino will get a bad reputation and lose customers and I don't see that being something good for your casinoQuote from: Bounty Inspectors on May 31, 2023, 04:31:20 PMQuote from: tirualuan on May 30, 2023, 02:52:37 AMafter signing i have deposited money to coinzino.io to play the first few times i withdraw is ok but after the 3rd time i have deposited and played after winning i withdraw then they closed the account and sent an email saying suspect me of violation waiting for them to investigate. after 5 days I still have not received a response from the email, then I texted the support chat on the homepage, they said I was in violation and the account was closed and can't be reopened, I asked what violation I did and asked by proof they don't answer maybe they want to take away more than 3000$ in my accountFew months ago I was created account on this platform.
