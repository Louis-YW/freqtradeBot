  "content": "It’s been a beautiful experience for me on this forum for quite a couple of months now, and I can reminisce coming across several numbers, but just of recent something struck my attention for the very number 120, which made me think, rethink and gave birth to this thread I am about to share with you guys right now. That thou as a number, what importance does it have on its reflection on the forum. Which I will be bisecting and dissecting with you guys to the very best of my understanding how the number holds great influence on this forum which I’m sure you never knew before and you are about to in a couple of seconds. So I advise, go grab a cup of coffee as I work you through this thread how important the number 120 is to the forum.3 Reasons Why The NO 120 Is Important On The forum1.   Access to the forum full features2.   Requirement for campaigns3.   Users forum statisticsACCESS TO THE FULL FORUM FEATURESThe number 120 plays a big role here, because in other to access the full forum features, two things are involved ‘Merit’ and ‘Activity’, of which the minimum Activity to rank up to the Full Member is 120, of which gives you access to the complete forum features, such as posting images, wearing signature and avatar, e.t.c. So that makes the number 120 unique and important on the forum because without that these features can’t be access.REQUIREMENT FOR CAMPAIGNSAnother place this number 120 plays a big role on the forum is when it comes to campaigns, because to most campaigns, one basic requirement always needed to join has always been, how many merits were you able to gained within the past 120 days. That is, now using the number ‘’120’’ as now a timeframe for measuring one’s eligibility with reference to merit earned.USERS FORUM STATISTICSThis is quite another way the number 120 plays a role on the forum, because as an active forum member, a user’s account statistics is always given in reference to the past 120 days, which gives a summary information about the user’s performance, merit sent and received within that period of time.So in conclusion, these are but a few ways I personally observed how the number 120 plays some significant role on the forum. So what have you to say to this. You can share your opinions on this, and I will be glad to see as much contributions as you can. Thanks.  Do you know any significant figure about the forum you have noticed and will love to share?",

I guess it's actually not what you may have expected, but at least it does gives a view in a different perspective about the forum, how our activities are boil down to these number 120 days, which just like you said 4months  Quoteand that’s the 120days which is another way of saying approximately 3months. I must say, you are wrong on this, 120days can never be 3months, its actually 4 months bro.. i.e 30x4=120But however, i have got previous good threads and still working on more",

So, it is correct to say that someone whose activity is not upto 120 can still use forum features. So, as activity 60 is important to a Jr. Member, so also 120 is important to a member rank.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on June 09, 2022, 06:49:22 PMREQUIREMENT FOR CAMPAIGNSI have read that some users here joined signature campaigns as newbies. Meanwhile campaign manager like yahoo62278 and others accept member rank into their campaign, so the 120 figure is defeated again. Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on June 09, 2022, 06:49:22 PMUSERS FORUM STATISTICSSome managers also do not require merits for accepting you into campaign. They only check your posting style and maybe your favourite boards and access you.So, it is good to consider the number 120 as an ordinary number as there is nothing unique about it.If we are to consider a unique number here, it should be number 7 => BITCOIN",

That person makes the decision to be the person they will be. Whether it be a bounty hunter, a sig spammer, a manager of some sort, a staff representative, an admin, an honest person, a liar, or whatever. The decisions you make are going to shape the persona you are on this forum. For example, the OP seems to be worried about getting 120 merits for whatever reason. Then decided to make a post showing why they feel 120 is an important number and they are completely wrong and are not getting any merit for this useless topic also leading me to think sig spammer is what they are desiring to be on this forum. I could be wrong, idk, just making an observation. The point is, whether you have 0 merit or 5000 merit you can still contribute to this forum. Along the way you may add to your merit total, you may rank up, or you may get negative rep for being a douche and disappear. You decide who you are and no amount of merit or rank makes a difference.",

So that makes the number 120 unique and important on the forum because without that these features can’t be access.You don't need to be full member to post images as there are two options for the same like first one is you need to be junior member which requires 30 activity and only 1 merit and it will take more than month of active posting to reach that activity level and second one is going through Copper membership that usually projects that want to advertise on the forum go through.So for signature campaign they are mostly for Full rank and above ranks but yes there are some for junior members also but the difference is signature space so you can't say it as restrictions.The number 120 is not distinctive as per my knowledge.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on June 09, 2022, 06:49:22 PMREQUIREMENT FOR CAMPAIGNSAnother place this number 120 plays a big role on the forum is when it comes to campaigns, because to most campaigns, one basic requirement always needed to join has always been, how many merits were you able to gained within the past 120 days.

But I agree with @ETFbitcoin, 120 is a random number chosen by theymos for several things including one of them is determining the activity required to rank up to Full Member. I don't find much more reason to say why 120 is an important number on this forum, so don't focus too much on things that might not mean much to your quality improvement especially knowledge.",

For example, if a user needs 1 merit or 1 activity to upgrade next rank then number 1 is important for him. Those need 10 then that number is important for him. I think this way number works.
