If you're begging here will not solve your problem. They can handle it by themselves. If you have zero experience and don't even project developers will be looked at you. You need to have at least some skill.  I am very good at work.  And how do you call it begging?  If a person is a little older, the eyes are higher on the forehead than people.  You are an example of that.",

Join a bounties doesn't increase your knowledge, actually it would make you become a dumb person since you're start become like a robot.",

I believe your command over English is not that good, which is fine but I would suggest you to improve on it, because that would help you in the long run while on this forum. You can continue to post in Bangladesh section but work on your English too.Firstly you are new user in this forum. Dont you think it looks bad to older forum members here when a newly created account comes here only to start looking for money making methods. You are expected to learn, read and ask about crypto and bitcoin in general to gain knowledge and gradually start providing services which includes campaigns.My suggestion would be to work on your English and side by side, learn about crypto from the internet and this forum as much as you can, try to participate in discussions going on and gradually work on your rank. If you manage to earn enough merits to rank up, you can attempt the bitcoin paying signature campaigns, which is the gold standard for campaign on this forum, way better than any bounty.No one will hand you a project, you have to build your name and reputation and then go for one.",

So, if that concerns you, don't get involved in a project and bounty that don't have a reputable person to back what they're running.",

I do hope not all coming here are just after the privilege to join some bounty and earn from it. This is my initial plan when I joined here but there are other ways to earn and not just here on forum. Its unfortunate that mostly just joined here for that purpose, and instead of contributing and learning here some important knowledge about bitcoin and crypto, this is their goal to earn money. Maybe its not too late to change your perspective regarding forum.",

Better still think of how to build yourself here, focus on constructive posts to keep you growing then maybe after getting to a higher rank you may decide to apply in signature campaign at the service section.",
