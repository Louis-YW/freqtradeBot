      "body": "I’m a huge fan of Resident Evil 4, I’ve been playing it for while now. I really dig the survival, horror theme. You get into a lot of solid shoot outs and there’s some good action in there. They put a lot of attention to detail in it. Like when you hit someone and shoot them in the arm they actually drop their weapon which I think is pretty cool. It also just feels more interactive and like a fleshed out world. I like that you can do more things like jumping out windows. I think it’s a solid game and definitely one of my favorites. The story is good too, you’re on this mission to rescue someone. Definitely recommend RE4 for sure.",

After that, I had other hobbies I wanted to pursue, and now I have improved on it. However, there are times when I can actively play it for a year, or during a burnout period, I play actively for a month or two before giving it another try because I know I won't be able to connect with her life in the future.",
