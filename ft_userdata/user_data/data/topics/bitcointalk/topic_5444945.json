If we are not in control of our emotions it is possible to make wrong decisions. For example, when investing in Bitcoin, we know that the price of Bitcoin will increase at this price but because we saw that it also decreased, so what he did was sell Bitcoin. Instead of making a profit, he should have made a profit because after he sold the Bitcoin, that's when it went up.",

Too much chasing is exhausting and in trading or investing, you need to be wise in all of your decisions.Because with a simple wrong move that you commit, it will cost you a lot of money and much worse is that you'll lose everything that you've got. Setting a target price is what we're all thinking about when we trade or invest bitcoin, setting price to buy or sell and the most ideal price in our opinion satisfies us.",

Two things cause people to lose money in the crypto world, one is getting in the flow of the hype and buying bitcoin when it is high, obviously when price goes up 3x then there will be a lot of people sharing their immense profits and news all over the world will talk about how bitcoin went up.So, there will be plenty of people who will come in and try to make the same profit but the price won't continue to go up like it did at that point, they are buying at the top. That's the biggest mistake and people should avoid it and buy when it's low. Second is losing and then trying to recover that by putting even more in and losing even more.",

      "body": "Well, you could miss the train if you keep waiting for your price and don't take advantage of the current price. I don't think that one should keep waiting for Bitcoin to hit the bottom as we never really know what the price will be the bottom price. So, it is better if someone just does DCA from when the price is not too high and keeps buying until it hits the bottom.I know it sounds good to get the price that you desire but believe me, those who try that usually regret doing so since they get nothing at the end and just keep waiting and the price starts going up again.",

This has more of experience to your strategic plan because if you have not seen that obeying your strategy then you won't wait but to rush in for the chase. The market does something first before it comes to the right spot for entry and that thing is chasing out stop losses set by trader, it push people out first before it gives it to you and if you enter earlier then you will be part of those whose stop loss would be knocked out. If you don't give it to me then no deal is true for experienced trader",

This is because, you never can at any point, pin the market to be at its best for a sell or buy.Yes, you might sell on profit but, when the market continues to appreciate, you begin to feel bad and think of yourself to have sold way too early. You continue to observe the market and further/longer pumps would always want to push you right back into the market. When you eventually come in, surprisingly the market might start dumping and then, you feel you should have waited some more.What would be the result, your lose canceling your profit. Its just something many investors face and so, holding might be a way to keep things together. Making profit over every move is not possible.",

Only one liquidation will eat you $150 and you will have only $50 left that is only 50% of your initial capital. Be very careful with leverage trading.",

I've stacked up mad profits from my neediness!This one wild time, I was so desperate, I dumped my whole stock collection just to get my hands on more Bitcoin! My peeps thought I lost it, but I was onto something. And what do you know? It worked! Bitcoin blew up, and I was rolling in dough! So, here's the deal: Embrace your inner needy!
