They can run every possible pattern and match it with provided key and tell if it is in that range or not. This range scanning time is based on hardware you have.For more information every bitcoin address is generated from a specific range of private keys. Nearly every 256-bit number is a valid ECDSA private key. Specifically, any 256-bit number from 0x1 to 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140 is a valid private key.",
