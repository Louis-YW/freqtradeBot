I hope you can understand this than getting yourself into what is not.sorry to say, but i don't believe this kind of prediction. i don't think there is correlation with the potential results with the movement of the pendulum. i am more on if you truly know the sports, you have better chance of getting the right outcome. also, if this method has high success, we should already have read many of these bettors recommending the use of pendulum to predict the results of the game. but is there any news something like that??? a bettor using pendulum with high success. i guess, no one yet.",

Anyway, thanks for educating me about that kind of technique, I'm now aware about it. Yes it is kind of superstition where you are using a tool called by pendulum. I knew about this thing long time ago when I was a student in Junior High School and I believed in it at that time but I dont believe it anymore. It works like you are holding the pendulum and ask something in your mind about anything then command the pendulum to move right to left or front to back. It was being said that we are transferring our energy to the pendulum so it can move based on our question. Never tried it myself for gambling purpose but I've tried it few times, what were the results of my tries? Some tries were correct and some other tries were incorrect, means that it was just a coincidence when prediction is correct.",

Which an underdog can suddenly win over an undefeated boxer who reigned for more than 5 years. I have no idea about that pendulum really until that link come up. And I still don't get it even after reading a bunch of paragraphs. But I can tell its BS. 70% can be achieved if you are really into the game, you'd have to be addicted to horse race and maybe lived among with those horse to see their capacity lol",

I laughed at her stupidity forever UNTIL I came face to face with the magical pendulum the entire month of September.When a story starts like this, it's a scam 101%! Magical and mystical powers are just some kind of illusion used to trick people! And to take their money and other possessions! I guess this guy has a good average, probably he is doing his research (or someone is doing that for him), and he is selling that! But there's no pendulum or stuff like that, it's just some weird kind of marketing that I don't like, but looks like some people still do!",

You cannot just let the randomness of a thing/event to be something you'll depend on. It's just irrational.
