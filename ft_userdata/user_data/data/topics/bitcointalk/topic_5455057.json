It will be best to elaborate about your project as much as possible. We investors are not expecting three to four lines of texts indicating that we should find out the facts ourselves.Â  So, do the needful. For instance, what kind of NFTs do you offer? What's it all about? Price range? Have you sold any before? Things like this is what attracts potential buyers.Wish you the best though!",
