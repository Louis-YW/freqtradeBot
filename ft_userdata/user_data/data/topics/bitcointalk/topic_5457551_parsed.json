UniJoin dey use CoinJoin to enable multiple Bitcoin transactions to combine into one wit multiple inputs and outputs. Dis way e dey provide a level of anonymity and security wey make am hard to determine de input wey correspond to de output.How e dey work?Make you create new wallet addressGo to https://[banned mixer]/en/coinjoin/btcEnter de new wallet address wey you createChoose your Wallet Distribution and Time DelayJoin de UniPool wit your traceable coins by depositing am from your old addressReceive untraceable coins to your new wallet       Frequently Asked QuestionsCoinJoin na de method wia different piple join togeda for one single pool and togeda create a single transaction wia each of dem go give coins as inputs and fresh and anonymous addresses as outputs to receive de coin. De goal na to break de link between de input and de output. We dey make dis possible by ensuring say de output amount dey exactly de same.Wen you don send your coin for mixing, we go provide a digitally signed confirmation wey be de letter of guarantee. Dis go serve as proof of our obligations and e dey expected say make our users save and store am well after dem don send de BTC. Since your data no dey for our server kpata-kapta, dis na de only proof for future verifications incase e result to de mata wey our support gats look into. You fit check de letter of guarantee directly from our website \"restore session\" https://[banned mixer]/en/restoreTo preserve your anonymity and to make Chainanalysis dey very hard, we com decide to randomly generate de fees for mixing operations. De fee for mixing operation dey de range of 1% - 3% and we dey generate am with a decimal number of 4 digits. Also, na de user dey pay de miner fee and we dey deduct am from de total mixed amount.UniJoin dey store information only de time wey mixing order don complete and na only dat one, wey dey technically necessary. After de mixing order don complete, e go delete immediately. Therefore, de order link no go dey accessible after de page don reload. So we no dey keep chat histories for our support section after we don resolve de issue, we dey close de chat as e fit contain information of de individual user.If you don already send coins to de address UniJoin generate, we go execute your order normally, even if you close your browser or window. You fit use de order link or letter of guarantee to restore de section. Either you enter your link in de url field, or you retrieve de link by by attaching de letter of guarantee /en/restore]here.Our mixing mechanism technically get no upper limit. However, de processing time dey increase with de amount to mix. For dis reason, we com limit de maximum amount per mixing order to 1000 BTC. De minimum amount to mix Bitcoin dey variable as e depend on de value of USD. Currently, de minimum amount to mix na 0.001 BTC. If you send less dan de minimum amount for an order, de order go cancel and you go receive a refund minus de transaction cost.De mixing process fit dey completed within an hour, but e fit take longer depending on transfer delay wey you set, join wit de time of getting 2 confirmations of de blockchain network. We no recommend say make you set de transfer delay to 1 hour, as e go get de least effect on anonymity.Wen you dey create a mixing order, you must make a deposit to de generated address within 24 hours including 2 confirmations of de network, so that our system go process de order automatically. If you send de coins after 24 hours, no worry, you no go lost your funds (contact our support and attach letter of guarantee).De Unicode na de unique string wey our system de generate wen you place your first order. We dey recommend say make you use de code for all your future mixing orders, as dis dey ensure say u dey rotate within de available CoinJoin pools and you no go partially receive your coins back from past orders. ________________________________                /]                              /en/download-public-key]Quote from: UniJoinSince we dey delete your data from our servers, de letter of guarantee na de only evidence for future verifications in case of any wahala.",

While the digital Yuan is intended to enhance payment efficiency and reduce transaction costs, some Chinese citizens perceive it as a means for the government to exert greater control over payment systems and surveillance of users’ activities.This article provides insight into China’s cryptocurrency landscape and suggests a solution to maintain a crypto user’s privacy and anonymity despite the stringent crypto regulations.For those wey nor Dey aware say Unijoin don drop another article nai make me bring am come our local board so.I go try Dey post some updates here once once make our people for this board still Dey get the koko about Watin Dey sup for Unijoin, and newbies wey nor know anything about mixers fit still use this opportunity take learn one or two from am.",

Okay make I try explain am the way you go take understand am.First of all you know say bitcoiners Dey very conscious when it comes to matter wey concern our privacy, so if something happen make we say person send you some coins based on say dem get your wallet address them go fit monitor how you take Dey do transactions and even if you like send am go another wallet he go still Dey show for blockchain. So if you want make the person nor fit see how you take dey run your stuffs nah there mixers go take help you. The way he Dey work be say you go send your coin to the mixer (dem get large amount of coins for different places) and during the period when you wan take send your coins you go also provide them with the new address wey dem go send your coins go so that way nobody go kon know how you take Dey waka with your coins. Nah just the basic idea be this, but if you really wan know more about am den just check this link[1] wey I go drop for the bottom of my post.

Cantsay has explained the basics for you. Bitcoin mixers are used by bitcoin users that wants privacy. Let me give you another examples, assuming you have 10 BTC and you want to make use of a decentralized exchange or you want to make an order to purchase something online, these are two examples that can link your 10 BTac to your real identity because the buyer on a decentralized exchange can link it to you, also the seller of what you want to buy online can link the 10 BTC to you. If what you want to buy is 0.05 BTC, you may decide to send 0.055 BTC to a mixer which you will use to exchange to fiat on a decentralized exchange or be used for the purchase of the item you want to order online.There are two types of mixers:Centralized mixersDecentralized mixersOn centralized mixers, like https://[banned mixer] or the Unijoin which this thread is all about, you will have to send the mixer coins and you will be sent a mixed coin which is not connected with the transaction of the coins that you sent the mixer so that your coins can not be traced. But you need to use a reputed mixer because you will first need to send the mixer coins, which the mixer will mix. That is why they are centralized. It is good to use their darknet (.onion) link. Decentralized mixers are basically coinjoin. Coinjoin means many users to be connected together in a decentralized way the mixer will send their coins to each other in a way that you can not trace or difficult to trace the coins. Just like 50 users to coinjoin 0.01 BTC each in a way that each 0.01 BTC is sent randomly to each 50 users in a way that can not be traced or hard to trace which one is sent to the different address that the coins are sent to for each 50 users. Example is the Whirlpool on Sparrow wallet and Samourai wallet. Or the Jointmarket if you run your own node. Another example is Wasabi but not trusted in privacy again as the company and chain analytic company are spying and censoring coins. All you will do is to use the wallet they are to do the coinjoin and they are noncustodial wallet.You can see the lists of reputable mixers and their fee on this thread: 2023 List Bitcoin Mixers Bitcoin Tumblers Websites",
