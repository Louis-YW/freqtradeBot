Causes for them to do this I can think of is that they have other accounts on the forum that they are monetizing, but I think this is less likely, or that they are degenerate gamblers, or that they use drugs or something.That in case they are participating in signature campaigns, although I think that in this case he was not participating, and it is not 100% clear to me why sashan gave him the loan, I guess because Devawnm367 had a previous history of having returned loans.",

Just because someone's been trustworthy for years on doesn't mean that that person won't flip on you. Everyone's got a price and that person decided that he doesn't want to be on this forum anymore so getting something little out might not be a bad idea or I'm overthinking it and that person died and we all know a dead man can't pay no debts.",

I think only Darkstar might be on profit as he managed a good campaign in DT from the beginning as a result got a lot of collateral-based borrowers.The mentioned default in scam accusations might be half of all defaults. I usually try to see whether come online or not. Few people repaid after a long time that's why at the beginning do not want to create scam accusations.",

This indicates that to have been their initial motive for creating an account on the forum.This from all indication does not look like that. But it matter much what it looks like or how I perceive it, another lender suffers yet another loss frustrating such well meaning users and demotivating others who want to join in.Going strictly with collateral based loans seems like a good direction to take in the face of all the possible indication of losses.",

Even if the money did not come as expected, within the long duration that was given to the loan defaulter, there is enough time to save up $100+.I just hope the loan defaulter is in good health wherever he is, and if he doesn't have a plan of scamming, maybe he will come back one day and repay the loan, as both the ALTs identified here have been active since 2022. @Op, just hope all this kind of loss won't make you change your good heart and give out your support to the needy in the form of your loan.",
