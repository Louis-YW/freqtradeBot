  "content": "As the title speaks, there was a bitcoin poster ad seen outside a van near silicon valley bank headquarters!Jerome Powell is handling a paper in it saying \"Buy Bitcoin\". So, is this the reason we pumped quite hard from 20k to 26.5k in a matter of days? Can someone confirm if this is real? I know Jerome doesn't speak clearly about supporting btc in any of his speech, but maybe some btc lover did this intentionally, lol. Does anyone here live near the svb HQ ??Sharing some of the images below of the poster ad:",

It's obviously a photoshop, otherwise Powell would have already been fired and it would be the news of the day. There are xx topics explaining what could be the real reasons for that mini pump.",
