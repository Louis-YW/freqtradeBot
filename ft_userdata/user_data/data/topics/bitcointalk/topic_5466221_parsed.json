There is economy hardship everywhere but you see the reality of this, people will still pay even if they protest from now to tomorrow because protest hardly bring leaders to succumb anytime people complain in this country. Na the koko wey dy happen for Naija be this because I remember then when we sef go protest for school make things better only for some snitch to go do another thing behind out back.Make we check mate this increase school fees wey dy propose and the economy. Things are hard everywhere and everything don cost, the cost of maintenance and new projects, to be able to meet up with the standard of things, they have to really increase the fees because make I no lie you, government no too send education for this country, na one of the reason why ASUU dy fight for student even if we know say them say get for body.But I know sure if this is proposed or already finalized amount. I don't know for other universities because my school then, when the school propose a school fees, the SUG will review what the senate bring to the table, they will come back and do their own meeting and then come as one and give their own stand and go back to the senate again. They will continue to deliberate on the price until they reach on agreed price that will be suitable for everyone and if the school don't want to be considerate, then SUG has the right to protest under the supervision of police and civil defense to avoid hoodlums from hijacking and turning it to riot. The school will have to agree with the SUG but I'm not sure if the same is happening in Uni Lag.",

While I see the increase in school as outrageous, there was need to actually adjust the school fees if the school are to meet up with running the system. What I rather find so strange is Federal schools increasing school fees to multiples of what it used to be considering the fact that they are being funded by the government and the staff under the payroll of the government. Well, I will not forget that everyone is looking for a way to take advantage of the systems since our institutions, that are supposed to checkmated them, are practically sleeping. At this price, there is little difference between public schools and private schools and if you ask me, I prefer the later considering the infrastructures and learning environment that is like world apart.",

Now wey Tinubu don carry him own plans come to make the poor ones strive to live, imagine before poor man dey fit eat three two times but now na government won begin give poor people money to take survive wey no go reach them spend for three days.

UNILAG is a federal government university and the fee they pay is far much more cheaper than state government schools. Despite that state government schools depends on state government, federal government students pay the lowest fee in the country. There is no way they will not depend on the federal government. The schools that I know that are less dependent are paying high amount of money. I remember Lautech that went on a strike for a long time, they resumed for exam. After they finished the exam, the strike continued until the tuition fee was increased. That was many years ago. I do not know much about the school anymore. Nigeria has one of the Universities that has one of the lowest tuition fee in the world, in a way that some tertiary schools in some states are free, while federal government universities are paying low amount in fee, followed by the state owned universities. The private schools are more expensive. Maybe it would have been better in a way that those that go to school may easily get job if the school fee is normal like other countries.",

Based on our knowledge about subsidy, it is a direct or indirect payment from the government.Assuming the government pays 70% as subsidy for a school fee of #150,000 (that is the government pays #105,000 out of #150,000) removal of subsidy means we have to pay the full #150,000 but if the governing council of the university decides to increase the fee from #150,000 to #300,000, students will be left in the dark and assume that this increment was as a result of the removal of subsidy not knowing that the governing council of the university as a hand in it",
