Will try to look at that top 10 streamers and I might see some good insight that can help my gambling decisions.",

I believe that no one can help us win in a casino, as games are won through luck. So, maybe their help is only in guiding beginners on how to gamble in the games, and I'm sure they won't continue watching once they learn how to gamble.If they were sports betting tipsters, I might be interested.",

Besides being rewarded with the affiliate code whenever someone new join and deposit, the marketing teams of such casinos select certain popular streamers on YouTube or Kick and provide them with monthly or weekly balances on their casino platform which they can use only for playing. Additionally they receive payment based on their deal and how famous his channel is.I don't see anything wrong with this since we all know that casinos are designed to make revenue for themselves and not for gamblers. It's only a way to have fun and nobody is forcing you to gamble or follow any of these streamers.My favorite streamers who play a lot of Sweet Bonanza are Toaster and Juicy while I enjoy watching slots and Blackjack.",

      "body": "Most influencers are paid to do streams and win in most cases without paying a single dollar. The simple reason is that they use a part of the promotion money to showcase that anyone can win if they play with the algorithm. Those streams are nothing but shows wherein the influencers encourage viewers to deposit big in order to win big. Any newbie or a wasted gambler would fall for it and would go ahead and deposit a big amount. In the end, they would lose their money and again chase the loss. Watching influencers and realizing that you are doing nothing is a big myth.",

As for whether it was fun or not, I think it's relative because usually most people who watch just want to get a giveaway that was deliberately held by these streamers. I don't really know many gambling streamers because apart from having to fight over other users, of course it's more fun playing alone.That's my personal opinion so it doesn't represent anyone, maybe someone agrees or doesn't even agree at all.

The last time I watch was the time I was looking for a strategy to win on blackjack. They are not sharing those strategies but I think those who follow these streamers are just as curious about how to win on particular games. But the sooner I learned that they were given money by the casino only to play on them and share the live stream the sooner I learn they are only playing pretend.Win or lose they make money by promoting the casino.",

I am not  much into gambling but did see some streamers streaming while gambling and playing games. To be honest, i found them very annoying. The way they scream and react, made me cringe to be honest. And I doubt they really risk any money. Whatever they deposit, it's all funded by the casino. Whatever profit they make, they return it to the casino and at the end of the day, they get paid a fixed amount. So they really aren't \"gambling\" or risking anything and they don't care if they lose or win. Hence when people watches them gambling, they do feel that gambling is easier and that does influence to gamble.",
