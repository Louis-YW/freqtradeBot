  "content": "If you're like a normal human being, you'll get into a lot of situations where you feel too comfortable and lazy to do everything properly. This'll one day come haunt you back and have an incredibly large cost. And unfortunately, the cost will for some of us be part of the Bitcoins we own or, worst case, all of it.I'll ask you some questions.When you're registering on a centralized exchange, are you reading their Terms and Conditions? What about their Privacy Policy?When your favorite centralized exchange sends you an e-mail about updated Terms and Conditions, do you take your time to read the update?When you're downloading software like Electrum or Trust Wallet, are you verifying the downloads before executing files or installing?Did you ever thoroughly, properly plan a way of storing your seed safely and backups for it?Are you storing your Bitcoin on a device specifically used for this purpose only, be it a hardware wallet or an old laptop?Do you store the majority of your balance on a safely created, properly stored Bitcoin wallet that only YOU own (a seed generated by you)?If your answer is No to any of the questions above, you need to reconsider your attitude regarding the way you're storing and using Bitcoin. Never take security as a joke or you'll end up being one of the many, many, many thousands of victims of one's theft, a business's decision to seize your coins or the universe's decision to make your improperly stored seed indecipherable and lost forever in vain.For every question above, there's a reason I asked.QuoteWhen you're registering on a centralized exchange, are you reading their Terms and Conditions? What about their Privacy Policy?Exchanges may have KYC policies you don't know about. For what's worth, you may deposit your life savings on a popular exchange and next thing you know is they steal it from you out of what they call suspicion. But it doesn't end at exchanges. Not downloading the proper wallet can lead to this too, even if the wallet is very popular on the app store with many downloads. FreeWallet is the perfect example. They scammed their users out of probably dozens or hundreds of millions of USD. They do mention KYC policies in their Terms. Their wallet isn't even a wallet anyway, it's more like a custodial service. But who reads their long-ass Terms, right?QuoteWhen your favorite centralized exchange sends you an e-mail about updated Terms and Conditions, do you take your time to read the update?Years ago, Bittrex users found their exchange wallets frozen due to an update of the Terms which they missed or were too lazy to read. The updated Terms forced the submission of personally identifiable documents to Bittrex in order to continue using their exchange or even WITHDRAW your coins from them! In consequence, users found their funds frozen and many of them never got their funds back because they didn't want to send mugshots and IDs to the exchange.Quote When you're downloading software like Electrum or Trust Wallet, are you verifying the downloads before executing files or installing? By not verifying your downloads, you're doing a HUGE mistake. It's a great idea to verify and never trust just your gut. There's a chance Electrum's website is compromised and you're downloading a malicious executable off the official links. For extra security, ask even on Bitcointalk whether your executable's hashes are legitimate. Better safe than sorry!Quote Did you ever thoroughly, properly plan a way of storing your seed safely and backups for it? If you're not storing your seed safely, there are so many possible ways things can go wrong. Are you storing your keys on a piece of paper? Ever thought the text may fade away? Ever thought what you'd do if a fire started in your house while you're away? What if your dog eats your paper? What if your little kid finds it and decides to rip it into multiple pieces or even throw it away without your knowledge? Think of all the possibilities and find a solution to cover most of them. The solution can be as simple as using some washers, a screw and a nut.Quote Are you storing your Bitcoin on a device specifically used for this purpose only, be it a hardware wallet or an old laptop? If you're using Bitcoin on your main device, you're doing it wrong. A wrong click can easily lead to a big costly mistake. You may not even notice it until you send your Bitcoin.. to the wrong address!Quote Do you store the majority of your balance on a safely created, properly stored Bitcoin wallet that only YOU own (a seed generated by you)? Never store your coins on a centralized exchange. Exchanges have been hacked before and you don't want to be a victim of it. Just.. keep your coins safe under your own custody. Never allow a stranger to take part in your wallet's security because you never know what could go wrong. Not your keys, not your coins. Never forget this.Stop being comfortable. Stop being lazy! Stop underestimating what could go wrong due to your silly laziness. Protect your coins now, before it's too late!",

You need to know the terms because most of the existing users might be comfortable with some terms which would actually not sit well with you and without reading the T&C there is not way you would find out. QuoteI surely will check their update in Terms and Conditions if I get their notifications in email or on their social media channels.Not all platforms will keep you notified with their changes in Terms and Conditions.Do not trust any update notification you receive via email. There have been series of phishing scam attacks through this method in the past. Just go straight through the app or in build site on the app after thorough verification of the site before you proceed. Emails could be sent my scammers and the link there wound lead you to entirely a different site. Quote from: Onset on June 16, 2023, 03:10:16 AMYou’re storing your seed/wallet as a digitally-stored backup? What if your hardware decides to give up and fail on you?Cold storage of seeds or keys in either hardwares or USBs are also good storage options too like the paper method or washers. Just like the washers can be stolen and papers could also be destroyed, the hardwares or usb can also get damaged by wears. Although the usb should just be a secondary source of storage since it poises more lost risk than the other two it is much portable to move around than the washers",

A secure way to store your seeds is with the use of metal storage which is almost indestructible and last for decades. https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/QuoteQuote Do you store the majority of your balance on a safely created, properly stored Bitcoin wallet that only YOU own (a seed generated by you)? Never store your coins on a centralized exchange. Exchanges have been hacked before and you don't want to be a victim of it. Just.. keep your coins safe under your own custody. Never allow a stranger to take part in your wallet's security because you never know what could go wrong. Not your keys, not your coins. Never forget this.One of the wrong ways to start on with bitcoin is having you coins stored in any centralized exchange as you can go to bed as a millionaire and wake up poor the next morning hearing the news that such exchange has been hacked or for any reason concerning your data's your account has been frozen as simple as that. Having you coins stored in a non-custodial wallet where you're completely in charge of your seeds with no proxy knowledge about it from any individual on earth is something everyone should take serious about. Having a friend have knowledge about your wallet security could be dangerous. For a friend today can be an enemy tomorrow because the future is not known and personal interests may change with time. Having someone else have knowledge about your wallet security apart from just you is no different from storing your coins in a centralized exchange.",

What about their Privacy Policy?I would point out that although you should obviously read Terms of Use and Privacy Policies, an exchange having good ones of these does not make you safe. Even the largest and most reputable centralized exchanges have been hacked or actively scammed their users. The only way to be truly safe is not to use centralized exchanges at all, and instead trade in a decentralized manner where you keep control of your own coins and you do not need to hand over your personal data at all.Quote from: Onset on June 16, 2023, 02:49:48 AMWhen you're downloading software like Electrum or Trust Wallet, are you verifying the downloads before executing files or installing?Trust wallet is closed source, Binance owned, trash.

I remembered a recent story that happened in Russia. The official was given a bribe in bitcoins in the amount of 1032.1 BTC.The funny thing is that he kept all his wealth, that is, the keys to the Bitcoin wallet, on his work laptop, in the most ordinary folder.Just like that, sometimes people who commit a crime, through their own stupidity, lose what it would seem difficult for others to find.https://www.gamingdeputy.com/the-head-of-the-tfr-received-a-bribe-in-bitcoins-and-hid-it-in-the-pension-folder/Sometimes people are lazy, thinking that all warnings are nonsense, and nothing bad can happen to them.
