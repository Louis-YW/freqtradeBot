If you want you can inform them. I mainly focused on casinoguru, I see that their support has already responded in there, so they are definitely notified about this matter.I fully understand and accept that the bookmaker can change the regulations, but the player should be notified about it.The situation becomes even more interesting that 2 days before my account was blocked, they sent me promotional e-mails to the e-mail address registered in Poland (@.pl) and it was on October 6, only when I had a very good day and made a few wins (8 October) and when I tried to log in the next day (October 9), it turned out that my account was blocked.Recently, Duelbits has introduced restrictions and every time I log in to their website I receive a message that:\"Your region is blocked from accessing Duelbits. Some functionalities may have been limited. If you are using a VPN, please try disabling it.Do you have any questions regarding this restriction? Contact our support.\"And this is how a bookmaker who approaches the matter honestly should behave.",

Winz.io team is partially responsible for this inconvenience if they haven't notified you about this before confiscating your profits.Hi.I have added screenshots, both from one of the deposits (I can add more) and the last few email.I did not receive any e-mail with a change in conditions. I only received e-mails with promotions and incentives for further payments  I described it in the post above and of course I can provide screenshots of these e-mails along with the dates.Of course, you are right that the casino has a provision in the regulations, but does this mean that it can change the regulations at will and confiscate winnings in the name of the regulations?Following this, today they can add another country to the banned countries and next week take away all the players  winnings for that week. Then add another country, and another, and another, and business will continue...I just wanted to mention that the casino's behavior was unfair and I hope that casinoguru will approach the matter in this way and if this dispute is not resolved, it will lower their rating, and here I am adding this post to warn players about the fact that today or tomorrow their country may be found restriction list and they will lose their winnings.",

All e-mails from them came to my main inbox.As you say, it's a trap for players. Winz.io is quite a young casino and of course they made a mistake that they cannot now admit with honor.I think that if they have honest intentions (and they don't for now), they will solve these issues in the future by informing the players, but why should I be the wronged now?As I described above, Duelbits has applied this information every time I log in to my account.I have been playing for over 10 years and whenever the bookmaker blocked my country, they notified me very carefully, there were often periods to withdraw funds, etc.There was no communication here and the situation ended with the account being blocked.",

Similar incidents may have happened to many other players who used to gamble at this casino from the same country as you. When a casino suddenly changes their T&C and informs their customers, it creates a problem for the gamblers of that casino. Winz.io can resolve your complaint as their representative is in this forum. I look forward to seeing how the Winz.io representative replies to you.",

When terms and conditions change, a player has to accept the new terms and conditions, and this is done by forcing them to accept or decline before proceeding to the site. I see this so many times with different services. As far as I understand, winz.io did not do thisThey should have also blocked the player from placing any bets if they were from a restricted region. Again, winz.io did not do this. So if OP continued losing until next year, they would be more than happy to see him use their platform until he suddenly wins  This is hypocrisy at its best. All they have to do is to own up to their internal mistakes and pay up. Next time, they should Geoblock restricted Jurisdictions. What is so hard with that.",

Our aim is to demonstrate our commitment to fairness and customer satisfaction, even in cases where there might be uncertainties.Oh! This is great!I've been reading this thread in silence, waiting for Tomas' reply on CG before deciding what to say. Earlier today, the progress on CG was still waiting for their mediator to made a response. It seems Winz made a good decision and realizing their mistake. They  also seemingly learned from this situation and will try to improve their announcements for a change in ToS. Hopefully they hear what our community suggested and made a pop-up message every time the ToS being updated, or perhaps do like what DuelBits do.OP, if you can confirm once the rest of your deposit being available to you and withdrawn, and then lock this thread, that'll be great. Also... just to straighten some facts, I take a look at these cases,Quote from: rafanaldo7 on November 22, 2023, 08:33:58 AMAdditional Notes:   I would like to mention that if you look at the last 4 disputes on Casinoguru, they are all about the same thing. Sudden confiscation of players' funds after country restrictions were introduced (2x from Poland, 2x from Germany). I think this has become a mass practice and many players from these countries have had their money stolen if I read the correct cases that you've been referring to, one player's fund from Germany was actually confiscated because he refused to do KYC, another was having his withdrawal delayed and never replied back, probably because it went through. Likewise, another one got their deposit delayed and also never replied back, probably because it got processed [for these two, what future their account will face, whether they'll be able to withdraw their full deposit or not, or will they get notified that they're now accessing from restricted territory, I think it can be a good instance to see whether Winz really do their commitment to fix their announcement system]. And the other one was actually counter-accused for colluding in sportsbet, and since CG did not do a mediation in sportsbet related cases, it was dismissed.",

The sudden change being referred here is a georestriction.Poland used to be allowed region, but then after OP registered, it's one of the excluded region, and thus OP's winning was [used to be] cancelled. OP was well aware of this change because his account got suspended. Amuse us and tell us how exactly could someone work by this new policies, to readjust and comply completely, instead of raising a dispute because it's not acceptable anymore?And if you bother reading above, just two post above yours, you'll learn that the casino acknowledged this error from their side, and technically \"go low with their terms\" because they're kinda the \"wrong\" one here.",
