Yeah,that mentality in gamers is pretty much in almost every one of them,it is inflicted deep in their heart,the so called PCMR-PC-Master Race which think of themselves like the superior race in gaming.I don't know if I would do it,to lie to sell the GPU-s as I would feel guilty inside but if you have no other alternative (i.e no miners available to buy your cards) then you had no other choice but to do so.Where I live everybody think they are smarter than the other,it is genetic (although as a nation we are from the last in term of development in Europe) this is genetic to us,we think we are smarter than the other so I always tell the truth when selling the card,here there are both gamers and miners and I know miners will buy them and some desperate gamers will also do so.",

You need to make multiple ads and people will know you mined with them because who would need more than 3 GPUs for gaming.Not every gamer cares. Some just want to see it run and that‚Äôs good enough for them. For others I told them I‚Äôve mined with it and ‚Äúif you get any issues, bring it back and I‚Äôll give you another one‚Äù.

What video cards did you sell?I usually sell old graphics cards that are already 4-5 years old. I change the thermal pads if necessary, change the thermal paste, take a photo, then do a video card test for about 30 minutes. I take photos and videos.At the expense of mining, I answer that during this time everything is possible, because sometimes I am not the first owner.

Gamers only take risks providing the card was cheap enough. If OP has to lie like that, he's just greedy wants to milk more money from his mining cards, understandable but still a scummy move.",
