  "content": "Top 5 BTC Major Dumps Ever in All time History1stThis was the biggest dump of bitcoin history as in BTC early era on June 2011.. This dump happened when BTC value jumped to the maximum of 32$ from 2$ then suddenly a major dump caused the BTC value to be below 1 cent.Reason: The reason for this dump is quite interesting as according to data BTC gained value from 2$ to 32$. During the same time, the largest BTC exchange on that time MT Gox was hacked or you can a planned hacking caused hundreds of accounts to lose funds worth millions of dollars.Total Loss: 99% You can say that after this dump BTC was dead but at the same time you can say that it was the Rebirth of the global asset.2ndAccording to the timeline, this was not the 2nd biggest dump but according to total value/ loss, you can obviously say that it was again the rebirth of the BTC for the coming era. As the year 2017 who can forget the golden year of Bitcoin's history according to the official data BTC pulled its ATH to around 20k and for some unofficial trading data it was around 21k. After the ATH BTC starts dumping within the year 2017 its dumped to 12K than in 2018 to the 6K and then goes on till 2019.Reason: Primary reason was the profit booking and with that BTC cycle entered to the bear zone where heavy capitulation caused regular dumping and sideways market movement. With all this panic some hacks in Japan and Korea played important role in this Dumping era this was one of the largest Bear zones.Total Loss: 84% In this whole cycle. This was a total panic timeline where BTC was used to call by the name of a Ponzi scheme. Rest is History we know what BTC was and what is BTC.3rdAs by the total value dump the 3rd dump was in the early timeline of the BTC after the recovery from the 1 cent crisis in 2011, this was in 2013 and BTC was in its prime time as it was reborn and now investors were more hopeful and that was the reason it leads BTC to the major dump. The dump was from 260$ to 50$. There also Mt Gox played an important role in dumping.  Reason: The reason was the success of the BTC as after the 99% survival BTC was moving toward the most trusted digital asset network was growing and then boom. The MT GOX trading exchange on that time you can the say the power of MT GOX on that time was about equal to top 10 exchanges of these days, and it failed to survive in massive trading volume and the system collapsed this was a venerable time and hackers attacked and the market crashed.Total Loss: 83% was the total loss in bitcoins value and this was a total panic time as MT GOX failed again and it leads maximum investors to move again from the decentralized asset to the centralization.4thThe fourth dump according to the total value was the era between the 2011 and 2013 dump do remember this era was total panic and that was the only reason BTC faced continuous 3 years sideways movement from 2013 to the 2017 Q3. There as BTC recently faced a major dump of 99% of investors looking for another opportunity as an alternative of BTC.Reason: The reason is quite interesting as it was a Ponzi scheme that offered the investors 7% weekly returns on their assets investors jumped into it and this was the destruction point and the market crashed due to this Ponzi scheme scam.Total Loss: 56% total dump in this major crisis time a total scam of 700K BTC. 5thThe most recent dump was of May 2021 as BTC was I hype of the cycle in full Bullish market BTC hit the 64K ATH. Then our dear Ellon the shit poster not on that time but obviously he is a shit poster on the current timeline backed off from the BTC payments for Tesla products.Reason: As I have mentioned Tesla created a fud environment for the BTC investors by backing the decision of BTC payments.Total Loss: 53% total loss was faced by the market. The interesting fact was within a week $1T of total crypto market capital was wiped from the market and you can say that this was the real bloodbath after the 2011 incident.Current situationAs for now, our Ath is 69K and we are in the sideways market same as in the 2014 to the 2017 Q3 the total loss is around 70% from the ATH. we are stuck in the resistance of 22k and support of 19k and its moving in these ranges a total capital we have lost until now is around $1T+ but who know what is going to happen in the coming week so be a ready to bear is about to end these pumps and dumps are temporary so focus the future and book the ticket to the train. Many Lunas are going to fail many shitposters are going to trap you to buy in cheap. Small holders get tired and bored soon which causes capitulation and Whales win always grab the maximum in cheap.Source: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-biggest-bitcoin-crashes-history-180038282.htmlSource: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoinPoint to NoteSource:Unkown image sourceAlways remember many Dumps and Pumps are gone and many are on the one thing that can’t be denied the power of BTC and its potential as a store of value. Many Shit-posters many MT GOX and many profit bookers played their roles but they were just the milestones not the destination. No matter how it is going to be done but point BTC is freedom and this is going to be the world’s first and only digital store of value. There are questions in the panic situation that is BTC is a scam. Is it Ponzi our mindset is still not changed but in the future BTC is going to prove all these statements wrong again.Just imagine how many times repeated questions can stop the BTC from reaching the destination believe in the potential and try to get out of the mindset, it is not an investment Ponzi scheme it’s the future that you are going to build for the next generation and they will thank you for the financial freedom. Remember  Weak hands always lose money no doubt that you need to face a hard time but the point is what are you getting right now, you cant regain it after few years so as many of us crying now they missed the train point is after few years many of us again are going to repeat their train so think now.",

No one knows since regulation and laws becomes even more strict specially on the platforms and services tied up with crypto but it wont really bea total blockage if we do speak about adoption.Recognition is on the move as always and this is what we do need.Its hard and it might takes time but its not overfor this market and we would be continuing on the future years to come.",

Inflation and employment has risen to the extent that people are now more concerned about thier basic needs than investment. These challenges have greatly affected the Bitcoin space because very few people are thinking of buying Bitcoin, while others are selling to raise funds to meet their daily needs. Hence the Bitcoin market have become so unpredictable and even when predictions are made it is always negative. But the recent increase in the price of Bitcoin is a clear indicator of its maturity and growing strength in the global financial industry. Therefore, there are also chances that we have entered the Bitcoin bullish era.QuoteIt's notable too that most of these aren't instantaneous drops as a lot of newbies would imagine. Bitcoin has spent a long time to reach these -80% in price so that suggests there's support for bitcoin in the worst of scenarios and people still willing to buy the coin at half its ath even after a bit of a fall will come as a surprise to many too.The rate of acceptance and support Bitcoin have received in recent times even at this bearish market is real magical. In this season we have seen increase in the use of Bitcoin in most developing nation who perceive the currency as a hedge against inflation and escape route for high bank charges. Also more nation's are recognising Bitcoin as a means of exchange, while a nation currently adopted it as a legal tender. I think Bitcoin have even accomplished more recently even in the face of attacks and drop in price.",

Because they have no choice but to adopt it and be with what the current technology offers to the masses. But at the same time, we know the foundation of bitcoin and it being decentralized, that's really one of the counterparts of it for which somehow contradicts its main purpose from the beginning of its creation.",

I saw this BTC Macro RSI chart in one of the telegram group (Bitcoin News) I am following which states that, we might be seeing a  \"bullish breakout of its trendline since January 2021 top\" and this pattern has occurred in previous years before the big rally upward. Can we see the same thing happening again going forward for Bitcoin price?However, in all situation, I believe that investing in Bitcoin during this time would be a wise choice by anyone.",
