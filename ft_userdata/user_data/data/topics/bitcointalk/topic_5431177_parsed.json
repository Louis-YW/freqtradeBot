Unfortunately, he dug the hole deeper. According to Nansen Research, he lost  $100 million in Ethereum and USDT playing at crypto casinos like Stake, Bitcasino, and others.

The source seems not credible and this kind of news is unbelievable for the likes of SBF to resort on gambling and loss 100M usd funds while his exchange and other projects is earning everyday. I believe this article is just another theory and this time they decided to us gambling to promote casino even in negative publicity.It's very hard to believe a news like this considering the background of SBF is pire on trading. Maybe a lose on futures trading is more believable rather than losing that huge amount of money on blackjack table that known for having a max bet. It will take a very unlucky lose streak to lose all that money on BJ since it has a low house edge.",

Each day we keep hearing more damning news about the controversial and imprudent life of SBF. How on earth would a sane man think that the best option to come out of a debt or regain a loss is to go gambling? Nobody can comfortably prove that he can accurately predict the outcome of games. Gambling is a game of chance and luck. I am sure he is addicted to gambling because blowing $100m without consideration or remorse is a pointer that he is a long-term gambler. I think he would get an increased prison term if this information is correct because it is sure proof that he recklessly used the customer's funds.",

It is incredible he also managed to get bail.I have never managed more than a couple of hundred of dollars at the same time and I think I could have done a better job than that clown, who ruined some many people's Christmas this year. What is next? News about SBF performing blood satanic rituals to get the money back?",

I mean, it's not like they have a successful exchange and other projects bringing in money every day or anything. No, no, it makes perfect sense that they would just throw all their money away at the blackjack table. Seriously now, I agree with most of the commenters here. The source of the article doesn't seem very credible, and I find it hard to believe that someone like SBF, who has a background in trading, would resort to gambling and lose that much money.

This kind of news will be on the major news channel if the source is legit but since the only article about this is only the link shared by the OP, We can conclude that this just a hoax.The article too mentioned popular casino like Stake and Sportsbet which is odd on how they get this kind of info of SBF gambling activities since casino doesn’t share private info of there customers.",

While the references for the article you are pointing out are extremmely shaddy, I do not believe that SBF would be that stupid. In case this story is actually true, he is either having some serious gambling addiction issues or this may just well be only FUD as the media always tries to go after this sort of news and makes a lot in turn, so it is more possible to be FUD than reality.",

But once you're in debt, what do you do? It can be tempting to use a large fortune to gamble, but the consequences can also be that you become completely bankrupt and then the consequences are incalculable. The example of 100 million is a very large amount, by the way. And your reputation has also been seriously damaged by such a thing.",
