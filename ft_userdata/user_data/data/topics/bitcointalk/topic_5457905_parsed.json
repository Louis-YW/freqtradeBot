If you have watched some Economics discussions, some of the experts are saying that this recession is a planned recession since Covid. If so then all these layoffs, bankruptcies, and company shutting down is part of the plan. I'm not an expert on economics but when Blackrock applied for BTC spot ETF, many of its counterparts are also applying for BTC ETF which it is speculated that BTC will also pump up.",

For Bitcoin's upside potential, it has done surprisingly little. And the fact that you expected this to be the last pump on bitcoin is only because you were not here in 2017 during the previous mania as well as in 2019 when support lines for suicides were created en masse.",

ThanksDo not ask forgiveness even you asked a legitimate question (of course to some it is legit and to some is not). The pumping of Bitcoin is not yet started in serious mode, as the current spikes are due to many of reasons, and the main reason for EFTs is already mentioned by Bittraffic. so i will mention others like the adoption of crypto in different countries like Hong Kong, USA, etc. Like in HK, the government made plans to convince those who are still skeptical about crypto to invest in it. while on the other hand, amid the legal cases and bans from SEC and CFTC, the US now promoting crypto, like they announced to come up with their own crypto exchange (i think the name is EDX). This news urges big institutional investors to invest in BTC and many institutions bought the shares from MicroStrategy which means they bought BTC indirectly. This increased the trust of other people and hype created among people. This hype has become so intense that small news is making impacts on the price of BTC now (in up trend).As i mentioned at the start BTC is not started to take pump so this news is not enough to make big pumps happen. Let's see what we see next,",

      "body": "The current hype around CBDCs and the continued potential of cryptocurrencies can seem overwhelming unless one is actively involved. Bitcoin's tenacity and recent streak, given the global economy's state, might be surprising, yet not completely baffling.Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often termed \"digital gold,\" a secure asset that remains aloof from typical market dynamics. This characteristic helps Bitcoin thrive even amidst an uncertain economy, making it a viable shield against inflation and market volatility.Conversations around replacing the dollar and the rise of CBDCs fit into the larger storyline of monetary evolution. As technology propels forward, digital currencies offering security, efficiency, and universal access are growing in allure. CBDCs serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the nascent digital currency realm.",

The recession or not is not going to affect bitcoin the way you are looking at it especially now it is getting closer for the next season of bull run. Around the COVID-19 time that it was suppose to be a bear but because it just had the split, it didn't have any draw back to price increase to $64k.

It is still at a very low level in my opinion and gives a buying opportunity. I think you've heard of the halving and wondered what caused the recent spike. The reason is the approach of the halving and the expectation of a bull run. For a long time bitcoin has been in a stagnant state. So it hangs around 25-30k. In some periods, its value fell a lot, but it quickly recovered. Since the expectation of those who follow Bitcoin is that there will be a bull run in the next 1-2 years, the things mentioned may seem like bitcoin is pumping to you. We haven't seen anything yet. Bitcoin will have much better times.",

I am no means an expert in economics as you can clearly tell, would appreciate if anyone who had the knowledge could shed some light here. Always keen to learn. ThanksNot an economist either but it is base on one thing. Many investors during recession or inflation which is the leading indicator for recession actually look for assets that are stores of value like gold to buy just to have an hedge against the inflation, because most of the traditional currencies are mostly affected or devalued during this period. In the past people relate bitcoin as an highly risk asset so they don’t invest in it during this period but as bitcoin spreads people have actually seen that although the currency is volatile it is much better than the traditional currencies and an easy asset to buy than the usual gold, so they just go on to invest in bitcoin which result in the upward rise of the coin. Although the above view is a general one this current pump can be accustomed to the fact that halving is fast approaching and many feel this is the right time to accumulate more before the halving which spear heads the major bull run in cryptocurrency.",

ThanksAs with anything in the crazy world of currency and stock markets, it can be pretty much impossible to pinpoint the factors that send it in a certain direction. If people think the future is looking bright again, or that they may be able to borrow money and invest it into this asset for greater returns - then it will start to pump. Bitcoin has now weathered quite a few storms and is still standing, so it shows that it has longevity. You have the super rich who have so much money that sometimes they feel like gambling on these new assets out of sheer boredom. Celebrities might be jumping back on to the hype train, or there might be a fresh exodus of money trying to leave Russia after the recent mutiny.",

I would rather say bitcoin price is showing signs of stability. Also I wouldn't say that the world is going into a recession just yet. US could go to recession but that does not mean the world goes into recession. What happens in US, stays in US. The market is actually gearing up for the upcoming halving. It is expected to happen in 2024 and the new supply of bitcoin is going to be reduced. So the price of Bitcoin is expected to increase in near future. The market is just gathering momentum now.
