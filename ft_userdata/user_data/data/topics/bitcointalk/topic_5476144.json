Experiencing the end of the year is a great time for many people to witness. Those that have not achieved their targeted goal for the year will want to do anything possible to achieve that within this short period of time, hence they can fall victims of this scams and fraud projects that bring in good offer to entice them with. This is a period where many projects are expected to come in especially as the bull run is being anticipated for.

They make mistakes by own and say that the project is scam. Means scammers just create a suspicious link regarding any good project and the newcomers just click and they lost money. Always make a proper research because your money is important for you and think before investing and search about the project. The hackers also create like gift links and others method they use and when you click that link they grab money and even they can steal your personal information. So be careful and ask from well experienced people they will give a good advice. And OP thanks for sharing this valuable advice.",

Scaming happens not only in the cryptosphere but across many places that harbour December celebrations because of the holiday but I love the reminder. I also think this space experience lots of scamming activities that such type of scams are nothing new again but more importantly, it is good to talk about security details and how to safeguard incase of any form of impersonation like:Fill any form that involved submitting private keys and Seed phrase; avoid.Giving out your emails and passwords.Claiming free airdrops that may poison wallet addresses; in most cases, they wipe out wallet addresses when you interact with those airdrop platforms.Don't accept giveaways, most time you will be risking your privacy because giving your details like wallet address tells them you may have coins in that wallet which can become a point of target.There is nothing free, even the airdrops today require your time and maybe interaction with the blockchains, run away when you see anything free in the street of crypto.",

If you are offered with too good to be true projects or investments, obviously those are scams so always think a thousand times before you bite their offers. If you really want a secured and highly profitable and guaranteed investment, then trust only bitcoin. Bitcoin might be quite expensive than altcoins, but with long term hodling, you will reap totally life changing profits.This is the season of spending, so to avoid regretting after, know your limits before you try to spend. Christmas cash gifts and bonuses are highly expected, so use it wisely through bitcoin investment or any other proven profitable investments, and not just use for merry making and partying.",

When I saw this thread what came to my mind was this thread which just a year ago warning of fake Santa, and yet again we are here warning again. There’s going to be lots of new fake projects on this again but the easiest way I think people will get caught is the issue of phishing attack through the clicking of giveaway links either on social media or either exchanges. We all know how some exchanges will want to reward some members or rather generate more traffic to the platform during this period by organizing some giveaways, although most from the top exchanges could be genuine but we all know that scammers will exploit this means to spread around fake or phishing sites. The best precautionary measure will be to avoid any giveaway links or others and be wary of links they receive this festive period. If there is large funds on software wallets use this period to transfer them to cold storage.",

Although there's no time that people don't invest, as long as they have the money, they always invest, but I think during a holiday period like this, people are more concerned about reaping the harvest of their early investment because they need the money to be able to make their holiday enjoyable. Unless you are an absolute amateur, otherwise people are aware that this period is usually when scammers and Ponzi schemes erupt and disappear before the beginning of the next year.When I got rubbed off about $500, it was in the year 2020. Just in the month of November (12th day), I made that investment with the hope of getting my 20% ROI on the 13th of the next month (December). I got disappointed, and not only that, the company crashed and my money was gone. A lesson well learned",

This last paragraph impresses me so much like being contented, one thing that make people fall victim of circumstances or get into danger and problem is lack of contentment like you want to reach the level that another person has reach or you want to do things they're doing in other to meet up life obligation. It is important that no matter how little you have you should be okay with it then strive hard to get more in a legit way, don't be influenced by peer pressure as this is also one of the major cause of lack of contentment because you see that your mates are making it through illegal means then you also want to join the trend and do what they do it can lead to loss of life, being apprehended by the government or tarnishing your reputation. Don't use because others are rushing to invest on a particular coin then you also rush and join them without knowing the sustainability of that coin. Invest and trade with caution and also invest an amount that wouldn't affect your mental health if anything happens to your investment. Above all be vigilant and take the security of your asset, privacy and environment of utmost priority as you are accountable to whatever thing that happens to you. Chill and have fun throughout the Yuletide period.",

When investing in a newly founded project, whether we are amateurs or experienced investors, we should exercise due diligence because there are a lot of new Crypto projects being established during these times, especially now that the bull run is almost here. Before investing in any kind of project, careful investigation is necessary because there are many scam projects in the cryptocurrency space that aim to steal people's money.

We should be on the lookout for projects that make unrealistic promises, they are not real.

This is an important part that every cryptopreneur must know and keep in mind: your keys are your money, and when you use a wallet where the keys do not belong to you, the money does not belong to you. That is what utilising a custodial wallet entails, which is why we are urged to use a non-custodial wallet so that only you have access to your wallet and your coins.People make the error of utilising a custodial wallet, or rather, they ignore this advise and store funds on a custodial wallet since they are much easier to set up and spend your money on, ignoring the risk of losing your money to scams and hacks.",

Yes surely one of the biggest problem we have is lack of  contentment. We are not always contented and that always leed to greed. Most investors fail because of greed. Take for example, having some $$$ in bitcoin and you think it's not growing as expected because you think the price is too high. And it can not grow to %200 or %500 in a day. So you choose to invest in new shit coin that just entered market with a massive pump of about %2000. And if paradventure the coin fall dip to by %100 all your money is gone. And it may never rise again.",
