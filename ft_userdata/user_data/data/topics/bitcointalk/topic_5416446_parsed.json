Usually the delivery of the Ledger company's products takes no more than 2 weeks (according to information from their website). If you want to clarify the exact time of delivery of the parcel to your country, you can look at the link in the support section - https://support.ledger.com/hc/eu/article_attachments/4503870263069/FAQ_-_delivery_time.pdfFor US, express delivery will be 4-5 days, and economy shipping will be 1-2 weeks.In fact, all the information is available on the official website of Ledger in the support section - https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/sections/4404369938321-Orders-and-Shipping?support=true.",
