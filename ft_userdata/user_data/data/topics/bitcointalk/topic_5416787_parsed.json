  "content": "Alik BakhshiDespair is a sign of defeatThe Russian army is losing in a conventional war with Ukraine, which received Western weapons, which, as it turned out, are superior to Russian ones. The Ukrainian army from defense, having crushed a significant amount of Russian military equipment and manpower, went over to the offensive. Putin, who did not expect such a turn of events, was forced to announce mobilization in the hope of saving the difficult situation at the front. The bragging of the Russian Fuhrer that Russia has weapons that have no analogues in the West turned out to be quite true, because in terms of accuracy and efficiency they cannot be compared with the weapons transferred to Ukraine, and, I must say, not the latest modification. The situation was exacerbated by the collapse of the Kerch bridge, which infuriated Putin. Out of desperation, the mad dictator, unable to defeat the Ukrainian army in battle, began to throw missiles at the civilian population of cities. Biden, who has so far refused Zelensky's pleas to close Ukraine's skies, has finally made up his mind to provide anti-missile weapons. Now the question arises, will a desperate Putin resort to unconventional weapons?By the way, does Russia even have the opportunity to win the war with Ukraine? The fact is that, if we look at history, Russia has lost every war since the time of Napoleon, except for World War II, in which it defeated Germany with the help of the United States and Great Britain. In three battles, Russia lost to Napoleon: the battle of Austerlitz, in the battle of Smolensk and near Borodino, and in all of them, having a significant numerical superiority. Further, Russia was defeated in the Crimean War (defense of Sevastopol) 1853-1856. Russia lost the war with Japan in 1905. Russia was defeated by Germany in World War I. In 1920, Russia was severely punished for invading Poland, in which Lenin intended to establish Soviet power. Then Tukhachevsky's army was defeated near Warsaw and Moscow had to sign an unfavorable peace treaty, according to which Russia pledged to pay 30 million gold rubles and return all cultural property exported from 1772, when Poland was a colony of Russia. Russia suffered a setback in the shameful Afghan war of 1979-1989. Finally, Russia lost to the democratic West in the Cold War, eventually disintegrating into 15 states.The St. Petersburg bandit and liar, who imagines himself a connoisseur of history, did not bother to find reasons in a series of military defeats and did not step on the same rake. In the article “Great Russian chauvinism, and Putin is his Fuhrer” (https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/21133.html), I wrote, “... every empire is disintegrating and Putin’s Russia is like drowning in a swamp bog, when every gesture only brings inevitable death closer , and this time there is hardly a wise guy holding out a saving hand. I hope now the West has understood what Russia is and will bring the matter to the end, leaving no chance for the monster from the era of lizards to be reborn again.The defeat of Putin's Russia in the war with Ukraine will certainly lead to the fall of Putin's bloody regime and save the world from the threat of nuclear war.10/11/2022Tags: war in U",

And there have been a bunch of deaths in the Ukraine military... despair... way more deaths than Russia. The deaths include a bunch of military people from the US and Nato countries, and the NAZI Party.When you listen to Zelensky calling for the US and Nato to nuke Russia while there still is time, you can even hear the despair in his voice.",

Almost the entire territory of Europe remains under the rule of Germany and Italy. How do you like that?",
