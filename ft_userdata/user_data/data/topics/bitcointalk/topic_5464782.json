  "content": "So i've been a trader since early 2017 and i have never seen such low volatility in market. Even at the time of 2018 bear run the things were quite slow but this time its totally different. It makes a move and consolidates for like a month or two now. Which was never the case in past.Its possible that only i feel like that and other people still see it like the normal bitcoin trend. But there was fun every week in crypto before. What do you guys think ?? Is it just me or some of you others feel the same?? And if it is like that then what do you all think when the wild ride start again like old days ??",

      "body": "As bitcoin becomes more established and the price has grown since it was first traded at less than $0.01 it is normal that we have periods of low volatility. This tends to happen in companies as well, small caps are more volatile than when they have been around for years, have established themselves and their price has risen sufficiently, when they become large caps.Quote from: joker1313 on August 28, 2023, 03:42:18 AMAnd if it is like that then what do you all think when the wild ride start again like old days ??[/i][/b]I would say that in the time until halving we should have a rise to the $40,000 area or thereabouts, with ups and downs, and after halving we should go much higher. We are in the calm before the storm.",

Simple. Really ? when in past ? if you go back to the last bear run the price ranged between 3000-4000 for a long period of time. But thats equivalent to 30% . Have u seen such moves in recent days ?? I dont think so. Its just that BTC is more established now and the volatility is gone.",

Probably summer could be the reason and if there is high volatility in october then we know for sure that summer is the reason. 2018-19 bear run was slow right but not like these days. gotta have high hopes from october then",

I don't think this is the first time for crypto to dump in the market, and it will not be the last, which are part of some of the things crypto traders must experience before they can swim in profits making when the price of Bitcoin is pumping in the market. Once you begin to see things like this in the crypto market, you don't need to panic in that period than to focus on the market to see what potential traders are doing at the moment because they don't trade when there is bearish season than to continue holding.",

      "body": "Now, it is different from a few years ago, when crypto has become increasingly popular and has attracted more people to use crypto for trading. That is what makes the movement or volatility of the crypto market unpredictable. I feel the same way when I see what's going on in the market, especially since the current market conditions have more coins to trade, making it difficult to analyze the coins.And when the market gets to what it is now, it's not likely to go back to how it used to be but it's probably going to be wilder than it is now. So if you don't learn to analyze more, maybe you will find it difficult to profit from trading. Only by continuing to learn can we adapt to market movements.But you shouldn't worry too much because you can still benefit from market volatility. For this reason, we are required to have better analytical skills than before.",

The price can still regain an upward wave if we continue to stay above $26,000, and thus the door is still open to reach $40,000 before the end of the year.

I think bitcoin normally dumps and rises again, and investors have taken it as normal because we already believe that we will take any risk in our investment, so worrying about the current price is useless. As you said earlier, any investor who wants to gain a profit from his or her investment must have patience, as he needs his money back with even profits.Besides, he said he is a trader, which by all means means a trader needs to take any risk that involves the fact that trading has a higher risk than investment either. However, maybe the reason the OP is worried is that he may have gone and invested the amount he could not afford to lose, and he saw that the price did not go up again. That's why he is worried, and by all means, I’m expecting a trader to be the one that can even endure the risk of crypto investment because they are doing the most high-risk thing in the crypto space.So hopefully the price of bitcoin will go higher than the current one because, as you can see, early this year, the price of bitcoin was at $30k and came back to $29k; now it is at $26k, which means that this is just like something permanent happening in the market of cryptocurrencies that will continuously happen. All we need to do is continue holding our investments, and for those who wish to buy now when the time to sell comes, there is no need to even tell someone we are going to do that.",

There is no volatility like 2017 anymore. BTC used to move 10-20% in a week and it used to happen almost 3 weeks in a month. and now it hardly moves in a month. you might not see it as a problem, it was just a basic narrative that BTC has changed its wave length. there are less liquidity grabs ofcourse which leads to less people loosing money. but at the same time there is less movement in price.",

All i meant was there is no volatility anymore and i asked if you all felt too. There is no mention of any of my position or any of my trade emotion. whatever you said really made no sense for me. pump dump and whatever really, from 29 to 26. do you even consider 10% a dump in crypto ? no i dont. so dont worry about my position and my emotions. you might be a senior member on the forum here but as far as i can read your comment i believe i have far enough better knowledge n risk management than you  no hard feelings",

There’s a higher demand now comapred before while the liquidity on the order book is much thicker that makes sell and buy order doesn’t result to a much volatile market compared before.The existence of institutional traders that holds huge amount of crypto assets in exchange to their fiat money that is now injected on exchange liquidity makes the crypto trading less volatile. You will experience same liquidity as before if this whales removes there existing open order and start to take profit.",
