  "content": "QuoteThe Irish government is now paying 2,000 artists, musicians, writers, and performers a ‘basic income’ of €325 ($329) each week.The plan for the Basic Income for Artists was originally announced back in January 2022. The Minister for Culture and Arts is spending around €25m ($23.3M) on the initiative. Over 9,000 people applied to join the program, with 2,000 accepted. Those who were accepted into the program were selected anonymously and at random. According to the BBC, musicians, and artists make up the bulk of recipients, who will receive the stipend for three years.The basic income initiative was set up for those working in the arts by a task force appointed by the Irish Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media, Catherine Martin.The task force was created to suggest ways the arts could recover from the damage caused by the pandemic. One of the stipulations of joining the program is taking part in a research project to determine the impact of the payment.Dublin has the highest number of recipients of the Irish Basic Income for musicians grant, at 764. Cork has 212, and Galway has 148 recipients. The breakdown for recipients is 700 visual artists, 584 musicians, 204 film creatives, and 184 writers. Around 170 actors and others working on theater projects were also selected. That includes 32 dancers and choreographers, 13 circus artists, and 10 architects. 50 of the recipients work in the Irish language.The high demand for the basic income stipend was acknowledged by the government. Irish Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin says, “there will be a lot of disappointed people today who applied and didn’t get selected. I am very grateful to everyone who took the time to apply and I understand their disappointment.”“Ireland could lead the way on a new model to support people active in the sector, recognizing its importance to all people,” she adds.https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2022/09/12/irish-government-basic-income-artists-musicians/....Forms of UBI (Universal Basic Income) have been deployed recently.Above we see ireland offering UBI to artists and musicians.There are also crypto based forms of UBI such as the good dollar program:QuoteEmpowering Anyone To Onboard Into Crypto, Start Learning,  And Join The Coming Wealth Boom.The GoodDollar protocol uses free market forces and the principles of social investing to create a stream of free digital currency.Anyone can receive real, free reserve-backed crypto straight to your phone, so you don’t need to invest in order to participate and learn.That is how we build a more inclusive digital economy, together.https://www.gooddollar.org/I think denmark and perhaps a few other european nations are known for running stipend based (UBI) programs for college students.For them to be successful however the politicians running them need to be somewhat honest and reliable. Which may not be something every nation on earth has.",

As in maybe offer guides on how similar people have made it in the past or offer this over a shorter timeframe (although that might ramp up the pressure too much). I see a lot of people on social media trying to set up businesses and getting a good audience from it (whether the audience just enjoy watching the livestreams, are forced there by the algorithm or actively participate in the person's business is something I wouldn't know).The arts is a tentative industry at the moment imo (especially for actors/love performers) so this might do something to help realign that industry. I hope it encourages musicians and singers to make more/reasonable demands on record companies too if they're signed.I don't think the cryptospace for nfts is developed well enough to be decentralised to offer a way for these people to produce things and get recognised yet though either.",

What this kind of help does is to stop them from looking for a main job, even if they are mediocre musicians or writers.In a market without intervention, the best ones live off their passion, others who are good but not so good have their passion as a part-time job and the worst ones disappear. What this does is to support mediocrity, instead of excellence.Having said that, I want to clarify that I am not against public aid to people with low income per se, but not as a universal solution offered by politicians to the problems created by themselves.",

For example, in this case, paying a basic income to artists and musicians can make a big difference because they will work for money anymore and they are not under pressure because of economic issues or they will have fewer economic problems which can help them in their lives.",

My guess is this will have a negative ROI, as with most UBI expenditures. The government isn't as good as allocating funds as the market would allow. Meaning, if the tourism industry is sunk due to COVID, investing into UBI for musicians and artists in order to restore a dead industry that the market hasn't afforded a recovery for yet is money down the drain.UBI only works if there was some seismic economic event that put a large segment of the working population out the workforce. COVID and the entertainment tourism industry hardly qualifies.",

But the organizations and governments have changed their minds over time and now they will pay a normal basic income to different people in their country. All these will stop and never be mentioned again, UBI was a failure and no leftist will be recognized this failure wherever it was tried, they've tried spinning the result in any possible way, like counting those that sought to be employed as numbers that would mean anything.Finland is the greatest example, they started this in 2017 and killed it in 2019 since it was just money thrown away and nobody actually did something to improve their status, nearly all of them ended up unemployed for real. The actual results were so bad that Finland got the opposite way altogether after this:QuoteThe Finnish government argued that existing unemployment benefits were so high and the system so rigid that a person who was unemployed might choose not to take a job because they would risk losing money — the higher your earnings, the lower your social benefits. The basic-income trial was designed as an incentive for people to start working.But last December, the Finnish Parliament passed a bill to take the country's welfare system in quite the opposite direction. The new \"activation model\" law requires job seekers to work a minimum of 18 hours or enter a training program within three months and stipulates that if they don't manage to find a job, they lose some of their benefits.UBI is just a utopia that as any utopia will never work, and if does for 1 or 2 years what's next will be a hundred times worse.Just look at what's happening right nowWe had people doing nothing and getting paid, what has this led to?",

Any development by the government to help artists financially is a welcomed idea. Artists have nowadays resorted to other means to survive since the pandemic and as passionate as some may be, having a family to carter for, bills to pay and sourcing of materials for work may be the biggest challenge they have to face in this current economy. Creatives are needed more in today's society due to the fact that their thinking outside the box mentality can assist a governments economic, political, structural and educational standings. With corruption in government however, it is noteworthy to be mindful of persons who would handle such allowances, so as to get the best out of an initiative as this.",

This will definitely motivate all the artist in the country and anyone willing to work in that country as an artist. In the modern world it's value is always deprecating because it's too much concentrated field. Artists require huge platform, hard work and their entire work depends on the popularity. Many times that forms the basis of their income. For example, someone investing in art gallery to display their art, filling up exhibitions etc. This could take both money and their ultimate times. It's possible they may never succeed even with perfect art. Many of the artist face challenges to earn decent money in that way. Now I am not sure what was Irish Government's first take on this, but this will really help the artist and musician to survive average+ life.",

So it all makes sense for them! It helps in circulation of money as well as increases the purchasing power of the people. In turn, it increases demand and money flows into the economy. It's beneficial for a small country like Ireland. But in bigger countries and especially where the corruption rate is high, this is not a feasible solution. Like in India, if the government tries to start similar basic income schemes, most of the money will flow into the hands of corrupt politicians and their close aids. A very minor percentage of population will actually get the benefit. It is practically impossible for India to maintain sanity of such initiatives.",
