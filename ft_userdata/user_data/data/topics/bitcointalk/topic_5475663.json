Their children couldn't sustain the wealth. So first as a man before choosing to make your wealth also try to teach them how to preserved wealth I think that is the most difficult place were many known businesses has folded up even some we don't hear about their names anymore is because of lack preservation. I can say creation is a bit easier but where the problems lies is to sustain it and pass it up to the next generation which would happened to the third generation and watch carefully those who were able to sustain their wealth continually even to the next generation were thought on how to preserved and diversify their wealth.",

      "body": "Although I also intend to hold the bitcoins that I have accumulated for the long term. But maybe I will sell some when Bitcoin actually reaches a new ATH after the halving or when the bullrun reaches the peak of its hype. And I will start accumulating it again when the bear market comes again. My desired target price is probably more than 100k. But I doubt the current bullrun will reach 200k. But because Blackrock and many other large companies in the world started to really adopt bitcoin. So of course the next hype could be a higher hype than before. In the bull run yesterday there was Nayih Bukele as the president of El Salvador who also helped make the hype even higher. Maybe this time Blackrock's Spot Bitcoin ETF and many other companies will help lift prices to the highest levels coupled with the potential for the current president of Argentina who seems to really like Bitcoin. In fact, he seems serious about his remarks which are not pro-Central Bank. The point is that big things can happen at the halving this time. But I will always remember that after bullishness there is always bearishness. So I also have to prepare for the upcoming bear market.I also want financial freedom. So I also have to be more adaptable and maximize every opportunity. Both in the crypto market and in the real estate and property market. I have to be able to enter all of that to achieve financial freedom. Because only with Bitcoin maybe it requires more patience. But combining them all I hope will speed things up.",

But if your bitcoin holdings amount is below 1 bitcoin, that is not enough to say that you have financial freedom.If you know for yourself that you cannot save more than one bitcoin, there are other altcoins that can also help you when it comes to financial freedom; it depends on how you do your own research. Just make sure you know the right choice of other cryptos that are also listed in the top market.",

In fact, I believe it's too much to project the future based on what we decide today. Everyone is born with their own abilities, and we all agree that our luck is unpredictable in terms of when and where it comes. This means that even if you work hard today and feel capable of changing the fate of the next two generations, it doesn't guarantee success, even if you rely on the two generations before you.Life isn't just about family inheritance... there are many other variables that determine a person's destiny, such as talent, perseverance, creativity, environment, and so on.",

We can only prepare them so that they can be ready to face it and be able to survive so that they can also prepare their children later.We can give them an inheritance in the form of Bitcoin. And maybe at that time, the price of Bitcoin will be so high that they can use it for their future. But it depends on how they will use the Bitcoin we inherited. Our job is to prepare them and teach them everything they need based on the situations and conditions that will occur in the future.Being rich or poor is a choice. And as long as we can teach them about life and choices, they will understand it themselves. After all, every generation always brings changes and it will definitely be different from the previous generation.

The reason for this is that there will come a point at which the price stops growing and will be closer to what happens with gold.

It maybe a good action to do to plan for a decade but also we need to settle up our expectation since its also good that we have separated balance to use for accumulating more bitcoins. That's why its good to split up and use the other amount for daily investment since this could potentially give us more positive result and who knows in future all the efforts we made especially on investment and hodling paid off and we can secure our future with that also the future of our child.
