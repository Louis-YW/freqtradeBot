The 2013/2014...... 2017/2018..... and the 2020/21...... The first 2 both lost 85% before reversing upwards.. Can we expect the same now?  We keep hearing \"INSTITUTIONAL ADOPTION\" and a bunch of other buzzwords but why wouldn't it be similar?If we are to go 85% down from November ATH we can expect a $10,000 - $12,000 BTC.. Although the flag pole from the obvious bear flag that formed since November 17th takes us to $17/18k BTC.. Would love to hear some thoughts.",

It's love to know that Bitcoin will still be doing history stuffs in price and -85% from its ATH is juicy for those who really want to catch that drop, this isn't a financial advice but if anyone thinks it's bear market then be safe by converting it on stablecoins. Yeah, we are having that institutional adoption thing and it's a fact considering how huge they get onto the space in the recent years. Some institutional haters turns out to be pro now in crypto and in the fundamental side, they are considered still huge part in this bull run. Speculating in a bear market surely makes other to miss their marks since prices fall down that easily if driven by market panic selling.",

This time/cycle the rise was not so stiff, this time we had 2 distinct ATH formations, we are already pretty far from the last halving and this \"crypto winter\" was not so bad yet.Will it get worse? I don't know. Buit with every day passing we are getting closer to the next halving and the end of this cycle.Was this softened rise and fall a result of institutional investors? Highly possible. Will they buy more if the price goes lower? Also highly possible, since this is the actual meaning of buying low (but they may also sell, hence next ATH may no longer be \"fantastic\").But, as I keep saying, we don't know anything for sure until the cycle ends. Then we can look back and make a proper review. Until then .. it's just guessing and hoping.",

Buit with every day passing we are getting closer to the next halving and the end of this cycle.That would be my advice to anyone that has already lost, and can afford to lose whatever they've invested in Bitcoin. The halving has some significance, and it could potentially be the time where we see a new all time high or a recovery. I expect, with the current climate around the world, governments increasing fees, inflation on the rise, and the impact of the war in the East, we'll likely see some low figures in Bitcoin for a while. The halving which is two ish years away, might be when we start climbing out, as we'll likely either be in the middle of a recession or on our way to mitigating its effects.",

I guess it's trying to understand which would be the most useful indicators, but also we can't factor in black swan events, for example this MONKEYPOX joke they are trying to create now, or more Western intervention into Ukraine.

      "body": "First of all: we had only two times where the often mentioned bull-bear 4-year-cycle pattern with 85% depreciation really occurred: 2011-14 and 2015-18. So the statistical evidence for that pattern being a \"rule\" set in stone is pretty low.Both cycles were also very different if we look at the details: the run-up in 2013 was much more \"wonky\" than the one in 2017, with a 80% loss in the middle of it (April to July: 250$ to 50$) which could well be described as its own bull-bear cycle. Also, 2011 is often forgotten: it's also a short cycle (5 months of bear market June - November 2011) and with a loss of over 90%. 2019-20 was unpreceded: a strong bull run not related to any halving, followed by a crash to the previous low (although the pandemic was also an unique event).The problem is that we don't have really good fundamental indicators* with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, so we search for patterns like the \"bull-bear 4-year cycle\" to guide our investments. It is obvious that there will, for some time still, periods of hype and others of (perceived) waning interest - like now it seems - but this applies to every asset.Quote from: Welsh on May 24, 2022, 12:12:10 PMWell, eventually the market will stagnate. That's almost a guarantee, however we're probably a long way off of that, and the drama probably won't end for quite some time.Agree. Long term volatility (btcvol) is already decreasing albeit in very, very broad steps. But if we compare the current \"hiccups\" with those in 2014 or even in 2018 or 2020, situation is already much more stable (we perceived the past weeks as a \"deep crash\", but if we look at this graph the 4,5% volatility spike is barely noteworthy).Quote from: Welsh on May 24, 2022, 12:12:10 PMI think Bitcoin is still somewhat failing at convincing the masses that a deflationary currency by design, is the better option to their fiat currencies that are designed to be inflationary, and basically keep the poor, poor.I'm not convinced that Bitcoin really needs do that to succeed - i.e. it can also have success being a global currency which coexists with fiat currencies, very much like it occurs with gold, but with much better transferability (so it can really be used as a currency, above all for international transactions). I think this is a more likely outcome than Bitcoin \"replacing\" all fiat currencies. Traditional monetary policy has some advantages in some cases, being able to somewhat leveling market distortions only by manipulating the perception of \"value\" by increasing or decreasing money supply. I could imagine some similar mechanisms with Bitcoin involving bitcoin-based stablecoins, but it would not be as flexible as the \"fiat way\". As a reserve currency that \"holds its value\", Bitcoin is, in contrast, much better suited than fiat currencies, due to the inflationary nature of the latter (as you write).*I somewhat like crypto.com's estimation of cryptocurrency users. It is an ex-post indicator (i.e. you only can describe the past with it) but it gives some indication if we're on the right track. More exchanges should do similar research, I think.",
