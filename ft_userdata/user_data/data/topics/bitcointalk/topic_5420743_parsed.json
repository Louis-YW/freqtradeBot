The banner can link a thread where we can see all the scandals related to exchanges where users lost their funds for not having the private key, for using the custodial wallet.

If we all value the phrase then as team of the community we can have our personal text dedicated for it. Imagine majority of the members have same phrase, it will defiantly create a sense for anyone.Users who are not using there personal text for any paid advertising they can volunteer. We also can have a factoid on the forum advertising space.",

They still do it, taking risks trading, storing funds on exchanges as if it's their personal wallets. Mostly because they think it like banks where most knows banks is for storing money, where they don't want responsibilities to their money of securing whatever you warned them because of technicalities so exchanges will do the job for them, assuming that they will be refunded when a hack happens. Actually, i have friends who do like this^, simply avoiding responsibilities.",

No one can save the world. There are still going to be people who just stare at the message but go ahead to do whatever that pleases them. After all, isn't it their money? Now the interesting part is that there isn't anyway everyone can take their coins off exchanges even when they know the risk involved. Maybe investors shouldn't leave their coins there but not daily traders.",

Many people fail to appreciate the importance of this statement and the phrase will ring hollow, which is unfortunate.I agree, of course, that it is good to inform young members about all the risks of keeping coins on centralized exchanges and other services, but it is even more important that they understand all the risks associated with holding their coins. What good is it if they have their keys but are unaware of the importance of keeping them safe? We have had numerous examples of naive and inexperienced users entering private keys on various sites and forms, only to lose their coins to scammers. The point is, no matter how hard we try, some members are impossible to save if they don't make the effort to learn about all possible threats on their own.",
