  "content": "The main digital currency has started this year with difficulties, after so many events worldwide, bitcoin has not managed to achieve the bullish objectives that many expected, was it is so much that have  15% loss and after this it has been exposed to large imbalances, it has gone from a maximum of $39,850 to a minimum of $36,665 in recent days, an event of great tension since breaking the resistance so as not to continue decreasing, would drag this to values ​​of $29,620 and $28,060, which would confirm the pessimistic predictions.I find it impressive what is happening in recent days with Bitcoin, its bearish state is causing a stir among analysts,It is not known exactly what surprise it will bring us, and it is not only the case of this cryptocurrency, Ethereum is also facing this behavior and it is estimated that if both continue with this scenario they could go from a difficult situation to a critical, leading them to have greater and greater losses.But as always, nothing is written and anything could happen with these coins, as discussed in cryptobriefing Quotegiven the high volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the bearish thesis could be invalidated. Bitcoin would have to reclaim $38,000 for a chance to make higher highs, while Ethereum would need to slice through the $3,270 resistance level to stage a bullish breakoutNow, I wonder what is the reason for this behavior? Why can't it go up to extremely high levels if it seems to be being used by more people?Source: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-are-at-risk-of-capitulation/?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss",

If you're using same time frame you'll see the charts are same.Quote from: Wimex on May 09, 2022, 01:10:11 AMEthereum is also facing this behavior and it is estimated that if both continue with this scenario they could go from a difficult situation to a critical, leading them to have greater and greater losses.The reason why this token faced same pattern because almost altcoins will follow Bitcoin, this is why ETH's chart is similar with BTC's chart. This token was supposed to overtake BTC on 2017-2018 where BTC goes crash and the domination is significantly drop. But since ETH can't overtake BTC, ETH will never overtake BTC even BTC will face a hard situation, ETH will always follow the same situation and wouldn't work otherwise.QuoteNow, I wonder what is the reason for this behavior? Why can't it go up to extremely high levels if it seems to be being used by more people?Because of those articles and so called professional analysis predict Bitcoin will face bearish season in this year, including you. That's why many people sold his Bitcoin and wait until it hit the bottom to buy the dip.QuoteI find it impressive what is happening in recent days with Bitcoin, its bearish state is causing a stir among analysts,",

It cannot be the final value of your Bitcoin portfolio unless you decide to call it quits and sell them. So the best thing for now is to strengthen your hands and hold on. If you can successfully weather this storm, then you will eventually see a positive return of your investment sooner or later. Volatility and unpredictability have been factors ever since. So people shouldn't be surprised.",

It happened much more difficult than these things before, but Bitcoin managed to overcome all the difficulties and came back strong, so you do not have to worry, but you have to be more patient until the green color again.",

Only those who sell can be at a loss, provided they fall into the category of those who have not yet realized that it is not wise to invest at the time of the bull run. At the time of halving 2020 the value of 1 BTC was about $7000, and by the end of the year we already had about x4, a couple of months later x10. If you go back to 2016 and look at what was going on until the end of 2017, you may realize that some are constantly losing and others know how to profit.Quote from: pooya87 on May 09, 2022, 04:10:01 AMWhy do you try to stick shitcoins to bitcoin?!!He is not doing this for the reason that he is personally convinced of it, but he has only copied a part of the article on the basis of which the entire post is composed anyway.

(very strange methodology)what is done is they lined up the random speculative highs of the short period and then threw in a line below that parallels the highs.. it not attached to any bottoms of the last year.. also the 'scale' gap from the top line is not a justified amount either.. who chose the scale of the gap between the two lines.. what people need to do is to understand to never ever use the highs to then cry about the lows.instead forget the high's.. pretend the highs dont exist. and instead zoom out the chart. and then draw a line between the yearly lows.and follow the lows along a line that corresponds to the lows. where by the line has actually something to do with the lows.and so is actually about the lows.with that said..bitcoin is safe within its known value window (no im not talking about the price chart of meaningless lines crap).ethereum is about to detonate into PoS where their value window is going to drop 1000x in short yes ethereum will crash its value when it POS's but bitcoin wont crash to anywhere near the same scale",
