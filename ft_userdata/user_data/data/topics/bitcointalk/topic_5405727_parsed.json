Votality scares them because they have never, ever studied it, anything that is risky will definitely have a benefit. For those who already understand crypto volatility, of course they will use it to make a profit. You don't need to be a financial expert, you just need to learn to understand what volatility is and master technical analysis. if the goal is just to make a profit, understanding the use case of bitcoin or crypto is not mandatory, you only need to invest, if the profit sells.",

Finally we agree franky, also someone who wants any token to even be backed by a fiat shitcoin, didnt understand yet what Bitcoin is here to fix. Maybe its time for people to understand for people what theyre actually using and its good Bitcoin doesnt make it that comfortable, if they expect a user experience that adjusts to 0 iq, but actually its not even hard to use Bitcoin when using the brain just slightly.",

The knowledge wich usdt or other stable coin uses wich blockchain...it confuses also many people the interface of crypto and use tools still not easy to understood for the many people.Here, I disagree.  Stable coins are only good until stuff like Terra's complete disintegration happens.  They are good for very short term usage when you need to buy an Altcoin and there is no direct parity between your coin and the Altcoin you want.  So you go Your Coin > USD Stable coin > Altcoin.  Otherwise, Fiat Stable coins are I must say pretty much unnecessary really and a time ticking bomb, just like Terra was.  If you want Fiat, then just use Fiat parities which, I would argue, even these are time ticking bombs.-Regards,PrivacyG",
