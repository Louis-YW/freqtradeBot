  "content": "Hi, I'm new here, I have read lots about crypto and how to trade on Binance so I am currently digesting the basics, and I've successfully made a few small trades that made a small amount of cash (I was very careful and watched the market and traded with a small amount to get used to it).My question is - what happens if I make a successful trade with Ethereum, then I need to convert it back into Bitcoin, but in the meantime the Bitcoin price plummets etc.With regards to scalping, if someone has GBP in Binance, then they convert this into Ethereum, do a trade and earn even just £5, what would a trader do? Do they keep it as Ethereum until the price starts going down, or change it into another coin they can see going up, or change it back into GBP and withdraw it?Obviously there are a myriad of trading strategies, however I would like to try scalping first. I am trading small amounts whilst I learn. I signed up to Binance before GBP could be added to it you see, and I used to have to add GBP into Coinbase, buy Bitcoin, then use bitcoin to buy Ethereum in Binance, so it got me thinking about the rates going up and down and switching currencies and how not to make a loss, and also thinking about platform commission charges.What do traders commonly do in these situations? Any advice would be appreciated. Many thanks",

If you want to increase Bitcoin then should choose to pair with Bitcoin. If you are worried about volatility then stable coin pairs if better for you. Since you are very new I will prefer to trade against a stablecoin. So you will not be lost much if you can trade carefully. But trading is always risky, you would lose your portfolio anytime due to a bear market.",

      "body": "Why would you hold ETH for the long term if you see the price is going down? That is why there are limit orders on Binance to avoid losing or making a profit instead of losing. And almost all crypto depends on the Bitcoin price movement so it depends on the market if you are going to buy other coins or stay holding ETH. Since your trading strategy is scalping then you can only play on active trading but stay with stable coins as suggested above because trading with Coins to Coins has a huge difference compared to playing Coins to Stablecoins. Bitcoin/USDT/USDC or ETH/USDT/USDC and any top 10 coins on the Coingecko/Coinamarketcap are active tradings that good in scalping.",

True, it does really depends on someones preference and on ways which they do seem to be comfortable because we do have different plans and goals in mind on what we do accumulate.If ever we dont really like for us to be that avoiding volatility then stablecoins would be the best choice or options for us or even trying to accumulate funds just to be prepared for possiblebuying situation or opportunities which you could really able to see along the way. Most of the time people would be accumulating bitcoin as much as they could which is pretty normal or basicconsidering on which coin is sitting on the top then its no surprise that this one would be the outmost priority even i could say to myself.",

My addition to withdraw is that some exchanges cannot charge or little charge of transactions fees. Your idea to BTC into ripple is also a beautiful.",

If the trader is determined to do whatever it takes to earn more, they probably have a strong will and a \"why\" they trade in the first place. If you know the reason behind that, you will see that you will have a place in your heart to change what you want or accumulate a particular coin. As long as that asset you wish to, say BTC, increases in amounts, that's okay. As long as you continue to trade it, then that's going to be a continuous thing for you, and maybe in the long term, you will see that it was the right thing to do.Withdrawing small amounts wouldn't be ideal. Maybe you can just put it into an asset or a coin you wouldn't mind holding, even if there's no value or something.",

Futures trading isn't for beginners since you're trading using an underlying asset and it would drain up your whole funds if your prediction gone wrong, even you're an expert, personally I wouldn't recommend you to do futures trading. It's better to trade in spot trading because you wouldn't rekt as long as you trade with Bitcoin. I highly believe Bitcoin wouldn't touch $0 even though on bear season.",

Then once you have an account, deposit the amount where you can afford to lose. While using binance platform it is good to set your trading pair at ETH-BTC so that you can accumulate both coins every time you sell and buy, meaning you can earn to these two for sure.However, in doing scalping this is good if this is your skills, but if not, better not to try this for now. Due to it will just take your assets goes to disappear in the end for sure. Otherwise, if you insist to do what you like to do even you don't have enough yet knowledge here in the cryptocurrency trading, it is still your choice. And I'd like you to know also that things you want to happen is all risk, moreover, you supposed to be prepare on this matter.
