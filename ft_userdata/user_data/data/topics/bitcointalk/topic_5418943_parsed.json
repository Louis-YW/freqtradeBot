I feel this as an open space. You can say whatever you want here, nobody will be censoring you.You can't just abuse the system: plagiarism,  referral links, spam to bump posts, and things like that. QuoteI've also read some topics advising newbies to avoid unnecessary show of membership relevance, as this very act alone leads to desperation, and anything done out of desperation mostly don't turn out very well and might lead to ban of one's account in the forum.I also read a comment, when a legendary member said \"NEWBIES POST AS IF, THEY'LL BE PUNISHED IF THEY FAIL TO MAKE A POST.\" I felt that real hard because, I was a victim of this not until I understood that generally the forum activity count has been programmed to get just 14 posts in two weeks, which indirectly means we're only required to make just one quality post a day.So why the rush and pressure?I am have been in this forum for nearly 5 years on a dailyy basis and I don't agree. Newbie are welcome here. When I see a newbie asking a legit question, I always give them a merit. Because legit and honest users trying to learn crypto are welcome here. There is no pressure. If you are feeling pressure, you might be doing something wrong. Just read and post the truth and merits will come naturally.",

This forum is to share ideas precisely on Bitcoin but not any how idea. Even the questions needed in forum is based on Bitcoin not like other social media groups that you asked shit and people would be praising you. Your answers and questions must be constructive from your brain not copy and paste.Yes we solved problems of Bitcoin related issues. What are they learning here? Of course Bitcoin and it elements, features and it characteristics. So comparing this forum with another social media groups is an error. If you don't know let me tell you, if you or anyone wants to be prosperous in life and in this forum is learning how to trade and invest on Bitcoin. I am an experienced professional teacher in the forum. In my understanding to you OP. The subject matter is like an opposite to the op.",
