      "body": "I am sure that in the next 16 years, the price of Bitcoin will grow at least 10 times. Moreover, this is a very conservative forecast. Bitcoin's capitalization has already exceeded the capitalization of silver. At the same time, we know that Bitcoin is called digital gold. When Bitcoin's capitalization equals the capitalization of gold, its price will be higher than 500 thousand US dollars. At one time, Satoshi Nakamoto said that in the future there will be either a lot of Bitcoin transactions, or none. And 16 years ago, the founder of Bitcoin did not know which of the two scenarios would come true. However, now we know that Bitcoin has become a digital asset that is of great importance for all of Humanity.",

But now some guys can at least hold a portion of bitcoin comfortably for a long time, because times have changed and they now have higher income compared to when they met Bitcoin, so for them, bitcoin is cheap right now, just position yourself to take advantage of the chances.",

Anyways bitcoin has been too good to be true that's if you actually follow past trends and stuff. The price movement over the last couple of years have been nothing but massive. Bitcoin will continue in this trend much longer than we expect but the thing is people may not be able to accurately tell price movement as time goes on.",

It kinda make me compared it to 2 pizza although the amount of bitcoin is not the same although it's price would be different between today and before just like the bitcoin pizza. My answers to your question is that yes, we can gain in the next upcoming next 16 years since price is changing time after time so it means there will be many opportunities.",

People may think that it is over and bitcoin has hit its peak or its ceiling and that it is not going to grow any more but I would disagree. I believe in bitcoin and its utility and security are only a few factors why I think it would never diminish in value not even talking about the fact that it is anti inflation due to its fixed supply. Another 16 years and we would wish we have bought more bitcoins today when we are looking back. That is if you have not yet. Make every year count, grab every opportunity.",

Higher demand in higher transaction volume means higher price. It's an easy math especially if we know Bitcoin future inflation decreases with time, halves every 210,000 blocks or about every 4 years.How is 21 millions bitcoin cap defined and enforced.",

Bitcoin has long surpassed the value of silver, but it is conceivable that BTC will equal the value of gold, but it needs a much better position and time. When we think about it, gold is stable. Bitcoin could not be stable like that, but the way the gold market moves, it can be stable. We need to wait a lot, and we do not know if it will happen because nothing can be said for sure, but we can temporarily expect that Bitcoin's stability will be equal to the price of gold.However, it is true that if Bitcoin were equal to the value of gold, its price would be more than five hundred thousand US dollars. It seems natural to me that it will equal 500 thousand US dollars.Looking back a few years ago, we can see the situation with Bitcoin. And now, what situation has it reached in the present time?

It's a no-brainer that the price of Bitcoin would skyrocket after so many cycles we think about in a 16 years or so.So we can make as much as OP said and more - we just need to learn about Bitcoin, follow what's new about it, and keep our diamond hands at hodling.",

It is many risk if they do loan for investment, but if they do loan for trading and with leverages or futures, it has another big risk, they will be liquidated by exchanges and lose most of loan money.",
