Everyone can give their respective opinion on this luna classic issue but the recovery part depend on the team, if they will continue to work on the code or let it die completely is up to them. individual opinion may not help much in this case because Do kwon rarely act on communities opinion so it will be hard for anyone to draw a clear picture of what could happen with luna classic. Since you already understand the risk of investing in this project, your best bet is to watch and see what will happen going forward.",

Its supply is more than 6 trillion.  If it recovers $1, it will have a marketcap more then 7 trillion.  Where the marketcap of the whole cryptocurrency is like 1 trillion now. How do you get LUNC's market cap trillion there? LUNC will never be like this.  And it can never do anything good.  Because everyone has lost confidence in the LUNA company",

For luna Classic going to one penny it would need to rise over 11000% from here. And personally i think that current marketcap of $593M is way too high to maintain for a basically dead and stained project as this. There are hundreds of projects that have way more potential with 1/5 marketcap.Luna Classic is not cheap when you look at the MC of it.",

If already know about the incident which happened a few month ago then you will also know that luna already run their new token luna 2.0 as the name is luna . So there is lots of cause that is why it will never recover one of the cause is they loose the trust from people and if the traders invest in luna the will invest in luna 2.0(luna) on the luna classic. So my advice to everyone that avoid invest in not only luna classic avoid all which from luna",
