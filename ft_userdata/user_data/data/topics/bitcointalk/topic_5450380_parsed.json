At 50 BTC minimum.Fiat (cash) will be deposited into escrow, while your BTC will be deposited into escrow.The amount of 50 bitcoins is about a million and a half dollars, and if you want this amount as cash, it will look like this[1].I do not think that any sane person would try to do such a deal in a public place, and therefore you will not find anyone willing to do such a transaction with you here.You have two options: - Either you go to OTC markets[2][3][4], which are highly regulated markets, with prices starting from one million dollars. - Wait for government auctions where sized coins are sold.[1] https://propmoney.info/prop-currency-dimensions.html[2] https://www.coinbase.com/blog/announcing-new-features-and-services-to-make-trading-easier-for-high-volume-customers-in-asia-and[3] https://www.kraken.com/features/otc-exchange[4] https://www.binance.com/en/OTC-Trading",

Who needs that huge physical cash this day when the global financial statement has gone digitalised, which is more secure and privacy oriented? Carrying cash around is something anyone will want to carry about,  that amount is cash will need a mini Vulione van to covey to the point of the deal.",

OP mentioned about reviewing escrow service, it's not really a concern, as long as both agree, it's a small issue, the problem is the amount that needs to be transacted Quote from: itis1MM on April 27, 2023, 01:52:56 PMFiat (cash) will be deposited into escrow, while your BTC will be deposited into escrow.It is possibly one of the craziest things I've seen since i started seeing this forum   Are you confused? if it's an intermediary escrow service, maybe we can do online transactions instead of cash like you said? just a little concern, the amount is too big for me to interfere, keep an eye here and see what OP does next, really curious",
