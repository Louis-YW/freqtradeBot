Every trader likes to make profit and to know the rates of performance will be of interest.Hey palle11, thank you for your reply. I happily can provide you all with lots of information, but I was trying to move safe.  We don't produce any entry or exit levels, so we don't have a \"success rate\" at that means. Instead, we detect triangle like patterns, breakouts, and sudden price movements.Our idea is to delegate crypto traders’ chart tracking efforts to the machines, and offer this as an affordable service. Please give a chance and don't hesitate to share any kind of feedback: https://coinpush.app",

I know it's better if you'll do the same on FTX, like they have options on what price on a certain exchange of a token is, but yeah, I know you're trying to not do the same thing so I hope you guys think of something unique that will help your app improve even more.",

These are what I was hoping to read from you really.At the beginning, we were using an API provider called Shrimpy and picking the exchanges by trade volume/coin, but they stopped the service, then we switched to Binance as only data source. I'm not very happy with that and thinking about building multiple exc connections when we will be available for that development. Btw since the beginning we have been receiving many requests from the users about a forex version of Coin Push and started to build FX Rates Forex Signals a couple of weeks ago. Today I fired an announcement and got about 10 beta tester applications: https://coinpush.app/try-fx-rates-forex-signals/We will be trying to improve as much as we can before releasing the forex version.",

It seems that this is actually how it works. Oh no Ratimov!  That's not simply you guess. We don't provide any \"buy\" or \"sell\" signals. No \"entry\" or \"exit\" levels. Our approach is totally different. https://coinpush.app detects trends & breakouts mainly. This is done by our server application, no human intervention. Please take a look at the link.If we had huge amount of users, maybe signals would make an effect to breakout events like self-fulfilling prophecy, but no, not at this time.",

This cant be a scam as long as it's free and what will they get of providing wrong signals? But, for sure they can get a bad karma if they do so.
