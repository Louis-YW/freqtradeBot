  "content": "With a spot Bitcoin ETF seemingly being approved on the horizon, ARK Invest has gone ahead and filed for the first Ethereum spot ETF. I suspect this will likely be approved following Bitcoin spot ETF approvals but you never know. This would be a huge catalyst for Ethereum, especially considering the lower market cap when compared to BTC. Thoughts?",

      "body": "I am thinking that the companies that want Ethereum spot ETF also matters, I mean how numerous their customers are. I do not know much about ether ETF because it is bitcoin spot ETF that I am following. Do not think ether marketcap is low, I do not think so, but spot ether ETF can help to increase the price of ether further, but I do not think ether can surpasses bitcoin in the coming bull run even if spot ETF is approved for both. I do not know why Ethereum spot ETF should be approved because Ethereum is centralized.",
