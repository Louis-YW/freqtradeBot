But faucet is already worthless because the price of top coin or token is already high, you can claim 1000 Satoshi per hour in few years ago, but now most of faucet only give you around 10 Satoshi per hour. Usually they will ask you to reach specific amount in order to withdraw and you also need to pay fees.",

There are too many of them but you need to exert effort to check if everything on these list are still working and certainly giving eth for their faucets.Note that I'm not affiliated with that website or part of it, I just did a quick search and that's the first one to show in the search results.",

Faucet was popular years back when crypto is on their beginning stage, but now we are already in the next level, so I do not think faucet is still worth your time. Don't waste your time looking for faucet sites and trying to claim it all per hour or day. Although there are still bunch of faucet sites and you use all of them, you will waste your time only unless you have nothing better to do in your real life everyday which I doubt.",

But if what you mean is they are still a reliable source of income or a sustainable way to earn cryptocurrency, then I would say that they are not.Example: ETH Faucets were popular a few years ago when the value of Ethereum was still relatively low, and people were looking for ways to earn cryptocurrency without investing money.However, as ETH's popularity grew, so did the number of people looking to get it for free. This has led to the emergence of fraudulent faucets that promise free ETH but are never paid out. If you are serious about earning ETH, I recommend exploring other methods that offer a better return on investment. Don't waste your time brother.",

You need alchemy account to claim your test net ethereum. you can also buy test net token through use layer zero bridge and this helps you to buy test net eth with cheap price. You can use that moment to grind goerli eth and you can sell it for real ethereum. It's a bit better compared with grinding eth through faucet",

To collect dust amounts and hoping to hit a huge number?Trust me it is not worth the time and neither has the bitcoin faucets been after bitcoin crossed 1k USD about 5years back.If you need ethereum to spend, buy it with fiat or bitcoin, that is the easiest way to get your first ethereum without looking for faucets. Dont keep that easy money collecting view, it will waste your time.",

Even for cheaper blockchains like Polygon, Tron — it's hard to find working faucet that's giving at least enough for transaction fees. Sometime ago, I wanted some matic for transaction fees, faucet sent me, it weren't enough, it also required Twitter verification afaik so couldn't claim it again before certain time passed, plus the ads and captchas. If you are looking at faucets to make money, that's not worth it. If it's for some momentary requirement such as paying transaction fees, you better find other means (on-ramps, convert from some other crypto using instant exchanges (stealthex, simpleswap has low minimum amount as long as 'to' and 'from' both blockchains are cheaper, example being Arbitrum to Polygon), make requests on Reddit — there are good fellows that I came across while looking for faucets, I had deleted my Reddit account so didn't make one to make a request but if you are already registered there you can make it, I can't tell you names of subreddits cause they came through Google search).",
