Of course, I know you can ask anyone to sign messages with keys and all but it’s not easy to understand/do for someone who is not into Bitcoin (especially banks).Please, feel free to tell me my idea is stupid but try to explain to me why.",

That's definitely not the case here in the USA, and as far as I know it's the same almost anywhere.The term \"legal tender\" is wildly misused among Bitcoin hardcores, as most people assume it just means \"legal\". Bitcoin is legal in almost every country in the world, and there are relatively few restrictions on it in most countries.\"Legal tender\" is where a government forces people to accept Bitcoin as payment whether they want to or not, and is actually evil in the context of Bitcoin. You really shouldn't use that term unless you know what it means.",

A proof of ownership(without sending the BTC to the lender) won't work.Having a public list of proven BTC owners would become a problem, if some criminals/mobsters find out that the people on the list have Bitcoins.

It can function as a sort of proof of funds.It does destroy all user privacy though, so I'm not sure how this is ever going to be a useful thing. It would also depend on BIP322 getting finalized.
