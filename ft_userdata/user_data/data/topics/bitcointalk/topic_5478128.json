No problem to us that knew this strategy and have been doing it for so long. While for the minimum amount.Take note that not all exchanges are good with small amounts like $1-$5 because some of them have minimum as low as $10. So, that's just my concern but it's no biggie.",

      "body": "Buying Bitcoin regularly, investing small amounts, is a good strategy. However, I wouldn't say that the amount doesn't matter, and I also think that dong it monthly can be much more convenient than doing it weekly. The amount matters because of transaction fees. Bitcoin transaction fees have been spiking really high recently, with some websites indicating that a current average fee is nearly $30. Needless to say, it's not a good time to transfer Bitcoin, now even pretty significant amounts worth around $100. So $5, $10 are just not realistic sometimes, unless we're talking about purchases on centralized platforms, but, as was pointed out by livingfree, they have their own things like a minimum amount, and there can be additional fees as well.",

      "body": "I agree. While regularly investing a set amount of money over time (known as DCA) is a common way to invest in Bitcoin, it's not the only technique out there.  DCA can be a solid approach, especially for newcomers or those who like a more passive investing style, because you end up paying an average price that smooths out short-term volatility.  However DCA isn't the be-all and end-all.  There are other methods to mull over, each with its own pros and cons.",

That would be the best strategy so far that mostly works for everyone. While some can afford all in investing that indicates higher risk but majority still follow doing DCA as the risk to lose can be likely controlled.You can chose if you want weekly, bi monthly or monthly, that depends on how often you make an income. As long as you do it consistently, you can easily maximize your investment portfolio and make you instant multi millionaire after long, indefinite years of hodling.",

If you invest that money in Bitcoin then you will benefit the most. Once you start investing in Bitcoin, you will definitely not want to withdraw from the investment. Because investing in bitcoins will definitely increase your money, so you will always be engaged in investing. @Op I definitely like your move because with little videos it is definitely possible to own a large fortune one day with Bitcoin alone.",

Of course everyone does.Don't think too much about it and now how this DCA should keep running all the time for years, the most important thing is that you have to stay solid and manage all the budgets you have including not buying unnecessary items that must be put aside first.",

This means your post's main goal is to tell people who are spending money on things that if not bought will not affect your life. So, the title should be like the best advice for anyone going to spend money on necessary things.I admire your suggestion and it's a good one but it is also necessary for the investor to know the time it will take for him or her to become a multi-millionaire. Many newbies might be thinking they will become rich while having no basic knowledge of how and when and is it even possible.The strategy you have shared to invest in BTC is known as DCA and you should also talk about it in your post so newbies would know about it.",

I do agree with him, it's the best piece of advice who want a long-term opportunity in the financial world especially in the risk investment markets.I cant say multi millionaire but it will be the best investment of your life. For every nebwie most of the forum members do recommend this investment strategy. Hehe seems like Op is already pretty familiar with it still you finds tons of topics on this perticular subject.",

The gas fee is quite high and if youll only buy little then your gonna waste gas fee for a little quantity. As much as we wanted to buy a lot, better to go for bulk buying since the fee wouldnt permit as to buy and sell with reasonable price.",

It's possible if we're back several years ago but saying things like this is unlikely at this moment. You gotta be good in calculation to say that someone DCAing with a couple of backs up to a hundred weekly and within 5-10 years, they'll be millionaire.

Though that strategy is already proven to be one of the safest (if not the safest), and one of the best strategies especially for newbies, this type also takes time to maximize your profits. In crypto, you need at least 4 years to maximize your profits (that is if you believe in 4-year cycles), and not all investors have that amount of time to wait for their profits, so as much as I want this for many investors to be using this strategy, the older ones can't use it or at least they can't maximize it. If you're a young investor, doing DCA would be a good strategy. I just don't like the fact that you're saying that in 5-10 years, of buying every week you will be a multi-millionaire. Is this proven already? If yes then where did you see it? I mean I don't buy Bitcoin daily, but I don't believe that I would be a multi-millionaire if I did. Consider also the fees that you will be using as well. That's also the reason why many investors opt to buy Bitcoin on a weekly and sometimes, on a monthly basis.",

Right now it costs $10 to send Bitcoin to your wallet, it means the beginner need to save up their money first to a certain amount, like $100 before they can accumulate which is not encourage for me.Unless they are willing to learn about Bitcoin Lightening Network first which still isn't encouraging for newbies as they will feel its too complicated.",

If someone spends around $100 per week on Bitcoin by following a DCA strategy it would take around a full year to acquire to accumulate just a small portion of Bitcoin. At current price of Bitcoin and it's up moving trends I don't think that someone can accumulate a full bitcoin even in 5 years if he/she does $100 DCA strategy for consistent 5 years.The DCA strategy can help someone to accumulate Bitcoin but that strategy won't make everyone millionaire. I would still say that someone who invests $100 per week on Bitcoin will be able to accumulate enough Bitcoin in 5-10 years and that would make someone financially stable if Bitcoin reaches $1M to $10M a coin. You can of course become financially stable by following a weekly DCA strategy but it won't make you a millionaire in 5 years.",
