  "content": "Social media affects our lives in massive ways,in how we connect with our friends,the news we get,the interest we all share and possibly to actually kill time.so it's not surprising that the things people share on social media can affect the way things happen in the real world.However,social media impacts has reached greater heights by the massive and increasing influence that it  has on digital currencies like bitcoin. The relationship between social media and bitcoin is expanding in exciting ways in terms of adoption,position,price/value and even the popularity.it is used to convey information about the crypto world,as well as to promote the content about cryptocurrency.What people are saying on social media can trigger or encourage someone to participate by wanting to trade,mine, or invest in bitcoin.It started from the forums that discussed cryptocurrency’s humble beginnings. Now, it makes headlines on our favorite social media apps. With popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reaching all-time highs on a regular basis, it isn’t at all hard to believe that these digital currencies are trending. Trends on social platforms can influence investor behavior, leading to price rises or perhaps drops. For example,an announcement from Elon Musk that Tesla had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and that they would be accepting bitcoin for purchases caused the price of the currency to hit an all-time high.  Social media has the potential to affect bitcoin positively, but it can also have negative consequences, causing both large rises and falls in price.Perhaps,it is the first place people go to when they want the latest news on bitcoin;you see them in places like Twitter,Reddit and Youtube.They want to know what people are talking about and what the next big thing is.Basically, what I'm trying to say is that social media is powerful,and its high time we understand that no matter how good or bad a post is,it has the potential to affect the market. Possibly, I believe social Media will play a significant role in Bitcoin's promotion, indulgence, maturation and exposure because of it's educational power.",

Social media platform like telegram has been used to carry out various crypto-currency activities. Project owners has created communities on telegram, also those who render there service that's crypto based has also used this platform. Let's not forget that scammers has also made use of this platform to carry out their own activities.Many crypto-currency influencers are seen on social media platform like Twitter, Facebook and even YouTube some has caused FOMO, FUD, Panic, also some has been able to share knowledge that was very helpful to people.The bottom line is that we are in a world that is technically advancing and technology is changing the world so social media would always be relevant but it's time we also build up characters and habits that would also protect ourselves from the vices on the social media.",

The youths are very active on social media and they are more open to new ideas. We are aware social media is used to spread the good and bad. It has also been a platform for the spread of FUD and scam projects. Hackers use social media to spread viruses and other harmful applications. But we can not deny that the social media have been very helpful to the industry. One area that social media have affected the industry positively is the area of Bitcoin education. YouTube is now a center to get quality information about Bitcoin and other coins. There are also good classes or lectures on other social media platforms. We also have different helpful forums and communities that have also contributed to the growth and development of the industry. But we should always verify the information we get from these platforms because some of them are highly deceitful.",

It's hard for newbies to control their emotion and actions when they read good and bad news. They even don't have enough time to sit down, calm down and analyze news they read are true or fake.I think I am not wrong to say most of them are altcoin investors, altcoin traders or Bitcoin traders. If you are Bitcoin investor, you will not care too much about news and social media. Being a holder will not require you to use social media like Twitter too much.If you are wise, you can use social media to assess market sentiment and plan to enter or exit the market.Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful",

For example, first it was pre-internet (human to human) then it became internet of content then internet of services then internet of social media and now it is revolutionizing to internet of things. The point is, social media is one of the main source for every ordinary and obscure person, project and service of a person to become famous. Mean social media is all about advertising and main purpose of it has become to lure users to something attractive (like money, girls, or any kind of phishing scam attempt).There comes BTC too, news are mostly observed and shared through Social media where many influencers try to manipulate the market with there pessimistic and optimistic opinions. Which put positive and negative impact. But, i did not see bad impact of fake news on BTC in compare to other alts. No doubt BTC is not fud proof but it has lesser impact from social media in terms of negativity.",

For instance, you might be active on social media while having important thing to doing inside instead of to focused one might end up being distracted. Social media also affects newbie's investors meaning they might get a fake news on media thinking it's an automatic information, like for an example, a famous influencer tweets about a particular coin and tokens people might rush to buy such token or coin without knowing that it was just a trap planned for people to fall prey, after they might have invested heavily the project may end up sinking leaving people with regret.Sometimes there are fake news flying all over that may cause you to panic and sell or even making bitcoin price to soar or dip. Media is something we can't do away from our lives because it's an important part of our living but in as much as that we should be able to simplify and scale out the weaning parts of it otherwise we might ends up witness the bad parts of it.",

      "body": "It's about Power. You need a lot of it to influence the price of Bitcoin thesedays. It's not really the social media. It's actually about a person or people with sufficient Power to influence the price of Bitcoin/crypto. They are the people you need to watch or observe to see how their words, deeds, mood, etc can actually influence price. How many of such people are active or popular on social media? Most likely zero. The owners of the social media wouldn't like them as they are typically independent minded, do not speak like the crowd, have high knowledge and understanding, hence could be suppressed, suspended or banned. The media owners could only give them that privilege in order to take advantage of their Powers. If the media owner hope to utilize the power of Bitcoin/crypto users to power up the price, it will need just one or few people with sufficient power. The powers of the collective or a majority of Bitcoin/crypto people with little to no power won't be sufficient. They probably need to be trillions × trillions in number to be enough.  It requires enormous amount of Power that can only be found in people you could consider the real Heads who are gifted with really high IQ. They are incredibly few in number and are people with gift of light from the CREATOR of the Universe... The brighter their lights the higher the Power",

Ofcourse it would be hard to determine which one but social media is jist a platform. Messages or contents running through it depends on who creates it and who reads or absorbs it. Scams would remain accusation until it really happened. Generalization and stereotype on the other hand are things which are not tolerated in any field of investment. If Social media is being used to take advantage of those who are naive of this industry, then people should be the one to make an adjustment. Indeed if one is equipped with knowledge, no matter what platform that is  unfortunate events of such won't have any room to take place.",

I would say social media has help the circulation of news or growth of technology but one area it is hurt is the area where new generation are becoming more lazy for research which makes it easier for Ponzi schemes to grow.

Even when it wasn’t rampant scam projects or Ponzi schemes where spread because people are just greedy to get rich quick not that they don’t varify information but they just want to try them out and that is why there various crypto scam projects are continuing to be developed and still get investors. Take this forum for example upon all the efforts spread for people not to engage in deals with some forum members you still find people being scammed by those users simply because of greed. Quote from: Bruce4 on June 28, 2023, 02:39:29 PMHowever,social media impacts has reached greater heights by the massive and increasing influence that it  has on digital currencies like bitcoin.I would say social media has had great impact on just spreading awareness of cryptocurrency and has impact on Altcoins because of the Airdrops, ICO news spread there but as for bitcoin they certainly do not have any impact rather it spreads just short term FOMO or FUD. The likes of Musk can’t impact a bull run on market just like you started this things they do is just FOMO. Most of these social media influencers buy bitcoin during halving period because they know it is going to pump and most people think it is them impacting the price.",
