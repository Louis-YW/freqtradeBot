Thank youFirst you either are too naively to find a local trader to do that trade because it is easy to be scammed.Second you can be a scammer try to trap your trade partner.You can simply trade it on a centralized exchange and get USDC or cash from your bitcoin. Remitano is a good one if you don't care your privacy and KYC.No KYC exchanges are for you if you don't want KYC.No-KYC exchange encyclopediaBecause you are a newbie, you can not find anyone will trade with you here, because risk to trade with a newbie is high.",

You can trade directly to your bank account in your local currency via P2P with no problem. Moreover, if Bitcoin is legalized in your country, you can directly contact your trader and trade in your local currency. Your money will be directly in your hands if you contract with your local agent. i think it would better for you to trade your Bitcoin through binance P2P trading process.",

You can check on Bestchange or other directories whether some Exchange out there meet your expectations, but I will have to let you know most exchanges will likely ask for your documents if you are trying to exchange a big enough amount in Bitcoin. It would be better if you tried some decentralized exchange like Bisq with s small amount so you can learn how it works and then proceed with bigger quantities.

Reputable exchange is more ideal and you can getaway with scammers for using that option. If worried about fees then you can use some alts which less fee feature. The one you ask here is more risky and if I am the one who have that, I will rather choose exchange than people I don't know if I can trust especially dealing with huge funds.",

It's better that you follow what other people posted here and just convert Bitcoin to USDC using p2p in an exchange that doesn't have KYC, and at least the percentage is much cheaper and its more secure and your money is more safe.",

Bisq uses a 2-of-2 multi-sig escrow, while AgoraDesk uses an arbitration bond system, meaning scammers cannot run away with your money or your coins. I have traded peer to peer for years and have never lost a single satoshi, whereas the number of people who have lost everything on centralized exchanges is innumerable.Quote from: DaveF on September 04, 2023, 11:39:47 AMLBC and LC have both shut downOh yeah, forgot about that.

Daily millions of trading occurs on Binance so it's a clear indication that it is safe and secure. You should give your BTC, Ethereum, or BNB, etc. to your local trader, and on Binance P2P he will give you money in your native currency, If you talk to him maybe he will meet you in person to see what are you looking for is best for you.Besides this, I am also giving some more exchanges where you can also change your BTC into USDThttps://bitquick.com/https://bisq.com/https://paxful.com/These are some other exchanges but I do not personally use them so I advise your Binance P2P if you want to use one of the above three then you need to be very careful and do detailed research for better results.",

You can do this on a binance exchange, they will pair you with someone who will pay you with the exact currency you are spending in your country.If you don't trust exchanges well Binance is the most trusted on my list, so there is nothing to be scared of using this exchange. Find P2P on binance exchange and move your Bitcoin or USDC from Spot into P2P and click on P2P at the left hand side of your screen, then click on sell on top of your screen and choose the best exchange rate from buyers, from Bitcoin or USDC to your Fiat rate. It's very easy, but if you find this complicated you can go on YouTube and watch how to use P2P on Binance exchange.",
