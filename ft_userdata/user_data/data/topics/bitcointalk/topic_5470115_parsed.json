  "content": "I was using the BPIP tool and was getting familiar with it, and checked my profile and the section in the pic below was a little confusing for me, especially the lower part in which it says. \"Last Parsed: 8 minutes (Planned for 23 hours from now)\" What is the meaning of it? Like what does parse mean here? And what does plan for 23 hours mean here. Please do not judge my English, I thought it would be better if I asked this question here. I hope you all won't mind me.",

      "body": "As far as I know, last parsed means, that 8 minute ago new data from bitcointalk was taken, and used to update BPIP database. And the next update is estimated to happen after 23 hour. Basically, every 24 hour, BPIP updates it's data from Bitcointalk. There is nothing wrong with questions. New questions and questioners are always welcomed in bitcointalk. Its not a crime. If you are confused, feel free the question and someone from that knowledge will surely answer.",
