You can use a coinbase wallet, which is a good alternative.What are you trying to say here? The \"wallet\" is not supposed to exchange between cryptocurrencies without the need for a third party, and therefore you do the transfer using the interface of that wallet and third party (CEXs or DEXs) works in the background.So coinbase wallet can not convert cardano (ADA) into Tether (USD T) but coinbase exchange can.",

You can use a decentralized exchange that is running on the Cardano chain but i don't know how big the liquidity is for such a trading pair on the Dexes. Also you would get Cardano USDT then and you probably would like to have those USDT on the Ethereum or BSC chain i would assume.Therefore i would say that the easiest and safest way to get those USDT would be to send your Cardano to a CEX like Binance, Kucoin, Kraken or whatever and then simply trade it for USDT there. Maybe you have to register and do a KYC first if you have not used Cexes before, but that takes not that long.",
