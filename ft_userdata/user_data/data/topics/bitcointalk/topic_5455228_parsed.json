  "content": "Today, I came across a crypto friend whom I hadn't seen for a very long time, and over a bottle of beer, we had a very long discussion, discussing majorly about crypto currencies and life in general..As we were discussing crypto, I asked him if he's holding bitcoin at the moment, he said yes, I was curious to know how much Bitcoin, he refused to say though, but went further to tell me how he has his entire bitcoin staked for interest, then I began to advice him on how risky it actually is to hold bitcoin on a centralized exchange, but he quickly made me understand that he's not holding bitcoin on a centralized exchange but rather, on a non-custodial wallet, I asked if it's possible to stake bitcoin through a non-custodial wallet..He then told me its very possible with wrapped bitcoin, he was probably ready to educate me on how wrapped bitcoin makes all the impossibilities of bitcoin possible, but I was quick to let him know that I know majorly every thing about wrapped bitcoin, and that they are no different from shitcoins - he was surprised, he then asked me how is a wrapped bitcoin a shit coin...Then I began to explain to him that -1. Wrapped bitcoin is not completely decentralized like the original bitcoin is..2. Those who wrapped the bitcoin can decide to unwrap it, then his supposed bitcoin will ultimately return back to zero (0) dollars.3. Wrapped bitcoin can only be traded on decentralized exchanges, liquidity was added by some persons, if those persons who added the liquidity decide to withdraw it, you are completely locked in and no way to sell your supposed bitcoin..It was a lengthy discussion, but in the end, he asked what to do, I advised him to unstake his wrapped bitcoin and sell it immediately, then use the money to buy the real Bitcoin and hold on a good and trusted non custodial wallet like the one I'm currently using(mycelium), though not particular the best, but very trust worthy.At the end, I was happy I was able to really educate him on the danger of holding wrapped bitcoin in the place of the real bitcoin, and this made me to imagine how many bitcoin investors out there, that are holding wrapped Bitcoin, and really consider themselves to be holding bitcoin..Wrapped bitcoin is no different from any other altcoin out there, it is highly deceptive to think you hold bitcoin if what you are holding is wrapped bitcoin.",

Someone ran to me about a coin that was about to launched yet haven't so, they were asked to invest on the coin then during launching they all have access to it and probably can withdraw and sell, what i did was to look at him twice and asked him to borrow me the money let me use it for important business than putting money in a mouth of crocodile which he will never get back again. To cut the long story short, i told him the reason why he shouldn't invest in that token and why he must make a turn from that project and he stops, guess what?After 2 months thereabout he ran to me saying that platform has crashed that people are panicking, those who invested with a motive to make millions are in their respective home crying for their lost. This was how he would have made serious lost, today whatever thing comes up he must inboxed me to confirm before going further.",

That's exactly the reason, to catch newbies who don't know any better.The principle is usually the same too with all tokens (including stable coins). The creators of such tokens have no money, no revolutionary idea or anything they could use to make money. So instead they sell \"air\". They simply create these tokens and start selling them to newbies, making money in the process!The fact that there is also \"staking\" on top of it where you get profit for holding your bitcoins in THEIR pocket shows what a filthy Ponzi scheme this is These things don't fall apart like regular schemes since there is a market where people keep trading them. In other words some of them manage to create an artificial utility that lasts as long as the gamblers keep trading. Then it falls apart catastrophically.",

They have seperated deposit address for WBTC and BTC & BTC (segwit). I had a similar experience and I used this trick to explain the difference. The peculiarity with these guys is that they would believe an exchange but won't believe on text available on Bitcoin.org.

Well, nothing serious here really, like I said in the op, he is a good friend of mine, and sometimes, several of us who are fiends try to know how much Bitcoin the other person is holding, not to get jealous or envy or anything, but to particularly know if to buy more bitcoin or not, it is just like  a fun competition we usually have, where each of us want to own the highest bitcoin... Lets say for example, he told me he's holding 1.5 bitcoin and I am sure he's telling the truth, and what I hold at that time is just 1 bitcoin, I will instantly find motivation to buy extra 0.6 bitcoin so as to hold more bitcoin than him..

And besides, the person I recommended the wallet to is not a newbie in crypto, he knows he way around crypto very well, and would go for a better more secure wallet like hardware wallets, if he feels the wallet I recommended is not secure enough.. I simply recommended that wallet because he wont have to spend a dime or wait up to 5 minutes to get it and start using, but for a hardware wallet, he will spend money to order it, and still wait a couple of days or weeks for it to arrive, he might even end up using that as an excuse as to why he didn't convert he's wrapped bitcoin to real bitcoin at the time he was advised to do so.",
