  "content": "There is always a man in the family who believe they are the smartest, I have an uncle who is currently the most successful one in the family, maybe that's why he is behaving this way, he knew my involvement with crypto and Bitcoin, and after the crash into bear market he called me and said ..Are you still into Bitcoin? You need to find something else to do, Bitcoin will fail soon because there is nothing that can take away the money printing machines, the government will keep printing money because they like been the printer, they can't print Bitcoin that's why it will fail, stop living a dream and do something good with your life before it's too late. At first I got angry, because he always believe he knows the best for everyone, and I am different, I am not like my brothers that fall before his kneels every time. I replied him with this.Why are you so into what I am doing? Why did you take this so serious than anything else? You have never showed concern about me, I have never asked you for help and you fulfill it, if Bitcoin fails it's fine for me, and Bitcoin was never created to kill Fiat in the first place, it was created to support people like me, because no one wants to support people like us but they want to pretend they do.. Fiat is Centralized and Bitcoin is Decentralized, it's for the people and the community, it's freedom and a perfect home üè†. I can't hate something that have helps me so many times uncle. Have I said something too harsh? He took this personal and report me to my eldest brother, my brother said I shouldn't mind, he doesn't know that my brother is now also a Bitcoin investor, my mistake was making it public, which my brother never did. If you are still planning to get into Bitcoin, don't post anything about it in family group chat or on your WhatsApp status, this was my biggest mistake.",

First, this is not good advice, what transpires in your family might not be what would transpire in another person's family. And as we all want more Bitcoin adoption, we should continue to propagate the information about it without minding opposition. The case of my family is opposite to yours and everyone is now adopting Bitcoin just because I let them know about it and how I manoeuvre with it in payment and investment. This is a good way to convince anyone as my own case is positive which I could show anyone at any time.So anyone down-talking Bitcoin or what I do could immediately be shut up with my achievement on Bitcoin in just a short space of time. Also, it's not about centralization or decentralization as this only relates to privacy, not adding benefits to you per se. Anything centralized or decentralized could work or fail, just let them know you are benefiting and also disclose more that you would still benefit from it.If after this they do not yield, then leave them, your riches over time will shame them, period!",

Can't help but there are these people that don't want to mind their own business and if they're successful enough with their lives, businesses and assets. He should give a friendly advice in a calming manner. How he knows that it's going to fail soon? He even said something that's advantage to the most of us. Anyway, that's okay and at least that uncle of yours will stop already to minding you and how Bitcoin is going. And soon, he'll see and will contact you again when the price is better.",

This isn‚Äôt about your uncle only but this is the position every anti-bitcoin person takes. Once theirs is a dump or a period of bear they come out to tell you of how bitcoin was set up to crumple. Even on social media we see those anti crypto activists publish articles about it failing and they end up getting into once their ignorance/doubt is cleared (Micheal Saylor is clear example). I don‚Äôt blame you trying to spread the bitcoin adoption but sometimes you have look at the person you are having this kind of discussion with, people like your uncle aren‚Äôt easily talked into new innovations or technologies because they have this ego that every new idea has to through them first.

Secondly it could only expose you to danger especially in an environment in which it is frowned upon. Speak about bitcoin to someone that shows interest",

If the government keeps on printing money, that can cause their currency and their economy to fall. Does your uncle doesn't know about how printing money works? Also just an advice, don't mind your uncle. There will always be that one toxic family member who thinks he knows everything. You, yourself know about what Bitcoin is capable of. And you've experienced achieving things because of Bitcoin so just continue what you've been doing... Another thing is, there's really nothing wrong telling others about your engagement in Bitcoin.

There is nothing wrong with making your bitcoin investment public for your family, as we are a family and must take care of each other. But it's unfortunate for you to have such a patriarchal uncle. Either way, they already know you're investing in bitcoin, and it's best to ignore what they say. There is nothing else you can do at this point, what you should focus on is your investment, as there will be no better explanation than the results. As long as you produce results, those talking bad about you will shut up. That's what I did to people who used to scoff when they found out I invested in bitcoin.",

What I mean is No two heads are alike opinions will differ and people make it a point to educate and help others even if you never asked for it in the first place.

If you really believe that Bitcoin will experience significant growth in the future it is important to hold onto your convictions and not let others sway your opinion. While it's nice to share your private stuffs with someone, ensure that you confide in the right person, I mean someone who will support your ideas, offer wisdom and not making fun of it.I remember a few years ago when I got involved with Bitcoin I faced a similar situation. Many of my irl friends laughed at me when I tried to claim my own few satoshis and didn't believe in the potential of Bitcoin in the future. However, a few months later when I started making my first few hundred dollars, they regretted their previous behavior and even joined the Bitcoin community themselves. So my advice for you is to show your uncle one day how successful you are while you're doing a huge business that involves bitcoin and I hope that day would come. Good luck OP",
