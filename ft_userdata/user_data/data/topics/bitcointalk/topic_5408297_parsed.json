  "content": "Many people on the liberal side of the political spectrum say that the attempts to restrict, outlaw, and otherwise criminalize abortion are infect attempts by the certain groups and/or individuals to control women, with many people comparing it to the world of the Handmaid's tale.But how exactly does \"controlling women\" benefit the people who are supposedly trying to do? What would be in it for them?",

      "body": "If you want to understand the pro life position, it is not about controlling women, it's about protecting the life of the unborn.The pro-lifers believe life starts at conception and that the human life has the right to live whereas the most extremist pro-choice groups believe in abortion up to birth. Controlling women is just used as a strawman argument.This wouldn't have to be as contentious of an issue if abortions were made illegal after certain development stages. Aborting a baby after it has a heart beat sounds like murder and much less about controlling women, doesn't it? Maybe not even a heart beat. What about brain activity?I'd draw the line around 12-15 weeks or so.",

      "body": "I agree with you that human history has excelled in its attempts to control women and reduce their role. This actually began with the emergence of the Abrahamic religions.But with regard to the issue of abortion, there are other reasons for intervention and this has nothing to do with controlling women's decisions. Above all, the fetus in the woman’s womb is not her son alone, and even if it was (abandoned by the father), no one has the right to decide the fate of a person, whether he is present in the mother’s womb or outside it.Of course, there are other, more profound reasons that have been discussed in another topic in this section.",

The church will last forever while all other kingdoms will be destroyed. Daniel talking to Nebuchadnezzar about this, Daniel chapter 2:Quote from: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%202&version=NIV36 “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. 37 Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; 38 in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.39 “After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. 40 Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. 41 Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. 42 As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. 43 And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.44 “In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. 45 This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.Now that we see that the church is the highest form of government, and will last forever, let's see what St. Paul the Apostle says about women voting... even though voting is indirectly referenced. 1 Corinthians 14:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/14.htm34Women  should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. 35If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.So, there you have it. Not only that women shouldn't vote, but probably, also, part of the reason why false churches and other governments will fail.BONUS, though I don't know what this has to do with it if anything. Just consider, though.SHOCK DISCOVERY: Any time a woman has sex with a man, she retains his DNA in her brainQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-08-07-any-time-women-intercourse-man-retains-dna-brain.html#New research from Seattle University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has accidentally revealed that a portion of DNA from every man with whom a woman has sex ends up staying with her forever, lodged in her brain.The study was originally intended to identify whether women who get pregnant with a son end up becoming more predisposed to developing certain neurological diseases that are common in males. It ended up unearthing even greater mysteries about the inner workings of the female brain.It turns out that a woman’s neurological system often harbors “male microchimerism,” meaning her brain absorbs male DNA that stays with her whenever she procreates with one. The more men a woman sleeps with, the more male DNA becomes a part of her.The study explains that 63 percent of the females (37 of 59) tested were found to have male microchimerism in the brain – and in multiple regions of the brain. This means that male DNA is now a part of those women’s neurological systems.To remain politically correct, the study concludes that the male DNA must have come from a male pregnancy. The reality, though, is that even women who have never been pregnant, but who have slept with many men, bear the same male microchimerism as women who are moms of boys.Try as they might to hide the truth, researchers who have been brave enough to unpack this phenomenon further have concluded that sexually active women are, in fact, absorbing male DNA every time they engage in the act, regardless of whether or not they become pregnant and bear a child.“Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE,” one report explains....",

I doubt it, as well. I didn't check to see how they did their research.What's interesting, regarding how you say you doubt it, is that the same way they research brains for DNA, that's probably the same way they researched to find Covid.
