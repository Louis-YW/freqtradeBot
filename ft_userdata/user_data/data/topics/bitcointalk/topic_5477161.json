Be it simple or compound interest, you can not have the right calculation because your calculations in reality and in relation to your trading would be only about profit while not considering the loss. The money that you can not afford to lose to trade with, do not use it to trade. Get your trading money, and do your calculations with just adding the profit and subtracting the loss to know your actual PnL.",

What is the calculation i need to use to calculate this.?Somebody told me about power of compound on spot Market taking altcoin and buying in when btc is monthly low I believe that there are traders who are profitable with compounding. This is the fastest way to be profitable in trading, and if you thought it's gambling, no it's not because when you lose a trade, you will only lose 30% of your capital. Let's say you have $100 margin and won 3 trades with 30% risk, it will become $219. So if you lose in your 4th trade, you probably lose 30% of your $219 capital which will become $169. If ever you apply this risk management to your plan, you have to make sure that your strategy has a high winning rate.You can go to this link to calculate your reward: https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php",

While others are giving the OPs exact calculation for the possible profit he'll take in compounding his capital in trading. I wonder why he needs it from other people, I mean it is obvious that you'll get added interest or profit from the capital if you compound it. It is giving me a bumps, and it is absurd that you are a trader and don't know this one. On top of that, it is so hard to get consistent gains in trading, you will get wrekt if you think of that in the beginning. If you are a newbie, try to experience things out, don't plan ahead, I'm not saying that its bad but realistically speaking no one can attain to have a non-losing trade in a year! He probably speaking about staking",

But it seems to me that his advice will not be enough for you to make a profit, since you do not even have the minimum knowledge for trading and your ability to count profits will not help you in this.

People are only thinking about how can they be wealthy but they disregard the obstacles. Being wealthy isn't easy but it's a rough road. So if you won't prepare about that, you will get shocked and you will fail easily on your journey. This was still an experience (a negative one) and it's up to them if they will use it to try again and improve their selves.If we trade modestly our emotions are stable and we are not concerned of checking it but if it was when we trade recklessly is the one that can give us a curiosity and a feeling of worry, so we will end up checking it, which is great than just ignoring it because it can lead for us to crash soon.",

I am really sure that you will not be able to win month by month and here your target is 30% weekly profit, that equals to 120% monthly profit.Your target is very high that will force you to be greedy and try to find many chances from the market for your trading. Over trading like this will make you more careless with your trading decisions then losses will find you. Eventually you will no longer get 30% weekly profit but might lose very big with initial capital and all profit you accumulate previous months.Trading means you have to know when to don't trade, when to exit the market to accept a draw or a small loss from your open positions.",
