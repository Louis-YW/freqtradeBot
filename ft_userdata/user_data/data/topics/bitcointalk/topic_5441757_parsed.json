You can choose to hate or wicked people around you because you are a politician. That is purely absurd and should not be condone. You are comparing politics to the usual games we used to play around us to politics? No I can't comprehend your comparison and I think giving more details will be better. I don't like politics that is why I always step aside when I see that discussion about it is becoming obvious. Politics is  not meant to change our personality rather to build us to understand how we need to act to become a winner.",

Humility is not born out of surprise or unexpected happenings, it is a well-coveted virtue. The Nigeria election is a total fraud and I am very surprised that people that claim they own the country lost elections even in their own presumed City. Some political heavyweights that claimed that Peter Obi will not get up to 5 votes in their wards lost elections in their wards. APC and INEC would have earned more respect if they had conducted free and fair elections, but they lost the opportunity.Our hope is now on the judiciary. They are the last hope of the common man and the last hope of the masses. The Supreme Court should consider the electoral laws and public opinions and the truth about the election will be unveiled. Judgment should be just and fair and Nigerians will rejoice and give them their due respect.",

Politics can only humble those who are emotional about politics and doesn't understand Government and politics. In politics looser always complain while winner rejoices.  Politics is a game of interest, and before you involve in politics expect anything at any time. Politicians pretend during campaign, they calm to be Saint and once they wins, they forgot those they claim they love. No politicians is humble.",

Family and friends despise you for what you believe in and who you support for a political position. Family and friends who can hate you because of your political beliefs and affiliation, in my opinion, never wanted you in the first place; the love was never genuine, and they were only pretending to like you rather than loving you for who you are. Politics should be treated as a passing phase in life, and people should recognize this and stop harboring grudges and jeopardizing their relationships with loved ones.",

If a politician there is found and caught to be doing something else which is out of their scope and does corruption, they're the ones to do harakiri.I haven't been there though and I don't know a lot on their politics and I've just watched a couple of videos showing how good their politicians are but behind that, there could be way way more things that I and we don't know much.",

In politics, there are no black or white names. everything is cryptic, and as we agreed. that in the end, everything boils down to interests.So, is politics dirty, wrong, corrupt? the answer is no. but there are many people who carry out politics in a dirty way, so politics sounds very dirty, even though if there is no politics, we are not recognized by other countries, aka not independent. actually politics is not wrong, even there is knowledge. but what is wrong is when rotten people cunningly play politics, politics is not corruption, but not infrequently some officials play politics only for corruption.But by the way, I actually don't like political stuff.",

Why we think that politics is a dirty game is because of the people who are involved in it.

Our universal history has some examples of presidents and prime ministers who are loved a reminded to this day, for one reason. They were not perfect, obviously, they also committed mistakes and had to bid for power but once they got their position, did mostly right. In the end, from my point of view politics is a necessary evil to humanity, otherwise civilization as we know it would not be possible. Talking about bad politicians, you should check this guy out.Source: https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/26/politics/george-santos-admits-embellishing-resume/index.html",
