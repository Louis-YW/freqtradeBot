It is installed when building Electrum and I forgot that it is required as part of the list of non-pip dependencies.Regardless, Electrum still doesn't contain as many non-python dependencies as most wallets. Most of the wallets uses libsecp256k1, and seems to follow what Bitcoin Core does as well.There is a pure python secp256k1 library out there but I guess there are reasons for not adopting those but using more mainstream ones instead. ** Possibility due to adoption and how thoroughly tested those are.",

I am relieved now after reading many replied here. Although I think that using Electrum is safe for those who want to HODLing Bitcoin and do not have technical experience, but making sure that your private key was randomly generated or at least knowing how we can generate a random private key (128-bit entropy + checksum) is required and learning it is not difficult .This thread will teach you the basics https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5316005.0 and with a little research you can generate a private key that is guaranteed to be random and *impossible* to Brute-force it (not recommended for beginners or if you don't really know what you're doing)",

If you want to use Electrum as a cold storage on an airgapped device, you will need to read about it and that means you are having the technical knowledge gradually. All that is required is if you are interested to make your wallet more secure.I can only recommend (online) Electrum wallet for low amount of coins which you are spending.",

That's also true. Electrum used to use python-ecdsa with some monkey patching done to it while they were using it. It was slower though, as compared to libsecp256k1 library, that, Qt and cryptography are not pure python. The migration was done to enforce and improve performance; it used to be optional before the introduction of lightning which necessitated the speedup.",

If you scroll down towards the bottom, you'll come across the \"Projects using Libbitcoin\" section. The website mentions several names there, although, there are surely more.The first one, Chip-Chap used to be a Spanish crypto to fiat exchange. I said used to because the website isn't working now.DarkWallet was a browser extension intended to become a privacy-focused wallet. It's been abandoned, though, and is no longer maintained. Airbitz is now Edge Wallet. A multi-coin mobile wallet.I am not sure about Joystream. Seems it was a video platform and a DAO.Darkleaks was a black market where you could anonymously sell leaked and stolen data. It's dead now.OpenBazaar is a decentralized crypto marketplace. Its website says a new version is coming soon.CanCoin is an altcoin that seems abandoned. I am guessing they tried to build some kind of community of users, buyers, and sellers. If we only had a currency we could use for that kind of thing.  Lastly, slur.io seems to have been a site to sell and obtain user data according to search engine results.",
