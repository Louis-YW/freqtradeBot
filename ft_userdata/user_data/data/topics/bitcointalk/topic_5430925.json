We are all familiar with Bitcoin with Orange that is a brand color for bitcoin.Thanks for the suggestion, the new color looks nicer than black as a background shade.  I shared the course without thinking the Bitcoin color branding.  But as I changed it, it looks nicer to the eye.Actually the full course goes up to the altcoin lesson, I just cut the altcoin parts because I don't think it is necessary for newbies and will make the thread too long making it boring at first glance.  Maybe I can put the altcoin course on the 2nd post since I had it on reserved.",

There is no bank or government behind them. This defining feature of cryptocurrencies is known as decentralization.If no central bank or government issues or creates cryptocurrencies, then who creates them?Units of a cryptocurrency are generated based on predetermined rules written in code which are executed by software.Crypto SoftwareOne of the most important aspects of cryptocurrencies is their supply since this heavily determines their utility and value.Cryptocurrencies aka centralized shitcoins are decentralized? No way, it's similar like people who leave most of their coins on Binance, because they think Binance is safe due to SAFU.And then they said supply is heavily determine the utility and value, there's many centralized shitcoins has limited supply and lower than Bitcoin, does those shitcoins are better than Bitcoin in terms of utility and value?",

Bitcoin is known as cryptocurrency and altcoin is another part of cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrency can be centralized  or decentralized depending on the developers control on the Blockchain but originally it is decentralized because the first cryptocurrency that is still existing is Bitcoin.

A shitcoin can have a fixed supply, but there's no utility and value because they're centralized and copycat.Utility from definition : I do not need to reiterate, that image simply tells what utility is.  When you talk about profitability, it automatically include pricing or value.  Just give facts not personal assumption .  No one is denying that many altcoin are presumed centralized because of their nature of governance. QuoteAlso utility and value are different with price, utility is the purpose of the coin, value is the uniqueness, while price is just price which can be easily get manipulated if you're centralized and a whale. A shitcoin can have a fixed supply, but there's no utility and value because they're centralized and copycat.Just read my reply on the factor determining the value of a cryptocurrency.  I also state no matter how scarce your coins is as long as there is no demand for it, it will be worthlessQuote Never factor out the demand because without the demand, no matter how little your supply is it will be worthless.Demand gives value while supply saturates that value. So it is a wrong assumption that supply gives value to the coin but how much it worth when there is a demand depends on the coin saturation or coin supply.Quotethere's no utility and value because they're centralized and copycat.It is not because it is a copycat but because it has no demand.",
