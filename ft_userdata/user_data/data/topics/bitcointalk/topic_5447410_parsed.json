Coinbase Wallet supports hundreds of thousands of tokens and decentralized apps, so you can trade crypto, collect NFTs, and much more.Please visit the Coinbase Wallet Help Center to learn more about creating and managing a Coinbase Wallet.Thank you for your understanding.Regards,The Coinbase TeamMy coinbase account is verified, but I barely use it.So many other people are experiencing the same thing as seen by the complaints on Reddit and twitter- https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/12a8e4d/my_coinbase_account_is_going_to_be_restricted/- https://mobile.twitter.com/iamClaudeGu/status/1642704155004514305They haven't cared to even state what their updated standards of services are, No official announcement of such a thing except that email messages to some usersEven the support is confused about the whole thing",

But these days, I barely use coinbase and I don't have a lot of balance. Maybe I have less than $0.10 worth of LTC there lol. But why are they closing the accounts? Basically, it's all of us who don't have a balance in our wallets. I think this is a pretty much stupid decision from coinbase though I can understand the necessity of this wallet has dropped which is the reason behind their step to close inactive accounts.",

Have you received the same email or not? If you have a balance, you are not supposed to receive mail from them as they stated that they are only closing the inactive accounts which don't have a balance.QuoteBecause your Coinbase account has a zero balance, no action is required from you.This is what was written on the email.

Had an account and a card with them for years with no issues. Today I received this:Unfortunately we have to close your Coinbase account. Before your account can be closed, you’ll need to withdraw your crypto funds to an external wallet and your cash funds to a bank account associated with your Coinbase account. If you are currently enrolled in USD Coin rewards, you may want to wait up to 40 days before withdrawing funds to ensure you have received all eligible reward payouts. You will not be able to access these funds after account closure. Please take precautions when transferring cryptocurrency to an external wallet as transfers outside of Coinbase are irreversible. Please also be sure to delete any external references to cryptocurrency addresses generated by Coinbase, as funds sent to those addresses will not be accessible once the account is closed. If you have any questions you may visit https://support.coinbase.com.No reason why, nothing. Is it common? Anyone here also dumped by Coinbase just like that?   If they ever do due to public demand, it'll probably be something vague.Quote from: examplens on April 04, 2023, 10:46:25 PMfor some reason, I received two emails with slight differences.

Not really, Meta for example is publishing those in their 10K but is doing on their own definitions of active users, if it were for Coinbase they could also do the same, judging an active user by a random time and sum, somebody who has logged, somebody who has tarded at least $100 in 90 days and so on, somebody who has a positive balance etc.Anyhow, I've logged in to my Coinbase account again to see how it looks.Seems like I have a  $5.4 balance from probably an airdrop or something as it's probably in some shitcoin not even shown on the main dashboard, I'm definitely not completely verified since there is one huge red banner there asking me for proof of address but still no message, no alert that my account might get disabled although it is restricted till complete KCY but it has been like that from at least June or July last years as far as I remember.
