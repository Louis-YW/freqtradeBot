Justifying it might help his sympathizers understand.I'm not from Nigeria but this is a developing country with so many resources afaik, this country even has oil and gas of their own. But then you know the number and the kind of crimes reflect how the economic status of the country.",

I can imagine the type of sermons he preaches to his congregations. He should be first flogged or his properties sold, the money recovered and distributed back to members who donated for his so-called release. In addition, the FG who enact a punishment for folks like this. Maybe 6 months in prison depending on the so called ransom money he collected from people.",

He should not have participated in such an act as a man of God. He has only tarnished the image of the church, and the surrounding community will always regard him as an untrustworthy individual. We know the country is difficult, but there are some things we should train our minds not to think about. I'm hoping that things will change soon.",

If not for the sake of hardship, there would have been no need for the pastor to kidnap himself. But it's absurd that such an incident was carried out by a pastor, lol. Men of God these days are just using God's name to cover up their criminal acts; a true man of God would beg instead of partaking in such an act. I wonder how hard it was for the church members who helped raise the money to pay his ransom. Despite the level of hardship he has faced to make him commit such an act, there is no reason to justify his actions. What baffles me is how he escaped the first time; God showed mercy as he was not caught, and he tried the second time. Although I have heard about five cases of self-kidnapping, none were pastor.",
