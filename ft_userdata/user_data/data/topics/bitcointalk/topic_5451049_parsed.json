      "body": "Most of us believe that if there is a conflict, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will plummet. But that is not true, because in 2020, there is a global pandemic that severely damages our economy, but what happened in Bitcoin that time? Price hikes have caused an abrupt surge in the market, indicating that there is a lot of demand. As you can see from the chart, it reaches an all-time high. As a result, I believe that if there is a war, it may be beneficial or detrimental to crypto.",

      "body": "You mixed things up in this write-up but I will try to explain in the shortest possible way. Inflation is mostly responsible for the fall of Bitcoin, and most countries' issues might not have any noticeable impact on Bitcoin unless the coin is popularly paired with their currency, that's how the market works. The exception of course is the news of adoption and retriction/ban by countries. Bitcoin can only be significantly impacted by the economies of the countries of the most popular currencies, in which the USD is number 1.Quote from: Godlovesyou on May 03, 2023, 06:36:42 AMDifferent countries issues is the reason why bitcoin is suffering price loss, when countries are not at peace with others, the whole nations suffered economic crisis, I remember when the price of bitcoin start going down was same season Russian x Ukraine start economy wars.Point of correction, the price of Bitcoin started falling in 2021, not 2022 when the Russia-Ukraine war started. Mind you, the importance of the country that can cause the effect matters to the global economy, not just anyhow country. And on record, Bitcoin has been falling before the Russia-Ukraine war, surely, the war aggravated it as it increased global inflation as the world depends on the two countries for crude oil, vegetable oil, grains, raw materials and many more. However, the world is finding alternatives, and you can see it as the war continues, yet Bitcoin has increased in value. Quote from: Godlovesyou on May 03, 2023, 06:36:42 AMBitcoin seem to remained statics because of sentiments by this countries attitude towards the resourceful digital products that would have swim financial hardship. There is nothing like the sentiment of countries here, inflation is the main consideration, and despite the challenges the economies of most counties are facing right now, Bitcoin still managed to rise since the beginning of this year and might touch another historical peak in 2024 since there are other favourable factors to consider.",

Bitcoin seem to remained statics because of sentiments by this countries attitude towards the resourceful digital products that would have swim financial hardship. Bitcoin is also a speculative asset, so the impact of the world's macro news cannot be avoided, but to say that the collapse of bitcoin in 2022 is due to war is completely inaccurate and also not caused by inflation. If we look closely, 2022 is also when we enter a bearish cycle after reaching ATH in November 2021. So I think whether there is war, economic crisis or not, the market will still slump, but with the impact of the other two factors, the situation will become worse.What I'm thinking is, if after halving happens and the world economy still hasn't recovered, the war isn't over, do we still have a cyclical bull season?",

Bitcoin seem to remained statics because of sentiments by this countries attitude towards the resourceful digital products that would have swim financial hardship. Wars affect bitcoin prices in a way that it put fear on the funds of investors and derisk their money from their investments and convert it into available cash in case of the worst case scenario. Then it will start to set bearish prices on BTC and other assets like stocks, gold, and indices. Sometimes wars and high-impact news also serve as manipulation in the market that will cause a false move and fluctuation in price swings. When OP state that Bitcoin seem to remained statics only implies that BTC is in a good stance because despite of negative global events, BTC still finds another support level to  remain in  a good spot to buy and invest in the long run.",

      "body": "I don't think you're right about Bitcoin and the war. Bitcoin can suffer from panic, surrounding global economic uncertainty due to certain events. But it doesn't have to happen and doesn't always happen. The full-scale invasion (because Russia's war against Ukraine itself started in 2014) started on February 24, 2022. If anything, BTC went up back then, namely from $37k on February 24 to $44.5k on March 1, and then up to $47k on March 31. The biggest impact on the price happens at the beginning, and Bitcoin was doing alright then. What's been going on with the price later has nothing to do with the war, IMO. Moreover, the war also gave new publicity and usage of Bitcoin, as Ukraine started actively accepting Bitcoin donations.",

Maybe it's just one part of the equation, but as we have seen, the war has been ongoing for more than a year but the bitcoin price has recovered already. From the lowest lost of $15,500, we have doubled it and reach $31k already. It's just on the correction right now, nevertheless, we can't blame the war as the only reasons. And the timing, the war started when we are in the beginning of a bear market.We have the terra luna and then the ftx collapsed that contributed last year for the price really going down low. And then now the banking crisis in the US and in EU, but it seems that it has a positive impact as investors are looking for crypto to hedge their wealth.",

I think the regional conflicts don't have any direct impact on price of Bitcoin, however such geographical conflicts may have significant  negative effect on global economy and financial markets. Consequently , such conflicts cause rapid increase in inflation due to disruption in supply chain, which ultimately creates negative sentiment among investment communities and prices of high risk financial assets, such as stocks and bitcoin start falling. This is how the  regional conflicts may have cascading impact on financial markets, ultimately affecting the prices of financial assets.",

You better provide dates or data to support your claim. Even if that were true, how would you explain the previous bear market then? As far as I remember correctly, there is no war back then. You should remember that correlation doesn't mean causation. Sure, countries in war probably mean people are less inclined to invest in high-risk assets, but it is hard to judge how much that contributes compared to other factors.Quote from: Godlovesyou on May 03, 2023, 06:36:42 AMBitcoin seem to remained statics because of sentiments by this countries attitude towards the resourceful digital products that would have swim financial hardship. I believe financial ideology contributes more toward their crypto attitude. Not every government purely decides based on profit. Even if there is no war and every country is doing trades with each other, you can't expect all of them to have the same attitude to crypto. CMIIW.",

Bitcoin seem to remained statics because of sentiments by this countries attitude towards the resourceful digital products that would have swim financial hardship. I agree with you there that global events such as political conflicts, economical sanctions, and regulatory changes can affect the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, when there is uncertainly or instability in the global financial system, some investors may turn to cryptocurrencies as a store of value or a safe haven asset, On the other hand, negative news or actions from governments or central banks can create fear and uncertainty among investors, leading to a decrease of demand and a drop in prices.The relationship between geopolitical events and the cryptocurrency market is complex and multifaceted, and it is important for investors to carefully consider a range of factors when making investment decisions.",

In some cases, people may turn to Bitcoin as a safe haven to protect their wealth during times of economic instability caused by war, leading to an increase in demand and a rise in price. However, if the war causes significant disruptions to the global economy, adoption and use of Bitcoin may decrease, and its value may become more volatile. Overall, the impact of war on Bitcoin is difficult to predict and can be influenced by many different factors.",

Currently, the use of cryptocurrency in the US is not really favorable due to some rules, and even some banks have restrictions on the use of debit cards by their customers to purchase bitcoin. So, you can see that it's not only war that affects the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. Even Last month, 50,000 bitcoins were discovered by the government, from a hacker, and the government sold about 17% of those bitcoins, which I think also led to the price decline of bitcoin last month.",

If I may describe the current state of Bitcoin, it would be due to all the negative news coming from various directions, such as government regulations, exchanges going under, and so forth. These factors have caused some investors to become fearful and begin withdrawing their funds from investments, and some nations have banned Bitcoin, which has slowed the growth of the cryptocurrency.Op I don't think any powerful war have happened since existence of Bitcoin  that have effects on bitcoin like and there of bear market since expected that of Russia and Ukraine which you claim it have affected the price of bitcoin which I can't say it play serious part in it.
