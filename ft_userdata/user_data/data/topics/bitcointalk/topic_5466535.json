For someone concerned about learning emotions as it concerns trading, the search option will provide a range of topics with many good responses that may be of help. If you decide to put together these topics in a tabular form as suggested, which is not bad, you should also remember that your topic will also be pushed down by more recent topics when published, that is it will end up again being among all the other topics on emotions that needs to be searched for.Every forum member, new and old need to know how to use the search option.",

As I've noticed in our local board, if someone else posts the identical topic after him, it will be quickly locked if the moderator notices it to avoid repetitive content, which I consider spam.Those threads mentioned in the OP are not locked, and I assume moderators have previously seen them, indicating that they are acceptable.",

Feelings are nothing but a motive. If you exploit them well, they will lead you to profit, and if you misuse them, they will lead you to loss. Otherwise, Greed, greed, and the desire to have more money and less work is why we all invested in Bitcoin, but some put limits on these feelings so that they do not believe scammers who tell them that they can double their money within 24 hours. However, they are more courageous than those who want a guaranteed profit with zero risks.the most correct sentence is to learn how to control emotionsÂ  and exploit them to maximize profit, and not just put them aside when trading.",

I see this not to be accurate, emotion can be bad or good like you said, but there comes a time I just later have to admit when they are only associating it will bad feeling that is resulting to losses. And you have said it already indirectly from your post, that if a trader is trading with little amount of money, not using leverage but going for only just one leverage, they will overcome the emotion that they are talking about, but by doing so, the profit will also be minimal. I prefer my profit to be minimal than for the emotion they are talking about to overcome me, emotion will overcome greedy traders.",

I know that it is not going to be that easy, and I know that it will take some time but as long as it exists we are going to end up with a good thing in the end. I believe that we are going to have some sort of situation where it will get to a point we can't really end up making a profit from, it is going to take some time.I hope that it can be considered fine, and yes it is not going to be easy but because we have been low for so long, that makes people feel all kinds of emotions and they have harder time trading. Bull will be easier, it is going to go up, and everyone will feel fine about it.",
