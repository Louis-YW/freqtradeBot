In this way, Bitcoin ownership can be better protected from interference. Considering that you can't stop yourself from gambling, it is very difficult to become a long-term Bitcoin holder, especially if you want to gamble you have to use Bitcoin.It sounds like what you are experiencing is the worry of not being able to protect Bitcoin. I understand very well and have indeed been in that position. The decision is yours, for example returning to the initial goal of why you should own Bitcoin and having big targets that you want to achieve in the future. Everyone needs bitter decisions in order to enjoy sweet results (whether they like it or not). Only that !!One more thing, do not give your ownership to third parties. Try practicing as much as you can, gradually I'm sure you will be able to control it.",

This response narrowed your post down to psychological challenge. Well, I will suggest you go back to why you even started your Bitcoin journey. If you still panic when price of Bitcoin is dropping,  most likely you are overinvested in Bitcoin and that is an error. You are expected to only invest amount you are not in urgent need of, amount you can leave for years and still live your life normally. Make the necessary adjustments and have peace of mind. You can adopt the DCA method that takes care of this emotional burden.Every true Bitcoiner must give Bitcoin a chance to grow by developing a long term perspective that should withstand the periods of consolidation and corrections.",

If I'm right, then you need something  else to keep you busy, you can find a new hobby like reading, hanging out with friends, forming discussion groups, learning a new skill, or even applying for a job. These will limit the free time you've to start getting bored unnecessarily and preying on your BTC against your wish.",

But I didn't really understand it and maybe that's still not what I am looking for.If I look at your stories here on the topic you did, it is clear that you are really a Bitcoin believer. Now, regarding your question about staking, is it because you hold Bitcoin that you want while Bitcoin is only in your wallet that you still want to be able to accumulate it? this without buying Bitcoin out of your pocket, right?And staking is the only way you can think of to make this happen, right again? Just always remember that Bitcoin teaches us to control the bitcoin we have because you are the only one who holds the seed phrase, password, and private key; no one else. Now, once you put it in staking, you are 100% in control of your bitcoin; it will no longer be 100% like if you stake it in Binance, which has a lock-in period that you buy between 1 month lock-up, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, depending on you. Once you can buy, you have no control over your bitcoin, and you will only be in control when the grace period you chose has ended. You get what you want if you point it out.",

We are in a cycle of pumping and recovery at the moment and we might hit a new all-time-high soon, where you can \"cashout\" with huge profits. I will advise you not to lock in all your coins, if you have the option to do that. Keep a small amount locked in, but keep the majority of the coins accessible if the Bitcoin price goes to the Moon, so that you can sell for some profit.

The solution is to learn to be discipline by not letting your emotions make decision for you, I taught this problem was associated to only newbies who have not gained enough knowledge about Bitcoin but here I am seeing a sr member with same issue. No matter how bored you get I don't think using bitcoin that has been planned for long term holding for gambling is a good idea because, within 24 hour you can destroy your bitcoin portfolio if you are not discipline enough. I'll recommend you use your fiat currency for gambling should in case you get bored.",

I know some will say that’s why it is good to invest in the amount you can afford to lose but sometimes this holdings can come in handy in terms of unforeseen circumstances. As for staking i would advise you to stay away from it because aside the fact that you might be trusting an exchange or not so reputable wallet with your coins, you would be holding Alticoins for a long time and that’s bad.
