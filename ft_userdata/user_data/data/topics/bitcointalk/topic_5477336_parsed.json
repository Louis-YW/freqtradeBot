Could a problem gambler quit slowly and expect realistic improvements? That has always been my belief, when it comes to those that are addicted to a drug they need to still receive small amounts of that drug for a time so their body does not go through some heavy withdrawal symptoms, which for what I have read it is an awful experience to go through, but for someone that is addicted to video games or gambling this is a step that can be skipped and they need to quit on the spot, as this is the best way for them to actually have a chance to make a recovery.",

But since we are talking about addiction, nothing will happen in an instant since it is an impulsive action. You have to surface awareness first before being able to stop if you want to. And if you managed to stop in a short period of time then probably you are not yet addicted to it. Same thing with vices; gradual quitting would be better to avoid culture shock and lack of control with your actions. Addiction as well means that you are spending huge amount of time to such behavior; a learned one. In order to completely unlearn something means slowly changing what you are used to, in order to still cover the tome spent on a daily basis with the things you are addicted of.",

I think it's best if you'll do it slowly and properly by starting to limit the money and time you spend in gambling, reducing it little by little until you get used on losing your urge and thirst in gambling. It's hard to deal with withdrawal symptoms once you try to quit cold turkey, the relapse might be worse and you'll get back to your old habit without even noticing it.",

But if the gambler do not quit and not able to quit, he needs something like rehabilitation program or medical consultant.It became possible when I did quit slowly. I tried to quit gambling instantly and I experience a withdrawal from it and gamble more as a result. We may all have different experiences but quitting slowly works on me. What I mean of quitting slowly is years of gambling but gaining a progress of having a good decipline until I can control myself of not partaking in any gambling activities if I want to. I can consider myself as an ex-gambling addict because the strategy works on me. We all have different life status and I think it is better to try and try until you find the best suited way for you to quit gambling.",

For example, someone who only smokes one pack of cigarettes a week can quit much more easily than someone who needs one pack a day. The same applies to (classic) gambling addiction. Someone who is heavily addicted will probably not be able to stop at all without professional help. However, someone who gambles from time to time can certainly cope with \"cold turkey\" because, as you rightly say, addiction symptoms can occur to a greater or lesser extent in heavily addicted people. By the way, if someone wants to quit cold turkey, it helps enormously to tell as many people as possible that you are quitting. This puts a lot more pressure on yourself to follow through, as it would be very difficult to admit to others that you haven't managed it.",

Could a problem gambler quit slowly and expect realistic improvements? Cold turkey never works. If you are an addicted gambler, you can't immediately quit gambling because you think about gambling all the time. Also, gambling tapering doesn't work like low your budget and over time you'll become free from addiction. When you are addicted to gambling, you should try to occupy your free time by doing your other hobbies or find a new job or walk in the park, you have to do something different and entertaining in your life to smoothly get away from your addiction. One best way is to spend less time every time you gamble. Gamble for 4 hours instead of 5, then gamble 30 minutes less in next week, then 30 minutes less and in near future one will smoothly solve this problem. Cold turkey is impossible for many people.",

That is the best possible way but it isn't that easy or realistic especially when they are deeply addicted to it. Generally when we talk about detox the addiction it means slowly reducing the dosage or drug or give an alternate drug that induces a similar mental situation while keep monitoring them continuously but talking about gambling that isn't possible so there should be a complete shift of their focus and needs to keep them engaged until the get back on their own and realize their mistake.",

If you do find yourself that it is really that hard to quit on point and you do seesome progress that you are slowly changing up then just proceed or continue but honestly this is really just that depending on someones mentail strength or will because not all would really be having that kind of mindset when it comes on quitting or doing something. You cant really be able to tell on what kind or type of person is, the one who had been addicted.Basing up into my own experience, there are really moments or times on which i do find myself a little bit addicted on which i do already spend up tons of money in doing gambling and lately realizing that it was never been that ideal or something that give good effects.Once you do make out those realizations then you would really be able to find out on what are the things that are supposed that you should gonna do.",

Even though it is not a 100% effective method, there are many gambling addicts who stop slowly using counseling methods and also open up to each other in a treatment group, but there are also many who cannot stop slowly, they must do it immediately, the point is that the recovery process for every gambling addict is different. Â Curing gambling addicts who have been gambling for years is not easy, it requires a consistent and gradual process because if it is not consistent then the chances of returning will be great, but trying to stop slowly in every gambling activity is a technique that is quite recommended.",

Maybe for some addicts it's better to stop slowly, step by step, while for others to stop suddenly at once is the best alternative. That is a matter the addicted gambler in treatment should discuss with his therapist, so they can find out which is the most efficient approach.Personally, I think to stop suddenly can bring more negative impacts on short run, like anxiety and aggressivity, although once this storm is over, it's likely the effects will be very positive on long run, while when stopping slowly puts the individual in a situation where relapses will tend to happen during the treatment, making it harder to revert addiction, and even retroacting a lot on his condition. In every cases, the individual has to be watched closely by family, friends and therapist.",
