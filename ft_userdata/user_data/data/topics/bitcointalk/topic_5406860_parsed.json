I understand what is on the card - whopper.io does two types of cards - one where they manufacture the card and supply the public address and the private key - or one where the buyer supplies the public address.Based on the activity on the address dating back to 2016, my guess is that this card is the card where the buyer supplied the public address for which they already held the private key for.I guess what I am asking is - are you the one that ordered it from whopper.io and supplied the address or did you get it from somewhere else?",
