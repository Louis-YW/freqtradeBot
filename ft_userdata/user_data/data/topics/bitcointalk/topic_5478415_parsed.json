Or you can use the lightning wallet that you do not have to open a channel like Muun wallet, but with little amount of coins.If you used legacy address to store your coins on blockchain and thinking you can transfer the coins without onchain transaction first to open a channel, that is not possible.To move the coins, you can use 3 UTXO counts each (I mean 3 inputs) sent to an address each in a transaction if you have many inputs. Then, use ViaBTC free accelerator to accelerate the transactions.",

Exchange withdraw fees are too high for ordinary address.Thank you very much!I think you have misunderstood how LN (lightning) works.Let's start from what a brainwallet is. A brainwallet is an unsafe way to generate a private key, by hashing a phrase that you generate on your brain. So for example, the phrase franklin2058 will generate the following:Private key (hex): 1c97d6a461f857e2cd864d39426def7e4724d6c77e630696b589a2f139bf4b26Private key (WIF): KxBHu7A2YggFc4kpq5aW52d8uHNyzvWPG6ADRtAR2855P2ruxdYQAddresses: 1QJcNn9PAPCLNeJnESou9h6QVNPnmGSKJD / 3GfLUQJTgNY7gqm1EPBX2MQdQ9SXACkbse / bc1ql70harvmavj8ru293ckcy3hgaevdteawc9gcdqEssentially you will only need to remember the phrase franklin2058 and you will be able to recover the wallet.I will not explain how insecure these wallets are in this post, since it is irrelevant, but I definetely encourage you not to use them.Now, LN is a layer that sits on top of Bitcoin's blockchain. It works by creating channels between nodes and then those nodes can exchange sats without paying insane fees. Once the channels are closed, then an on-chain transaction happens on the blockchain that settles the amounts to the addresses. Having said that, there are mainly 2 implementations of LN nodes:1. LND2. CLNEssentially, you generate an on-chain deposit address. This address will be in the bech32 format and can be used to send Bitcoin funds to your LN wallet. From this address you will be able to fund the channels.These 2 implementations don't support brainwallets! So, the funding address is properly generated, collecting entropy from various sources. The address is part of a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet.If what you want is a good LN wallet, then I suggest you totally forget brainwallets. Brain is not suitable for secure implementations! Just follow the proper way that everyone uses and you will be just fine.Finally, some more wallet suggestions:1. If you run your own LN node:For PC: Ride the Lightning, SPARK, LNBitsFor Mobile: Zeus2. If you DON'T run your own LN node:For PC: *I haven't used any so I can't suggest*For Mobile: Wallet of Satoshi (custodial), Muun (semi-custodial), Phoenix (non-custodial)",
