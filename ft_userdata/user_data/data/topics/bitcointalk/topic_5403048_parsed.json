  "content": "After 5 years of stirling service and a lot of modifications I'm retiring my rig of 8 x 1070's.  My remaining 2 rigs, each with 8 x 1070ti's are running at around break even so will keep them spinning a few more months, at least until the Australian winter is over. The question now is what to do with them?  The 1070's are old cards now and I can't imagine there is much of a market for them especially considering their mining history.  (Though one could argue they are thoroughly tested!).  I doubt it would be worth the hassle of listing them on ebay.  But I can't yet bring myself to throw away perfectly good cards.  So I will probably store them for 10 years and then throw them away!What do you do with old mining cards that are no longer profitable and unlikely to ever be profitable again?",

      "body": "Do not throw away these cards. They're still decent for most games today/last gen under 1080p @60fps depending on the setting (medium-high). Did you see the Steam's Hardware Survey Chart that average PC users have nvidia 1060 as the most popular video card, something even weaker than 1070? No, your cards still have a decent after-market if you decide to sell them at your neighbor SEA countries where the average salary is low and most kids or students can't afford too much money on video cards. I said you can sell them at $150 per card or $100 minus all the labor costs, shipping,... if you want to get it done fast, in batch. That's around $800 there or even more!Steam Hardware & Software Survey: May 2022",

When the price of the cryptocurrency rises, you will buy new cards. And if the price of cryptocurrency does not rise, then you still wanted to throw away video cards.",

You'll still be able to get some money for them. You can also turn them into furniture pieces / artwork. Or rendering farms. If they brought you riches then you owe them gratitude and respect. If a mountaineer summits Mt. Everest does he throw away the boots he climbed the mountain with? Hell no that's a piece of history!",
