Especially with Bitcoin and a volatile market like cryptocurrency.You will see that every area of ​​life (sports, education, business, music, academics...) is a competition for rankings. But investing is completely different, it's not about how much money you make compared to those around you, it's a very unique profession, when what you fight for and win is not with others who join the market that is yourself. Win over yourself. The challenge for Bitccion investors is not to try to find the best information the market has to offer, but to prevent themselves from being their own worst enemy - to prevent themselves from “restless”- buy and sell continuously  Restless busy has probably become an ingrained instinct in everyone's mind. A normal working person is too used to working 8 hours a day, their mind will always urge them to work. When you wake up and go to the company, you have to work. If you don't work with your hands, you work with your mind. You're always in a state of thinking or acting and you have to do this or that to make money. This makes them think that when they join the market, they You also have to work hard and hard to make money from the market.  As I said, investing is a profession that is extremely different from other professions, especially with Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market. The way legends make money is not mainly from buying and reselling transactions, but from \"waiting\". Restless and waiting are two opposite things, and are also what help us distinguish between a true Bitcoin investor and a gambler.",

Although trading comes with its own level of risk, just like almost any other profession, it can either be taken as a side hustle or a full time job. It actually depends on the person in question. Trading is a full professional job and a lot of persons out there have it as their core source of income and I really don't see anything wrong with it. Just like we have responsible gamblers, so also we have experienced traders too.One thing that people fail to understand is that trading is something that requires time and analysis. Experiences traders also understand risk management properly and are also good at applying it during the entire process.",

The only thing you need to do is just wait while you still doing your normal job let Bitcoin do his job for price growth.Bitcoin price is proven consistently growing so there’s no way you will still doubt about Bitcoin when you invest on it.

Holders are the people who benefit most from bitcoin and not those who risk their coins through trading. The challenges facing some holders remain the lack of patience which is mostly caused by insufficient funds.

I believe this investment is all about individual goals and how you plan to achieve it. Taking early profits is not entirely bad since the motive behind the investment is to make profits but they should be aware that their future potential profits is becoming insignificant whenever they take profits.

But both gambling and Bitcoin investments entail a certain level of risk, so in this sense gambling isn't that different from Bitcoin because you can lose money and sort of can win money.The op's point about being restless and waiting is relevant, I suppose, if we consider people who gamble regularly and people who invest long-term in Bitcoin.
