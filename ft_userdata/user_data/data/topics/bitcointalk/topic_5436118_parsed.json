In their portfolio there are only the biggest assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on). Everything can be seen transparently in the network.They've just launched and are already starting with an insane investment pot of $150,000.So you have the opportunity to invest directly diversified with leverage, instead of doing it yourself.The team is legitimate and has already done nothing questionable or the like in previous projects.Telegram: https://t.me/Potfolio_OfficialWebsite: https://potfol.io/but as pointed out by julerz12, there's no detail about team on their website or other mediaThe user, which I strongly believe also the founder of the said project although they tried to give an impression that they're just promoting the project, has couple of hit and run projects in the past, [ANN] Whalegirl [WGIRL] - P2E Unreal Game, CEX listings & much more in 2021 and üè¶ GolddogeSachs - the first leveraged index for crypto üè¶ in 2022. Both website are no longer accessible, and now the suspect posted another project, which most likely will also gone after a day or two and we'll see them again in yet another project next year.In regards to the point above, I wonder if it's necessary to raise a flag against the user to discourage them on creating another project in the future.Some screenshot for easy view:   Notifying the suspect.",

Buy a domain, design a website, make some social media accounts for that project, Create an ann thread here, launch a ICO and go away with investor money. Again to the same things.I don't understand why some investors invest in such type of project without proper research. Until those investors don't stop to invest in such a project, they will not be stooped to create this type of project. But we can do one thing is tagging them. I am going to do that , others also should do it",

These are newbie scammers targetting newbies like them even if they have an original whitepaper I will not involve myself in this project, no platform obviously this is a pump and dump project they are also lying and they have a $150,000 budget and bought top coins in the market, they don't even have $500 with the kind of script they have.QuoteI agree with sujonali.

Since we are not a big company, but can only use on equity, we are on the BSC in the so-called \"shitcoin space\". You know, where Shiba-Inu comes from.The websites that are no longer there are because of the aforementioned trademark dispute and at Whalegirl because of a failure of the project. We communicated the ending of the project CLEARLY and allowed all holders to exchange their tokens for their value without any fee.The BSC space communicates exclusively via Telegram, so the information there is much more detailed.

I wondered why you used \"they\" on the ann thread which cast an impression that you're just promoting them instead being one of them. But, as we're here, you might also want to mention Neptune, one of your team's other project, which somehow got deleted from your post history, and which created to compensate the downfall of Whalegirl.Unlike Whalegirl's channel remnant which filled with countless bot messages which made it difficult to navigate and conduct a research, NPTUN is easier. Apparently it also fell from their grace and the dev team got a brilliant idea to put it on life support by creating yet another project, Triton, but unfortunately and ultimately, has to be closed for this reason,So should I also add \"PnD\" and hit-and-run above the plagiarism accusation?Quote from: Whalegirl on January 26, 2023, 07:46:44 PMUnlike BTC or ETH, it is unfortunately common for many very young projects to fail early.How it goes in the lower spheres of cryptocurrencies, you do not need to know.

The original and copied material was there on my first post, the plagiarism proof is there for you to defend, which you still haven't. Unfortunately, with both GDS and whalegirl site went down, so did the page which contain the link to their whitepaper, hence I can't check if they're also plagiarized.Two things to add. First, how could a veteran in crypto project still do a plagiarism? You're not new to this space, you knew it's heavily frownes upon. I can't think of any way it happened by accident. Second, wouldn't it be much easier to say on the first place on your ann thread that you're a rebrand of GDS due to copyright issue --which also can't be discussed in details due to the legal reason? Instead, you made a statement like it's a whole new project with huge intial investment... which actually came from the GDS crowdfund.Dare I say, departing from your previous history, this is another means you tried to do to keep the project afloat, much like Neptune and Triton... or Whalegirl and Neptune",

They won't spend thousands of dollars to buy such scripts. There was a time when I tried to earn some money on the PTC website by viewing ads, and rarely got paid. After a couple of months, I realized I can build such websites for free. Yeah, Those free scripts are available on many webmaster forums. All you need is to extract the script and connect the database and do the cronjobs. That's a whole different story. Their representative is here. Let's see what they have to say.",
