  "content": "The new changes to the decisions of offside and onside has been raking in different opinions and response from many football lovers about the changes and how it is going to affect goals decisions next season.https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.marca.com/en/football/2023/07/03/64a310c8268e3e07148b45c0.htmlIn my opinion, with this new changes concerning the decision of when a player should be said to be offside or onside has given the centre-referee in the match to fully have a decisive power on goals easily without having to mostly rely on the VAR on issues of technical matter on offside and onside as the new change will drastically reduce that. The new change now makes the two opposing decisions clear, and by that, relaxing increasing incidents and cases of debatable goal-decisions.What do you think about the change? And does it appear to be a well-thought-out change to modern day football?",

      "body": "The offside rule must be corrected from now on because of course it will be quite detrimental for players who have the opportunity to score but have to run aground just because of a few centimeters difference from the opponent's steps. We have often seen this rule so detrimental for players, especially strikers, who have to lose their chance to be able to add to the top scorer list or even be the key to a team's victory in a match. I think the VAR function now needs to be optimized and it seems that VAR will only be used to check for fouls in the penalty box.",

      "body": "I think as long as someone removes the VAR and let a referee has full power over it then it is not good for football in general,we know very well that most of the times when we lose money in our sport bets is exactly because these guys impact the game in such a way that they are clearly favoring a team,I don't know if that is intentional or not but to me looks completely intentional as I have no other explanation for why such things happen.Therefore any new rule regarding giving more power to the referee and losing some power from such a great invention in football which is the VAR can only impact football games in a negative way in my opinion.",

It should have been a long time ago.I think the matches will be more enjoyable and uninterrupted after this rule change. There may be some wrong decisions in the first year.If the rules are like the above then I think the referee no longer needs VAR at all, even by looking at the linesman the offside rule is clear enough. Imagine if this rule was really enforced, then the defender's role would be much more difficult, including defenders and midfielders who incidentally do not have fast sprints that will be easily tricked by opponents. Strikers with high sprints make it easy to score lots of goals, even hat-tricks will be created in every game. In my opinion, this regulation clearly needs to be revised again before it is ratified, because it will be very detrimental to many parties and FIFA may receive more criticism than praise.",
