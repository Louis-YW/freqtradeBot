This has already happened several times with the GPU - during the rise in the price of cryptocurrencies, like ETH. A sharp increase in demand for GPU and CPU will create a shortage and an increase in cost.From the point of view of decentralization, mining on CPUs and GPUs would be preferable, which would allow even ordinary users, just with a regular PC, to be part of the BTC-system and receive their small commissions from this. The question is, how can it be technically possible to make ASICs impossible to use? It seems to me that it is no longer possible to go back to the old ways and simply abandon mining farms.",

      "body": "anything a CPU can do a asic can do bettereven if mining changed to a 11 algo technique. ASICS can just have 11 varieties of chips each performing each algo and end up doing more hashes than a CPU/GPUthe only reason many of the multi algo mining methods altcoins dont have asics is because they are crapcoins so no one cares to design asic chips to mine those crap coinsits not a techical problem, its a lack of interest problem..end result if bitcoin changed algo is:if the difficulty the day before algo changed stayed at todays asic rated difficulty number and had to step down periodicallythe network would have needed many years of not solving blocks due to how long one cpu would take to solve a block at current difficultyit would take years for a CPU to solve 1 block let alone get 2016 blocks to then trigger a difficulty step down.. and then still years to step down enough to then be cpu attainable mining...but within that time if the community had not abandoned bitcoin already. smarter minds would have made an asic to out achieve solo mining CPU. so you wont see thousands of solomining users winning blocks per month.. if as part of the algo change they used a CPU level difficulty start point on D-Dayusers would already be trying to pool multiple CPU/GPUand within days solo mining is gone again..and if bitcoins market, utility has not already been lost due to this silly idea.. smarter minds would ahve designed asics to outperform GPUand we would be back to ASIC farming again and the silly idea would have been a waste of a couple years of annoyance.. for ultimately nothing",

In other words any algorithm can have a more efficient hardware including ASICs that performs the required computation.This is why there has never been such thing as \"ASIC resistant\" algorithm despite many altcoins creating algorithms that they call \"ASIC resistant\" starting from the oldest one LTC and the most hyped shitcoin called ETH both of which ended up having ASICs built for them.As for your concern, you have to remember that we are talking about mining pools not miners having 51% of hashrate. Pools don't own hashrate, the miners do which means they can switch to another pool and this has happened in the past like the case with GHASH.io.Another better solution to solve this is to change the pool algorithm (not Bitcoin's mining algorithm) so that the miners connecting to the pool have a control over what they mine so that the pool can't perform any attacks, vote for or refuse to vote for new proposals, etc.",
