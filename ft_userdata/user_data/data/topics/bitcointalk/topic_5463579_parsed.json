I am not too interested in news concerning this, but I don't want Nigerian soldiers to be used because we will definitely lose our brothers and sisters through a war that is not related to us while we have our internal insecurity that the soldiers are yet to solve.Our president requested our soldiers be deployed there, which I do not support because this is pure politics; they will kill our brothers and the politicians will be there in their homes, and if this war is started now, we don't know when it will end.",

Coup was done by Niger military against their president and the coup enjoyed the support of the citizens... this shows it is an internal politics that does not require meddling by any external forces. What I see with this ECOWAS and other African leaders is dancing to the tune of the West. Most of the corrupt African leaders wear rigged into office by the West, who prefer the worst of us to lead us. So, those leaders are just doing the biding of the West that depend on the Uranium of Niger for goo proportion of their nuclear power plants and ammunition.",

The civilian government is not doing their mandatories and all what they know is to suffer the people. So to some extent, military regime is needed in Niger Republic and Nigeria as well.",

So generally speaking they rather stay away from leadership struggles and issues. They were created to defend the republic and they are not specialized to decide which person should rule.",

This is the exact point that the western African leaders in ECOWAS are neglecting which is very crucial before they decide to go for military intervention. The citizens are happy about the coup, why will they worry themselves again. Who are they fighting for? The citizens they’ll want to fight for are okay with the military government and this war will look like the ECOWAS is fighting against the Nigerien people all.

      "body": "A major challenge faced by African nations is the issue of ineffective governance. Although democracy was initially introduced with the intention of benefiting the citizens, it has unfortunately proven to be unsuccessful. The leaders have consistently caused the population to endure hardships and poverty, all the while engaging in extensive looting of the nation's resources. Given that the people of Niger appear to be content with the current coup leaders, it may be advisable to allow them to proceed without external interference.",

The people of Niger are actually in support of the junta and are giving the military a thank you commendation for their actions.Imagine a situation whereby virtually all her citizens are happy and attacks nations verbally and on social media who speaks against the junta. This shows you how much they have been clamouring for change of leadership and  possibly, I believe there  must be something more to this actions of Niger citizens than one could imagine.I do.not in any way subscribe to a military regime or junta as it always causes a setback in the economy of that nation when sanctions are placed on them.",

Take the worst, most rapacious civilian democracy. Then, give them the power to abrogate the constitution (including all your fundamental rights like right to life, free speech and all those unnecessary things like that), let make their own laws and form their own courts where you are presumed guilty. Then give them military uniform. That is essentially what military rule. No saint is good enough to have that kind of power. Never again.

Viz: Benin, Cape Verde, Côte D'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau (not Guinea), Liberia, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo if those four countries are excluded.ECOWAS members wanted the war, but Nigeria is slowing it down. Niger Junta said Mohamed Bazoum would be killed if ECOWAS invade their territory. Is that not coward?I do not wish for warThe longer it takes, the more the Juntas will prepare. I wish there could be a dialogue. But if it is war, those Juntas can not win ECOWAS. But likely USA, Europe, UK for ECOWAS and Russia for Juntas would be what might occur next.",
