How many of us actually read the terms and conditions of any site we sign up for? They're usually kilometric. To those who read, how many of you actually understood the stipulations therein? To those who think they understood everything, did you consult a lawyer or any professional to make sure you got everything right?Celsius, to those who don't know, was one of the largest crypto lending platforms in the world. Aside from offering loans, users could also invest by depositing funds to the platform. No minimum required. They could earn as high as 18.63% APY which is paid on a weekly basis. Last July of 2022, however, it went bankrupt. It owed billions to its clients. Just a few days ago, the bankruptcy judge ruled that the money deposited by users are owned by Celsius and not by the depositors. Surprised? Unbelievable? Well, that's what each and every user agreed to when they signed up for the platform. By depositing, users are actually giving their money to Celsius. Deposit is like transferring ownership from the user to the platform. Of Celsius' hundreds of thousands of users, was there anybody who noticed this particular term? I doubt. So, what happens now? I guess the ruling could still be appealed, but for the meantime, it seems Celsius doesn't owe a Satoshi to its client. So, those who have lost their life savings in Celsius could probably say good bye to the hope of getting it back. Lessons? There's only one: keep your Bitcoin to yourself! No company will have any power over your funds. No possibility of bankruptcy, mismanagement, rug pull, and others. No sneaky terms and conditions. No unfair ruling. No frozen funds, locked accounts, whatever. Forget about passive income, yield, and the like. They're baits!Source:https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/05/celsius-crypto-bankruptcy-ruling/?isMobile=1",

It is normal for terms and conditions to explicitly stipulate that the company has the right to amend or change certain terms without necessarily informing the users. And everybody just clicks 'yes, I fully understand and agree' even without understanding nor agreeing. Heck, without even reading. Many are probably like you who only invest in centralized platforms what they can afford to lose. Celsius claimed that it had around 1.7 million users in June of 2022. Let's say everyone of those believed that it's indeed safer to deposit just a small amount. The average deposit could just be $100 per user. That's already more than a hundred million of, well, donation or gift.",

On the contrary, the entire wrapper of the project is drawn up in a large and colorful color, which completely discourages the desire to think about all the shortcomings, creating the illusion of success and popularity.The problem is that most clients are not legally educated and do not understand all the risks of investing in various kinds of platforms, but the advertising noise that the Celsius platform has also dealt with makes them take risks, hoping for quick pluses, which in the end, as usual, led to their own problems.",

So they can escape from the money they owe, sadly Sam Bankman Fried is too quickly get jailed before Celsius bankrupt lol.",

Companies don't have to to point out what specifics were changed. They might just say something vague like, our terms of service have been updated, please take a look at what has changed. And they just email you the link to their TOS. Now it's up to you to go through the document and see for yourself. Banking institutions do that, for example. My bank never tells me what changed, just that something did. This is particularly true if the changes are not in favor of the users. The email is not going to highlight points that make that service worse because they are running a business. Their intention is to present themselves as a strong and quality company, and not one with evident faults.",

That's why before making a deposit into an exchange spend a lot of time researching about them. QuoteThat is why i don't deposit large amount in an exchange once profit I reduce the fund in an exchange and transfer it to my walletWithdrawing funds from exchanges after every profitable trade is not a good idea for me, you keep them paying fees for doing it over and over again. Withdraw them once you finished playing with the funds.Quote from: Darker45 on January 07, 2023, 02:28:27 AMCelsius, to those who don't know, was one of the largest crypto lending platforms in the world.

The terms and conditions of most of the exchanges are more or less same but also read them and the best solution is to choose a reputed exchange.",
