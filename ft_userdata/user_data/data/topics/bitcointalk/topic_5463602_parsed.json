  "content": "I'll create a new resume or fix and rewrite (as needed) your current resume and in addition I\"ll offer career advice as needed.I keep up with the news and latest trends in employment as I do this for you and offer my advice freely to my clients.My process starts by researching what HR managers are looking for in your field, optimizing the resume for your specific case, and making sure your resume is ATS compliant so you can use it to apply online. I've extensive experience with all job types and have one of the most extensive resume databases ever written by a single person!My results are real and can be confirmed via a simple reddit search of my username.What do I offer? ATS-Compliant resumes and original cover letters, all original, all tailor-made to suit your needs.Research-based boost to your resume- Even though most resume writers are ex-HR personnel, they're not usually the best candidates to hack the brains of their kind and in hack I mean, understand how they work, on what criteria they base their evaluation, and what subconsciously drives them to pick a candidate over the other, but lucky enough for you, I use a research-based approach to my resume building. You can thank Harvard and other universities for allowing access to their research. Flexibility and Tailor-made resumes - My resumes can target a single vacancy that you want, or can cover a wide variety of job offers, your choice.Proven experience and results: You can search reddit for \"randvoo12\"  ( and you'll see random recommendations speaking about the results of my work. Price list:- Check/re-write/fix/enhance without changing template: $15- Resume: $30.- Original cover letter: $10.- Resume+Cover letter: $35Payment method: [Cryptocurrency (BTC, BNB, ETH, USDT only) and Paypal] ONLYHow to contact me?Please bid on the post and send an email to [resumes.moe@gmail.com]The email should include :-The service or offer you want.-Your forum username.-Your current resume.-What you need to be edited or taken care of.-Any job ads you wanna apply to.-Deadline by which you want it back, you don't have to be super-specific, just give me an idea about when you want it back.Clarifications :Research is king: I do all types of work fields since I mainly research the job and then research the areas you reside in, I don't just rely on experience and prior knowledge.I'll give you your resume before taking any money from you because my customer satisfaction is high and I'm confident in my service but please once I deliver can you not make me wait for my money?I've been doing this professionally on Reddit and other websites for years and have been doing it for longer in my local community. I served many Redditors (500+), unfortunately not all of them left vouches, but you can check some of those vouches here, here, and in this Imgur post the rest are scattered in old archived vouch threads or their respective offers posts.I usually have other clients from other marketplaces and websites, so expect a delay of a few days in the delivery of your work or you can ask for same-day delivery for an additional 15$ fee.All work is delivered through Google Documents links.I retain the right to ask for an advance payment or a deposit before I start working.",
