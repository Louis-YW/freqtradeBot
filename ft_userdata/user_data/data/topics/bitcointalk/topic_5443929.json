  "content": "Hello guys. Me and my friend started trading with literally 0 money. We used someones promo code and we got some free bitcoin. We gained a lot of money since then but we have a problem. To withdraw money we need to deposit 0.05 btc. We literally had no idea about this only now when we tried to get money from an ATM and since we are just students (both of us are 15 years old) we dont know what to do. I know my account is fresh and it could sound like a scam but its not. We can send you a screenshot of our balance or anything. Just ask.",

Wow, you must be a magician. Do it again (9090x) and you'll soon have a little bit over $900 million. It's just weird that you would waste such potential on an exchange that asks for a $1000 deposit before you can withdraw your 9090x profit. I'm sure you actually did a 9090x, and this isn't just the weird-ass exchange without a single google result tampering your profits so you be greedy and deposit $1000 to \"cashout\", right?",

NEVER DO BACKROOM DEALS VIA PM WITH NEW USERS. Make sure all deals are negotiated in the open forum for both public record and peer review.BTW - Show me on that website where it says it's Okay or 15 year-olds to be trading.Quote from: Tomi200000000 on March 07, 2023, 07:57:25 PM(both of us are 15 years old)What's your user name there?",

Therefore, the information about us on the web is minimal. We value the privacy of our users more than the promotion of the exchange. 4. The deposit we require is really big for some, for others it's pennies. 5. To withdraw your funds we ask for activation of premium account because we can not explain the origin of large amounts of funds in a short period of time, but our security service has not found anything suspicious. A premium account is a guarantee for us.We do have problems with indexation, which we are addressing. And we are not promising any huge sums.Due to a recent attack on our servers and a change of host, our website is no longer indexed by search engines, so it is not visible.

All rights reserved. Ltd ABN 19 619 574 186\"ABN means Australian Business Register, and if you search that register, you will find out there is a real company behind it. The name of the entity is CASEY BLOCK SERVICES PTY LTD, registered in 2018.and their business is named Coinspot, which is a registered crypto currency exchange website (https://www.coinspot.com.au/).To a random 15 year-old, googling any of these would be proof enough that the website they're on is legit.Hopefuly Tomi realises he is being conned.",
