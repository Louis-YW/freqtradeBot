  "content": "As reported from the Bitcoin Ekasi Twitter post I found children in Africa doing daily grocery shopping using Bitcoin. The child from Africa has been digitally literate since childhood, through Bitcoin Ekasi or often referred to as a non-profit organization has succeeded in creating bitcoin economic programs in various cities in South Africa. The organization partners with a company called The Surfer Kids to empower children from an early age to earn money. The most famous of the program is surfing training. As a result, the child will get a salary in Bitcoin. With the work that the child gets, he can spend Bitcoin at several vendors who have partnered with Ekasi.The positive point that I take is that this kind of program stage is really effectively implemented. Where to introduce the world of Bitcoin by way of direct transactions. So that in the future they are familiar with the digitalization payment process.In your opinion, how far behind is our country when in fact the government does not want or does not provide support for something like this to happen? if under the pretext of no financial control then how jealous we are of African countries which in the next 5 to 10 years will be at the forefront of digital transactions, especially Bitcoin for the younger generation.Source :https://bitcoin-bay.org/https://www.thesurferkids.com/https://twitter.com/BitcoinEkasi/status/1554539426126204928https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later",

Africa is taking it to the higher bar with thier innovation. We also knew they were able to have an option to send BTC thru SMS.",

      "body": "Maybe I misunderstood something, but I didn't find anything that would connect these kids to Bitcoin in the sense that they do something to get paid, but their coaches who teach them to surf are paid in Bitcoin. These trainers then try to pass on their knowledge to everyone else, including children - creating something similar to Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador.However, it is interesting to see that children can obviously very easily master paying with Bitcoin, which in this case is LN - so if it is not a problem for them, then it will not be a problem for the older population either.Quote from: naira on September 04, 2022, 01:47:15 PMIn your opinion, how far behind is our country when in fact the government does not want or does not provide support for something like this to happen? if under the pretext of no financial control then how jealous we are of African countries which in the next 5 to 10 years will be at the forefront of digital transactions, especially Bitcoin for the younger generation.I think these are rare examples for which it is difficult to find an example in some other countries (with the exception of El Salvador). Consequently, it is not realistic to expect such things to happen in some developed countries, but in countries where people are much more left to themselves and the government does not care too much if someone promotes Bitcoin in this way. However, I am not sure that we can talk about the fact that Africa as a continent will be ahead of others when it comes to digital transactions (especially Bitcoin), because not all African countries are equal when it comes to human rights, the level of economic development and the level of corruption.",

This brings two things important so to make bitcoin adoption easier:1, Gives youth an avenue of knowing how and what to use bitcoin for in their daily lives.2. Has another country to see bitcoin as a means rather than an end to financial freedom.You got to start from somewhere and build upon it from there. And this shows how this is being done in this African nation.",

Also it keeps far high among the countries that are crypto friendly. The way by which the kids were rewarded with bitcoin is really good plan. Now, they'll also know about the value of learning.This shows that African countries are much into cryptocurrency compared to the rest of the world. Another reason for the same seems to be the government and the inflated currencies.",

I reckon South Africa might also bring one of the largest inflows of new adopters to the cryptospace before the next bull market begins and it might also be the cause for the next bull market. Binance's partnership with the Nigerian government to create a digital economic zone might be an indicator that Africa is the next jurisdiction of interest after America and Asia.Binance is partnering with Nigeria to build an Export Processing Zone Authority (NEPZA). The aim is to create a digital economic area similar to Dubai.The report stated that the Nigerian authorities intend to build a zone that will be similar to Dubai’s virtual free zone. The space upon completion will be the first in the West African region.NEPZA’s Managing Director, Adesoji Adesugba, said the country’s “goal is to engender a flourishing virtual free zone to take advantage of a near trillion dollar virtual economy in blockchains and digital economy.”Source https://beincrypto.com/binance-partners-with-nigeria-to-build-digital-economic-zone/",

So it is definitely easier for them to understand and use Bitcoin compared to the older generation who would even find it hard to familiarize themselves with digital technologies. But I think making young children work and earn money is not really empowerment. I hope these young children are also going to school and get the education they deserve. I hope they're also having enough time to just play and act like the children that they are instead of seriously focusing on livelihood.",

      "body": "In the future, more and more people will use bitcoin in Africa. Moreover, Bitcoin has become a legal tender in the country. so do not be surprised if the children began to be taught about bitcoin. either directly or indirectly.It's ironic, when our country, which is more advanced in technology and modernization, still hasn't been able to take the same steps as El Salvador and the Central African Republic. But of course there are many things that must be considered for a country to make certain policies. like africa and el salvador they made a policy of adopting bitcoin is indeed they are in need of it. imagine el salvador before the adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment there. El Salvador is still a country that is not widely known by the outside world. so that tourists to the country is very minimal. despite the strategic location of their country if you look at the trade routes. but in the tourism sector they were less advanced at that time. but now after el salvador made a policy about bitcoin as a legal payment tool in the country, the tourism sector to the country is increasing rapidly. and help their economy a little. and el salvador is now a country that is quite famous. So do not be surprised if there is an increase in tourism there. and shops that accept bitcoin as a means of payment are commonplace there.And soon in Africa, such a scene as in El Salvador will become common there. it takes time for the citizens of these countries to adapt. like in el salvador which initially had a lot of rejection from its citizens. but now the citizens there are getting used to and adapting to the new system. and in Africa I see people there will be more open in accepting bitcoin. hopefully more countries will make policies regarding bitcoin as a legal tender.I haven't read any news about the State of Panama which is also interested in bitcoin.",

Now, it is helping that there can be hub of innovations or platforms that are using their heads and not their high-flying ideas when it comes to marketing to the people just like this program for kids using Bitcoin which is to me looks like a surf-to-earn kind of thing. Hope the same success can be duplicated elsewhere and I am thinking that the same can also be popularized in El Salvador where many people already called its Bitcoin adoption as a failure.",

And after all, Africa does need this innovation. and I think the younger generation there will be very easy for many to be interested in and even it seems that many are already interested in bitcoin. If we look at the increase in crypto users in Africa, we can see the potential for rapid growth in the country in the field of cryptocurrency. although there are still limitations in the country such as electricity which has not been able to reach the entire region. and the internet is not as advanced in our country. but it looks like it won't be a problem in the future.Even Africa is in second place if based on data on the continent with the most user growth in the age group of 18-24 years oldSourch : bitocto.com & Coinmarketcap",

No wonder why Africa with all the conditions and limitations of the economy, food, and other resources actually motivates them to able to build an image of far-sighted thinking about technology. Despite all these obstacles, isn't this enough to motivate developed countries which are still silent about paying attention to digitalization. It is undeniable that we are in a changing transaction towards the digital era. Therefore, what Africa is piloting will be a consideration that every country can take part in being a part of Bitcoin adoption in the future.",
