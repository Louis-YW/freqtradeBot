Terra UST was a stablecoin and it was safe until one day it suddenly wasn't. Something similar can maybe happen to DAI tomorrow or Tether. Centralized or decentralized, they might still get de-pegged. Anchor Protocol was a big factor in the UST fiasco. Waaaay too much money was locked in the platform where interest rates of 20% were being offered. Unsustainable interest rates that started dropping after a while. When that happened, people lost interest in UST. That tells you that for 80% of the investors (that was reported as the percentage of the total allocation locked in Anchor Protocol), USTs only use case was to earn those 20% extra rewards. And that's it. Take away or lower their rewards and the system falls apart.",

It doesn't make sense in my opinion. thats why beware guys about this kind of offer. and sorry to say that Defi hype has already cooled down.",

We don't need to wonder why these meme coins just fail in the first place, as the majority of these projects are meant to be scammy. Well, some got lucky and earned a profit but sadly, many become a victim of such a quick-rich scheme promoted by the developers. Actually, I don't have any interest in them and just ignore them.It is very important to know what projects we are about to invest and we have to stop believing \"instant returns, double your money, etc...that is only a lie. Such dirty tactics won't succeed anymore.",

Well it's obvious that if a project is giving a high APY this something is wrong there. I mean the era of high yield project is gone, the hype has died down and the market is saturated already.And now the game is that everyone is trying to lower their APY because obviously it's business at the end of the day and profits is the key for this projects.So I will agree with your warning, and everyone should be very careful specially with the market conditions that we are in right now.",

Mostly of these kinds of tokens were scam that was offering very big APY which was actually non sense thing. Being created with non sense supply and im sure that if creator wanna only scamming its members. The same thing that was happening with darth, and many scam token with non sense APY. This kind of project is only using its APY as a bullet to shoot the investors to be their victim.Only dumb people will be falling into this kind of shit. I don't even believe why so many people are betting into this kind of project which was actually a scam project since it was starting.",

I guess what you wanted to say in your comment, but I'm afraid you did it in a terrible way.To think that LUNA, a project that failed and investors lost all their money, is better than projects that work but have red flags, is downright idiotic.Everyone should do a thorough analysis of the project they are investing in. If someone does not know how to do such analyzes, then he should not invest at all.",
