You can do whatever you like or whatever you want, you can follow whatever you like or feel like following, but be careful for you not to let altcoins to disappoint you, see altcoins as gambling, use the amount you can afford to lose to invest in altcoins. I understood you about what you mean about FTT and Luna, but they are risky to invest in, but nothing bad to take the risk, but be careful and do it with small amount of money that you are ready to lose like I said before.",

I hope you don't cry in the end and regret it, this time because it's very difficult to gamble money investing in FTT right now, that's how it happened to luna until it became 0.00028$ each.I don't know if you are just encouraging other members here in the forum to invest in FTT as well as you are brave enough? Maybe then I'll buy it when it becomes 0.0003$ each of those, I can gamble my money for that dude.",

There is a very high risk that FTT and Luna will never recover to their previous values again.Of course, FTT and Luna should be ignored and I would never gamble with either altcoin. Anyone who is aware of the risks probably wouldn't invest in either altcoin, but we wouldn't discourage people from gambling with both as long as they can afford to lose money.So let them be with themselves and their own choices even though we have suggested the best for them. Life would be calmer if the investment we currently have is bitcoin, besides that we see too much risk in the long term.",

Btc and the top cryptos can crash and recover. They will work like this forever but for those who are shitcoins, they can crash and won't recover again. Not all altcoins are junk. As long as you know how to do a research then you can always find a good one but you should observe them because who knows?Maybe the devs of those coins became greedy or they can lose interest on their project which can result for the collapse of the coin but this can't possibly happen with btc and we don't even know if its founder is still alive or not so there is no need to worry about it. Overall, investing won't only depend on the asset but will also depend on the person that invests on it. Not all those who bought btc are in profit and not all those who bought luna are losers.",

FTX is not a bank and it is not like governments want to help this market to grow, so it is in their best interests to let it crash so fear takes over the market, however at the end you are free to do whatever you want, it is your money and if you believe you are right then you can follow this strategy, however I doubt you will find many members on this forum which will support your views.",

But there are also those who bought BTC 5 years ago and now have a loss, despite the fact that during this time bitcoin has established ATH. Maybe it's still better to partially fix the profit?",
