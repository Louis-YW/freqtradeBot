Most of the tokens can easily be regarded as get rich quick projects because in short Periods of time they grow higher in price than the coins but they never keep up to the hype. So when talking about profit I don’t know maybe you are looking into a long term scenario but if that’s the case the coins are much better to invest in than the tokens. They are some what not pump and dump like tokens. QuoteWhy I'm asking this question is because tokens has a variety of exchange options to trade them on like DEX and CEX but coins can only be traded when they're listed on centralized exchange  and when trade are halted you can't buy or sell that coin that you're holding. I disagree with this, I think most of the coins since they have their own parent chain are recognized or listed on many exchanges most especially the bigger ones than tokens. Even after lunching you still find some tokens finding it hard to been listed on popular exchanges",

A coin you can trade that has a strong foundation. Ethereum can. While tokens I can say no. So, choose coins not tokens.If you refer to the project considerations, most of the projects create tokens and for me it will be wasted not for a long time, because there have been many projects where the age is not until the project is completed as planned.Now is no longer the time for memes and the era of memes is over. Just like trading on hype coins or tokens. It is vulnerable to losing money.Choose a coin that is sure in the long run. There is no prohibition to trade, but it is better to invest and the best investment is in Bitcoin.",

If you trade scam coins or scam tokens, you will have bigger risk to lose because after pumps and dumps, rug pulls, price will not recover.Reducing risk if you want to trade, by choosing very old altcoins or tokens with high trading volume.

I think between tokens and coins they are the same if it is about for day trading. But when talking about long-term trading then of course choosing a coin that has its own blockchain (Layer 1) and has a constantly growing ecosystem is the best. An example here is Ethereum. But lately Layer 2 and Layer 3 are also quite popular. But I still feel that Layer 2 and Layer 3 projects will not be as good as Layer 1 which is the parent ecosystem in a Blockchain. So the answer depends on what type of trade you are referring to. whether trading short term or long term.",

If it's better to trade coins, you can ignore exchange tokens or buy them and keep them as an investment. The difficulty is finding coins or tokens to trade because more tokens and coins are now on the market, requiring more in-depth analysis.But you have to be careful in analyzing the tokens or coins because not all of them can make a profit. Often the coins or tokens move fast but it turns out to be just a trap for panicked traders so they get stuck buying at high prices.But for now, it's better to buy coins or tokens that have the potential to increase in the future and we can find this out by analyzing each coin or token. If you are in doubt, it's better to wait for market conditions to decline so that you can have more options to analyze it and be able to see coins or tokens that can increase later.",

In trading, you want to use leverage, checking how volatile a coin or token is very important. There are some coins or tokens that will require you not to use leverage at all. With some, you will best use half or less of your trading fund. Some coins are shitcoins. Also some tokens are shitcoins. Avoid them.

The difference between the token and the coins is that the coins may have a demand if a lot of projects are included in the blockchain such as MATIC and Tron.The chance of profit in the token is higher, but the investment is high risk, so I do not advise the beginner to invest in tokens now.All you need to know is whether this currency solves a fundamental problem or offers something new and distinctive that is not found in others. If this is true, invest in it at a rate not exceeding 5%.I also advise you to learn more about bitcoin and blockchain, wallets, platforms and how to secure your coins.",

From my experience I saw several tokens just crashed because team dumped or sold a huge quantity of tokens. Any many projects are now just vanished from the market and mostly they are tokens. It may happen to a Coin also as we saw what happened with LUNA Coin. So if you want to choose more secure or long term projects to invest or trade always choose Coins but should have potential and fundamentally strong.Actually it doesn't mean every Coin will generate you profits but there still have some high potential tokens for a quicker growth. But in long term tokens can't perform well according to coins. So my thinking is always choose several best projects to trade and never trade all of your assets In a single project. Thay can vanish you anytime if something bad arrives.To know about good projects for trading just research some of them from top ranked Cryptocurrencies either it token or coin. And always depend on technical analysis, research and be updated with ongoing events.",

I agree with you to prefer trade in coins than token, volume transaction is most important and factor to make some coins or token have chance up to higher price, but when getting trouble with less transaction volume actually not any investor yet interested for trading with coin/token has lower volume transaction.

There are step-by-step tutorials that you can follow to create your own token in literally 5 minutes without any advanced skills, and the process consumes almost no resources. On the other hand, coins with their own blockchain require a significant investment of time, expertise, and resources (unless it is a complete clone of an existing coin). Developing a new cryptocurrency from scratch involves creating a unique blockchain and wallet software, which requires coding skills and a deep understanding of blockchain technology. For this very reason, you will find many more different tokens on the market than coins.However, this doesn't hold much weight when it comes to the profitability of trading or investing. You can equally find examples that support either side of the argument. In my personal opinion, coins with their own blockchain may have better prospects for the future because they usually have a team of developers supporting them. On the other hand, there are numerous examples of strong price jumps for some tokens, especially when we consider that there were projects that started with a token and later migrated to their own blockchain.",
