  "content": "I can't be the only one. After chipmixer was shut down, a ton of other mixers started operating at a very close proximity time-wise. Is that fishy or am I paranoid? It can't be that one sided I think.Chipmixer had indeed become too big. There was a lot of co-mingling between its funds and funds from darknet marketplaces. So after one of the biggest darknet marketplaces was traced and shut down, naturally authorities also went for this big mixer. While authorities claim to have managed to seize more than 1909.4 bitcoins in that sting, that probably didn't cover the full balances of the mixer. The recently seized mixer, Sinbad, was said to have been a re-launch of a blender that came under sanctions for having laundered funds that were stolen by North Korean hackers. We can all safely assume that this is very notorious business. And what most of these services had in common was that they were advertising on bitcointalk. This really does make you think, WHY? Why would a service allegedly moving billions worth in proceeds need to advertise here, and so aggressively even, especially when their customer base seems to be set in stone from day one? I have a simple theory on why that might be happening. By looking at what generated the largest volumes in these mixers, I conclude that no bitcointalk user could be possibly be in need to launder billions in hacked funds, and would never be in dire need to launder cash associated with violent crime like drugs or fraud at this magnitude. Instead, an illusion of privacy was promoted to clearnet users (that's us here in bitcointalk), while in fact our \"cleaner\" funds were used to bail out real criminals and terrorists. Because to a mixer, a clean bitcoin, is worth more than market value, so they were willing to overpay for it in the form of advertising. Come to think of it, the recent bust of Sinbad served as a reminder that mixers are in fact very traceable. Authorities even had contacted exchanges ahead of time and even users participating in the signature campaign faced issues having to answer to authorities:Quote from: Turbartuluk on November 30, 2023, 08:24:18 AMQuote from: AHOYBRAUSE on November 30, 2023, 01:17:06 AMVielleicht werden die ja von FBI usw ja auch schon ins Visier genommen.  Ich könnte mir vorstellen, dass die Sinbad Kampagne da vielleicht schon noch ein Nachspiel haben wird, zumindest hat mich Binance heute folgendes gefragt:Dem aufmerksamen Leser dürfte die Adresse bekannt vorkommen, ist nämlich die Escrow Adresse der Sinbad Kampagne.What's the point then, of using a mixer, when your funds can be traced so easily? Do its methods of mixing really work, or could it be that this is intended functionality for someone to get the short end of the stick? This is all just a theory of course, but honestly, trust no one, not even me. It's a very real possibility though, that with mixers, we might be the product.",

Some even talk about exchanges tracking you:QuoteIn difficult times like these, when even the smallest online shops or cryptocurrency exchanges are tracking all your transactions, you shouldn't forget about privacy, since privacy is an inalienable right of every person.The above is from a mixer's promotional materials. Tell me if THAT doesn't seem like the mixer is directly encouraging the user to interact between exchange and mixer. What kind of anonymity and privacy that might be, that associates your KYC'd exchange account to criminally tainted coins, I don't know. But surely mixers would like us to believe that they stand for privacy.",

I think it is too naive to think that if I am an innocent user and my coins used to deposit to a mixer will give me clean coins after the mixing process. I know my received coins after mixing will be tainted.Usually exchanges don't trace your coins too far, too deep in history so tainted coins will be limited with some rounds of transactions. It can be differently defined by exchanges and their analysis tools for AML compliance.",

An address can't simply be a means of identification without finding the person and then investigating whatever they have. In other words, criminals are the first target, then mixers are second. If the mixer is in first place, then global regulations will close the existing mixer services regardless of whether they've been involved in money laundering or not.​",

After chipmixer was shut down, a ton of other mixers started operating at a very close proximity time-wise. Is that fishy or am I paranoid? It can't be that one sided I think.Before Chipmixer we had bitmixer. Bitmixer was really the biggest bitcoin mixer but their owner decided to shut down this money-making website because many people were arrested in 2016-17 and many darknets were seized, he would probably be the next. Bitmixer shut down their service and then many people created mixer websites, many used the shut down of bitmixer to start a new business and many mixers came up on market. Chipmixer was only invented two months earlier before bitmixer announced shutdown of their service. Chipmixer started signature campaign similar to bitmixer.io and slightly increased their payrate soon. Then soon bitmixer announced a shutdown but chipmixer continued. Despite a huge rise of bitcoin's price, chipmixer kept their original bitcoin payrates and hired even more people. Chipmixer hired one of the best, trustworthy and famous bitcointalk users, promoted service through them and become one of the biggest mixer. Btw not many mixers started operating after chipmixer was shut down. Many mixers that you see advertised on this forum started this business before chipmixer's shutdown, not after their shutdown.Quote from: alani123 on December 04, 2023, 02:43:03 PMThis really does make you think, WHY?

Do you really mean that mixers are exploiting the clean Bitcoin they receive from users who came through a promotional campaign on Bitcointalk to compensate for the dirty Bitcoin they receive from criminals on the dark web? This is a rather interesting theory, but it is also strange.First, because this assumes that all of Mixer's clients from the forum are innocent people looking to protect their privacy, and that all of his clients from Darkweb are necessarily criminals who want to launder their money. This is not absolutely true, and it is certain that any information can only be confirmed by the mixer himself.Secondly, assuming the first hypothesis is correct, this would lead to the conclusion that clean Bitcoin is equal to the dirty Bitcoin that is to be replaced, which does not seem logical because I do not think that an ordinary person who obtained Bitcoin legitimately would be interested in mixing millions of dollars.Thirdly, this forum or any other place would not have allowed this or would not have discovered it, especially with the multiplicity of tracking methods on the blockchain and the companies that have become specialized in this, able to track many transactions and verify their source.",
