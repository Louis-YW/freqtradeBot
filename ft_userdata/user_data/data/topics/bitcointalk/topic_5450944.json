Long-form Youtube videos from FreeCodeCamp are a good place to start with this kind of stuff, that's where I recommend everyone else who wants to learn how to code as well. Although taking an online bootcamp will also help you out on the SQL side as well.",

Any advice ?I suggest learning to code without any particular application in mind at first. Start out with a language that is easy to learn and widely used such as Python or Javascript.There are many sites that teach coding. I don't have any recommendations, but try https://www.codecademy.com/.While mastering the basics, you might try to write applications that can create and process SQL queries or interact with financial APIs.",

      "body": "Learning to code can be a challenging but rewarding experience. Here are some steps to get started:Choose a programming language: There are many programming languages to choose from, but for the purposes you mentioned, you may want to consider starting with Python for Bitcoin coding and SQL for database management. Both of these languages are widely used in the industry and have plenty of learning resources available.Find learning resources: There are many online resources available for learning programming languages, such as Codecademy, Coursera, edX, and Udemy. You can also find tutorials and articles on websites like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Medium.Practice coding: The best way to learn coding is to practice coding. Start by working through small coding challenges, such as those on CodeWars or HackerRank, and gradually work up to more complex projects. For Bitcoin coding, you can start with simple scripts and then move on to more complex projects like building a wallet.Join a coding community: Joining a coding community can be a great way to learn from others and get feedback on your coding projects. You can find online communities on platforms like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit.Attend coding events: Attending coding events like hackathons, coding bootcamps, and coding meetups can be a great way to meet other coders, learn new skills, and work on coding projects.Remember that learning to code is a long-term process, so don't get discouraged if you encounter difficulties along the way. Keep practicing, asking for help, and seeking out new learning opportunities, and you'll be well on your way to mastering Bitcoin coding and SQL",

It will give you a pathway to start.Sorry, but this is terrible advice for inexperienced programmers who just started to learn how to code in the correct way. I mean, to receive a meaningful answer from ChatGPT, one should ask it a properly formulated question that takes into account all the subtleties of the programming language of choice. Obviously, a programmer that hasn't yet decided which language to learn can't know all these nuances. If one has no prior experience in programming, one can't notice some shortcomings, inefficiencies, and bugs in the solution that ChatGPT generates, one can't adequately evaluate if it is the most optimal solution to the problem or not a solution at all. However, ChatGPT is a perfect place to build your personal learning roadmap for quickly familiarizing yourself with the core concepts of any programming language. It is not meant to solve all your problems you enconter during coding, but can become a helpful tool to make you more productive.",
