  "content": "EDIT (May 17, 2024 at 10:39am Central Time US): Before reading the following and deciding to post a negative comment, don't. If you think this was a waste of your time, don't waste more of your time trying to state it was a waste of your time... That'll just make you the one wasting your own time... That, was hella confusing to write LMFAO... Anyways, this thread isn't a scam to sell a wallet.dat file, it's a thread of my discovery and where I found this file and the alleged addresses this wallet held.So, I've been doing some digging and found a wallet.dat file in the format that seems closest to the way electrum's wallet files are formatted. I've manually looked through the in case, and it checked out alright. I loaded the file onto electrum and like the thread title states, it throws a \"corrupted file\" error and that I need to derive it from the seed again to restore it. I obviously didn't do it right away since I wanted to see what it held.To my surprise... whoever originally held this wallet was able to import the Mt Gox address (the one starting with 1Feex) and couple other addresses with jackload of bitcoin... The total that this person held in this wallet.dat is as shown in this screenshot:https://snipboard.io/Ivjt3y.jpgHere is another screen shot of the electrum window with the addresses displayed:https://snipboard.io/tRxerl.jpgI will reveal more info of where I got this file and how later as this information seems to be very valuable even if the file may be corrupted.Take into account before replying, that I am not here to spread misinformation or any false leads, I am just stating what I have found and have taken me couple days for me to make this decision to make this finding public.Lemme know your thoughts!EDIT: also, if this wallet.dat file is a well known thing in this forum, do let me know so I don't have to make a fool of myself stating I found something everyone already knew about lol",

So far, I'm not impressed.My original response:The actual fuck? Why would I waste time to do that? Have you not read a single word I wrote? I don't understand what your thinking process here.Buttttt.....Took time to rethink what I would say:Sure, there are people out there who try to scam others in the way you described. But I have clearly mentioned that I am wanting the forum's feedback on what I have stumbled across.I have no reason to photoshop what I found, cuz I don't like being deceived (experienced it myself, as I believe everyone did one point or several point in their lifetime) so I don't like deceiving others on anything. I respectfully asked for people's thoughts and opinion and of course, what you had to share is one. So thank you for sharing your thoughts but I find it very rude (in the perspective of the OP) but also very valid (as I would have thought the same myself if I were in the perspective of responding to an OP).I dunno if it's just me, but I think it would be better off if we don't start off convos with such negativity and pessimistic pov unless it's obvious that an OP should get the rough talk.If I were to say that I'm trying to sell this corrupted file (along with the broken english, idk but broken english is what makes them super obvious and hilarious for even trying XD) for money or something without anything said, I'd find the rough talk and the pessimism valid.But yeah, I dunno, I get carried away in trying to elaborate my perspective it ended up being a longer response than I expected LOLBut do expect my responses to be hella long since I want to make sure I explain things in a way everyone understands",

I can't get the gist of why you did it. what exactly?I guess most don't want to even 'waste' time on responding to the thread. I know how scammers work and their stupid ahh gimmick to tell a convincing story and yada yada yada. I still took my shot and tried to see if there would be anyone left who wouldn't start off their comments with \"you're a scammer, etc etc etc\"Anyways, to the real juicy details (idk, rereading before posting, it kinda sounds anticlimactic but oh well X-X):I was google dorking and deep web searching to see if there are any leaked wallet.dat files (obviously rarely any since if your a real crypto bro, you'd be smarter than to store that important file in an online directory) and stumbled across one in a directory for rpg games... Specifically the Russian RPG server directory... I don't want to point fingers but it hey, it was there...The rpg's main website is https://www.rpg-club.orgAnd if you were to specifically google dork something about wallet.dat this link pops up https://www.rpg-club.info/rpg-club.net_2018.sql             <  this one is a .infoObviously the first thing I saw was the difference in the links as the main is a .org and the link I found the file was a .info                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |I made sure to double check with the main website and it shows the same thing: https://www.rpg-club.org/rpg-club.net_2018.sql                       < this one is a .org like the main websiteThey both show the same thing, and I may not be technically advanced enough to look for any other directories they have that may store similar information.That is where I found the corrupted wallet.dat file and you can go to download it yourself to check it out (obviously make sure to double check it through notepad or something first in case your that paranoid... dw, I was and that's what I did too lol).Like I mentioned above to BitMaxz, I was trying to use pywallet to recover it or at least attempt to recover it, but I had some few hiccups (mainly cuz I still use a dam 2017 MacBook T^T) and I didn't have much time to read over the pywallet docs and stuff.When I initially found this corrupt wallet.dat file, seeing that whoever originally held this probably had access to these addresses, I didn't know whether or not I should tell someone as that could lead to sticky situations... or I was getting delusionally paranoid lolBut I decided that if I just inform as much people at once (at least attempt to since people already thought I was a scammer instead :\\), then it would become a public problem and it is what it is.... idkI don't know if this information will be of any use or be the slightest bit useful, but I will be handing over this information over to this forum for anyone interested to take a peek and perhaps help solve... this... mystery...? Again, I don't know but maybe.... justtttt maybe, this may (delusionally) be a small step to finding out the Mt Gox hacker(s) or something... lolAnyways, like most people said, I didn't plan on making people pay for this information, it should be free as it may be useful for someone. If that someone happen to find it useful, I'd just kindly ask to optionally give some dono since I'm still tryna make it out of college and don't think that the level of education taught is really worth the money I'm in debt to.      (.__________.)But yeah, that's about it. This is as much as I, myself know. If I were to ever get any progress or if anyone else had any progress with this info, please do reply back to this thread to keep it updated I guess.I hope everyone a great night(for me at least)/day! Godspeed to you all!",

The person/group of people who foolishly decided to leave the file out in the open most likely have the actual access to these addresses.Here's my thought, it's fake wallet file designed to waste someone time or scam someone else. Please read post i quote below,Quote from: achow101 on April 12, 2019, 02:10:03 AMThe wallet file isn't fake per se, nor are the transactions it shows. What's fake about it is that it doesn't contain the private keys it claims it does.Quote from: yangxin325 on April 12, 2019, 12:44:33 AMThe method of identification is to look at the corresponding version of the wallet code, check the data consistency, time, field, type, structure, It looks very complicated.It actually is not that complicated. You don't need to check any data consistency, time, etc. You don't need to check any of the things you mentioned. You also don't really need to look at the wallet code because the data that they are manipulating doesn't change frequently, if ever. In fact, the specific database fields that are being modified will likely never change in order to maintain backwards compatibility with older wallet versions.What the authors have done here is simply add fields which represent encrypted keys. These fields contain the pubkey and the encrypted private key which will typically just look like random data (because that's the point of encryption). What the authors have done is just create a field that contains the pubkey and random data (or in this case, a string) as the private key.It is impossible for anyone (technical or not, professional or not) to identify that the wallet is \"fake\" by simply looking at it (besides the fact that common sense tells you its a scam). If done correctly, the supposed encrypted key will be garbage data and its veracity cannot be determined without knowing the decryption key. Of course, if it's just zeroes or some other obvious non-random data, then it can be easily determined. You can inspect the data of a wallet.dat file using BDB 4.6's db_dump tool.While he's talking about fake Bitcoin Core wallet file, the principle should be similar for fake Electrum wallet file.",

Sometimes the file is free but they rely on convincing you to pay a service they run to \"recover\" those coins I've seen those threads lolLike I've stated in my previous reply, I found it in a website's directory that should not be accessible regularly for normal site-goers and obviously, I have opened it up on notepad to check the encoding to see if there is any sussy malware code written. It didn't so the file checked out clean.I've seen the threads about the wallet.dat files with passwords encrypted, but this wallet had no encryption to protect the wallet. The other thing is, I don't know what the difference is from a wallet.dat from bitcoin core and from electrum as I've never used bitcoin core before (my old ass MacBook takes forever and makes it go slower, trying to sync nodes so I gave up on that). I don't know if there is even a difference between the files from the two services.I know most have already deemed such thread like mine as \"a waste of time\" as it seems to entail the same old \"oh, a wallet.dat file from the internet, maybe it's a risk I should take and others should try toooo!\" but I just wanted to inform the general public about my findings.The file isn't something I hold personally and try to distribute, but is already online so to scam people to 'buy' the file is the craziest, most stupidest shet I've heard... albeit, scammers have tried and succeeded in fooling couple gullible people lolBut yeah, I do understand the mindset you guys have when it comes to such topic but out of all honesty, the pessimistic comments (not yours specifically, but the ones that come out of nowhere and immediately label someone a 'scammer' for mentioning such topic) could just overall not be commented if that's how you feel, cuz why waste time commenting about wasting your time if it truly is a waste of your time, right?Idk, that's how I see it, like if that's the type of comment one wish to make, at least make it modest and nice enough to tell the OP that such topic may just not be viewed in a positive light and suggest nicely to either give solid proof or just lock up the thread... If that's not nice, then Idk what is lol",

And they were password encrypted so they don't have immediate access to these wallets...? idk, but you seem like you just read my original post, then scrolled all the way down, and commented off my latest reply without reading every other reply I made containing other information.I 'found' the file but like I said, it's corrupted (and still being a person less than 20 yrs old, I don't exactly have the technological knowledge most others here have to be able to do something about this corrupted file). That's why I decided to just let y'all know that I found this, and that you can also check it out by yourself from the exact website I found it and it's not some pay-to-get file. Go check my other reply, it holds the url to the website's directory I found it in.Quote from: stompix on May 17, 2024, 03:45:16 PMLE:My god, 18 morons have paid for this:https://satoshidisk.com/pay/CEu1tXThey're just gullible people who just want to take their chances on a quick fortune which most likely isn't lolAlsoQuote from: stompix on May 17, 2024, 03:45:16 PMCommon just stop it!!!!What tf is a common and stop what :\\                <-- ohhhh, common as in commoner? man, that makes two of us! lmao!      (if commoner is not what you meant, ignore this LMFAO)I'm just informing, nothing else. I am not asking people here to buy it or something, I clearly informed how and where I uncovered such file and that it's up to the rest of y'all to do whatever with this information... What am I doing wrong?I've also stated that if you believe this thread was a waste of your time, don't waste more time to state it was a waste of your time. It's as simple as that. Please be more respectful when expressing such pessimism. If you are to have more knowledge than another, you don't belittle them for their limited knowledge. After all, everyone starts somewhere... And clearly nobody starts off knowing as much as the older people does. So be more understanding if someone doesn't already take into account what you already know... cuz we ain't mind-readers lol",

You are just a decade too late.  ... are basically everyone on this forum very narrow-minded or do y'all just have some type of really really bad trust issues? It really does fascinate me ngl. Maybe it's cuz I'm still young, but wow... the level of distrust and quick to say something is a scam or misinformation is crazy and beyond words lolYoung? More like naive. Spend enough time in this game, and you will see every scam under the sun recycled a thousand times. Sounds like the younger generations are too busy reinventing the wheel to learn from past mistakes.  Try to spend at least ten minutes searching this forum or other sources and learn more about \"fake wallet.dat scams\". Or dont.

So are you for real?Either you think we are all stupid enough to fall into this or you are so new to the scene that you don't even realize you are using really old tactic.There are like hundreds of different kind of scams out there in out to drain our wallets and not trusting anyone blindly is pretty much 101 of how to keep your crypto. So, you really think that dissing us with trust issues and being crazy would be a solid tactic. I seriously hate scammers who pray for newbs.",

So you're telling me that if I was also a legendary or a rank around there and informed the same thing, I would be worth listening to?Quote from: o48o on May 17, 2024, 08:28:11 PMEither you think we are all stupid enough to fall into this or you are so new to the scene that you don't even realize you are using really old tactic.Again... I ask... FALL FOR WHAT?? I've shared the link of the website's directory I found it in so everyone else has the same access to the dam file and decide to do something with it or not. I haven't asked for money for the file, I haven't said to pay to reveal more info, I clearly stated everything in every single response and yet you're ignorant enough to say the same dam shet as the previous replies? READ MY REPLIES TO THE PREVIOUS PEOPLE!!I gave all the info I know about what I found. How in the fucking world am I scamming people if I gave up every ounce of information I uncovered?And you people say I am the ignorant one to be using 'tactic as old as time'?? Where?!? I want you to carefully read every single one of my responses AND THEN reply. Because clearly, you are the ignorant ones for repeating the same things over and over again when I already gave my answer and response to that same accusation. READ! PLEASE!I understand that there are people who try to scam and shit out there but at least take the time to read so that the responses are circulating the same thing over and over.I don't like scammers myself, heck I believe scammers hate that they are who they are! The point is, you don't have to let your guard down to read my responses. You can have your pessimistic beliefs BUT still read everything AND THEN write a reply. It's that simple.With that, I gotta go out for Friday night church so I won't be able to respond back for a while. Have a great day/night/evening!",

It's at minimum still a waste of time, yours and ours.Let me put what you're saying into perspective:Experienced users = someone like master oogway (assuming you and everyone else knows Kung-Fu Panda)Do you see master oogway yelling at inexperienced people about how endlessly stupid they are and that they are wasting time? Do you see master oogway ridiculing them about how they don't know 'the way' and to just stop asking stupid questions and just listen to the rants of the experienced who don't share their knowledge in a nice manner as they should? Cuz clearly I haven't. If you see yourself as a more experienced user than others, then shouldn't you be more slow to anger? More slow to pointing fingers and saying people waste your time on pointless topics?Quote from: Cricktor on May 18, 2024, 10:05:51 AMIt's funny how you're fighting for it, though.At this point I'm not fighting for the relevancy of my topic; It's to show how irritating it is for the so called 'newbs' to get any actual help or knowledge the 'experienced' users claim to have.I understand that newbs (including me) can bring in topics that may have been mentioned long ago or have no apparent relation to bitcoin, but I believe if you are part of the 'experienced' people here, you need not to get all hotheaded about it. I believe this is the only way for the bitcoin community to grow and also for this forum to thrive instead of having non-bitcoin people (aka the rest of society) call everyone here inc*l neckbeards or redditor 2.0's <--- (yes, I've actually heard someone use this term while I mentioned about this forum... Idk if anyone else will take offense but... yeah...).This is how I see it; It's up to you to decide how you'll take this information.Have a wonderful day y'all!",
