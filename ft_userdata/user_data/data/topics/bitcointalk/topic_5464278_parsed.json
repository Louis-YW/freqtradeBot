So you have to take your girlfriend or boyfriend to your parents for them to know your fiancee and sometimes stay with them for a few days. After this meeting, they might approve or disapprove the marriage. A young man brought his girlfriend to his parents and they disapproved of the marriage because they observed that she always failed to greet elderly family members and neighbors while she stayed with them. In some cultures greeting or exchanging pleasantries with family members and neighbors is very important. Children are raised to say good morning, afternoon, and good evening to mainly their elders. Greeting your elders is a sign of a good home upbringing and people that exchange pleasantries are loved in society. In some cases, mostly in rural areas, an elder asked why you refused to greet him. This might sound strange in some areas but this is an important part of people's lifestyle.In my culture greeting is important, it is a sign of respect and humility. What about in your culture?",

For example, here parents do not need to evaluate their children's partners or stay with them, here we are more flexible on it. When comes to greeting, I recall I was taught in school and by my parents that greeting and giving the \"good morning\" was important and was supposed to be a signal of respect towards others, since it looks bad when you greet someone and you do not get greeted back. My parents typically mention and point out how some neighbors do not take the time to greet them in the morning, even if they greeted them first. So yes, it is important here, but there are some who may not pay attention to it or get out their way to greet everyone they encounter.",

Greeting is very important in every society but the difference is the way it is done. Like in the European culture, they acknowledge greeting but not the way it is done in Africa, they could greet hello or how are you to their parents but you don't dare that kind of greeting in Africa. Moreover, the European don't pay heed to bringing intending spouse for approval from the parents but this is done in Africa as you pointed out. However this same practice is beginning to reduce in Africa because of urbanization, modernity and distance.",

It's true that it's a gesture of respect and a sign that you're comfortable with them or even not, you're trying to get along with them. But the generation is changing and there could be some couples that treats this as nothing like there are no more greetings but that doesn't mean you're disrespectful to them, but because you're comfortable already with them so you don't greet them anymore.",

I didn't know Ethiopians are so nice.I've always found it fascinating how the Japanese greet. I was once traveling by train and and a Japanese woman sat in my compartment. After a while she stood up and started bowing, so I stood up and asked if she needs help with her luggage, thinking that she wanted to leave, but she was just going to the toilet. Every time she wanted to leave the compartment she'd bow to each of us and we didn't know if she'd be back from that journey or not. In my country it's customary to greet people who you know and the one's you're about to interact with. We usually don't greet strangers, unless we want to ask them something.",

Nigeria has many states and different cultures. I am from the south. But when I traveled to the western part of Nigeria, I understood that they value greeting very well and when they greet, rlthe prostate until the Elder reciprocated by accepting the greeting before they will stand up. When I was in the West, I started greeting as often as they do, but I do not bow. After some years I came back to the Southern part of Nigeria Where I belong. I started greeting everyone, but they could not respond and they saw it as an unnecessary act. I was sometimes an embarrassment to me. But within few months, I understood that I have travelled to another part of life. I stopped greeting unnecessarily So, some cultures attach much importance to greeting while others do not.",

Because doing this action, it is included in an etiquette or courtesy in the area where I live. Because if for example there is someone in my area, passing through someone else's (neighbor's) yard and the owner of the house is in front of his house, then that person will be considered polite if he greets or says excuse me to the owner of the house. But on the other hand, if someone does not greet or greet the owner of the house they pass, then surely that person will be labeled as having no manners.So that's what the culture is like in the area where I live. Maybe in the majority of places or areas in the country where I live, they also have the same culture as in my area. So the point is to give greetings where I live, it has become a culture that must be done. And in my opinion, even in other countries, the majority of cultures say greetings or greetings, it seems that it is always there and is applied to aspects of life. Because in my opinion, it has become a habit, manners/ethics and culture throughout the world. But the difference may only lie in the movement, tone of voice, or spoken vocabulary.",

In my culture you will be regarded as a disobedient child if you fail to greet your your father or mother everyday when you wake up in the morning likewise whenever you see them especially if you're coming from outside. my culture sees someone who is fond of greeting people as obedient, respectful  humble,loyal as well as righteous but once you have been tagged as someone who doesn't have respect for elders just know that it is because you don't greet them the way they want to.My personal experience growing up as a child I was always reminded by my parents to be greeting any one I encounter on my way I never knew why till I became an adult I then realised that my culture values greetings more than food hahaha but I think this cultural practices is mostly found in the rural areas because if you stay in the city you won't be mandated to greet everyone because they may not practice the same culture like you.",

In certain cultures, the dominant religion itself becomes the core of their culture and holds more influence than the legal system. Across many cultures and even in the context of marriage, parental approval is necessary for matrimony. Hence, it's crucial to have a deep comprehension of your partner's cultural background before encountering their parents.",

I married my wife without meeting her parents or she mine. I didn't see any reason for it. Familiy ties are different in where i live, people don't need to be biological relatives to be my family, they are just loyal friends/companions for each other.I personally don't value marriage as institution very high either. It's more who you decide to keep loving, and working on that relationship that counts. Sure, there are some legal benefits on getting married but i don't see that state approved monogamistic marriage should be a reason to have those benefits.",
