And perhaps we will see more volume in non full-controlled-CEX. In any case, I don't see why we shouldn't be extra cautious and withdraw.",

The truth is, one's funds will never be safe in a centralized exchange. A lot can happen in 24 hours in Crypto world. People should not move funds out only when they see the rumors about a certain exchange. They should move funds out as a practice of safety, even when they still trust an exchange. \"Prevention is better than cure\"",

      "body": "I'd say get your money off centralized exchanges. That's regardless of whether there are rumors about them or not. Get them off exchanges regardless of whether they are insolvent or not, whether they have insurance or not, and so on. So get them off Crypto.com. Get them off Binance. Get them off Coinbase and others. But this doesn't stop there. Get your money off any centralized platforms, not only exchanges. Get them off investment sites, lending platforms, swap platforms, and so on. I hope this huge wave of suspicion on centralized exchanges started by the fall of FTX would put the spotlight on self-custody.",

So it's better to use decentralized exchanges for trading and decentralized wallets to store crypto assets.",

He is just trying to FUD more the market as many crypto influencer is doing to boost there short position. He says that he has enough evidence yet he put a disclaimer that the said post is just an opinion. He is contradicting  his own post which means he is not sure on what he is saying on his tweets.But removing all tokens on Crypto.com and other CEX is the best thing to do as safety precautions on what might coming on CEX.",

The FTX case has opened a lot of people's awareness including the blue twitter badges that centralized services in general can carry out similar dirty practices. As such, these services will no longer have the opportunity to control crowds' assets as influencers spread negative rumors from some of the top exchanges.",
