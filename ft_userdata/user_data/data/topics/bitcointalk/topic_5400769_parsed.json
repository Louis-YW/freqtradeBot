I can't comment on that, since I'd never even heard of it until today. However, I guess the main priority would be establishing whether the seed is legitimate, and not just made up to appear like it is legitimate. They may have used their own seed generation, which is only valid for their wallet. Obviously, don't just spurt out your seed, but look at the seed word list, maybe copy the raw text of it, and compare it with your seed offline to be safe. Seems to be a fairly popular app on the app store, but that doesn't mean much.",

It is good to use a reputed wallet like Electrum. You can check this thread to know more about this:To be careful of the noncustododial wallet we are using these daysI will advice you to use the wallet that has the standard derivation path which are m/44'/0'/0'/0/0, m/49'/0'/0'/0/0, m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 and m/86'/0'/0'/0/0.

When I say scam, then I am referring to the fact that many users complain that they cannot send their funds from the wallet, and that is one big red flag.Some of the reviews :QuoteOctober 27, 2021FUNDS STOLEN!!! I funded my wallet last night and someone managed to send them all out this morning! I didn't share pin, phone, or phrase codes with anyone! My data network was via mobile provider. I didn't access the app or download it from Wifi. Please be aware and DONT USE THIS APP! Customer service still has not emailed me back.QuoteMarch 9, 2022I received money into my wallet but I can not send it. The send page is blank and I want answers as to why it won't let me send it. I don't trust the app anymore. It must be a Russian app stealing people's money. No support to speak of and they offer no security of any kind so my funds are never secure at any point.QuoteMarch 29, 2022Like a few users who set 1-star review for the app I discovered one day that I can't send money from my wallet. You click send and you get Transaction Successful. But your balance isn't changed, there is no new transactions in activity list, and no money on another wallet. There is a way yet to get your coins back.QuoteJanuary 5, 2021This Bitshield Wallet appears to be intentionally trapping people's money inside the wallet. It will allow you to receive bitcoins without any problem. But when it's time to send bitcoin away from the wallet, it just crashes. I've cleaned my phone, did a hard reset, removed the batterie, and even uninstalled and re-install the app to no avail. It's clear they did some unwelcoming change to the backend responsible for the transactions. This matter needs to be urgently looked intoSource",

Also, it is found to have stolen the content from Samourai Wallet website, which is a very big red flag:QuoteOn their website:    We are privacy activists who have dedicated our lives to creating the software that Silicon Valley will never build. We build the software that Bitcoin deserves.which was taken almost word for word from Samourai Wallet‘s website.… which leads us to wonder if the provider is also secretive about who they are and sure enough, no mention of the people behind this product.How can it scam people if it is non-custodial? Given that this wallet is closed-source, we can't know what is happening behind the scenes. The wallet may well be maliciously \"non-custodial,\" where it gives you a fake seed phrase and completely unrelated bitcoin addresses from which only wallet devs can spend. They claim that they use a unique derivation path for their wallet, but it also may be just a different seed. When you restore your Bitshield wallet using a fake seed you were given, the wallet secretly replaces this seed with the real one and generates the same addresses. No other wallet can reconstruct the same addresses because they don't contain this \"replacement mechanism.\" These are just my assumptions, I could be totally wrong.",
