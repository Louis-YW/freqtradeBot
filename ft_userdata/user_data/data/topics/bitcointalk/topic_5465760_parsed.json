Now, the company says that in the days following the announcement investors tendered an additional $211 million worth of the bonds for a total of $261 million.What do you think of this? Is this going to directly impact anything in Crypto or just they are trying to save their arse at this moment?",

If you have the money on hand to buy back bonds and stop paying interest on them it's better then doing a stock buyback that just boots stock price.Without doing a dig into how much cash they have on hand / other debts and the rates they are paying on those it's a tough call.Yes you can get way more money by leaving that cash in the bank and earning interest on it. BUT, it also may make getting money in the future from other bonds easier since overall the company has less debt.-Dave",

I am not an expert on this but anyone deeply comprehensive understand about this, could you share your thinking?Impact of an inverted yield curve",

Is this going to directly impact anything in Crypto or just they are trying to save their arse at this moment?Nothing to think of this really! It's a very normal process of any cash rich corporates. When they need money, they float bonds and when they have money, they buy those bonds back to save on interest. Because it makes no sense for a corporate to kept the bonds unpaid because they have to pay back interest on it. I don't think crypto market is going to be impacted in any way due to this bond buy back. Rather it's a positive thing that a cryptocurrency related company has done good business to pay off their debt.",
