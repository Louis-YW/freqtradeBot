Q: If I have multiple codes with different expiring date ?A: AWS will first use the code expiring first.Q: How do I redeem the credit?A: Go to aws.amazon.com/awscredits/ and follow the procedure.#1 What is the Stack number for an AWS code? Is one code one-time only? Or can it be applied multiple times?For a given Credit Name/Event ID, a limited number of codes can be applied to one AWS account. The limited number is the stack number. There are many possibilities for the stack number, such as 1x,2x,4x,5x. So please check this stack number carefully before purchase. Also, please note that the code is one-time only. You need different codes to reach the stack limitation. And the stack limitation is a life limitation. If the stack limitation is reached, you cannot use that Credit Name/Event ID codes in the future months too.#2 How many codes can I apply to one AWS account? What is Credit Name/Event ID?Credit Name is the same as the Event ID. They are just different names. Credit Name is the key to code purchase. For one AWS account, it can apply codes:- Credit Name1 x stack for Credit Name1 + Credit Name2 x stack for Credit Name2 + Credit Name3 x stack for Credit Name +…, if you can find endless Credit Name codes, you can redeem credit endlessly too.#3 How to check the AWS Credit name of the AWS account?On AWS console, click the upper right username, “My Account,” “Credits”. Here you can find the current codes credit name list. However, please note that The AWS “Credits” part refresh every month. And the credit name stack is for a lifetime. So please keep a full credit name list every time you applied a new code. You need to keep your own code credit name record to avoid the credit name stack issue.#4 What is the difference between EDU codes and Non-EDU codes?Generally, they are the same. Since Non-EDU codes are rare and hard to be gotten, Non-EDU codes are expensive. If you do not need it urgently, you can wait for the EDU codes since they are cheaper.#5 What is the difference between EDU codes and Non-EDU codes, besides the price difference?Besides the price difference, Non-EDU codes support more AWS services. EDU codes support 112 kinds of AWS services. Non-EDU codes support 147 kinds of AWS services. So if you need some special AWS services, Non-edu codes should be better#6 Could EDU codes and Non-EDU codes use together?Yes, EDU codes and Non-EDU codes can use together.#7 I need lots of AWS credit codes. So I want to know your Selly store updates. Is there any store notification service available?If you are interested in my Selly store AWS credit code updates, I will update new AWS credit name information and other important stock change news of our Selly store.#8 About the latest AWS credit code price changeThere is a severe AWS EDU credit code supply issue. So the EDU codes are very rare now. The supply cost increases a lot, so the price increases accordingly. Please note the supply issue is not temporary. In the future, the AWS EDU codes supply will be very limited. Thanks.",
