I never use watchlist as a parameter to determine whether that was a legit token or not.

I just tell you about safemoon. This shit scam token has millions of watchlist on CMC but the price already destroyed. It's worth nothing right now. That proves that watch list was not a reliable parameter anymore.

Not only watchlist, i think so many things are fake or it’s happened by bots as like a lot of shit exchanges trading volume is unrealistic in the coinmarketcap i think. And i see showing coin price isn’t real sometimes when i will compare with coingecko.",

If someone wethers it is legit or not wants to spread hype about their a brand new project, there will be a service for that. Not to mention that, most token are built based on meme, hype, influencer, etc. There will be shady things that people will use to gain benefit for their own.",

Coinmarketcap is under the invasion of bots. It's really hard to measure the pulse of communities. Neither parameter is reliable. That's why we have to be more careful than ever before. :(",

I also think that there are people that are offering to boost your project with a lot of fake votes from fake accounts.",

The shit scam token were using this way to increase its watchlist. I do believe they were doing it manually rather than using the bots. There are some services that offered it to manipulate the watchlist on CMC and coingecko as well. I rarely see this kind of service being done by the bots. It's done by human. That's why watchlist was a bad thing to be used as a way to know whether that was a legit or bad token.",

It's not always related with the bots. I see some projects were spending few amounts of money to be airdropped as long as the participants were completing the mandatory to add the tokens into their watchlist. This is a very easy task and CMC has bunch of members. That's quite easy to drive people to click on the watchlist. I see that some meme tokens developers are also doing this thing.

It doesn't have to be a meme token, also there are some investors that go to coinmarketcap to hunt for new tokens and to get attracted to new investors the token must be on the Trending coins and tokens on CMC, the only way that this can happen is using many votes, the voters must be the token investors and supporters, I have seen this happen before.",
