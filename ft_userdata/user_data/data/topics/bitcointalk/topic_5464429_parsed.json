  "content": "This happened to last month or thereabout and and yesterday again it repeat itself. I place an order to sell coins and in Binance, we are warned that we should received the money before releasing the coins to the buyer and if you release your coins, and the transaction failed, or the vendor did not send you the money, Binance will not reliable for your negligence and you are on your own. So after when I had planned the order, I waited for like 40 minutes for him to send the money so I could released the coins. And finally the guy said he has send the money but me I have not received the money. But the release link has shown yellow.And I refused to release the coins since I have not seen the money in the bank account, and the guy was disturbing to release the coins but I refused. And later the guy asked me to send him another account number and I did, and he send the money to the second account number and I received the funds and I also released the coins.All what I am saying here is, mostly to those who are not aware of this please be careful when dealing with vendors in Binance and any other exchange. Don't release your coins when you have not received your money. If the matter is serious tell the person to send you a screenshot of the payment slip. And make such you check the date, time and, minutes to know the exact time the transaction took place. And if all the information are correct then you can release the coins, because there are some times that the delay is from your side. But be careful. And how many of you have experienced that before?",

On that faithful day, after placing the order, I slept off and the lady called me to release the coins because I dropped my contact on the chat box, and reported me so Binance made a request from her site and she sent them the screenshot, so they released the coins for her and dropped a very big bogus written note for me to read.

Before the coin can be released for the women, that means Binance has seen evidence that the women paid the money. I do not think screenshot can easily give that without doubt, but if the woman downloaded her statement of account and send it fast, that is still better of a valid evidence than a screenshot that can be easily manipulated.I remember a day that I used BinanceP2P. The buyer messaged me that he as sent the money but I did not see it. He sent the screenshot of the payment from GTBank which looks suspicious to me as â‚¦10 was also deducted. I may be wrong but the payment was suspicious to me. I told the buyer to contact his bank customer care. He sent me message that he contacted the bank customer care and said it was a technical issue that they are working on it. After a day or two days or so, he messaged me that he has seen the money in his bank. I told him to send the money so that I can release the coin, he did not but cancelled the transaction.",

Well, anybody that will fall victim in this kind of scammers in binance P2P vendor is not the fault of binance P2P because it is your duty to confirm the money first in your account because releasing that coins.",

It is easy for a buyer to scam than a seller. This is definitely a good warning to all, do not take screenshots as evidence because they could easily be manipulated, in fact if not now there was a thing called schedule on palmpay then that you will get a receipt for sending fake alert and if the person believes it then there funds is gone. Base on experience early this year, some binance vendor tried same thing with me, I wanted to sell some bitcoin and he sent me a fake receipt that he sent it from GTbank, luckily for me I used Opay then because of bank troubles during cash crises then. When I checked my account balance nothing was there and the transaction history didnâ€™t show any pending transactions because if it was actually sent Opay will have a pending transaction there. When I returned to tell the vendor about it he told me it was my bank that I should release it and the money will arrive later I declined and he threatened to report to the support but before he could do that I reported first and then the support asked him for the receipt and ask me to chat with my bank support too after the live chat with Opay they blatantly told me that the transaction ID on that receipt doesnâ€™t exist on there database so I got back to the support only for him to lie that the money has been reversed back to his account. He then cancel the transaction instead of even continuing which clearly shows he didnâ€™t he no money to pay then but wanted to pull that trick from first place, had I been naive to realize the coins then I would have been scammed.",

I have experienced that on remitano a couple of times before where I lost my 2FA security and couldn't verify payment on the account,Â  so what I do when I want to use that account to exchange my Bitcoin,Â  is to always reach out to support to help confirm the trade once I have seen the money in my bank account. Agbe also be careful when someone asks for an account number outside the one provided on the exchange,Â  this can aid the buyer to pay you through a third-party account without your knowledge and that can lead to troubles since most hackers could make such third-party payment through the victim accounts and if investigated all accounts that transactions flow into may be implicated. That is why, Binance or other cryptocurrency exchanges always warn against third-party parties,Â  aside from the one stated on the exchange account.",
