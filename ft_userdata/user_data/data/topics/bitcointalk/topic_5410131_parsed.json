  "content": "Where small investors are getting frustrated with the bitcoin price dump and panic selling their bitcoins. And on the other hand, big investors are using this dump as an opportunity to accumulate bitcoins as much as they can. The owner of this address can be an individual or a company. Bitcoin Address: 1LQoWist8KkaUXSPKZHNvEyfrEkPHzSsCd This investor became the top holder of bitcoins after entering the market, and the owner of this address may be buying more bitcoins. So it is easy to imagine that if retail investors invest by following these smart uinvestors, they can get positive results. These investors come into the market with a long term plan, this investor may have waited long in advance to grab this opportunity. As a result, he got enough of his expected price to buy bitcoins. So all these activities indicate how much demand for Bitcoin is growing among billionaire investors.Source:New Whale Becomes Top Bitcoin Holder With $3 Billion Acquisition, BTC Surges To New High Bitcoin Whale: New Player Buys Three Billion Dollars’ Worth of BTC Source: BitInfoCharts",

But once you have data from multiple sources and multiple users and you can start making differences between transfers to cold wallets to other exchanges (that also happen all the time) people can start pinpointing those wallets more accurately.Tracking is the best way, those coins have to go somewhere and it's not like an exchange will use a tumbler to hide the traces.Quote from: ScamViruS on August 16, 2022, 07:31:08 PMFor what purpose the journalist has published this news, he probably knows well, otherwise how could they not identify the coinbase address.

Someone buys $3 billion worth of Bitcoin, and the event gets some media attention. So aside from the purchase itself, there's also a bit of FOMO going on. The price goes up by less than 10% over a course of several days, and then drops back to the pre-purchase level in a couple of days more. That's what $3 billion does to the market.
