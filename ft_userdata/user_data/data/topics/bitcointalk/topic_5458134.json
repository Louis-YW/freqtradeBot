This is a wonderful piece and I applaud you for such a creative poem about Bitcoin O.P, because this writeup clearly shows you truly understand what Bitcoin stands for and is all about. But nevertheless, I will like to make some corrections to your poem calling Satoshi the messiah to the internet which is not true, because while Bitcoin was developed/launch in 2009, the internet was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in the year 1989 (i.e 34yrs ago)Quote from: Mia Chloe on June 30, 2023, 05:45:53 PMThanks mateSecondly, writing two words as a response to a comment is not necessary, as it's not compulsory you must appreciate everyone who comments on your forum contribution.
