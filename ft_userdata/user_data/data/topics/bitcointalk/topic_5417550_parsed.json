I found this interesting article that discusses the EU's desire to develop a cryptocurrency energy-efficiency grading system in order to encourage more environmentally friendly crypto systems.“Just as their use has grown significantly, the energy consumption of cryptocurrencies has more. In harnessing the use of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain technologies in energy markets and trading, care must be taken to use only the most energy-efficient versions of the technology.”Do you think this would help mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies?Original source:https://tokenist.com/eu-to-grade-cryptocurrencies-based-on-energy-consumption-report/",

At the beginning of this technology, it's really for decentralization and the governments like in EU are trying to get back the power that has been taken by this technology. It seems encouraging to see that they're stepping on it but for someone that sees and look at what they really are up for, this doesn't look good as we understand the importance of securing the network through PoW and it being decentralized.",

And yes as you have said, this is as close to CBCD. And I doubt that bitcoin will bend just to give in to the pressures. Government can do whatever they want, mostly to altcoins, ETH is a good case and maybe more will to follow. And I don't think there will be a consensus in between. We might see the brunt of the argument though for years to come but I don't see bitcoin will move to PoS as it will defeat it's purpose.",

That's just what's what's to be the effect of such initiative and grading system. Its not rocket science to understand that, comes advancement with more and more minings going on, the more energy consumption is required. As it is, we've got coins that are far ahead and the coins would be down graded or sized in other to promote some other coin, hence adoption and there you have some pump/dump manipulation in our cryptospace.Theee isn't any need for marketing manipulation as that's what this could bring. It doesn't help if you asked, just another way to make money for the whales.",

BTC decentralization is actually pulling a torn on the government centralized system of economy and they are trying to use every means possible to gain access., It's obvious one of the beauty of bitcoin is in its PoW and  that's why the government's through the EU is mounting pressure in support for PoS based coins just in attempt to limit the utility of BTC but it's just a failed attempt in futility from the start.",
