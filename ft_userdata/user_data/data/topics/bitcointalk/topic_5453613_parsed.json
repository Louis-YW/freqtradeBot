OP I can not give you price range but you should know that your market price survey should be much affordable for your prospective clients on each category which can be feasible for them to patronise you and even make referral for your services as a well. Escrow would build more confidence in dealing with you here because that is what members here do look into before having a deal of such nature with anyone here as they are very cautious and would want the safety of their assets be paramount. Nobody would want to take such risk when it happens that your account is just a newbie account and has no reputationLastly, your previous jobs could serve as selling point for you based on the fact that you have had the experience and expertise on the past as a result of engagement with firms and other organisations and if possible you could get a vouch here from them if they are present mere.",

Your advice is helpful as I improve my services and portfolio here.That would be nice of you mate.  Using an escrow gives prospective clients the confidence to deal with you if the need be because they have no knowledge who you are and you have no much activities here which makes it very difficult to trust to you with funds.  I just hope the escrow as said by you are reputable members registered here on BTT platform because anything outside of that would scare members away without any delay.Lastly, presenting your portfolios would aid immensely to help you secure deals here if you want to go far and as well as attracting more bigger clients your way.",
