At the current exchange rate, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this coin sell for as much as $400,000. That’s around where I’d become an interested seller if I was looking to sell this coin.",

Congrats to the new owner, tho.Regards,Chris   Welcome to the long list of people wanting this...the only time I ever saw one for sale was a beaten up one Ebay.   Never saw one offered anywhere else. A peeled 10 Cas silver is desirable but the silver gilt is the one that I would want for sure.   It would go very nicely next to the 1 BTC silver gilt",
