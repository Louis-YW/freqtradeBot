The biggest problem with fiat currency is that it is controlled and we as users do not have the freedom to control it. This system is called a legal transaction tool because we use money to buy. Many people are aware of the problems posed by fiat currencies but have no other option. The presence of bitcoin also does not provide a complete alternative because some countries only allow bitcoin as an investment asset, but it has many advantages so people are competing to invest.  Quote from: Briankimp1 on April 08, 2024, 12:32:46 PMWe all send money from one end to another with the traditional bank as intermediaries between these transactions they charge both sides collect data from the informations given to them these individuals which they can sell to their rich friends in the dark not until the creation of Bitcoin  It's the same as when we send bitcoin and a fee is also required, but the difference is that personal information will be much more secure if people don't do KYC.

In your opinion, this could happen. So how and in what way will it happen? Also, if I remember correctly, Satoshi did not mention this in the bitcoin's whitepaper nor did he intend to create bitcoin to replace the current currency or banking system. It seems like you are overvaluing and exaggerating bitcoin if you think it can wipe out the commercial banking sector. By the way, I think because of these unnecessary exaggerated thoughts, the government had a negative view of bitcoin in the early days, they thought that because it was created to wipe out fiat, wipe out the banking system they created it, so they banned bitcoin.",

No and the answer is no always.The same question has been asked many times in this forum. Banking system and bitcoin might seem to be opposite of one another but we cannot survive without the banks because the economy is intimately connected to it and remote from bitcoin. Unless something huge happens bitcoin is not going to become the \"cash\" of the economy but fiat will.Maybe in the next 100years, drastic shift will happen, but we can only speculate on that.The more likely scenario is that bitcoin and banks working hand in hand to maintain a much evolved economy.",

I think that till the end of time, banking system and bitcoin can never walk on the same path, the banking system is free to make money off bitcoin in their own way but Bitcoin is not created to replace any centralized gap.Not the banking system, not the centralized money or fiat, unless there comes a way where centralized entities are neutralised, which is not possible.The government can only be either friendly with what they can control or what they can make money from, problem is they can't find their way with Bitcoit's its why I called it the first innovation that works as intended without the approval of the centralized authorities.",

My suggestion for you buddy, you  must try to find out more about bitcoin or the creator of bitcoin so that they don't mention the wrong name like you are doing right now so that in the end it doesn't spread too far in terms of mistakes .",

Bitcoin was allowed to exist only because it was largely ignored by those in power until it was too late. They could easily destroy it by 2014 and China actually tried and failed. Now it's almost impossible. That said, not allowing them to destroy bitcoin and forcing them to give up some power and privileges are two very different things.",

From a calculation of advantages and disadvantages, the Bitcoin system is better than the commercial banking system. If it is 1 BTC it will still be 1 BTC for the next year and that is not the case with centralized currencies with commercial banking systems.On this side, people prefer the Bitcoin system which cannot be regulated like a centralized currency. A centralized currency will decrease in value over time. On the basis of the freedom we gain with Bitcoin, it is a concern for these parties, but we cannot be sure that the Bitcoin system will not be able to leave the commercial banking system when the time comes because what we think is impossible can become possible.",
