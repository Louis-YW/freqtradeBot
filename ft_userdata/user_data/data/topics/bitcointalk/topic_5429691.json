Either way, you’ll probably win.FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has received official criminal charges after the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, which is more than just a moral victory for the exchange’s roughly 1 million individual investors. While not locked in yet, things appear to be on track for these investors to take a more favorable tax position as SBF’s fate continues to unravel.What kinds of losses can FTX investors claim on their taxes?Earlier this fall, it appeared that assets lost in the FTX collapse would be considered a capital loss under the United States tax code for the tax year 2022. This capital loss can be used to offset capital gains. But in a year in which the crypto market took a beating as a whole, most investors will not have capital gains to offset in 2022.A capital loss can also be used to offset “ordinary income,” such as money earned from a business or job — up to $3,000 per year. The loss is carried forward indefinitely, but if your loss in the FTX collapse was substantial, it could take quite a while to claim all of it.Related: Biden is hiring 87,000 new IRS agents — and they’re coming for you.SOURCE",

Yes, once in a while one can copy paste news but doing it regularly makes it look suspicious and not recommended.Also, in addition to giving a source and if you want to emphasize on a text in an article, how to do that? Many people are not aware and hence they just copy and paste the text.The solution to this is to put it in quotes, which will make it 100% legit and no one will have any objection to it.Example:QuoteThis is important news i want to share and it is copied from a source",

In this case, the user provided the source of the news, so it cannot be considered plagiarized because the owner was cited. In other cases, even if you cite the original author, copying his words and pasting them into yours is considered plagiarism. This is mostly applicable to the educational sector. This is a forum where we're all here to learn and be enlightened; we don't need that strict rule that applies to educational institutions here.",

The way users cite the source to their post, some insert the links in a dubious manner, you can tell they want readers to think they are the original authors by the way they hide the source link in the wall of text. Ratimov came up with some good examples of what should or should not be regarded as plagiarism and from the response of other community members it was clear where the line for plagiarism is drawn.  Should the link to the source be visible or should it be present? I also like LoyceV fifth option because it is more obvious that the OP isn’t passing the work as his. QuoteQuote from: Cointelegraph: El Salvador president predicts ‘gigantic price increase’ for BitcoinSalvadoran President Nayib Bukele made yet another bullish Bitcoin (BTC) prediction soon after the International Monetary Fund had urged his government to remove Bitcoin’s status as legal tender.Bukele took to Twitter on Monday to predict that Bitcoin will ultimately see a “gigantic price increase” due to its limited supply of only 21 million digital coins.The president cited Bitcoin’s scarcity case, emphasizing there are “more than 50 million millionaires” in the world, and there is not enough Bitcoin if each one of them wanted to own at least 1 BTC.",
