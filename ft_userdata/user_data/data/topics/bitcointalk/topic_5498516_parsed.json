Have you read the Bitcoin white paper?. The title clearly states: \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". Satoshi pointed out so many things on the published white paper which getting Rich was never part of it. Please don't misquote him.Quoteremember that Satoshi was a math genius, he solved equations thought  to be impossible it the time being.Every programmer especially those who are into C/C++/python,etc needs to flexible with maths. So .Quoteand he did it I mean look at the richest people who made there fortune form Bitcoin and other Crypto currencies, all of them have 130 IQ at the least and all of them sold most of it.Bitcoin isn't real, the money that those people got is.change my mind!Making money is also part of Bitcoin, but does not necessarily mean you must be good in maths like Satoshi and other programmers. Your strategies(plans) and what you have(funds) for investment is clearly what makes you rich.You might have skipped this thread after your registration:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1689727.0",

There were only a few people including the developers and testers who started using Bitcoin initially, and then it started gaining attention because of how it was designed.Those who became rich because of Bitcoin deserved it because they believed in the technology and adopted it when it didn't have any value at all unlike most of us who are into it after seeing how it can provide good profit.",
