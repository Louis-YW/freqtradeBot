  "content": "Hello everyone, Recently it came my way a 5BTC Holo 2012 (MS67) and i was wondering, whats the market price for such coin now a days?I haven't seen any 5btc holo coins offered for sale in the forum so does anyone have any idea? It's a rare piece and i consider my self really lucky to even have one in hand. The coin itself is in great condition.More information about the total number of coins minted: https://casasciustracker.com/status/More: https://i.imgur.com/aXeumjf.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/V7iUzGd.jpgPictures courtesy of MJ.Thanks",

      "body": "They don’t appear often with holo/key. I have only seen a few for sale in the last 3-4 years. Stacks recently had one in the June auction, but I don’t feel like they marketed it well pre-auction and then during poorly by the auctioneer. Some blanks sold for 2x what this one went for, so someone got a great deal. June 2023 Auction - Session 4 - Physical Cryptocurrency - Lots 4001-4168May 09, 2023Lot #: 4110Title: Redeemed 2012 Casascius \"Bitnickel\" 5 Bitcoin. Firstbits 1CtprxPF. Series 1. Nickel Plated Brass. MS-67 (ICG).Description: <b>Exciting Redeemed Casascius 5 Bitcoin Rarity</b><br><br><b>The First Our Firm Has Handled</b><br><br><b>Redeemed 2012 Casascius \"Bitnickel\" 5 Bitcoin. Firstbits 1CtprxPF. Series 1. Nickel Plated Brass. MS-67 (ICG).</b><br><br>Redeemed and non-loaded. An incredibly exciting offering that represents the very first such example our firm has handled. This piece was initially funded with 5 BTC on February 13, 2012 and was redeemed just over a year later on February 23, 2013. At the time it was redeemed, the 5 BTC face value was equivalent to roughly US$150. Today, it would amount to about US$150,000 (May 2023). <br><br>A much more common unfunded example sold for $2,400 in our March 2023 sale, which never had any cryptocurrency associated with it. The present redeemed piece offers an immensely more fascinating narrative and greater rarity. It represents an irresistible jewel for advanced specialists. <br><br>According to researcher Elias Ahonen, the Series 1 Casascius 5 BTC funded coins were released in January 2012 with an issue price of 6 BTC, amounting to around US$33 at the time. Since their debut, nearly 35% of them have been peeled and redeemed.

Some notes here: 1) People can see the coin here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvMRFSKQo5U - minute: 1:54:502) The one sold at the auction is a series 1 where the above is series 2. 3) Total issued series 1    675 & series 2 587.Honestly the series 2 looks way better than series 1 and it's even more rare.",

Sure. But I wouldn't say anything is cheap right now in Bitcoin terms. I would make the bet that most Bitcoin collectibles will devalue in BTC terms this next cycle I am not really sure about that, remain to be seen. Now for everyone awareness @minerjones did give me an estimate price for the current value of the coin, i will let him justify his estimation on this thread so we all get a better understanding and to further discuss.Thanks -bass",

I mean you can search \"Casascius\" in the search bar at the top right of this forum and you will see the premiums from 2013-2017 and then compare them with the premiums of today.Ungraded Brass Casascius coins were selling for 3-5 BTC. Today you'd be lucky to get 1.3 BTC.Dollars premiums going up, BTCitcoin premiums are trending down.The trend is your friend.",
