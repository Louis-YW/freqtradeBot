  "content": "To join this years World Cup predictor pool please send BTC0.002 to the following address: bc1q075y54lgy772hlq0608evmhkga0ggkkwpax6cxhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q075y54lgy772hlq0608evmhkga0ggkkwpax6cxOr scan the QR code:Once you've paid just PM with the TX link and I will send you an invite to join the pool.Sportsbet will again be sponsoring the pool and have graciously donated 0.2 for the pot so many thanks to both them and jeremypwr for that. The jackpot first prize will be 0.1 and the rest of the money will be split between the runners up. How many places we pay will depend on how many join, but it's usually between the top 5 or 10. There will also be a 2mbtc freebet for the weekly round winners along with exclusive members only promos. We will again be using the Superbru website which is free and easy to use. If you're unsure how the pool works please see the current Premier League thread here, but basically you input your score predictions for every game and you get 3 points for predicting the exact score, 1 for the correct outcome (win, lose or draw) and 1.5 for a close prediction. The winner will obviously be the person who gets the most points at the end of the tournament. FIFA also have their own predictor here which we may also use and then combine the points together. FIFA's predictor is different in that you predict the order you think the teams will finish in and how they progress through the tournament.The World Cup starts on the 20th of November which is only 18 days away so please sign up as soon as possible. Thanks!",
