  "content": "Nigeria is in a very big problem.  What is problem,  \" problem in this context can be seen as a state of no solution\". It is very clear that nobody has the solution to this country except God almighty for now. Though every problem have it solution but  the problem of this country Nigeria is so big.  Even most of our politicians knows  how big the problem is, instead of them to be offsetting it small small they rather go and add more problem to the country because of self centeredness.  Most of our politicians knows that someday they will not be here and their children won't be here either that is why they are doing things  regardless of anything,  they don't care about the welfare of the country but rather they add problems and also benefit from those problems. Below are the characteristics  of someone  I think/feel can help this country. 1. A tolerant person => someone who will not listen to what people will say until he is done achieving what he wants to achieve for the country,  it is very true that people will criticize when you are doing something because of how you start not until they see the result of what you were doing.  Most people end up on the way because they can't take what talk about them any longer. 2. A person who takes advice,  you can't be correct all time3. A person that is soft in mind,  I mean someone that can never think of hurting the country in making a decision,  someone who understands the feelings of the people4. A creative minded person etc",

A creative minded person etc The problem of Nigeria have gone beyond who occupies the apex sit because the system is designed to fail. If you are asked the system of government that Nigeria is practicing, you will call federal system that is why Nigeria is call Federal Republic of Nigeria. Federal system of government requires that each of the component states are independent,  have their police, control their resources and pay certain percentage of revenue to the centre who handles immigration,  military and few others. Unfortunately, Nigeria is not practicing federalism in reality rather what Nigeria is practicing is unitary system of government where the power is concentrated at the centre with the state governors sitting as monuments without power. Every month the governors receive allocation from the federal which they use to pay salaries, execute one or two projects and looth the balance. Nigeria is designed to fail because the system that will produced the all powerful president is marred with corruption and several demonic practices including international interference such that it becomes practically impossible for a clean person to enter there without being inundated with oaths and several devilish agreements. The only way to change Nigeria is to abandon the 1999 constitution foisted on us by military junta,  then draft a new people oriented constitution that is progressive and easy to follow. A constitution that will strengthen our institutions and make the key ones like INEC and the judiciary truly independent of the executive president.",

In a country like this some set of people feel that they are entitle to rule. When someone becomes the the president or governor he turns it into an ethnic affairs and neglecting the best hands and brains that are capable of handling appointments and contracts. A country that does not prioritize education what do you think is the future of that country. A country when academic staffs were on strike for more than eight months. We Nigerians don't see ourselves as one that's our major problem.  Quote3. A person that is soft in mind,  I mean someone that can never think of hurting the country in making a decision,  someone who understands the feelings of the peopleMy brother I disagree with you on this one. Can you remember what happened during Goodluck Jonathan administration? The was a good man and kind hearted and people took advantage of that and Nigerians started calling him aunty, sister, woman etc. For you to be a good leader some people must get hurt along the way and you must be open to criticism, that's the only way you will know if you are doing well or not. What is important is that you make policies that will always benefit the country generally. Quote2. A person who takes advice,  you can't be correct all timeOp too much advice no too good, as a Nigerian president how many person advise you want to start listening to? The thing there is that as a president before you come into power you must have your agenda well documented in you manifesto with the blue prints on how to achieve them. The moment you assume office hit the ground running and follow the already documented goals you want your administration to achieve. You can do consultation where necessary just to seek opinion of few elites who has a good track records and has contributed positively in national growth and the economy. That you are seeking an opinion does not mean you don't know what to do.",

We only have political problem that is we are lacking a leader I will love to go down to say we are yet to have someone to called a leader, the people we have there are riggers and money mongers who are only there for self interest and family again. Watch other nations that has leaders see what they does for their countries and not ours though I have decided not to dig into nigerian political issues as it's just a waste of energy and strength instead it best appreciate to post here than put minds Into politics.",

Reason because;Quote from: sotelorene on November 19, 2023, 03:40:31 PM1. A tolerant person => someone who will not listen to what people will say until he is done achieving what he wants to achieve for the country,  it is very true that people will criticize when you are doing something because of how you start not until they see the result of what you were doing.  Most people end up on the way because they can't take what talk about them any longer. When you talk about tolerant, we don't need someone who is tolerant. This is because a tolerant person will hesitate to act whenever something is going wrong in the country. We need someone who will take action when he notices anything going wrong. Embezzlement, criminalist, political fallacies, and high level of corruption should not be tolerated anymore in the country.Quote from: sotelorene on November 19, 2023, 03:40:31 PM2. A person who takes advice, you can't be correct all timeEach leader has a personal advice I his cabinet and we know that some advice maybe negative and some positive, depending on the person working with you. We need a leader that at some point could make a difficult decision from his own will and reasons. What makes a quality leader is by the decision he/she can make at a critical condition or a difficult situation. The choice of decision he makes will determine if he is a good leader. Quote from: sotelorene on November 19, 2023, 03:40:31 PM3. A person that is soft in mind, I mean someone that can never think of hurting the country in making a decision, someone who understands the feelings of the people.Maybe you would have said who carries the burden of the country on his shoulder in his heart not someone who is soft in mind. A person who is soft in mind can easily be manipulated by his own council. You may not understand this, but anyone who has led some group of persons will understand this and will relate very well. You cannot satisfy everyone and do what we please everyone in the country. Sometimes its best you for you harden your mind and take some descision as long as its for the greater good.",

That is an economic problem,  a lot of time this is the only problem that is faced globally,  and any president who can have the theoretical and technical knowledge to revitalize and recover the economy such is the leader we are looking for as a country.",

Nigeria is not for the weak. For example, before Wike carries Sim made governor of Rivers State both of them got an agreement. But as Sim enters office, it seems to say if he stands by this agreement Wike fit dey Abuja dey collect the hole money wey dey come from Rivers State and it will affect him in making policies that will help the state because of no enough money. If talk says Sim get a soft mind in for accept everything wey Wike talks just for peace to dey for Rivers State.",

A creative minded person etc well OP, there's no problem that can't be solved, the thing is, are the people there interested in solving the said problem?. The problem of Nigeria its 50% the politicians, and 50% the people. The politicians are bad and corrupt, yes, but they cannot carry out their corrupt practice alone. They must carry it out through  some of the masses whom are loyal to them. They've intentionally kept the masses hungry in order to rule effectively by offering peanuts instead of real infrastructural development. The greatest heartbreak of all is that some people are still much hungry and they have the mind to be chanting the praise of these politicians whom are taking advantage of them, instead of ignoring them and working on electing a more competent candidate in the next election. The people are thereby learning from their masters and in the office, you can see corruption everywhere, starting from the managers and heads whom  employ ghost workers and leave the bulk of the work for very few vulnerable juniors. The workers themselves lacks dedication and wouldn't just give their best which sometimes is as a result of low motivation from the employers or senior colleagues. Even in the armed forces, the so called uniform men have turned away from their job and task of protecting the citizens to killing them. Nigeria needs a reorientation in all angles cos now corruption and evil is now seen as a way of life.",

A creative minded person etc     The country at this point in time is in a state that we single handedly cannot come out of. There are so many errors we've made and our leaders have made it seem like a normal thing to keep being in problemWe sink on a daily basis and we keep adding weight on ourselves that'll still keep us down. It's so obvious that we're going to be on a long ride with the situation at the moment. I don't know if we'd ever be able to get the caliber of hands we'd need to get ourselves out of this challenging phase. We need genuine leadership, selflessness, understanding, determination, good people to be at the top.    We have all it takes to prosper but we can't because of the hands that we're in. Change and development doesn't happen just like that, there ought to be a beginning. It should start with the mindset of the leaders. Even if we struggle to lend our voice to choose who we want, the greedy and ungrateful leaders won't let our voices to be heard. It eats up a whole lot of us that we're just worse than how we used to be each passing year. It's so sad that a nation blessed richly could turn out to be this way, how much would we now be if we weren't blessed with the resources we have at our disposal?",

A good leader must be strict and even if you have to kill to make things right, you should do it. As leader, you don't need to be soft hearted just to please everyone. It's practically impossible to please all and if it is necessary to hurt few for the improvement of many, you don't hesitate to do it. The likes of Gowon, IBB and Obasanjo are the types of people that Nigeria need at this moment. Although, the idea to hurt is not encouraging but if that is the option to make the right decision, please do it.

A constitution that will strengthen our institutions and make the key ones like INEC and the judiciary truly independent of the executive president. Nigeria is never designed to fail but the people piloting the nation are not aware of where we are even heading to. By the way, I agree that Nigeria is practicing federalism with k-leg but it's still a federation set up and not unitary system. The problem we are having is that too much power is concentrated on the central and I don't see that coming to an end soon. Most of the states solely relies on FGA on monthly basis to pay salary because their IGR is not even enough to cover up their monthly expenses.It's true that our constitution is not perfect but to me it's not too bad and the military deserve some thumbs up for their era because I have not seen the civilian administration that has performed more better than the military regimes despite most of their tenure are short. The truth is that, nobody including the leaders and citizens have no regard to the constitution and that's why we think there's need for another constitution. Even if you change constitution countless times and it's not follow then it changes nothing. The current people we have as our leaders will make the worse constitution in the world if given the opportunity to change the constitution because of their personal benefits. Let operate according to the present constitution and I believe things will change for good.",
