Quote from: Sakanwa on January 24, 2023, 02:53:48 PMis it also gaining this much fame in your environment?Not really. The bitcoin/crypto hype peaked in 2021 in the country I'm currently in (Philippines), and I'm pretty certain it's pretty much the same for most parts of the world. Not because we had a good price bounce after all the exchange fiasco doesn't necessarily mean bitcoin is gaining fame.",

Regulations normally allow things to gain acceptance providing they're not an outright ban (or near one).When were people talking about it? Was that recently due to the last spike or has it been ongoing for a while? If it's more recently, are you sure they weren't already talking about it like franky said?Crypto hype in general has been going on for longer than bitcoin has been a thing imo. Bank security is generally worse than most exchanges that function in cryptocurrency now because of it and a lot of cryptocurrency holders also have more secure assets too because they have no need to trust in anyone else to keep their keys secure (though there'll be people in the market with weaker security too so it's a topic worth researching).",

Bitcoin is one of most profitable assets for investors so it is noisy on media in the last few years.You can see how Bitcoin survived through many fuds, crashes in cryptocurrency market as well as many shocks from economics, politics black swan events.Bitcoin is not dead but it was called as dead 450+ times.https://www.bitcoinisdead.org/https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/Bitcoin will become stronger and stronger year by year because of Lindy effect that was mentioned inThe Bullish case for Bitcoin. If you love reading books, let's buy this bookOne of easiest (but too naive) ways to see people interest in Bitcoin is Google Trend.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=bitcoin",

Cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular is decentralized asset in which nobody including authorities can't control or regulate the price of the currency. And also investing in bitcoin is much more better than Fiat currency so known this people leave their minor works and investment to Join bitcoin. When you buy bitcoin at the rate of $16,000 or below and you wait till at the rate of of $50,000 and sell it then you Will see the increase income of it.From the way narratively present  your content, your mood look similar to a country I know.",

The continuous regularizations by banks or restrictions to the freedom of one’s funds when they want has inclined people to bitcoin. Its features like hedging against inflation also plays a role. But the most important part of its fame is the ability to gain profit by just holding for long. Humans look everywhere to gain profit and that is why even Ponzi schemes get lots of people investing in them. The fud or rather hate by the government has one way or the other spread news about it and this has some investors into picking interest in it, clear example is countries whose its adoption grows after government ban. Lastly the social media which is easily use this days to spread news or stereotypes has one way or the other influence it’s popularity.",

Anybody can create any number of accounts on any of these websites (I have one with Binance) and never use it (I don't) and yet be a statistic there. Maybe someone who created the account to see what bitcoin is and then realized they don't want to buy it at all. I said accounts since until you verify your account you can create as many as you want.You also aren't taking into account the people who have an account on both sites.So you can't use that number to find number of \"crypto users\".That's not to mention that trading cryptocurrencies is not the same as using them (ie real adoption)...",

If your country has strict and enforced anti-crypto legislation, then I'd be surprised if Bitcoin still were popular. In many countries, luckily, Bitcoin isn't banned, and it's either legal or in the gray area, which is basically safe in most cases. So I'd attribute Bitcoin's fame to being a great-performing asset (if you zoom out), being a revolutionary kind of money (the one no authority issues or controls, the one with fixed total supply and without monetary policies set by anyone, and the one you can send internationally without getting banks or anyone else involved), and partly to it not being severely restricted by the authorities of various countries, actually.",

This feature provides the user to manage his finances independently, without having to beg and follow the government or banks. This is the main and primary reason for which Bitcoin has lot many fame. And to counter this many government have banned the coin. Another reason for which many people have interest on Bitcoins is that due to the limited amount of coins. Soon it will become valuable and people will sell it in high price.",

Bitcoin has suffered from both, most notably from black ash and bad press from those who oppose its global implementation as legal tender. One thing you should take away from all of this is that bitcoin is still gaining acceptance around the world, despite the government's opposition. People still believe and trust in it, which should persuade you that bitcoin is worth the good name and fame it carries. Millions of people can't be attached to something if it's not worth it.",

Most people that are fifty and above have little or no knowledge about the currency in my locality. Although it is restricted in my country, yet young citizens are attracted to the coin because of some notable benefits it offers. I think bitcoin would get more recognition if the economic condition of my country improves. This is because people are currently focusing on meeting their basic needs and only a few are considering investments. A good product would always get the right attention, that's why bitcoin would keep attracting more people to its fold.",

People are not mostly free nowadays. Some of them think they are free but in reality they are just slaves. Bitcoin is putting an end to slavery. With bitcoin, you are your own bank. You have the total control of your funds. Gold offers a similar deal too but the difference is, bitcoin is actually portable and you can move it from one country to another without asking permission from anybody.Bitcoin is life changing tech.
