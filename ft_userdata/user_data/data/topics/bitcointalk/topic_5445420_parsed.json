  "content": "Hello, I want to run my own node and contribute to the network. I have found online tutorials on how to build it and I decided to download bitcoin core and run it on an old laptop, after upgrading its disc to 1TB (preferably SSD). I know I can build a fully custom node using a raspberry pi etc, but I decided to go with my old laptop.However, there is something I haven't understood and it has to do with the software that is needed. My question may be silly but... here it is:I came across many people online who say they run nodes, but they use MyNode https://mynodebtc.com/ or Umbrel etc.What is the difference? I really don't understand it. If I want to validate transactions, isn't Bitcoin Core enough?",

Would I be able to run those programs on a simple computer? I guess yes..Also, all those programs don't require Bitcoin Core ?? I thought bitcoin core is a must",

The 'nodes in a box' install core and then everything else.They do run on a RPi4, well perhaps not run but walk really fast :-)I have a few of them running on Rpi and they are fine, but a 4th gen i5 with 8gb RAM and a 1tb SSD blows it out of the water in terms of performance.

And, as I understand, it provides you with a local server that you can access (perhaps on localhost via browser) and have multiple applications oriented towards bitcoin, such as block explorers, wallets etc.But, Bitcoin Core is \"hidden\" behind all the other applications, in order to maintain a full copy of the blockchain.Correct ?",
