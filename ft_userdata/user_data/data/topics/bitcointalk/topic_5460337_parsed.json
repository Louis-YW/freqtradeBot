Its not like that.I wanted to say i got it, that you have to have some smerits then you will be able to send merit with page reloading.

I am asking because I could swear that I didn't see any message each time it happened (last time it happened was probably more than a year ago).This is not new feature, the popup message is very small and not noticeable especially if you are using desktop with huge screen. I usually received this notification when I’m distributing merit on local boards. You will just mistakenly that the page didn't load properly when you refresh if you didn't pay much attention on the screen pop-up. @Poker player, my worst epic fail on sending merit is sending 10 instead of 1 simce the default zero doesn't automatically delete once we input a number.",

Are you certain that your computer tab was not opened to a different forum user and you came in to meet it? This for me is the only situation that can make you see a different username.

The restriction applies only in the merit sending page, right after you have sent smerits to a post. You have a 60-second restriction window before you can again send the same amount of merits to the same post.→ If it's a different amount of merits getting sent to that very post, then it's possible to do it even within the 60 seconds→ If you are sending any number of merits to different posts, then it's possible to do it even within the 60 seconds.",
