  "content": "Dude seems pretty solid.https://jameso.be/vaults.pdfWould like to see something make it into bitcoin like this. Since if the time delay could be set long enough then it would serve effectively as a \"freezing\" function: my post about freezing functions was locked https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5351497.0  for those too lazy to read the pdf, here's their concluding remarks:QuoteWe have presented a new set of opcodes, OP_VAULT and OP_UNVAULT, which enable featurefulvaults in Bitcoin. These opcodes allow encumbering a set of coins in such a way that theirspending requires passing through a delay period, during which the coins can be recovered to aset address. Enabling on-chain enforcement of such a control flow presents significant benefits tocustodians of bitcoin, whether large or small, because this scheme in essence offers multisig-likesecurity for an expected operational burden roughly on par with single sig use.",

This is generally fragile and has several pitfalls, the obvious being loss of the presigned transactions means loss of the funds. It turns the transactions into secret data, and transactions are much larger, so this becomes harder to deal with. There are other issues such as the vault cannot be reused (the key was destroyed after setup, so no new inputs can be signed for) and the destinations and amounts cannot be changed after the setup. OP_VAULT solves these things.OP_VAULT makes it so that the secret data in the vault is still just private keys. Because it's a script, it can be reused and receive coins even after setup. The destinations of the coins can be determined during unvaulting, not during setup.

There aren't any additional changes to RBF required that aren't already planned and in the works. Ephemeral anchors requires package relay and validation, which is already largely in progress. It just adds one additional rule for detecting and handling the anchor output. Otherwise, OP_TRUE outputs are already valid, as are 0-value outputs and spending them. It's just a policy change, there's no consensus meaning applied to ephemeral anchors.Quote from: NotATether on January 20, 2023, 10:27:26 AMAnd what happens if somebody needs to move the coins that are delayed by the vault, because an unauthorized person initiated the transfer in the first place? Will RBF still work in that kind of enclave, or does this design require the consensus to reject such transactions?There are two methods for recovering the coins. The first is to double spend the unvault, and the second is to recover during the spend delay. In the first method, you would double spend the OP_VAULT input with a transaction that sends those funds to the recovery address. Doing this requires package RBF to be implemented (and this is something that is already in progress) as well as ephemeral anchors. The recovery just needs to pay a package feerate that's higher than the unvaulting. However, even if this fails (or is not done) and the unvaulting transaction is confirmed, there is still an additional delay before the unvaulted coins can actually be moved to their final destinations. During this time, the coins still be swept to the recovery address by a transaction that spends the OP_UNVAULT output and sends everything to the recovery address. This does not require RBF, and the only consensus changes are those required to implement the semantics of the opcodes themselves.I also want to note that the author of this proposal has been working on vault constructions for a very long time. It's highly likely that if you think of an \"obvious\" construction, he's likely thought or heard of it already. The motivation of this proposal is that there is no way to construct a vault that meets the \"idealized vault\" described in the paper using today's consensus and policy rules.",

In other words it requires 2 transactions to spend a vaulted coin.yes that is true. but just ask anyone like LukeDashJr if they wish they would have had something like this. it could have saved him from losing all his money. he could have still used his \"hot wallet\" from a computer connected to the internet but when he saw the hacker trying to unvault and then spend his bitcoins, he could have snuffed that out asap by sending to his \"cold wallet\". now i'm not gonna lie, the value of the delay time is an important consideration that would be something each individual would need to evaluate and determine what works best for themself based on their particular use case of bitcoin. set it too small and someone could unvault and spend before you even knew it happened. set it too large and you can't really use your \"hot wallet\" effectively to send bitcoin in an expedient manner.  enough said.",
