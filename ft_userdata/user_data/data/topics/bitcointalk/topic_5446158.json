  "content": "Over time what ever we owned was been accounted for, If we invest in landed properties we are given government issued documents to seal our ownership, if we wanted to invest in gold or any other precious metal it will require us having a sort of ID that permits the buyer and seller to operate legally. Everything we could ever own is subject to close monitoring. It can as well said to be safe guarded by this same systems.Those who didn't want to account for their properties went through the back doors and yet their investments were vulnerable to all sorts of attacks, which included confiscation, theft, oppression even loss due to lack of document to claim ownership. To stand a chance of having your properties safe and secure means having to trust the government. While this might not be a bad idea but what if this properties get seized, what if this properties get confiscated, what if along the line one is denied access to their properties. Some offence might warrant search operatives to visit homes of the suspects to ensure the confiscate all their valuable properties. This is where the importance of owning Bitcoin comes into play. It can come in very useful in times like this. No one ever prays for bad events to occur but most of this things happens and sometimes the suspects might be tried and later discovered to be innocent but how about the moments of hardship they encountered while the trial was ongoing. Since the invention of Bitcoin we have seen it as an investment option, a p2p transaction mechanism, a means of making anonymous donations and lots more. Now looking at it from the perspective of making anonymous savings incase of unplanned circumstance. Some times this circumstance can come in the form of set up or envy just to pull a fellow down.",

      "body": "Well,that method of record keeping for asset ownership is important but it creates another problem, which is, it could be abused by government or those you trust to manage things for you . So, the question would be \"how do we have this records tied to their real owners without the abuse or trusting the government with them\"?. That's part of the reasons Satoshi invented Bitcoin, a Decentralized System that  keeps an immutable record of transactions and ownership in a transparent ledger. It keeps chains of records that prove ownership & transfers by owners. Having a private key to your assets with possible signature, could be enough to prove your ownership or who the original owner was and whether he/she consented to the transfer of the assets/bitcoins to the new owner. I think we could have some sort of Transfer Consent that's easy to use and signed by the owner, like it's done in Physical World Another advantage of the Bitcoin method of record keeping is that monitoring of the asset transfers is possible due to its transparency, without revealing the identity of Bitcoin owners due to its anonymity/privacy feature. Some would say that the anonymity/privacy  feature can be broken/abused...well, what do we have the law enforcement people for? Isn't it to enforce the law and punish the law breakers? If the anonymity/privacy is abuse or broken the responsibility of law enforcement lies in the hands of law enforcement agencies.... So, the responsible ones would have to do their job. By the way, it's important to always use Bitcoin properly to reduce the likelihood of your anonymity/privacy getting abused or violated.So, Bitcoin solves the problem really well. We can continue to build better record system from its foundation.",

Now obviously it was initially documented because that’s the most solid proof with all the stamps and agreements, along with lawyer as eye witness in many high class deals. I don’t think there is any big change in the bitcoin technology. Per se blockchain is locker where all the important stuff is locked up forever while all the public computers are validators or lawyers or middle entities witnessing the data for validating. Proving that I own it or you own it. Former is traditional and let’s consider blockchain as the modernise one.",

      "body": "I definitely remember that banks realized they had to change something about their operations after seeing that Bitcoin doesn't disappear for a couple of years. In the early days it was not possible to make a transaction and hope for it to arrive the next day. It took several days even domestically, abroad was a nightmare and sending it to another continent was the ultimate catastrophe. The concept of being able to send value 24/7 on every single day was a great value proposition. It became a bit harder later on because of the fees and network congestion, but still banks knew that development might not stop and this thing could become a threat to their transaction revenues. Today the banks are much faster and provide services like instant transactions. This is just one practical example how Bitcoin represented a great alternative to back then existing payment methods.",

Just imagine the early birds or early adopters who began so rich because of their investments when it was just like < $100k. Me, I'm not an early investors but I have seen the bull run and bearish market so come to the conclusion that it is one of the best investment that I did since 2017. However, it's not that anonymous though, I mean we all know that bitcoin addresses doesn't have a name, but now almost all services that relates to it has KYC already. But I guess it won't deter us from going full bitcoin mode in the next years or so because we know that the chances are high to get big profits like every 4 years by simply buying and HODLing and waiting for the bull run to happen.",

However, as a good citizen, you must obey and comply with the rules that have been made regarding the investment that you have. But some of these violations on average do not happen to people who are obedient and obedient to the rules. Every investment has a risk, both Bitcoin also has a risk of loss. Bitcoin is becoming a Digital investment option that provides good returns in the long term. The risk is quite high because of volatility, it provides many benefits if used properly. It's up to the user whether you want to be anonymous with Bitcoin, or own some government regulated investment. having both is certainly good.",

So here's the thing: how most people lived before Bitcoin was developed and how they are still living now make no difference. Centralized organizations and companies are still the major source of some people's investment.I also tend to always tell people around me about Bitcoin, should they not be aware of it (just as OGNasty stated). I think some people are not yet aware of Bitcoin, and we could talk them into it to help them.",

Bitcoin is really good but it's not perfect, it and banks, governments, fiat money... all have their pros and cons. Bitcoin is also just a financial instrument, and whether it is good or bad is due to human behavior. As well as governments that accuse bitcoin of serving criminals, launder money and have difficulty tracing criminals. In this case, bitcoin is not as good as we think.",

There may be unintended consequences in making sure that ownership is made clear, but it is certainly good rather than bad. I don't actually find any problem when titles or certificates are issued signifying our ownership over certain properties. Although it is also self-serving for the government because that would also be used for tax purposes, the fact is that it legally protects the properties of people. As a matter of fact, I think it's about time that Bitcoin is also given the same benefit.",
