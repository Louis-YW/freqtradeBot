  "content": "Hello, in order to insert an image into your post, you must first upload it to the hosting. Sometimes it can be inconvenient, especially from a smartphone. I suggest to use a @Free_Image_Hosting_bot in telegram. You just need to upload image hare, and after 1 second you will get a link.This is not an advertisement, and I am not the creator of the bot. Therefore, I advise you to upload images without confidential information. Nevertheless, this method is very convenient.",

But, do you think the bot can keep the images forever?Â  I'm worried that if the developer deletes an image after some time, it could mess up our posts and make them incomplete when we revisit them after the image is gone.One of the things I despise about Telegram bots is that their services sometimes stop without any prior notice. This means that their service could shut down at any time. IMO, this method is convenient but uncomfortable for the long term.",

I don't know about other image hosting site and their mobile usage friendly but I will prefer to use the most recognized and familiar photo hosting sites instead of trying out some new ones which have no significant and clear difference or upgrade to what we already have existing here.",

I don't think that someone will first create an account on Telegram only to use this bot to get quick links for their posts. It's probably better if there is a website that is easy to use and quick, just like the one I provided above.",
