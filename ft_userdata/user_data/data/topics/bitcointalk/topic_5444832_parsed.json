  "content": "This is a sad story of how someone panicked due to the news about SVB a couple of days ago.A twitter account named BowTiedPickle.Eth posted a tweet about this guy that had made a mistake. Every detail is on the link that I'll provide at the bottom together with the quotes from the links.Quote from: https://twitter.com/BowTiedPickle/status/1634415551450587138With USDC insolvency fears rampant, users are fleeing to safety in other stables. Not all of them are going to make it there in one piece, however.Here's how one unlucky user paid $2,080,468.85 to receive $0.05 of USDT.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-investor-shells-out-2m-to-receive-0-05-usdt-trying-to-evade-crashOn-chain investigations revealed that the user had stored the assets in a liquidity pool (LP) — a popular method to earn passive income in cryptocurrencies. The user could have sold his LP tokens for USDT for a 6% slippage. However, they chose to go for a “questionable \" method. As explained by BowTiedPickle:“The unfortunate soul used the KyberSwap aggregation router to dump a large clip of 3CRV (DAI/USDC/USDT) LP token into USDT.”Sources:https://cointelegraph.com/news/usdc-investor-shells-out-2m-to-receive-0-05-usdt-trying-to-evade-crashhttps://twitter.com/BowTiedPickle/status/1634415551450587138",

And this is the main issue that has been in between governments and blockchain adoption. The fact that people are responsible for their own wallets doesn't sit well with regulations in where you can't \"lose\" money or take it from someone because they made a technical error.There's a reason why same self-responsibility idea is not applied to elsewhere in the net, because if people would be responsible of their own data. Hacking accounts would be semi-legal because you would be solely responsible of your security anyway.",
