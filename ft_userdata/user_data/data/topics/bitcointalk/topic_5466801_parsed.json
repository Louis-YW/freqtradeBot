Those country that you listed has their own set of gambling license exclusive for their citizens and some of them literally ban any form of gambling to their country like Monaco.Do mean legal means regulated strictly? I do agree on this basis since Curaçao license is somehow useless in an event of complaint since they are very slow to make action and they didn’t care if the casino has a lot of acrive cases of scamming user for their license unlike country that you mention that is very strict on gambling policies in terms of consumer protection.",

That's because the majority of them have not been educated apart from the role of religion which does not allow this activity.",

      "body": "Exactly,  the country regulation on gambling differs and while at that those countries like the USA ultimately block their citizens access to casinos that are not license by them and just like you have said Curacao licensing is worthless due to high number of unresolved scams accusations on some of the casinos that are licensed by that authority and there is nothing that has been done about addressing the issues and withdrawing such casino license. The countries listed have strong regulations unless for a few of them that may have other banned places on gambling activities within their jurisdictions.",

UKIrelandMonacoGermanySpainBelgiumthe USACanadaMaltaAustraliaWhat do you feel from this that gambling is less ethical?For all those countries that banned gambling must have some reasons that made them to banned it from their countries so that there will be peace and progress in their land. I believe we have had how some people have sold their properties to gamble and loss everything at the end to draw the attention of the government that made gambling legal but still make it banned for the sake of some people that are addicted to it and they are ready to sell anything sellable just to have access to gambling. For those gambling is less in their countries based on the banned will not stop the gamblers not to make money from their gambling  because they will still be doing it in a secret way but they will not be comfortable like some countries that made it legal and popular for their citizens to use it to finance their education and businesses. I guess, a time will come when some presidents will lift the banned to favour those who want gambling to be legal and popular in their countries to have full access to gambling publicly in their various countries country just to make their gamblers happy because there are some people cannot copy without gambling.",

Others prohibit gambling due to its moral damage to the society in which it further applies more risk to its people. While this may be the case, there are some countries that see gambling in a 2-way perspective: one as an activity and one as an economic opportunity.In the Philippines, the revenue of gambling activities ranked 2nd to our main source of income for the country. With this in mind, the country uses these income to fund various government sectors and for the benefit of the society.",

The government can't stop online casinos but I don't think that they can stop gambling as a whole.If there are no land based casinos or online casinos, due to the fact that it is an offense. Gambling will be done secretly by gamblers, especially gambling with friends and neighbors. Sportbet can also be done in pairs by individuals. It is only in the Muslim countries that I can say gambling activities wouldn't be possible. Although gambling is dangerous to human financial status, if he can't control his gambling activities.",

Citizens of their countries continue to play illegally because of which these countries don't receive taxes. They harm themselves. Sometimes they introduce completely strange taxes, and other times they refuse a large chunk of taxes. Because of ethical reasons? Of course no.I don’t feel anything from gambling and am completely indifferent to it. Do I think this is unethical? I believe that everyone has the right to do whatever doesn't disturb others. Gamblers only harm themselves, therefore, there is nothing unethical in this. It is unethical for casinos to abuse the weaknesses of gamblers.",

It's just a neutral activity, which can be positive or negative for an individual or society, depending how it's being organized, executed and promoted by the individuals involved. As we can see on the presented list, it includes mainly first world countries, what means gambling isn't harmful for their economies along all these years it's being practiced by their citizens. In many cases it's actually good, since gambling moves the touristic interest for a specific region.",

And it is not impossible that the legalization of gambling in every country can occur, even though some people consider gambling to be very contrary to norms and laws. However, currently I see that gambling has become a disease for society, because many of them are addicted to illegal gambling. And of course, so that every country is able to control gambling carried out by the public, like it or not, the government must legalize gambling so that it can control and supervise gambling activities carried out by the public. And this is done to prevent even worse things from gambling addiction.",

In Asia, gambling is also legal in several countries, but perhaps not in some countries where the majority of the population is Muslim.The legality of gambling can basically make the country profit, but of course the government needs to strictly control gambling activities which might limit you from gambling. Somewhere, I've heard the government is starting to limit gambling budget, so gambler won't be completely free to use all they money even though they have legalized gambling.",

Most of the countries in your list offer some of the highest standard of living and advanced environments you'll find anywhere on the planet. How about these countries have seen common sense and accepted that you may as well regulate this activity, that people have wanted to engage in since the beginning of time, and get tax from it instead of driving it underground? You can guarantee that gambling takes place in many different forms in every country of the world, it's just other countries choose to hide the activity and pretend like it doesn't exist, or usually persecute the activity due to some religious related nonsense. You'll also find that these are some of the lesser corrupt countries too. I know which type of country I'd rather live in.",
