What he's going to do is offer you a private key of the address with 1,400 USDT in it and indeed there is some USDT in it, but you won't be able to move the USDT out of the wallet because it's multisig. Only OP has the keys to the wallet to move the funds.",

If OP really wants to go through that route he might as well just let us know he's trying to scam us, I've spent too much time in Runescape so it's only going to be a waste of time.",
