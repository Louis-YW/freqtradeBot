  "content": "I recall the way you did it with ledger live back then was go to your transaction history and then go to all your receiving btc transactions and then copy and paste the btc address into a website and then it would show the current btc balance.  You would then add the balances of each address to get your total btc current balance.  It would also show all previous transactions with the address.  However, how would you know how many total btc addresses you have BTC in?  For example someone could have 1 btc and that 1 btc could be in 30 different btc addresses on their nano ledger s plus?  Do you just go and check the receiving address every single time you received btc even if it was say 0.0001 btc because that 0.0001 btc could actually be 0.1 btc?Does anyone know what is the name of this website I am talking about?  I thought it was blockchair for some reason but not sure if that is the website now because the website I use to use doesn't look like this now?  I recall you could copy and paste the btc address or transaction id and then it would give output and history etc.  What is the name of this website?",

Click on 'view' on the GUI -> check (✔️) coins. Coins will appear on the GUI, click on coins and you will see your funded addresses.You can also use other coin control wallet like Sparrow and Bluewallet for it.Do not import your seed phrase or master private key. Import your master public key which will start from xpub, ypub or zpub. It is a watch-only wallet and you will not be able to use the wallet to spend your coins.",

If your goal is to keep an eye on your wallet's balance at all times even when you don't have access to your device, then follow what I said in my previous post. If you want to see your balance in Ledger Live, then their desktop app already shows that. Doesn't it?",

Of course, that's not much helpful, as it doesn't work if you have a ypub or zpub.

Every good wallet will use a new address for each incoming transaction. It makes absolutely no difference to the fees you have to pay whether each UTXO you receive is on the same address or on different addresses, and using different addresses is better for privacy. I don't want a colleague to pay me $5 for a coffee I bought them to the same address I hold every single satoshi I own and therefore reveal to them my entire holdings.",
