So, always have this feeling that there are companies or institution who are paying their investors bitcoin or if they are ordering goods from other countries payment can be in bitcoin. I still need to draw your attention that people are trading bitcoin on forex, binary options and another broker out there so they need bitcoin for that to take effect. Wth all these I have explained tell how do you think no one will transact bitcoin?",

Granted, the total hashrate might drop (so the difficulty might drop aswell), but having no miners at all doesn't seem plausible.",

After all bitcoin has been mined miners will have a reduce profit from the mining and so also as when there is a reduce sells or move of bitcoin from an address to address will also reduce the mining profits. But one thing is the hashrate will actually be reduced which is the reason why mining in the first place is expensive to run.

      "body": "That is not a dumb question at all! In reality, it's an extremely important subject to explore, particularly as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gain popularity. If everyone holds on to their bitcoin and does not sell it, the value of bitcoin may fall gradually. This is because the demand for bitcoin would be reduced, and fewer individuals would be prepared to pay a higher price for it. It is possible that miners will not find it profitable to continue mining, which could have an influence on the overall stability of the bitcoin network. So, while holding onto bitcoin may appear to be an effective strategy for Bitcoin Investment, it is important to examine the possible repercussions. This is something that could potentially have a big impact on the bitcoin ecosystem, so it's definitely something to keep in mind.",

There are a lot of players in this market, both big and small. Each of which will not allow what you voiced to be realized. In fact, this is impossible because the asset in demand will always be bought and sold. If we proceed from the law of supply and demand and assume that no one is selling bitcoin (and demand will only increase due to shortage), then the price of bitcoin will probably tend to the moon. Literally. And it will cost truly astronomical money.What is your concern? Are you worried that if you hold bitcoin yourself for a long time, and others follow the same example and won’t sell (no one at all), then you won’t be able to sell bitcoin at a good price?",

That. And when sales start to decrease, of course the effect will also be there, such as the effect of increasing prices which will continue in the market so that there will be more holders and those who believe in Bitcoin will also continue to increase every year.",

Miners alone will have to sell a percentage of their reward in order to pay for operational costs.The perceived problem hasnt arisen so far over the last 3 halvings.We also should consider that there are times of shorter supply because of Bull markets and funnily enough not the most opportune time to buy and times of plenty of liquidity in timesof Bear markets which is a great time to buy!",

On many centralized exchanges, there are traders who have already set a sell price of $70k+, while others have also set a higher price. What happens is that if perhaps the market is a bit stagnant at one price and an investor really needs to buy bitcoin, they have no choice but to buy with the order that is less expensive on the sell orders book, and if the least order was placed at $70k, which they end up buying, the price of bitcoin will jump to be $70k. There will always be an equilibrium between the price of bitcoin and the last sell order. If everyone is holding and there is supplous demand or unlimited buyers, then this will only trigger a high price. The mining business will still be profitable for solo miners, as they will still earn significant rewards upon completion of the process within the network.",

But there is this concern that usually pop up in my head anytime I am meditating and that is what will happen if everyone is holding their bitcoin and no one is willing to sell. You make a fair observation.  There's some truth that if all Bitcoin holders just cling to their stash instead of selling any, it could disrupt the market balance.  Bitcoin's value depends on basic supply and demand, just like any other tradable asset.  If no ones selling to satisfy buyers, prices could skyrocket.  But that spike probably wouldn't last forever and  the market tends to even out eventually with the cost settling into a new balance that fits with how supply and demand shift over time.Quote from: adultcrypto on February 29, 2024, 01:41:53 PMThis can possibly happen in the future when mining reward becomes too small. Even when mining reward becomes too small we will still have transaction fees.Quote from: adultcrypto on February 29, 2024, 01:41:53 PMI know some people will say that miners will continue to mine and sell to sustain their business but when there is reduced selling, will mining still be a profitable business?Reduced selling means less Bitcoin on the market, which can impact its price.  If the miners are not able to sustain their business, some of them will probably stop mining, this will affect the difficulty on the network, which will consequently lead to more earnings for the miners who remain until a new equilibrium is reached again.",

The answer is within its historical price increase. People who have joined the community a couple of years back, they have already seen an astronomical amount of profit which no other asset can provide. So they are more inclined towards holding. Personally I am one of them. Secondly, I think the current transaction fees is also discouraging people from using Bitcoin. So instead of making small transactions, people are waiting for their goals to be reached so that they can make one big transaction and take out the profits.",
