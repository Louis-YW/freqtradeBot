Now what if you have all you need and you don't require money to buy anything, are you poor? Some people live in communities where everyone lives agrarian life. They have all they need because everything they need to survive is available. Food is on the farm, water available and everybody is happy. Although it was hard during the Covid-19 lockdown many people lived without money. I have also seen many people leaving cities and moving to rural areas to live a natural life. In summary when you have everything you need to survive and you don't need money, are you poor?",

I think this discussion will only be related to human dissatisfaction and greed and spinning to things that we often encounter in every discussion about the economy and poverty in this forum and I think it will also spin around the same conclusion.Poverty is not seen from the amount of money you have, I can consider the person in your story to be a rich person, because you can enjoy life without thinking about having money or not, and or without thinking tomorrow is because he has life and awareness of thinking From its perspective.Someone will make it poor and still need money, someone thinks the same as me.With the meaning everyone has his views, but will refer to the same discussion pattern, are you not bored?",

Just like you said, someone that is living agrarian live in a way they are cultivating land for crop planting and rearing animals. These kind of people may not need anything. It can not be said that they are poor too. To be poor means a person that can not afford to eat three good meals per day, not having good cloths and shelter. If you see them, you will know that they are poor in the kind of environment they are living, the food they are eating. Did you know that some people will borrow to eat or depend on someone? Some people can not afford to send their child to school. If someone can not meetup with the basic needs of life, the person is poor. It is not about if the person is agrarian or living in a well developed city.",

There has been a lot of things to consider in determining who's living under poverty or not, one of the primary reason is the unemployment and lacking of ability to generate money consistently. I guess being poor in the city is much harder than being poor in the rural areas where you can plant crops and vegetables and raise livestocks as well.",

Just as the Igbo's does whenever they are sick just mentioned some certain amount of money as gift to them you would see how effectively they will recover from their illness.

That's just one way to look at it.Also, a person can be poor when they are living on less than $1.90 a day. That is the global poverty line. So if a person spends less than $1.90 on food, transportation, education, electricity, and other basic needs a day, he is considered to be poor. I prefer this version better because even if you don't spend money n the things you see a day like the example you gave on people leaving on a farm, those things can still be valued with money. The fruits and vegetables can be valued as money. so if the value of everything they spend a day is less than $1.90 then they are poor.",

So when people assume that poverty is when you don't have money I don't agree.I agree with your point. I'd like to also add that poverty should be considered when the means to be able to grow is extremely tough. Opportunity is low, living costs versus income are close and the ability to save is limited. I think that someone who has landed themselves as poor from bad decisions but have the ability to change if they worked hard enough, is not in poverty but rather just poor.Quote from: Fiatless on June 14, 2023, 08:14:10 AMIn summary when you have everything you need to survive and you don't need money, are you poor?Maybe from a general society outlook you would be poor...but really, you can live. You are not poor in time. You are not poor in the sense of your fulfillment (as you have all that you need)...and if you live like this by choice, you probably aren't vein so you are probably not poor in your mind.

So if poverty is aimed at the financial aspect, it is certain that that comes to mind, lack of money or lack of necessities of life. So if there are people whose lives are short of money, and their needs are not fulfilled, you could say that person is financially poor. But if there are people who don't have money, but whose needs are fulfilled, I don't think that person can be called a poor person. Because if a person's needs are fulfilled, even though the finances are not too much, his life can be said to be quite decent.But if you talk about something deeper like happiness, financial aspects or needs, sometimes for some people it's not that important to always be there. Because people like that already talk about contentment. Because if in their life, their hearts always feel satisfied and grateful, even if not with money, or with having all their needs fulfilled, for them with that they already feel rich and have enough. So in conclusion, poverty when viewed from all existing aspects, it all depends on the person who interprets it.",

If there is everything that you need  available like food etc. The rich and poor will then be determined by the quantity of food they have. Rich and poor is determined by the quantity of the resources you have. In some ancient African cultures where agriculture is a major practice and planting of yams and rearing goats is the major products, the man who has the largest yam barns and goats is usually called the richest.

In summary when you have everything you need to survive and you don't need money, are you poor?According to William BrownWilliam Brown: Poverty is the state of being poor; that is, lacking the basic needs of life such as food, health, education, and shelter. https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199670840.001.0001/acref-9780199670840-e-1716Poverty refers to the lack of adequate financial resources such that individuals, households, and entire communities don't have the means to subsist or acquire the basic necessities for a flourishing life. This means being so poor as to struggle to obtain food, clothing, shelter, and medicines. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/poverty.asp%23:~:text%3DPoverty%2520refers%2520to%2520the%2520lack,clothing%252C%2520shelter%252C%2520and%2520medicines.&ved=2ahUKEwi3l7KM3ML_AhXDnFwKHTexAy4QFnoECBEQBQ&usg=AOvVaw3yS3yYncpJTsc1jl-xsTFgIn the two definitional context above you can see it all points to same things and criteria that could be said of a person to be poor in the absence or inability of the person to provide for himself and family such needs. But unfortunately today, celebrity lifestyle and the quest for man to acquire and accumulate wealth has increasingly made it difficult to agree that anyone who can only adequately afford shelter, clothes, food and health is not still poor. The desire to obtain and acquire ostentatious valuables has made even those that can only afford the basic needs of life to still think themselves poor, and this idea has led to ingratitude in today's society among humans.",

We must strive to make money because money is important to provide for our needs as you mentioned. There are places where you don't need money for medical bills, school fees, and transportation. They rely on traditional medicine, education, and more of transportation. I know places that still use horses, donkeys, and camels for transportation. You may need money to take care of these needs but many people don't need money to satisfy these needs. There are also many modern societies where education, healthcare, and transportation are free, so you don't need money to satisfy them.

And if you can satisfy these without money, you are also rich. So a man that earns money in New York to satisfy his needs and a man that owns a large farm in a rural area of South America to satisfy his needs are just the same. Money shouldn't be a determinant factor to classify people as poor or rich. I don't need to eat in restaurants to satisfy my hunger because there are none in some areas.",
