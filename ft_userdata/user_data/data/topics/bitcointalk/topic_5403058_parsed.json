  "content": "Peer to peer payments are a revolutionary technology. I've contemplated integrating them into a number of different projects of mine---to add an economic dimension to network transactions could greatly reduce or entirely eliminate spam, and could change the economic model from ad-based to direct payment, which could lead to greater variety of viewpoints presented, etc.However, I keep coming up against one obstacle: the operational complexity of actually running a Lightning node. I'm no technical slouch, but as I read through guides on running a server, I come away with the strong impression that the process is not only onerous, but also incredibly accident-prone.For example, the need for watchtower services in addition to the main lightning node; the need to always be online and available or face penalties; the complexity of managing channels; restoring nodes (and funds!) from loss after unexpected shutdowns; etc.The point of the Lightning Network is to fully realize the peer-to-peer cash vision of Bitcoin. Due to the blockchain's limited throughput, transaction fees are too high and transaction latencies far too slow.But de facto the operations risks and difficulties of the Lightning Network serve as a comparable---though not identical---impediment to its use as a peer-to-peer payment network.Of course, many can and do run nodes and make use of what is an amazing technology.But to truly take the place of cash, everybody should be able to use it. Anybody can receive, keep, and pass on a ten dollar bill. But almost nobody can run a Lightning Node, even following step-by-step instructions.So lightning is faster, and per-transaction it will be cheaper. But in many ways it seems even less cash-like than directly transacting on the blockchain. At least with on-chain transactions, I only need to be online when I want to transact.That's why I hesitate to integrate Lightning into services and protocols I'm designing. For example, a peer-to-peer publishing and content distribution platform I'd like to build. Asking people to run _a_ server on their phone or laptop or whatever isn't too big of an ask; but asking them to _also_ run a Lighting Node so that they can be paid for their work and pay to view others' work---that's quite a high bar.I understand there are simplifying upgrades to Bitcoin that could allow a smoother Lightning experience (e.g. the L2 upgrade).But what are the prospects for making Lightning at least as easy to run as Bitcoin Core?And making it easy to integrate directly into other software, such that the Lightning Protocol is largely abstracted away from users?Some things I've been wondering about. Look forward to anything I might learn. Thanks in advance.",

Then you don't need any watchtower, but then you have to rebalance your channels more often. Also, you can try to increase the number of participants in a single channel, from 2 to N. By using Taproot and forming N-of-N multisigs, you can handle that, without increasing needed on-chain space.Edit: Technically, I can imagine a sidechain as a single Taproot output with SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY, that will keep moving as a one-input-one-output entry every sometimes, when all peg-ins and peg-outs will be handled by attaching more inputs and outputs to such transaction.",

It should not be terribly difficult to implement improvements to all of the above. Watchtowers are needed to ensure that your counterparties are not attempting to cheat you. With watchtowers, you do not need to personally be online. One failsafe improvement may be to query the current channel status from the counterparty to improve issues related to restoring from backups.",

If you don't turn it back on till today you have to catch up on a weeks worth of blocks and that can take a couple of hours depending on your hardware. If you are using a wallet like Electrum anyway that connects to their servers then running lightning through them or blue wallet or any of the other LN wallet providers is just as simple.-Dave",

      "body": "There's a handful of custodial Lightning Network wallets such as Wallet of Satoshi and Bluewallet that allow sending and receiving payments via Lightning Networks without the need of running your own node. I guess that's what most users will go for and for the smallish payments that LN is aiming for using a custodial wallet should be fine for the most part.If you plan on using LN \"properly\" the complexity of running your own node can be reduced by not running a routing node. If you're just looking for a self-hosted gateway for the LN wallet of your choice opening a channel to the node you're planning to transact with the most (e.g. a merchant or exchange) is sufficient and you won't have to bother with keeping the channels balanced etc. (especially if you keep the channels private). Under that scenario it should also be fine if your node is not online 24/7 as long as it comes online at least once a day or so as to make sure that no shenanigans is happening.Quote from: PrimeNumber7 on June 18, 2022, 11:10:27 AMOne failsafe improvement may be to query the current channel status from the counterparty to improve issues related to restoring from backups.The LND implementation already has had this for quite a while in the form of Static Channel Backups:https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tutorials/troubleshooting/static-channel-backups",

      "body": "Running a bitcoin node versus running a bitcoin node with a lightning node differs, indeed, in difficulty, because, besides setups, you also have to be aware of re-balancing your channels often, being online at all times, creating new channels etc. However, I think we need to settle down how much willing a \"simple user\" is, and should be, during their involvement with bitcoin. For example, I don't believe a \"simple user\" is willing to devote a part of their disk space and RAM for syncing the chain or for buying extra hardware, let alone to run their own lightning node. But, that's their loss. If they don't like trusting an SPV server, the tutorials, papers, github pages, internet boards are there to help them achieve it, whenever they decide to. You gain financial sovereignty when you have, disciplinedly, taken the time to study the subject. Just knowing what bitcoin is said it offers makes you a potentially financial sovereign. But, you gain this individual consciousness only if you do study it. Now, when it comes to Lightning, a \"simple user\" has two options;Losing custody of their money, but being able to use Lightning in a simple manner. (e.g., BlueWallet, Phoenix etc.)Deciding to study what's the Lightning Network and act accordingly to their benefits.It's obvious that the latter is a difficult thing to do, objectively. But, that's how it goes. Simplicity, custody, efficiency; pick 2. Maybe there's some better network-proposal in the future, but currently that's what we have.",

But the downsides you list is what is to be expected if you 'are your own bank' and do not delegate such duties to an institution like a bank. Sure, that's going to be less hassle and less work for you, but you'll have no financial independence and financial freedom like you have when 'doing everything yourself'. That's essentially the price we pay for our freedom. A little less convenience and a bit of time and money for set up and maintenance.Quote from: vfCM on June 18, 2022, 06:58:38 AMThe point of the Lightning Network is to fully realize the peer-to-peer cash vision of Bitcoin.

They definitely impede high-frequency, especially small, transfers much less than when using the blockchain directly. Because these are things that are actually only possible in Lightning. You can actually donate to podcasters minute by minute using Breez, for example. The same could be possible through a browser extension donating to a YouTube creator by the minute or by the second. Or on a new platform, like maybe https://bitcointv.com/, which is part of the federated, distributed network called Fediverse[url=http://.

If you're saying using a SPV on-chain wallet is easier than a comparable Lightning wallet, I may agree. But most people don't run Bitcoin Core; the same way they won't run a real routing, always-online, Lightning node.Quote from: vfCM on June 18, 2022, 06:58:38 AMAnd making it easy to integrate directly into other software, such that the Lightning Protocol is largely abstracted away from users?Abstracted / integrated into software already kind of exists; in BTCPayServer.

I'd add to that: Breez is probably the same. Last I checked, by default it only opens channels to the Breez node; the idea is that they have much less incentive to cheat on you than the other way round, especially since they usually deposit more into the channel you have with them than you do and they have a reputation at stake.What I like about Breez is that it's trivially simple to use raw lnd commands through the 'developer' menu to (force) close all channels and move your balance, for example. I've not yet come across another mobile application that has this feature and in my mind, it massively reduces trust in terms of being able to access your funds at any time on-chain through manual channel closes.Quote from: NotATether on June 20, 2022, 11:23:07 AMQuote from: tromp on June 19, 2022, 07:12:25 AMIt's worth mentioning that the BIP equivalent for lightning is BOLT: https://github.com/lightning/boltsGood, so that's one problem already solved.

It can be speculated if they truly believe it's bad / unnecessary / insecure (whatever) or if it's a political decision, but if one company can just put in a 'veto' this easily, it shows me BOLT is worse than BIP.",
