  "content": "Nigeria, a blessed country. A country highly blessed with natural resources. I keep wondering why our leaders are not trying to do things right.People are really suffering. There is increase in everything. Is say it again everything. What make things more hard is the fuel subsidy removal which has caused an increase in cost of transportation. Although, the feredal Government has planned to give N8000 to over 12 million low-income earners to help cushion the effect of this subsidy removal.How good is this plan to the masses? Will this money truly be circulated to the masses or later been embezzled? Remember $800m has been borrowed for this purpose. This is a very huge amount of money. Is there any needs for us to borrow money from world bank again with the present situation of the country? And if we do, is this the best thing to do with this huge amount of money?I will accept this is the best if the questions below can be correctly answered:ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Is this the true solution to our problems?ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Can #8000 be enough to feed a household monthly with the present inflation in Nigeria?ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰Do we have database in Nigeria that can help to identify the poor or the rich?ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰How will they get to know the poor household?ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰If they decide to send this money through our bank, how many poor and aged people have account in bank?Atlast, this money will still be embezzled. How many of us received COVID 19 relieve fund? Few, even mostly in the north. Almost all was diverted into their purse. I thought this money should be used to develop our infrastructural, education, health sector and to build industries around every part of the country so that our youths can get employment.",
