  "content": "The US throws US money into Ukraine, while American people don't get help from American natural disasters... in this case Hurricane Ian.Throwing Good Money After BadQuote from: https://www.lewrockwell.com/2022/10/ron-paul/throwing-good-money-after-bad/It's scathing because for seven months, Congress has shipped the American people's money, some $65 billion (and counting), to Ukraine – money that could have gone to disaster relief or even (perish the thought!) returned to taxpayers.In July, after four months of support for Ukraine and when the total was \"only\" $54 BILLION, that figure accounted for more than what U.S. taxpayers paid for the first five years of the Afghan conflict.Just last week, when Congress passed its Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded through mid-December, they included $12 BILLION in new aid to Ukraine.So as The Fed recklessly prints more and more money, I have to ask:What has this $65 billion gotten us – and when will it end?Never since the Cold War have we been so close to nuclear war. The thought is terrifying.This is a conflict that could make Iraq and Afghanistan pale in comparison. Unlike those countries, Russia has an enormous military and a nuclear arsenal. Their allies are not insignificant, either.Whatever hope for peace there was in the early months of the conflict has been eclipsed by months of escalation, with no end in sight....",

But if they read it and the places on the Internet that talk about it, they won't believe it, but they certainly won't do anything about it. They will continue to give their labor to the banks, allowing the banks to support wars and anything else the banks want to support... indirectly, of course, through the Federal Reserve Bank.",

The American people are having relief as well as fulfilling its promises made to an ally(Ukraine).  - I Partially agree with you. After all, take a look at the article in the OP. Right near the top of the article is this:Before Ian reached the coastal city of Florida, the president has already declared a state of emergency thereby activating federal funds for the state.  - So, certainly Biden would have sent aid to Florida.I think you’re just mad that the US is fulfilling it’s obligations and promises it made and aiding Ukrainians in its quest to defend and repel the invaders. Just because you don't know things like:- The US financed the Bolshevik Revolution. But Russia turned against the US long before today, recognizing the corruption in the US systems that set her in place.- Russia is essentially the people who put down the German tyranny of WW2.- By 2014 the US (CIA) had done a coup against the Ukraine elected government, replacing Ukraine's government with the thing that turned into Zelensky's government of today.- Russian-Ukrainian families had been living together in a rather peaceful (if strained) co-existence before 2014, in the regions Russia has take over.- It was the US coup government in Ukraine that started harming both Russians and Ukrainians way back in and before 2014.- It's the US coup-installed government that asked the US for help... like the US asking the US for help.Study up and see that things aren't as cut and dried as something like \"Ukraine good, Russia bad.\"",
