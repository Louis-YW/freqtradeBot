  "content": "According to the story, a man collapsed after he lost $400(the equivalent 200k in my local currency) loan at a betting shop called Bet9ja. This money was borrowed from loan shark operators for pay for his house rent however. The man thought that he may be able to double it he took it to a betting shop. Sadly, he lost all the money to a virtual game. Now, he is mostly likely going to be kicked out of his apartment and wind up homeless on the street. The football season starts today. Many folks who gamble see it as an opportunity to cash out or double their money. This is a great caution to never take out a loan to gamble and another way of saying this is never gamble with money you cannot afford to lose. Lastly, I believe we have a moral obligation, not to introduce any friend and family to gambling matter how much we may have won in the past or think we will win this season.

And this man didn't understand that and so now he has 2 problems, how to pay those loan sharks because for sure he will get a beating from them if he don't pay, and then probably homeless by now. Another stupid move by a individual and more likely he will continue to gamble as it seems that he is already addicted.",

In reality they're all just basically donating their money to the rich people that run the casinos.Behind all the bells and whistles of the casinos there's the cold hard math fact that in the long run the house always wins.",

      "body": "But why did he have to gamble with all, if he wanted to gamble so badly and was so sure he could double the money, why not split the money into two parts, one part greater in ratio than the other and use the lesser part to gamble seeing that he's already a problem gambler. In my analysis he is first a silly individual, and allowing himself to be a problem gambler without accepting it and wanting to change has made him more sillier. I doubt he will be without a roof over his head, even if he has to squat with someone for a while or make some payment to retain his accomodation...but this experience I really hope will serve as a lesson to him to make better decisions next time. If he doesn't, he collapsed today maybe tomorrow if he continues, he may have a heart attack, slump and just die.",

      "body": "I would never understand how people living from paycheck to paycheck and are on the brink of being homeless still think of using their last money to gamble. The chances of losing that money is extremely higher than doubling it. People should stop relying everything on luck and start doing things to turn their lives around. Nothing wrong with gambling if you can support your life without having to get a loan. Then again, the delusions of the poor and their greed would always get to them and that, IMO, is something that can't be fixed.",

      "body": "One thing gamblers fail to know is that gambling involves taking from an unlucky bettor to pay a lucky one. Risking a loan taken for a specific purpose on bet is a risk that isn't worthy to take. And risking all $400 wasn't a good idea as well. And the sad story is gamblers keep falling into this over again making the gambling industry the most profitable amongst other industries. I feel many will still engage their greed in gambling so for now this has become a norm",

I just commented on a thread about not taking a loan to bet on an insider tip so this is the scenario if you gamble and the money comes from a loan, the sad part of this topic is, that it is coming from a loan shark, we all know how loan coming from loan shark generate interest if you fail to pay on time this is a big lesson for him and people should learn from this sad experience that only gamble excess moneyQuoteThe football season starts today.

You can share your thoughts.Unfortunately, advice or reading stories coming from people's experiences are not sufficient, for gambler's alibis are, it's not going to happen to them or they know what they are doing, for a loan shark they always on a look for people who are addicted to gambling because they are willing victim.",

Another stupid move by a individual and more likely he will continue to gamble as it seems that he is already addicted.I am currently reading The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. There is one interesting episode in the book. Musketeers have very little money. Athos, Portos and Aramis give all their money to D'Artagnan and send him to play in a casino (gambling house). At the same time, Athos says that D'Artagnan will definitely win at dice, since he has a \"light hand\". However, only in fictional novels do such stories end well... In fact, according to the mathematical theory of probability, losing in games of chance based on luck is more likely than winning. All the more crazy to play with credit money.",

Getting kicked out of your house and homeless on the street is the worse that can happen to anybody but he cannot blame anybody but himself, I'm sure he already knows that we should only gamble money that we cannot afford to lose, I wonder why he takes the risk and did not think of the consequences, this is what happens if you want to take on risk and don't want think of the consequences, I hope his relatives will still help him based on the picture he seems to regret what happened to him, you seldom think of the consequences until it happens to youQuote. Lastly, I believe we have a moral obligation, not to introduce any friend and family to gambling matter how much we may have won in the past or think we will win this season. You can share your thoughts.Unfortunately with the internet and ads online it's hard to stop them from learning about gambling, but once you discovered that your relatives are into it, we need to guide them and advise them on the harmful effect of irresponsible gambling.",

It's probably like 20% or more than maybe he was just give 2 weeks to pay for it. And now that he gambles everything, then his problems multiply as well.Again, dumb decision because he didn't know to prioritize things. Or maybe he was really addicted already that's why he is willing to take a loan to disguise as payment but at the back of him mind, he is thinking that once he got the money, he will gamble it right away.",

Gambling is a strong force that always control an individual to only see possibility of winning but not for winning. As soon that you make the money out for bet, the money is no longer yours and you stand only in between to recover it above what it was or to lose in entirely. For the gambler who borrowed money to try his luck to multiply it against paying his rent, it is unfortunate that he may suffer the consequence of taking the risk of luck",

The guy seems from a country which money is very hard to earn, Loaning on whale shark and lost it all on betting will surely give you a distress because that money is very huge in his country. Although I’m just concern about the source because it’s from a social media post and video looks like a meme but focusing in the lesson of this kind of story, Gambling is already risky but involving loan sharks as source of money will just  worsen the risk involved because there interest is insane and huge than the house edge.The player is already in lose the moment he get that money from the loan shark.",

In few months the interest would be greater than the loan and they would get him arrested if he fails to service or pay the loan.

I want to add that we should not also use income that have been budgeted for our basic needs, especially those that have defendants.
