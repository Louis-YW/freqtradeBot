  "content": "Hi,I have read about collateral etc. I currently have nothing in the way of Altcoin, cryptocurrency to offer as collateral but I do have a few of my own virtual bank accounts (N26, OPENBANK) with good balances registered in Spain where I have residency. The reason I need the Btc is to deposit to my trading broker (Fxchoice). I am a citizen of Barbados and our deposit methods are very limited to that platform. The very few options they have do take a lot in the way of fees which makes it quite pointless. With Btc, the fees are minimal and you get a bonus added to your account. If anyone can somehow facilitate a loan with alternative collateral arrangements based on what I have described above please let me know. I will be able to return your Btc within 7 days with 5 to 10% interest.",

I would also be willing to buy Btc at market value if anyone is open to that. Definitely need escrow service for this however.",

In your situation, I believe the best option would be to directly purchase Bitcoin with fiat currency. I recommend checking out the Currency Exchange section of the forum. There may be trusted forum members who can facilitate such trades for you. Additionally, you can try using platforms like BestChange to find exchanges that accept your preferred payment method for purchasing Bitcoin.",

      "body": "The story sounds a bit strange. If you have N26 you can use a DEX to buy bitcoin, which will be easier than on the forum, because as you have been told without collateral, without being very active and without participating in signature campaigns nobody will give it to you. What you are suggesting about a bank transfer with escrow could be possible, but it involves KYC with whom you transact and it is not very popular here. It is something similar to a DEX, so while you wait for someone to show up here, I would look at the other option as well.The other option has also been mentioned to you, to try to meet in person, in Spain, but it seems that you are not very keen.",

Anyway, skepticism was unwarranted. Have a good day all.No one doubts you and we have answered you all according to your story. Someone asking for additional details does not necessarily mean that there is doubt about your story or your intentions. In addition, you did not provide verification of your status in Spain because everyone assumed that you were a Spanish citizen or at least a permanent resident there.Most of us suggest that you use one of the peer-to-peer platforms, and I think that you have actually found what you are looking for there without even needing to update here or explain to anyone. I don't understand why you came back six months after the date the op was published to explain that you are not a scammer when no one has explicitly accused you of that.For everything, we thank you for your patience and express our satisfaction after you were able to find the ideal solution for you.",
