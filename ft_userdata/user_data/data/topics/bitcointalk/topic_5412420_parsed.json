I'm drawing 1000watt so what's the best stabilizer I can use if I can....I think if you are referring to an UPS that has also built in function of stabilizing tension then Eaton is one of the best brands but unfortunately for that 1000 watt of your rig is extremely expensive,it costs like 1000 EUR if you want online UPS that soothes everything by itself or if you just want your rig to not suffer the hits from the fluctuating power grid then you can get and 1200 watt UPS of Eaton not online one at just 250 Eur and as I said it is one of the best brands.In the factory where I work the main PLC(Programmable Logic Controller) the heart and core of our production environment is backed up by that 1000 Eur UPS with about 1400 watt power.",

      "body": "If your power is this unstable I wouldn’t mine at all. Because you will end up frying all your equipment. So if you are heavy invested I would be careful because all it will take is one voltage browning moment where voltages halve and all your capacitors are going to blow up due to huge current spikes. Most PSU won’t be able to provide enough protection from them.If your GPUs are old then I would just keep mining but not on newer equipment.",

      "body": "Have you tried asking your electricity provider about this? If this is temporary I'd stop mining as suggested above, but if the stability is always like this maybe moving your place or changing your provider would be your best solution, albeit overkill just for the purpose of doing some mining.

I'm drawing 1000watt so what's the best stabilizer I can use if I can....An electric kettle or iron does not need a stabilizer, because they will work at low voltage, only the heating process will be longer.I have 220 volts in the network, but there are jumps when the voltage drops to 180 volts and a little lower. A long mining experience in the village has shown that ATX power supplies from well-known manufacturers such as Corsair can easily cope with this task.If your voltage fluctuates between 100-220 volts, then this is illegal, and your electricity supplier must deal with this problem.",

Not worth the risk.Going between 100 Volts and 200 Volts is not going to happen. Typically what happens is you get something like 90V. And like you said. Most light bulbs or stoves won't be affected but sensitive electronics will be. 90V is worse because it'll cause the current to increase to make up for it. If its over voltage like 140V then most PSUs will quickly shut down.",

I think that when the voltage is reduced, the efficiency of the power supply will decrease and the heat will increase, but the problem of low voltage should be solved.",

A stabilizer primarily functions to keep the power going into an equipment stable to prevent electrical damage to them. Your number one goal is to protect your equipment life, hence since you are already thinking in the right direction which is to acquire an appropriate stabilizer, I support that you should for the time being suspend all mining operations until you can get the stabilizer, so your equipment will not be incurring little damages that will later amount to much. Even if the power grid is fixed, the stabilizer should still be a priority.",
