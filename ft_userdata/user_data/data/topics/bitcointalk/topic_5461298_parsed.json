And from my understanding the write up looks like a cheap Nigerian scammer as I believe Elon Musk himself can't just go pm someone in the way without any sign to show. That's to say he can't write in that way as he is not a mad and a naughty writer who does things for a joke. But however, I might be wrong with my thinking as anything is possible if he could buy off twitter what more X.Maybe he wanna buy X who knows if he planned  this to launch a crypto exchange.",

I have been seeing tweets regarding this but I was not sure if it was true. However, you made a good point here about users not actually owning their usernames and can be taken away by the platform whenever they want. If it is true that Elon offered those things to the recent username owner then I think it was pretty generous of him and based on the previous owner's tweet it seems like he expected it to happen the moment X was announced.",

Xtraordinary ain't it? Yeah, this is dead serious. Elon Musk did posted and same goes with Linda Yaccarino who's teaming up the X' squads on how they'll be teaming up to launch the futuriXtic X. Believe me, I bash Elon Musk a whole lot for so much experiments done with/ on Twitter.Rules are meant to be broken and the upgrade or update of this X shit would be for the betterment and growth of the Twitter App.69.42 Mill...ion! Holy Cow! That's woof. Godspeed to him, he better diversifies and not spend on hooker's. You really should care because this is the richest man on earth making improvements on the App used by big organizations and big handle's likewise government. It would definitely control the markets. LolWhatever Musk has done despite all the critics he gets has always been for solving and improving human beings even though he gets self centered. Change is something people don't take easily, let's be open to see what Elon Musk has for us. He's no villain, ten times better than FTX owner wanting to escape prison.",

It’s hard to see how scams are easy to perform these days. The user with X username must have felt the same way as we did at first glance of reading the post. Though users are very careful these days and it seems he does have many followers so must be some sort of publisher or otherwise public figure to get it. He would definitely check the authenticity already.",

Owner of @x account got zero dollars for it, which seems like an abusive move from elon. Imagine building your twitter account 16 years and then comes a billionaire and just takes it, and gives you nothing for it. But it doesn't surprise me at all, that's elon for you. How would you feel about the twitter after that? And yes i keep calling it a twitter and tweets tweets. Priivate Message you are referring to came from a parody account pretending to be elon. Why would he pay if he can just take stuff?",

Also OP he never paid the guy who owns the @x tag on twitter and just forcefully took the tag from him without any notification, which in my culture is collectively known as a massive \"dick move\". The screenshot you gave us is a parody account on twitter that's trying to impersonate him cause he's a stupid clown that shot his own foot with the verification badge bs and now everyone can impersonate someone they wanted.",
