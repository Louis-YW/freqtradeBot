      "body": "Heya Kryptowerk, they started doing this shortly. I like the idea of Raffles for expensive collectibles cause everybody gets a chance to win for a fraction of the price that these pieces sell normally. The amount of Tickets is infinite & the market decides fairly. I hope to see more Raffles of valuable collectibles on Scarce City...will there be Cas coins in the future? I like the idea...all the best KW & have a nice weeküòâQuote from: Kryptowerk on October 11, 2023, 01:26:42 AMQuote from: Humble Bitcoiners on October 10, 2023, 05:57:04 PMA beautiful piece of Bitcoin history is up for Raffle on Scarce City.
