We should face the losses to learn the market, by fearing and not giving a chance we can't learn anything, you want to learn, run a node, test wallets, platforms providing services to btc holders, it's not always about profit.",

      "body": "In short, Bitcoin isn't for everybody. The problem is that there are so many people who jump right into it without doing a quick due diligence. Especially during a bull run when Bitcoin is all over the news highlighting its price increase, many start buying without understanding anything. One thing you're missing, however, is the responsibility that accompanies a Bitcoin investment. To invest in Bitcoin is to be your own bank. That requires you to at least understand how keeping Bitcoin is properly done. If you don't want to spend time and effort understanding wallets and private keys and whatnot, Bitcoin is also not for you.",

This is the important thing I think because without they learn, they will not know what they need to do. They will not accept when their money value reduce because of the price is down, they are panic and difficult to manage their emotion, they can't hodl for one or two cycle, etc.If they want to search for a short term profit, they must learn about trading so they can trade without a problem. But they must know that the market is unstable. Those who lack knowledge of Bitcoin investment better not to try to invest in Bitcoin.",

There are simple rules that objectively help people and should be followed in the following order:1. repay your short-term debts.2. build an emergency fund. The size of the \"emergency fund\" is completely subjective and depends on the individual's financial status (expenses, salary, personal life etc). 3. have a plan to repay your long-term debts.4. investSome tips:(a) you can use other types of bank accounts for the emergency fund, where you gain at least 1% so that you can deal (partly) with the inflation.(b) the emergency fund can be used freely, don't stack money in there just to stack them. Just put an upper threshold and when you are lower than that, refill it.(c) if you can't put aside more than 1% of your salary in the emergency fund until you fill it, then just put 1%. Don't ignore it, because even a car's flat-tire, or a small house emergency will require you to use credit that you haven't planned to use.Quote from: Joy- maker on March 19, 2025, 01:00:30 AMKnowledge and understanding are also essential in bitcoin investment, so those who lack knowledge and understand about bitcoin investment should just avoid it, because if they invest in bitcoin with ignorance sorry is their name.Yes, it's very important, but considering that most people keep their money in exchanges, I can safely guess that in fact the opposite happens.",

There will be people that will disagree and that you can invest little by little, they are right but I'd rather get out of poverty first and as quick as possible rather than stay there just so I have some monthly savings for a future that is still uncertain given that I'm still impoverished.I mostly agree with what @Cypherpunkz said but I'm not sold on the 4th one, you can invest in bitcoin in the short-term if your goal is also short-term, that's how some people get profits all the time, they invest and wait a little and then get it out when they're in profit, not really a big deal but I think that those people do deserve to invest especially if they're making money out of short-term investments.",

As long as you can meet your daily needs, have a reasonable spending plan and have money to invest in bitcoin, then invest as soon as possible. If someone says they want to be financially stable before planning to invest, I think they will never invest in bitcoin. Because we don't have financial stability, so we have to try harder every day, work hard and invest...and the purpose of all of that is to have financial stability and become rich.QuoteA lot of people dive into Bitcoin thinking they’ll get quick profits but they end up panic-selling when the market dips.

You are more likely to get scared and sell at a loss than you are to hold and wait for a more favorable outcome.It's not true that bitcoin doesn't yield short-term profits. A few weeks ago, BTC's value rose by $10,000 in a day, only to fall by as much the next day. That's a decent daily gain. I don't agree that unknowledgeable people should trade crypto. It's a disaster waiting to happen. Check out What Can Happen If You Want to Trade Cryptocurrencies, but You Don’t Know How? if you are interested.
