If you are going to convert around 1/6th of your monthly income to bitcoin, it'll represent a big part of your funds, and it might be a good idear to keep it as safe as humanly possible.you'll need this (official) electrum document to set this up: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlI'd also suggest to test non-\"default\" setups with tBTC before actually using it on the main chain, that way you can make sure you know how everything works",

Because by saying best time to buy Bitcoin, you are trying to find bottom price, timing the market. It is not how a person is using DCA think about the market and his investment plan.Back to your $50 monthly DCA fund, you will have to do like 3 to 4 rounds of DCA before withdraw your bitcoin from an exchange account to your non custodial wallet. Withdraw your coin to your wallet when you see withdrawal fee is good enough for you.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

Since you don't have much experience in investing till now, you need to take some more time before investing and learn well. If you are random at the moment, don't participate in the investment but get yourself together and invest later. If you are earning $300 a month from your job, I'd say that's a good salary for you. If you save $50 from here, and spend the rest on your family or personal things, your daily life will be well served. Invest BTC in the fund when you have enough money to buy your bitcoins, it will be the best decision for you. There is no golden opportunity to buy bitcoin, rather you can buy bitcoin from any market from anywhere for long time investment. By buying bitcoins you must hold for a long period of time only then you can become rich, moreover you should always keep in mind that you will not get much profit after buying bitcoins. Anyway, since you have taken a great step, I hope you get this done soon. Also, when you invest you must use a secure wallet, you can use Electrum Bitcoin Wallet it will provide you maximum security.",

You will try by all means to reduce your spending in the coming months and invest in Bitcoin, but if there was a way to invest once and then start paying later, it would be better because within less than 5 months to 7 months, the price of Bitcoin will be between 40k to 60k, which is almost a double increase, and there may not be enough time for assembly.We cannot advise you much because we do not know the circumstances of your country and the savings allowance, but create an airgapped machine and keep several copies of the seeds (one of which is metal).",

By reading those threads you can lean a lot and it will groom you as well in the cryptocurrency field. I am sharing a thread where a lot of users is discussing about bitcoin accumulation and the DCA technique. Buy the DIP, and HODL!  I would suggest you if you are a newbie in the field of cryptocurrency start it doing from Bitcoin Accumulation while using the DCA Technique then do DYOR which is also good for you to understand market sentiments. Investing in other shit coins is not good for you at the start I'm sharing the meme which i designed it on my own from this you can take an idea of how actually be happen to you while investing in other shitcoins instead of Bitcoin",

Take note as well that despite the fact that electrum is a well reviewed open source wallet, it isn't secure by default, you have to store your seed phrase well and have more than one backup of it, if you use your Electrum wallet online, it can be compromised, and if you also lose your seed phrase, your wallet will be compromised. If you continue with your dca plan and your funds get bigger, use Electrum on an airgapped device or buy a hardware wallet for better security.",

Electrum, airgap devices, or hardware wallets, none of them are absolutely secure, the safety of our bitcoins will largely depend on ourselves. Before owning a hardware wallet, I used Electrum for many years and I never encountered any attacks or problems with it. In my opinion, it all depends on us, we don't need to make things more complicated. And I also want to confess something, I still prefer using Electrum over hardware wallets, maybe because my habits haven't changed yet  .",

And I also want to confess something, I still prefer using Electrum over hardware wallets, maybe because my habits haven't changed yet  .Probably because you choose too much comfort than the little hassle with hardware wallets. But electrum can be equal to hardware wallets if they are properly airgapped and never comes online. The seed getting exposed to the internet is the major advantage the offline wallets like Hardware wallets have over the online ones like electrum so airgapping it and just having it on a phone as watch only wallet breaks that barrier. Just like you also said the importance of securing your seeds or keys should not be over emphasized, while doing so one shouldn’t use to many ways of securing it and causing redundancy or getting it complicated like the colorful seeds does Quote from: kryptqnick on October 05, 2023, 12:50:41 PMI don't know where you live and what kind of finances are required there, but in general, $100 for monthly expenses isn't enough for anything, even for a developing country and even if you don't have to pay the rent...

Also, in that case, I don't think you need $100 per month for emergencies.It definitely depends on the country, the $100 is almost like 3x the minimum wage workers of some countries earn, so that should at least cover a little and if not he can just fall back to the other $50. The $50 is just like 17% of his monthly earnings and that’s not bad but as said he should be obliged to buy every month with that amount, there are months that OP can reduce it or months that he can go above that amount. It just depends on the amount he thinks he do away with that month.",

Of course, in order to save on that fee, it does not make sense for him to make individual withdrawals for such small amounts, so he will have to take a certain risk and keep what he buys on the exchange.The alternative would be to try to buy BTC on one of the decentralized exchanges, which might be the next move when he understands a little better how things work.",

Many people get discouraged by the price and think it's better to buy a coin where you can get x number of \"full\" coins, instead of buying 0.001 BTC, but it's a wrong assumption. $50 allocated into any cryptocurrency is still $50, no matter if they'll give you 0.1, 1, or 100 coins for that. The only difference is that with bitcoin your funds are safe, as long as you hold the keys. With altcoins you can even see 99% loss, while for bitcoin a 10% move is a large one.
