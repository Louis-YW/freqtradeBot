  "content": "As we see, things aren't going well for Changpeng Zhao and more likely for Binance too, especially when it's becoming very clear that they are into very shady things: Binance employees are helping users in China to bypass KYC, directly violated U.S. derivatives laws, manipulates with trading volume and probably manipulates with Futures Trading too. Decentralized exchanges are good alternatives if someone wants to feel safe and secure and in control of their funds but they lack a lot of features compared to centralized ones. For example, Binance has features like: Futures trading, options, leveraged tokens, swap farming, DeFi Stacking, Liquidity Farming, Launchpad and so on. These features attract a lot of users but p2p exchanges lack them. So, there are people who choose centralized exchanges because of that.So, my question is, if Binance goes down, which centralized bitcoin exchange are you going to use? Personally, I think that Coinbase will become more popular because it's number two exchange by popularity at the moment and what makes it more attractive compared to Binance is that it's the San Francisco-based company, has been in business since 2012.",

      "body": "Answer? No centralized exchange. Operate by using Peer to Peer solutions for your bitcoin <-> fiat needs and use decentralized exchanges or no-kyc swapping utilities (if decentralized exchanges are not available) when you are on-chain. This way, you do not have to trust a third party with your blockchain usage data as well as your personal data and your risks of being exposed to potential pitfalls that come with using centralized exchanges as minimized. If you are looking for peer to peer or privacy friendly options, I can recommend AgoraDesk for a local-bitcoins style marketplace and kycnot.me for tools that can be used to maintain privacy within the Bitcoin ecosystem and beyond. Some fantastic decentralized web3 tools exist on various layer 2 (arbitrum, optimism, polygon, etc.) for perpetual/margin trading if you will miss these features on the centralized exchange that you are currently using.",

I use Kucoin for no KYC, I also use OKX and Huobi global. If no Binance again, I will add another exchange which most likely not Coinbase.

I don't think Coinbase will be able to be the #1. Any other centralized exchange like Kucoin will take over the place in case Binance gets down.I don't like Binance for a lot of reasons, I don't like centralized exchanges for the same reason almost but you know we don't have a way to ignore them especially when you are in a country where no ATM is there for crypto. We have to go through centralized exchanges many times though personally, I'm trying my best to minimize it at best. Well, if I had to pick a centralized exchange, Kucoin would be my pick.",

(...)I've highlighted great suggestions that I also support from BenCodie. Solutions such as Bisq[1], RoboSats[2][3] and AgoraDesk[4] are probably some of the most popular (at least from the replies that I every often see here in the forum), but as BenCodie pointed out you can check out more in the website that he listed. Do note that considering that you're increasing your privacy (as in not providing KYC and other information to a central entity) you'll likely find a premium price in the BTC that's being traded in those platforms. For instance, as of now, the current BTC price is $28,110 USD[5] where in Bisq the value is sitting at ~ $28,701 USD[6] (2% increase). Due to the nature of the platform you'll likely encounter sellers that impose a higher %, but from what I've seen that is more often than not related to the quantity you are purchasing (the bigger the smaller the % of the premium), which is understandable.To me this percentage means nothing as I consider my data, and therefore my privacy, way more important than the previous price difference. I do reckon, however, that most people simply do not care about this and as long as there exists a platform easy to access and to trade fiat<->BTC, they'll most likely go for that (the average John Doe at least...).[1]https://bisq.network/[2]https://learn.robosats.com/docs/access/[3-TOR]robosats6tkf3eva7x2voqso3a5wcorsnw34jveyxfqi2fu7oyheasid.onion[4]https://agoradesk.com/[5]http://preev.com/[6]https://bisq.markets/",

My next choice after Kucoin would be Coinbase, I have heard people speak decently about it but yet I still haven't used it, but if anything should go sideways with both Binance and Kucoin, I might consider giving it a chance.",

And I replaced it with the Kucoin platform, which is considered one of the few reliable platforms that support my country, since I cannot use all known platforms, including those licensed in USA. Kucoin is friendly use and contains a range of features similar to Binance although i am not a trader myself.Worth to mention that one of the best alternatives is Coinbase. It's a cryptocurrency exchange that is fully regulated in the USA. Coinbase has been operational since 2012 and has gained a reputation for its security and ease of use. Another alternative is Kraken, which is also fully licensed and regulated in the USA. Kraken offers a wide range of cryptocurrencies and has a strong focus on security.",

A couple of weeks ago they started spamming me with \"Source of Wealth documents needed\" - I provided everything I had and after some time they backed off but then I got a warning because \"You have sent and received funds to/from gambling services which is prohibited as per our terms\". I searched through their ToS and they make no mention of gambling services, anywhere. When I pointed this out the reply I got was \"This is our terms, do not receive funds from any gambling services or you will be banned\".Alternatives are desperately needed, indeed. I guess they just got too big.",

Because Binance is mostly the best option they prefer to buy USDt before they can withdraw and buy Bitcoin through P2P, just as Little Mouse stated, some countries that don't have a Bitcoin ATM or any local Bitcoin P2P vendor will face some challenges. In as much as CEX is criticized because they are centralized and require KYC, in most countries the use of CEX makes it easier for them to buy bitcoin. I have been using Binance since I started my crypto journey. I have also used Huibe, and if Binance goes down, I will switch to Huibe, which is also a large CEX and opened in many countries.",
