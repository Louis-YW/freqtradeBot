You can do an RBF if you enabled RBF in the transaction before. or you could do some CPFP if you are simply moving it across your wallets or your receiver wishes to do it. It will take a long while before the transaction is dropped. If you are skeptical if it's RBF or not you can check by putting your transaction hash on the block chain explorer.I didn't suggest accelerators because they are way expensive.",

Bitcoin is not fiat replacement but an alternative.Quote from: New2024 on September 22, 2024, 08:49:41 PMThoughts? Ideas? Are my sentiments wrong? You can use lightning network for small amount of bitcoin. You can use Phoenix wallet for it which is very newbie friendly but it will require onchain fee to automatically open a channel for you.For the issueDownload Electrum and import your BIP39 seed phrase on Electrum. Check if you will see the coin has been dropped from mempool on the history tab. If you do not see the coin, go to network -> server settings to uncheck the sever from automatic and manually be selecting the server one by one and resynchronize the wallet each time you change the server. If you do not still the see coins, you may have to wait for 14 days and do it again. You will see it dropped from mempool by that time. But before you do that, is the transaction not supporting RBF? Which wallet? If we know the wallet, we can know if the wallet is having RBF. If the wallet is having RBF, you can use it to increase the fee by double spending the coin in a new transaction.Bitcoin is so much interesting than fiat. But fiat also makes bitcoin interesting.",

He said in another topic (created two months ago) that he is using bitcoin core.afaik, bitcoin core creates rbf transactions by default. So, all he has to do is to rbf the transaction to accelerate its confirmation.nc50lc already explained to him, in details, what he should do to accelerate the transaction or to cancel it. But it seems like OP didn’t read that reply or he just chose to wait for the transaction to get dropped from the mempool.",

It was never returned to me and it was never committed.It’s probably stuck in the mempool because the fee is just too low to be processed. Sid you use any exchange or wallet because they usually have the estimation for the ideal transaction fee for your transaction to go through. I know we want to pay as little as possible but we can’t avoid transaction fees no matter how mcuh we try otherwise we are just not gonna be able to use bitcoin. QuoteMakes me feel like this is not going to work for a business - to hope some developers will pick up the transaction and remove it from the blockchain and return the BTC; or to go ahead and push it through. Which also makes me wonder how will BTC ever replace a currency? Aside from bitcoin’s volatility, it’s undeniable that the high transaction fees are one of the things preventing everyone from using bitcoin every day. The transaction fees are too much just to make sure it goes through. What I want to correct you, though, is that bitcoin is not trying to replace a currency. It is not trying to be fiat. It is a currency of its own that we want to use for everyday transactions but it doesn’t mean we want it to fully replace fiat as that just seems impossible and unrealistic.",

Fortunately, now you can bump it to fee rate like 2 satoshi/vbyte and get a confirmation in a next block. If you want to be stingy, don't want to double your transaction fee, you can try to use fee rates less than 2 satoshi/vbyte but more than 1 satoshi/vbyte, for example 1.5 satoshi/vbyte.See mempools.https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightOpt-in RBF FAQ, What is it used for?",

Actually, it's pretty likely we will see an empty mempool in a few weeks.Fees this week dropped in the 1.75 sat/vb, the difficulty adjustment shows a -5% adjustment so we had 100 fewer blocks than normal and the whole mempool can now be cleaned with 92 blocks.With little incentive to spend as most just hold and the rune hype finally subsides unless anything major happens we might see 1sat/vb in a month or so, of course, if a new wave of jpg monkeys gets traction or something else we're back to 20sat/vb but in my opinion the trend is clearly pointing downwardsAnyhow OP is interested in the purpose as a currency not getting his transaction confirmed otherwise he would have put in practice all the counseling he got last month,  so at this point, all this help is unneeded.",

Which also makes me wonder how will BTC ever replace a currency? Thoughts? Ideas? Are my sentiments wrong? I completely understand the frustration. A lot of Bitcoin Puritans are not going to agree with me, but Bitcoin transactions are really expensive compared to the other payment processors available in the market. Paying 10% as transaction fee is not sustainable. Moreover the transaction is stuck as the network considered the fee is less than required. It is a serious problem of Bitcoin transactions. Generally if we would like to resolve an issue, we need to recognise the fact, that we have an issue. Unfortunately, Bitcoin Puritans are not ready to accept that.",
