Education is the key for survival not for success so don't get confused between both cause it is different and knowledge is powerful in my opinion.Unemployment is everywhere and lot of reasons are there why many doesn't have jobs but currently the fear of recession caused many companies including google, facebook, twitter, tesla, etc fired thousands of their employees to survive their winter. For us, we need to keep updating our skills so you won't be fired or can get a job in no time.",

If you're making a decent living and money, then be consistent on it and look at it if it will become stable someday. So when it does, you're free to do whatever you want in the future and that includes studying back again. We're in a different economy these days and many companies won't look for educational attainment as they only look at the skill and personality of their potential employee. I mean not all companies are like that and there are still those that depends on the educational attainment of their applicant. But as you've said, the situation there is different and you have to adapt with it.",

My point is with money you can get an education by the side but it is not a guarantee that getting educated brings money.",

      "body": "@OP, Both, in my opinion, should be archived. Education is not a guarantee of success because the world's most successful and powerful men did not become wealthy as a result of formal education. Some people have the zeal to gain all the educational certificates in the world, and they end up becoming professors in their discipline, but the richest man in the world today is not a professor. Most wealthy and powerful people are businessmen who are not illiterate in terms of education, but while pursuing formal education, they discover their own potential and what they want to become. There is a case of two medical doctors in my area; one is working in a government hospital, but the other person has his own hospital with up to five different branches.There are lots of people who want to acquire formal education so that after graduation they can be employed by a big company. There are also people who plan to be bosses of their own after graduation. It all depends on how you plan, but education is not a guarantee of success. However, education is necessary because, even if you are successful in business, you will do some things differently than an illiterate may be able to do.@OP, you said that in your country some graduates are not employed; would you also believe that some people don't know how to hunt for a job? When a white-collar job is not forthcoming, the individual must learn how to support themselves rather than stay at home. Learn a skill, do business, go freelance, etc.",

I don't want to be naive but the fact is money is always a major factor in that but on the other hand we also can't rule out education because of course when we have money but our knowledge is lacking then this will also be a problem.",

For me, education is the best thing in life.Â  With it comes knowledge, and we all know just like money, knowledge is power.Â  Power attracts power. In short, when a person is full of knowledge, he can create ideas and innovations that can bring him prosperity.Â  Aside from that, the system today often gives priority to those who have the degree or proof of knowledge on several areas.Â  Even in Entrepreneurship and businesses, successful people seek knowledge, they even reenroll in colleges, workshops, special education like seminars, and alike just to gain knowledge.Â  You can choose money but without knowledge of how to grow them, you will end up with nothing.Â  Ever heard of the news about lottery winners?Â  They have huge amounts of winnings but without financial literacy, they end up poorer than before they even won the jackpot.So between education and money, it is education for me, money can come after.",

Try to create a business plan or investment model for how this might occur. Maybe you can write an ebook you sell on amazon. Priced at $1. You can make $1 million dollars, if 1 million people purchase your book. Keep coming up with and executing plans, until you succeed. Learning from each experience. That seems to be what works for most people.Education I am not certain on. The diploma and certification can open the door to higher paying jobs with some majors. Unless there is a specific vocational skill one wishes to learn, I think university doesn't make much sense. Today with the advent of micro degrees which can be earned on sites like khan academy. It might be better for some to pursue ISO equivalent certs, which can be had quicker and more affordably. There are some micro degrees which can be earned for $50 within the span of a few weeks.",

Both is you ask me, and Op you should know that being educated doesn't really meaning going to school, you should try to differentiate between school and education and also recall that beware a child is registered in a school or any learning institution that child already knows something like for example a baby before being enrolled in a kindergarten that child already knows his/her name and its also able to identify some inject around him/her. So you see that child has been educated without even having to go to school. So also you can still have money and still be educated on a certain field you can just decide that I want to k ow more about a specific niche of science of your interest and just learn it while still being rich, and at the end you'll end up with both knowledge and wealth.",

Maybe their skills are poor, if so work on them.
