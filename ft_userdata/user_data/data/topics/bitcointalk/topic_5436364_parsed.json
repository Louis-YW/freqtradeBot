On the other hand, if they're like unexpected medical bills and stuff, then there's nothing you can do but to try to increase your income.As for being discouraged — if you don't budget, you're likely going to be in a far worse situation if you didn't budget.",

I believe dealing with the problem slowly before it come is the best way to counter it instead to wait for what’s coming and absorb it using your budget that didn’t prepared exactly to value of upcoming unknown expenses.",

If it's for emergency and the likes, you should already have a separate fund for that to begin with. If it's for other things, always weigh in if it's really worth going over your budget and indulging at it for a time then skimping on the necessities next. A lot of people have enough money to get by every payday and still have something to save, but the problem is most are easily tempted by the new deals that brands are always getting out there and they tend to spend more than what they should. Cut off from the indulgencies and focus on what's really importan and you'll be fine.",

      "body": "I think that the answer to such questions is not easy to give, because even though as people we share some habits and have certain needs, there are still greater or lesser differences resulting from the cultural-geographical factor. What is normal for me in everyday life is certainly not for someone else, and that means that our living expenses are also different.I will say that the only way to overcome such crises is that we must be ready to make difficult decisions. If this means that we have to give up visiting restaurants, cinemas and buying branded clothes, then we have to do it, no matter how hard it is. We put all the money we save aside and use it for exactly those unforeseen situations, thus avoiding them being a burden when they happen.Maybe for some who have very little income and live in bad conditions, even giving up a lot of things will not help, and in that case, as someone already mentioned, the only solution is to find an additional job or a job that pays better. If even that is not an option, moving to another location or even another country with better living conditions should always be one of the options.",

The first and actual unexpected expenses are healthcare expenses like you got an injury or even worse got any hospitalization or even Death. Generally your Insurance should cover these expenses, I generally suggest people to buy Insurances available with OPD benefit as well. So you are reimbursed for almost everything.( Obviously upto a limit but it generally is sufficient). Second expenses are like some of your appliance got broke or some other repair of something you use. I generally recommend you keep a buffer of 10% in your total budget always for such expenses because these will always come you can never stop them ever. If they still exceed in some case I suggest you withdraw some amount from emergency fund but make sure to replenish it in the month there is a saving. Other than these rest are definitely the unexpected expenses which can be avoided so it's best to avoid them if it's not possible fit them in category 2.",

So for example, if you want to buy food or household needs, you may not use the money you have prepared for unexpected expenses. Do that and save it every month and don't use it if you don't have any unexpected expenses. Try not to overspend in one category or another and stick to those rules so they don't get in the way of your monthly spending plan.",

Food prices going up is not something unexpected, everyone knows inflation was coming, and everyone knew that covid has destroyed all the logistic chains and affected manufacturing, inflation was the last on the list of \"unexpected\" things. Also, food prices are not unexpected, you shop for food every week at least, and you see the prices increase so if you think it over you plan your budget to contain a 10-2% rise next time, and you prepare for the worse.Plugging in your vacuum cleaner and blowing up all your fuses and damaging other devices plugged in also, that's an unexpected expense.",

Sorry to say, I am married and i have tried several ways to cut down unexpected expenses but the truth remains the same. As an african man I am, i would draw my monthly budgets and targets but it will still fall back that some unforeseen expenses would arose from nowhere and befall me. So i discovered a very nice trick to overcome it.First, what are your monthly budget at home or for yourself?For instance, if your budgets at home is $200 per month or week or day, depending on how you makes your spendings and plans. For me i make sure that i don't spend above $250 per month. So what I mostly does is that, since $250 is my max, I will only free up $150 and reserved $100. Although the $100 will be later spent but must serve me till first week of next month. Then lastly try to reduce much friends because it must calls for hanging out, all this are also from your personal pocket and spending.",

My advice to you is as follows:Socials: Most of the unexpected things come when you are socially active, you will be associated with more people (their behavior is unpredictable), which means that the probability of unexpected events will increase.Habits: Undisciplined people with habits are often more vulnerable to unexpected financial events.You pay people first: whether it's the government, rent, social services, and more.As for the solution, it is to stay away from people, isolate, pay bills at the last minute, and focus on investing, especially if you are young and do not have many responsibilities.",

If it's to do with inflation, it might be worth changing your perspective and waiting for when things become more stable before you try to grow your savings and investments as it'll likely become easier once prices are stabler.You could also invest or save in a way that'll make you forget about it. Maybe you're focusing too much on money that you're making yourself want to spend it too (a regular investment might prevent against this if you see your available balance in your account as lower before you even start to budget).",
