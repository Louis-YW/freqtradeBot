Congratulations to them.Throughout his tenure their manager David Moyes showed some of the class that made Manchester United select him as a successor to Ferguson. That job ultimately was too big for him but at West Ham United he found relative success and moderate consistency. This season was tough for them in the Premier League but they went all-out to win the Europa Conference League and Moyes played a huge part in that success by managing the team.",

Manchester United look like a team that has zero plans and zero formation therefore they will be in trouble all season long. As for Porto goalscorer Samu Omorodion, he was the player that could have been sold to Chelsea when Gallagher was sold to Atletico Madrid as part of the wider deal but he ended up at Porto and has shown what he is capable of.",

I couldn't count how many critical chances they wasted. This match could have ended in a horrible way for us at the same time. This is what Mourinho needs to work on.

At this stage what matters more than the style of winning has to be the three points. I did not see any games involving Fenerbahce but will try to watch the highlights just to give feedback. The new style of European games (Europa League and Champions League) seems more exciting that the previous generation of qualification by group table. The knockout draw might have some big games.Quote from: Patikno on November 29, 2024, 08:46:39 PMBesiktas & Nice made many devastating slips, not thinking that they could lose to a team that was not the favorite, even it was a defeat with a big score.

Maybe Manchester City and Real Madrid can turn it around and climb up the table. As for the Europa League, there were some unexpected results including Tottenham vs Roma but that is to be expected.",
