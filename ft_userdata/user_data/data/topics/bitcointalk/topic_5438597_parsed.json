I just want to if I  can be penalized for using an image gotten from twitter to create an entirely different work or thread here in the forum without making any reference to the original tweet that contains such pictureThe reason for this my question is just the fear i enquired when I stumbled upon a thread on meta where i see so many accounts have been banned and most of them are due to copying of original work without making reference to it @plagiarism. So i simply want to know if the same rules apply to image even when the topic its use is a totally different thread.",

You gave yourself the answer, leave a reference link where did you get the picture from, and you won't have a problem with plagiarism.again, it all depends on what kind of image it is and in what context you use it here. For example, if you share some of the well-known memes, you probably don't need to add references. But if you share someone's else technical analysis images and you present them as your own without reference, it can be considered abuse and plagiarism.",

It's unethical to copy someone else's work, be it a text, image, table or graph and present that as yours without any reference to the original author,  but it would likely not get you a ban.It is less straightforward to get the original source of an image or video, so it usually isn't checked on the forum. If you're still confused, then just reference where you got it from.",

I myself can't tell if uploading images from different source could become a plagiarism if we never put the original owner of that link/image but if I want to be sure I'll just have to put the sources below if that would bother them to know where it belongs. Perhaps, there's a different verdict to each plagiarism but just to be sure we just have to put the link and that's all there's no problem.But so far, I haven't seen someone getting banned from uploading images on a different source, maybe they just consider it lightly or they doesn't care at all?",

What an interesting topic link,  the forum really is a maze filled with enough knowledge but the issue is how to know your way around the maze inorder for you to gain such knowledges but am glad they are always seniors here to guide us on the right part for proper learning. I have gone through the link and its has really made me understand the whole concept of image content copyright violation and text content plagiarism. But just like you adviced a reference link to the image is not going to consume time so i think i will just input it to avoid such misunderstanding that took place in the above link.  Although just like nullius stated in the discussion that the whole issue was all due to grudges held between the two party involve @whitemanwhite @icopress .",

However, most users here don't go through those additional steps, and like the quote above generally users don't get punished for it. Nice to see you looking for clarity on it though, it's not a overly discussed thing. Most of the rules can be found in mprep's unofficial rules though, and there's quite a lot of discussion in that thread itself, delving deeper into each rule. That's usually the good to for most of the common sort of rules. Even if it's not against the rules per say or at least you won't get punished for it. Quoting the source of images that aren't memes is generally a nice thing to do. Especially, when it comes to original content. If it's memes, I mean they've been recycled so many times you wouldn't be able to find the source anyhow.",
