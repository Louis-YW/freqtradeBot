Mempool is moving from red bands to yellow bands which are less expensive for us.However I agree with you that we don't have reasons to move our bitcoins in these days and feed miners as well as the attacks on Bitcoin network. If many people do this, we can stop the attacks sooner and contribute to bring fee rates to new normality.",

It will not stop 100% all people to not get involved in BRC-20 tokens, but it obviously the traffic will decrease and it would make the hype over.Even an attack on the BRC-20 token won't actually work; have you forgotten that even with the high ETH fee back then, NFT worth millions of dollars were hijacked? What happened is that people just kept on moving their assets to a newer wallet, which they thought was more protective, keeping the network busy, and the fee still continues. I think the only solution here is that, whatever method those developers used in implementing BRC-20, validators should also look for a way to stop that from happening. If the BRC-20 tokens can be completely shut down, I think we will see back our old and regular fee as it used to be.",

People where not really expecting such to happen in the bitcoin blockchain .It doesn't affect traders. If you trade you have your money on a centralized exchange so you aren't touching the blockchain unless the rare time when you move between exchanges.Most people can delay their txs a few days no problem. Not many people use bitcoin for daily spending. And many people who do, do it by choice, and can also delay doing it for a few days. Of course there are always people who want to do a tx today and if they really badly want to do the tx today they will do it, but lots of people can delay without harm. The only real harm would be for perhaps those small areas in some third world countries who use bitcoin regularly (and aren't yet on LN) because they have to. Let's let them keep doing their transactions because they need to, while most other people can simply choose to wait a bit without any problems. For most people it won't matter if they make a transaction today or tomorrow or a week from now, and those people should volunteer to wait a few days. Heck the tx fees have already dropped from like $20-$30 yesterday to $6-$7 today so perhaps the worst part of the attack is already over.",

I know some businesses that are highly reliant on Bitcoin as a means of payment for imports. This will affect the business negatively. But for those that don't depend on bitcoin, there is no need to congest the Bitcoin network. This situation might also be designed by some forces to spread FUD. So we must do all we can to reduce the impact of their actions. This BRC-20 tokens hype will soon die down and the main pool will become free thereby leading to a drop in transaction fees. After all, this is not the first time such an attack is happening, bitcoin will surely overcome.",
