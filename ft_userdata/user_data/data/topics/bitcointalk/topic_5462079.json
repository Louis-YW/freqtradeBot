I did ask for a collateral loan, not a non-collateral loan, because I can't access my BTC at the moment, so I would send the collateral first and then I would get the BTC. and I would not get the collateral back before I send back the lending amount + interest, are you joking with me? How could I scam anyone with that?? You should think before you speak next time and giving out feedback.I lending out money to people on this forum, not scam people. I got a active loan to a user right now as we speak.If you think I am lying I can show you that I got the money. and you can also check this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445759.msg62587912#msg62587912Remove your feedback now please.",
