  "content": "I'm working on a Antminer T17 and this was a verified working board, but for whatever reason it stopped working. Using a STASIC hashboard tester, I isolated the issue to the first domain region. The LDO is measuring 3.2v, but should be 1.8. The other domains are measuring 1.8, but I'm unsure what's the cause of it because this is the FIRST domain and what comes before this? Pics below:https://prnt.sc/rmzqDEcmiOUs",

Also, check its resistance if it's shorted or has abnormal resistance.If I were you don't go directly to hardware better start to diagnose the issue through the miner's logs and it might be just a PIC program issue. Replacing it with working PIC file should fix this issue you can get the PIC file from other known working hashboard.",

Which is also 1.8v. You can't goto the miner logs, if the boards reads: 0 ASICs found! Thanks for you help anyways.",

Why not share the kernel logs here so that we know what exactly your miner's issue is?Or try to follow the guide from zeusBTC on how to check them if its abnormal voltage value or not.Here's the link https://www.zeusbtc.com/manuals/Antminer-T17-Hash-Board-Repair-Guide.asp",
