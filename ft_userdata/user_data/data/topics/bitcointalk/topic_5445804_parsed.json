It was a shame that a democratic nation still doesn’t practice democracy still that should not warrant the destruction of the international passport.",

For me I just take everything' that is happening in the country to be the faith of a better tomorrow because I know all this nonsense is just internal repairs in the nation that no one is currently aware of. We are all going to be here and see as Nigeria solve it problems by itself some day because nothing actually lasts forever.",
