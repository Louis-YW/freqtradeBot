      "body": "Happy 80th!From what I can tell, the main thing to have risen is fuel and oil (which in number seems like it's up 100%) - your van probably makes you notice this a lot and so your comparison might even be higher than the 35%.Regarding this being a way to pass money to the elite, that does look like the case. Before it was supply and demand - but both of those likely stayed the same over the longer term for oil (or with just slightly more demand) but not by 50-100%. Perhaps companies are realising their time with oil might be coming to an end and are going to slowly push the prices higher - electric cars and vans are cheaper to power but more expensive to make and produce (and electricity is high cost now too - I'd guess that's a similar reason since 50%+ of the UK and EU's energy supply comes from renewables).Tldr: it looks like an outcome of extreme deregulation somewhere imo.",

Petrol was still considered expensive back then, costing an average of â‚¬1.50/liter for 95 unleaded petrol. It only became cheaper during the first quarantine due to Covid-19, reaching â‚¬1.30/liter. Currently the average price in my area is â‚¬2.45/liter, filling up my car would cost more than â‚¬110, while the max I'd spent the past years would be â‚¬50 - â‚¬70.",

But in the field, we as citizens experience rejection, where every retail sale or subsidized proves the fact that gasoline prices have never dropped. So who has absolute truth when our daily fuel forces us to spend huge sums of money? At least we know that the way the super-elite invests wealth is by enriching their offspring, not giving us cheap prices.",

The change in price happened gradually changing the total cost of commodities but so far no government will want to admit their effort lead to inflation. Getting a car in this era is quite expensive and the cost of maintenance is discouraging. petrol cost is like a sector of the economy that got its price hiked.

This is a completely understandable situation.Oil. Today, while there is a high demand for it, and there is a serious dependence of both consumers and suppliers, it is often a \"hostage of the situation\" or becomes a \"victim\" of some world events. This is exactly the situation today, but it will also calm downThe growth in value or \"cheapening of money\" is also a natural process. First, most economies have an inflationary model of the financial system. To be honest, I find it difficult even to give an example of whether there are countries with a deflationary model. Most likely not, because it's not good for the economy. Those. the gradual cheapening of money is a manageable process.",

I believe that this won't be staying at the top forever and there will be also the decrease for its price over time. We just don't know when exactly that will come but that's what I want to believe and that's the same as the markets. The factor with its continuous increase is due to the war, so, I wish that it'll end soon so that we all going to benefit once its down and decreases in price.",

I don't know who says it's low, but they are blatantly lying. Inflation started to rise before the war due to massive printing and energy policies, and, with the war on, it has been getting worse. It is a good way to impoverish the general population, while rich people will not have problems because they have assets that beat inflation.",

Naturally if the price of oil climbs up it is going to have direct effect on the price of commodities in the market because the cost of transportation will be factored into the product. This means the commodities will be higher in price and more money will chase it causing it to increase more, the more it goes higher in price it opens up the gap between the rich and poor causing inflation.",
