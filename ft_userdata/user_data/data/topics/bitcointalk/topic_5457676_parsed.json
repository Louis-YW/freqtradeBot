  "content": "1. Multitude of betting optionsPlayers like options, and eSports gives you options. Not only do you get way more options than if you bet on NBA, MLB, or NFL, but the options are present every day.For example, on May 11, 2023, a Thursday, 52 eSports matches across various games occurred. That’s 52 separate options on a single Thursday.At times, sports bettors can wager on over 100 separate Esports options. The more options the better because more options means Esports handicappers can pick and choose the matches they wish to play.2. Esports odds are fairer than traditional sportsEsports odds are almost always more fair than traditional sports. The reason? Oddsmakers set lines determined to get the same amount of money on both sides.Although that’s also true for eSports, public money, the dollars bet from casual weekend players, doesn’t affect odds as much. So when you see an eSports line you can be reassured it’s as close to a fair line as possible.3. More and more eSports are creating leaguesCall of Duty, the highest-selling video game brand in history, launched their league in 2020. Since then, the CoD League has blown up.Riot Games, the creators of League of Legends, launched the Valorant Champions Tour in 2021. Nowadays, it’s almost a given that if you develop a first-person shooter or strategy game that involves multiple players, you must also think of branching into a league.4. There’s big money behind the biggest eSportsRobert Kraft, the New England Patriots owner, purchased a majority share of Boston Uprising, a team in the Overwatch League. More big time owners came on board just this year, 2023.Big money is behind Call of Duty. Kia use to sponsor DWG Kia, the top League of Legends team in the world.When big money is involved, the sport isn’t going anywhere. The fact leagues have attracted big dollars and it’s not just for a single eSport, means the Esports industry is only going to get larger and become more of a sports betting force.Continue→ https://n2g.io/7b62f75",

It's way easier to be in the game and know the game when you also play the game, hence why more and more people are slowly transitioning towards eSports betting. There are also multiple tournaments being held for different games at a given time in short intervals, too, so it's way easier to look for something to bet on eSports compared to traditional sports. On the contrary. Most traditional sports employ linear gameplay and it all really ties up to the player’s skill and how they can make the most out of these pre-set rules and mechanics. Videogames on the other hand are balanced to a T, plus the variety it carries especially in eSports games like valorant or league of legends is a double-edged sword considering it provides you with a plethora of options for gameplay but at the same time requires you to be inherently skillfull to the game. This makes videogames easier to pick up but harder to master. While I would agree with the notion that it’s easier to cater to eSports since it’s virtually accessible unlike trad sports where you oftentimes have to visit the stadiums to watch it live, videogames are just way more difficult and thus could not be counted as a reason for why people bet on eSports.",

They rely on large datasets, but these are fairly static and readable by average people placing bets as well, plus there is more information in the domain (like watching people stream live before the upcoming event) which might show whether they are on form. Especially when new games break on to the scene, there can be a complete lack of data for companies, which is often why you mainly see older games in established sportbooks. They are definitely interesting bets to make, especially when their are lulls in other sports competitions like the end of the football season.",

On another note do people really find it looking at the money side of things to bet on the sports they want? I mostly like eSports because I play them in the first place, and really, once you get into one game, getting into the next is rather easy. I learned and played Dota 1 in the past (which was hard in the itemization part for people who played it before), so playing the next games like League, and Dota 2 was a lot easier on that part. FPS games are almost basically the same, the niche strategies for each character/map just change. I reckon that's why it's really inviting for new people to see.",

I don't think much of the sports betting people will get into eSports betting leaving the comfort of sports betting. To understand the leagues itself it takes time and this needs more dedication and not many get interested into watching it compared to soccer or other matches.",

Esports is an interest to many youngsters out there to both male and female individuals. Graphics, contents and variation is attractive no doubt. Also, it is as profitable as with sportsbetting. As entertaining as well, especially if it fits your interest. There's no direct correlation between sportsbettor and esports bettor but it just happened that most of us have experienced playing some of the games in our computer and phones which are now being developed to be more competitive.",

However, you really need to have broad knowledge about the game and the teams that are participating in a tournament, otherwise you'll end up placing a bet at wrong odd. eSports with the likes of Dota2 or other similar games is kind of a little complex game to understand. Though not as hard when you know how to play Dota2, but some of the other similar games tends to have different set of characters and skills. That's what makes it a little hard to analyse the match up. Whereas, those FPS games like counter strike or call of duty are far more easier to understand than the rest of the online games.",

You constantly need to be in shape, only eat healthy and work out a lot. In gaming you are sitting comfortable at home and can have a snack aside. The gaming industry was one of the fastest growing sector over the last 10 years and a lot of young adults keep gaming today. That's what is one the most attractive points to also gamble on Esports. If you play the game yourself there is more interest in watching the professionals play and also you have more knowledge about the game and leagues which gives us an advantage to bet on the games.
