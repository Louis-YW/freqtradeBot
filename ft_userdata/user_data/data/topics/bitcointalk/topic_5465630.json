  "content": "Hello!Over the past 2-3 years, the world of cryptocurrencies has changed significantly.It seems that the time of romantic dreams about boundless growth and cosmic profits has irrevocably sunk into oblivion.As usually happens in reality, everything turned out to be a little more complicated.Firstly, the global economy is facing significant problems caused by the pandemic, the growth of global political tensions, demographic and environmental risks, changes in the structure of production and consumption, cardinal shifts in the energy and food markets.Secondly, a heavy blow to the global crypto industry was caused by the collapse of the Terra and FTX - largest companies in the industry. In addition to the huge losses of investor funds, the industry has suffered reputational damage, haven't been able to recover from the consequences yet. Thirdly, the ongoing regulatory uncertainty exerts significant pressure on the inflow of capital into the cryptosphere. The attitude of various jurisdictions to cryptocurrencies ranges from official legislative adoption to a complete ban. And of course, a powerful negative factor that creates uncertainty and apathy in the cryptosphere is a monstrous imperialist war raging in the very heart of the European continent.All this hinders the steady progressive development of the crypto industry. These \"black swans\" appeared unexpectedly for the crypto community, and it, for the most part, was not ready for them.Nevertheless, the crypto industry has resisted the blows that have fallen on it.Moreover, the value of cryptocurrencies in the lives of a huge number of people has grown significantly. The existential disasters plaguing the world today are forcing hundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes and move to other countries and other continents in an effort to save their lives and not become accomplices in criminal atrocities. These people do not always have a solid base in a new place, even a simple opening of a bank account often presents a significant problem, it is also necessary to solve the problems of employment, rental housing and many others. In this case, the opportunity to pay for everyday expenses with cryptocurrency, the opportunity to earn money in cryptocurrency turns out to be literally a means of saving lives.We are closely monitoring this and other forums and have noticed that activity in the field of the practical use of cryptocurrencies has significantly decreased since 2021. Most of the links pointing to businesses accepting cryptocurrency lead to abandoned sites.We consider this state of affairs completely unacceptable, because it is at the moments of global cataclysms that new solutions should manifest themselves in all their brilliance and beauty, give people new hope and new opportunities.It's time to stop looking at cryptocurrencies as a speculative asset with vague prospects and start actively and massively use them.For this purpose, we founded our project.Why did we decide to focus on Dogecoin? There are several reasons for this.Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that has earned the broad support of a large community of creative, positive-minded people with an active lifestyle. You can treat it in different ways to the support of Dogecoin by the most famous businessman on the planet - Elon Musk, but largely thanks to this support, Dogecoin is today the largest cryptocurrency by capitalization after Bitcoin, based on Proof-of-Work. Also, Proof-of-Work makes any subjective manipulation of users' funds fundamentally impossible (unlike Proof-of-Stake). In addition, Dogecoin is extremely simple and cheap to use, the reliability of its blockchain does not cause complaints.So, welcome to Dogelly.com - Marketplace of Things and Ideas.We promise that we will not disappear from the web space, regardless of the attention of users to our project: its purpose seems too important.We believe that the motto \"DOGECOIN ACCEPTED HERE!\" will become a quality mark of any service in the near future.!!! And we are really looking forward to your feedback !!!Regards,Dogelly.com teamMuch WOW!Follow us on Xhttps://twitter.com/DogellyM",

      "body": "Interesting idea for a website & the design is nice. I think you're right about Dogecoin being ideal for online payments. I notice that some of the \"listings\" just look like advertisements for websites & they don't post prices of what they are selling -- maybe its just because the site is pretty new still. In any case, I wish you good luck with it. If DOGE really starts to take off again I can see something like this doing well.",

      "body": "Thank you for your attention and kind words. We hope that gradually our project will gain popularity and gain real usefulness. So far, any information about real businesses accepting Dogecoin published on behalf of real people is already some development. The promotion of such projects is a rather difficult task with uncertain prospects, so every review, every mention on the Web is important to us. But we firmly believe in the success of DOGE. Thank you again!Regards,https://dogelly.com team",
