  "content": "Mempool has hot discussions on the forum in May, it got me goose pimples and the congestion in it has lasted for a full one month. The good news is that is getting better from how it was 3 weeks ago when it was at over 650sat/vbyte. I became happy to see it at my normal bitcoin transfer fee of 15sats/vbyte today. The 15sat/vbytes is my usual fee from the first day I started sending bitcoin, I like to maintain that. The highest I sent for the congestion was 40sat/vbyte two weeks ago, but the light after the tunnel is likely here.The mempool congestion has been fast decreasing in the last 3 days, the memory of 1G/300MB was last seen as 863MB/300MB. The notion is that a lower memory can be seen by this time next week and fee can be lower than 9sats/vb.The ecstasy will be high if I got this correctly.",

      "body": "You are correct.The Ordinals Attack lost some of its hype so the number of junk transactions went down very slightly. It is too soon to celebrate it though since the attack is still ongoing and the exploit is not fixed yet.Another major contributed is the price stagnation which always leads to lower trading volume hence less on-chain transactions (less transfer to and from exchanges) hence bringing down the mempool congestion.",

      "body": "I think last week or so on the weekend some transactions around the 15-17 sat/byte mark also filled. The worse is the weekdays when the fees always jump.However what is more impressive is the ETH gas fees. I saw it at 12 gwei earlier today. Can’t remember last time it was that low. Means meme coins are dead for now.So I am also assuming these lows fees are due to the low liquidity and regulations and people just quitting crypto pretty much. And summer is around the corner which leads to less volatility.",

Bitcoin looks to has a confirmation of a falling trend and it can be one factor to stop the hype on BRC-20 tokens, Ordinals.Fee rate 1 sat/byte will need 2 or 4 more weeks to be seen if nothing suddenly loads massively in mempools again.",

I became happy to see it at my normal bitcoin transfer fee of 15sats/vbyte today.I know this is a thing that that everyone got affected with and it's something that we also believe will be handled well if the due attention needed is giving, the solution will definitely come onboard either by taking the ordinals off the bitcoin layer 1 blockspace to layer 2 or considers both transaction fee on a lower rate and lastly if the bitcoin token had a drop in it market value and number of transaction it performs.Quote from: Call_Me_Guru on June 04, 2023, 04:59:36 PMThe 15sat/vbytes is my usual fee from the first day I started sending bitcoin, I like to maintain that.

If you make a transaction paying the fee rate of 5 sat/vbyte now, it would be around 80 vMB from tip and it's very very unlikely that it will be confirmed in the next 24 hours.",

When I started using Bitcoin, I tried to save on fees as much as possible, sending my transactions only at night and with enough anticipation, so I could pass with 1 sat/vbyte.  I would not like those days to be forever gone, I would be happy if I could still do the same on Sundays.",

If the transactions fees goes to $100, I am sure 99.99% of the cryptos users will be very unhappy. Bitcoin can never become an ideal payment processor if the fees do not stay cheaper. Otherwise Bitcoin will remain an investment asset only and never become a method to transfer value. Also OP is not referring to the USD value of the fees. He is pointing towards Satoshi value and it's quite fair at his part. Bitcoin has to remain competitive in the market in order to survive. I personally don't see a reason to pay high fees just because some junk Ordinals.",

Clearly they've never heard of altseasons, which are short lived, and this time involved BRC20 memecoins and as well as Ordinals inscriptions. It seems quite obvious that these short-lived fads have passed for now and fees will continue to decline.If previous mempool history is anything to go by, then once the 10-12 sat/vB transactions are cleared out, the rest should clear out pretty quickly after that.",
