Tell then i have 2 VPS with not the best specs but i can run the bitcoin full node on one and ckpool on the other. My goal is to figure out how to work with the limited resources now. Then later upgrade the VPS as i save more money to be used to upgrade the VPS's. Strange thing is. I am able to run Bitcoin core testnet and Ckpool on 1 vps and works fine. What about moving to mainnet has cause this error to happen? Very excited to learn and gain better understanding . Thank you in advance for your time in helping me gain more knowledge .",

I have solved 50+ bitcoin testnet blocks. I have modified ckpool to do many things other than the stock source code functions. I know a good deal about coding but my knowledge is spotty . Somethings i do not understand. Just need to tackle the issues as they happen. Community Driven is more than one person working on a singular goal. I just need a little help getting started. Just need a little help now and again from a helpful and caring  community. That is why we are here right? To be a community. A community helps one another.",

The node is fully synced and prune just means it is fully sunced but holds on to only the latest 550MB of data from the chain. The prune thing is not the issue here seems to be. failure seems to be at the ckpool connector starting. Prune just holds on  the required last 288 blocks on disk.
