      "body": "Your site is well designed and pleasant to navigate.However, I have some comments to make about this article, I am not sure you know what you are talking about: Bitcoin Mining: What Is It And How Does It Work? 2023QuoteBitcoin mining involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and create new bitcoins. This guide explores the fundamentals of the process, from hardware requirements to the economics behind it.QuoteBy using sophisticated hardware, this \"mining\" entails solving an extremely complex mathematical problem.QuoteBitcoin mining is the process of adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. Miners use specialized computer equipment to solve these problems and validate transactions, and in return, they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins.No. Mining is not like \"solving complex mathematical problems\", people need to stop saying that. It is closer to bruteforcing than to solving a complex mathematical problem. The \"mathematical problem to solve\" is a preconceived idea which is totally wrong.QuoteTo mine Bitcoin, miners must first download and install a Bitcoin wallet, which is used to store their earnings. They also need to have access to specialized mining hardware, such as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) or GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are designed specifically for mining BitcoinYour title is \"Bitcoin minig [...] 2023\"For years now, it is impossible to mine efficiently BTC and sha256d coins with a GPU. ASICs yeah, GPU is totally wrong.QuoteOnce the hardware is set up, miners must connect to the Bitcoin network and download a copy of the blockchain.You absolutely don't need a full node to be able to mine. You need an internet connection, an ASIC and a pool. The time of solo mining via Bitcoin Core is long dead and gone.QuoteMining software: You will need mining software to connect your ASIC miners to the Bitcoin network and start mining. There are several popular mining software options, including CGMiner, BFGMiner, and EasyMiner.Unless you are talking about some very specific ASICs like Gekkoscience ASICs - which are more for \"hobby\" or home mining than everything else - a mining software is not necessary at all. CGminer or a forked version of cgminer is already present on all ASICs.Without wishing to be unpleasant, I hope you've written the other articles with a better grasp of your subject.",

Thank you for your questions. No, I am not using Wordpress. While Wordpress initially started as a blogging platform, it eventually expanded its mission to cover a wide range of functionalities. So, it seems that Wordpress lost a little bit of its soul to me. The admin panel and overall usability feels clunky, and the need to install dozens of plugins leads to increased lines of code, resulting in a larger attack surface and slower loading times. Since the website mainly consists of static pages, I prioritized simplicity and speed. Consequently, you won't find social icons (you can find all the links in the contact page) or similar elements like widgets.Actually the website has a free membership, so the sign-up/sign-in buttons are for registering/logging-in on the website. You just need an email, and the advantage is that you receive the new posts directly in your inbox (you won't get spammed).",
