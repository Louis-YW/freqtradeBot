  "content": "There have been some issues in the recent signature campaigns that I would like to comment on and also ask those of you who have been on the forum for a longer time if you remember similar or anecdotes worth commenting on.1) Bitlucy.com signature campaign.It started on 04/28/2022 and has been paused for the time being due to abuse in the no deposit bonus:Quote from: Royse777 on May 10, 2022, 07:23:21 AMUnfortunately I have to pause this campaign right now. Any eligible posts made till midnight yesterday will be counted for the running week. You are free to remove signature now.Give me 24 hours from this post to sort out your payments. I am requesting to post your BTC address. This is a backup plan just in case we miss 24 hours time frame and in that case you will get paid directly to your wallet and any withdrawals in the system will be removed.As per the CEO, they have had massive abuse on the no deposit bonus. From 3.5k users to over 21k users in just one day. Over 400 withdrawals and almost all of them are abusing with multi accounting. We have whitelisted many users and all signature campaign participants are on the whitelist too.2) Amechain signature campaign.It started on 04/29/2022 and has also been paused because the campaign manager did not hear back from the team:Quote from: beveryu778 on May 09, 2022, 05:14:52 AMThis signature campaign has been paused for Project team inactivity. And team didn’t send 2nd weeks payment to me yet for distribution and they do not seen our message . bevery team  will pay hulf payment for hulf week working. Everyone can remove signature & avatar. this campaign will be open again. When team come back and send escrow. Thanks for working with us.3) [banned mixer] signature campaign. It started on 03/21/2022 and just when the three weeks were up to see if the campaign would be renewed or not, not only the campaign manager did not hear back from the team, as in the previous case, but the site was down.Quote from: icopress on April 11, 2022, 07:20:29 AMFriends, the third week is paid!https://mempool.space/ru/tx/d50e8da35ff5240fcf0f0a097002917744fc2ff840e89504bd11f4c89b93b436In addition, I still have not received a response from the customer, so I am announcing a week-long pause, which means that you can all remove the sig.But at the same time, I tried to be as flexible as possible and paid each of you a bonus of 2 mBTC. If the campaign does not continue anymore, this will be a nice bonus for you, and if the campaign is restarted again in a week, I will take these 2 mBTC into account for future posts.Quote from: JollyGood on April 13, 2022, 10:38:24 PMTheir website seems to be have been down for some time.I hope they fix the issue and continue as a viable option for those seeking to mix their Bitcoin.These are the most recent that I can remember. There are also the Lightlord campaigns 777coin and Bitvest.io with very long delays in payments, or the crappy 1xBit signature campaigns that are the shame of this forum.Do you remember any curious anecdotes about the campaigns?",

For as long as the issues are resolved relatively quickly and fairly and in favor of those people who exerted effort in promoting certain brands, they could easily be shelved and forgotten. As in all facets of life, it is inevitable that different issues with different gravity arise in signature campaigns. For example, just recently we have these:Quote from: DarkStar_ on May 01, 2022, 05:34:14 AM* I accidentally messed up and used last week's exchange rate of $39790 instead of the current exchange rate of $38100, so people's payments will be ~4.4% less than what they should be. I will add this difference to next week's payment, as the amounts are fairly small. I apologize for the inconvenience.Quote from: Best_Change on April 28, 2022, 06:20:10 AMRules update as of April 28, 2022:[/b]We recommend avoiding topics with sensitive political agenda, in particular, the situation surrounding Russia and Ukraine these days. Since we, as a business, take up a neutral status, when a user publicly supports this or that position on the forum, it can be a reason for suspension of cooperation. We understand the desire of many not to stand aside and actively participate in discussions, but, unfortunately, due to possible false associations of the signature campaign participants with our brand, we ask such users to suspend collaboration with us for the time of active participation in these discussions. We would be happy to resume collaboration when you decide to retract your political statements.Quote from: Best_Change on May 06, 2022, 10:18:14 AMNo open slots, no. We selected the ones from our pool of applicants.And probably there were also issues regarding signature payments sent in gambling site accounts which require certain fees upon withdrawal. Other than this, there were probably issues in terms of how participants are chosen, how campaign rules are suddenly changed, how payment funds are not escrowed, and so on and so forth. There are simply tons of them.",

I'm confident they will send the budget over but it may be next week so for now, please remove your Signature and Avatars.Quote from: Hhampuz on February 05, 2022, 07:08:29 PMMy contact on telegram has still replied as of a few days ago saying he'll speed up the process of getting the budget sent but.. It's getting to that point where I can no longer recommend anyone to play at Rolletto if they struggle to pay this $1200 invoice. I'll give him one final bump on telegram and if nothing comes of it before Monday ends I'll also launch a thread in Scam Accusations I suppose, unfortunately.Sorry that I do not have better news to bring.However, it seems that the payment has not been made by the team and Hhampuz has not been able to send payments to all campaign participants.Quote from: Botnake on March 27, 2022, 01:25:43 PMSame here, I was part of this campaign and I don't mind if I'm not getting paid since Hhampuz himself has not been paid for running this campaign too. I'm not saying he has no responsibility or whatsoever because he stated before that he would pay from his own wallet if Rolletto will not send the budget for the pending week. Quote from: Hhampuz on February 05, 2022, 11:38:38 PMI also am not too worried about this particular campaign as if they aren't going to pay up I'll just pay it out of pocket, as I have done in the past.However, I would be happy to help him to lessen the burden and would not claim anymore my pay if he decides to send the payment to the participants. Quote from: Poker Player on May 11, 2022, 02:48:32 AMDo you remember any curious anecdotes about the campaigns?I'm not sure what the real story behind it all is, but the lack of campaign funds and a few other things made some of them unsustainable. The whole story maybe we can say that the team may still not be serious enough to develop their site for various reasons, that makes sense and might just be abandoned.",

Maybe their existing investors or holders should start to doubt since if they can fool people by not paying a small amount of money for sure they can also do the same with large amount especially if we talk about millions of dollars.",

One was icopress paying a bonus to the participants of the [banned mixer] campaign when he did not know if it was going to continue, which he did not have to do, and in the case of Amechain the same thing: the campaign manager (although he does not express himself very well in English) only received funds for the first week, and paid half of the second week whith what was left. Although in these two cases they did not literally take money out of their own pockets, as it was a remnant of the campaign, they acted in favor of signature campaign participants.

It was, to me, specifically this passage of signature campaigns that led to the massive forum clean up and merit system.Sadly, I can still remember threads were people were just posting dumps of bot Tweets daily, \"amazing project\" \"I will invest\" posts etc. to get their \"stakes\".",

The current bear market might have contributed a little, especially if there is indeed a correlation between the market and the number of running campaigns. But if there is, the relationship is most probably indirect. After all, if the revenue of the casino is significantly growing while the campaign is running, I don’t find a reason why they should stop the campaign, unless perhaps they have somehow established that their casino will continue to thrive even without the campaign, or that the signature campaign is not really a factor in their growth.Although it is not that interesting to speculate because it is more of the rule than the exemption here. Long-term campaigns are far outnumbered by campaigns running only for a few weeks or months.",
