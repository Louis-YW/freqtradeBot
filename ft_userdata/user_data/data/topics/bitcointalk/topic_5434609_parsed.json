  "content": "I have checked my CryptoBonds and the funding wallet is still intact.     Unfortunalty you cannot sweep the BTC until the Locktime date or Block is met   However, If you want to know if YOUR CRYPTOBOND funding wallet is intact, please DM me your raw hex DATA that can be found in your large QR code.   I can then find the BTC addy and send you the funding wallets BTC addy and you can keep an eye on that and if anything is amisss before you sweep you will know by tracking it.   Hope this helps you all.   P.S. And NO I cannot steal your BTC by knowing the raw hex data.....even if I broadcast it it will only goto to your card and your card alone.",
