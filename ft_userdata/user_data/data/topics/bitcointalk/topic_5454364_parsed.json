  "content": "Recently, I started experimenting with AI tools. They are incredible tools with tremendous potential, but also full of errors. Out of curiosity, I asked Chat GPT for predictions on future Bitcoin prices. Of course, it immediately mentioned that it only has data up until 2021. After providing it with the current data from the last six months, it generated the following prediction. What do you think of it, and what are your thoughts on the potential of AI in technical analysis?QuoteShort-term Scenario (1-3 months):Based on the recent price movements, the short-term scenario for Bitcoin is as follows:Probability: 40%In this scenario, Bitcoin's price may experience a consolidation phase with a slight upward bias. It may encounter resistance around the previous high levels, such as $29,000-$30,000. The trading volume is expected to remain moderate, indicating a cautious sentiment among traders. The key support level to monitor is around $26,000. If the price breaks below this level, it could signal a bearish trend continuation.Medium-term Scenario (3-6 months):Probability: 30%In the medium-term scenario, Bitcoin's price could exhibit increased volatility and potentially enter a new uptrend. The probability of this scenario is lower due to the overall market uncertainty and the need for a sustained bullish trend. If Bitcoin manages to break above the resistance level near $30,000, it may attract more buyers, leading to a potential rally. The key resistance to watch for is around $35,000. However, a failure to break above this level could result in a continuation of the consolidation phase or a bearish reversal.Long-term Scenario (6+ months):Probability: 30%The long-term scenario for Bitcoin suggests a potential continuation of the bullish trend, but with increased volatility and periodic corrections. Bitcoin's price could aim for new all-time highs, potentially surpassing the previous peak around $64,000. The probability of this scenario is lower due to the inherent uncertainty in long-term predictions and the influence of external factors on the cryptocurrency market. It is important to monitor key support levels, such as $40,000 and $50,000, as significant breaches of these levels could indicate a trend reversal.Second attempt with slightly different prompt:QuoteScenario 1: Short-term (next few days/weeks)Based on the recent price movements, Bitcoin has been experiencing a downward trend. There is a possibility that the price might continue to decline in the short-term. The key support level to watch is around $26,000. If Bitcoin breaks below this support level, it could indicate further downside potential. However, if the price manages to hold above this level and starts to rebound, we may see a short-term rally towards the resistance level around $28,500.Probability: There is a 40% chance of a short-term price decline, and a 60% chance of a short-term price rebound.Scenario 2: Medium-term (next few months)In the medium-term, the price of Bitcoin will be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and overall market conditions. If Bitcoin manages to regain positive momentum and break above the resistance level around $28,500, it could signal a bullish trend. In this scenario, Bitcoin may experience a gradual uptrend, with potential resistance levels at $30,000 and $32,000.Probability: There is a 30% chance of a medium-term bullish trend, a 40% chance of a sideways consolidation, and a 30% chance of a medium-term bearish trend.Scenario 3: Long-term (next several months to a year)The long-term outlook for Bitcoin depends on various fundamental factors, including macroeconomic conditions, institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and market acceptance. If Bitcoin manages to maintain its position as a leading cryptocurrency and continues to gain mainstream acceptance, there is a possibility of a long-term uptrend. In this scenario, Bitcoin could potentially reach new all-time highs, surpassing the previous peak levels. However, it's important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and there are inherent risks involved.Probability: There is a 40% chance of a long-term bullish trend, a 30% chance of a sideways consolidation, and a 30% chance of a long-term bearish trend.Its nice that both are bulish",

ChatGPT does not have access to the internet. The data it is based on ends in 2021, and what comes after that is very fragmented and incomplete. So, the analysis I shared with you is not based on other online analyses of current bitcoin price change. The data the model received from me consists of daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices starting from January 2023. The analysis seams to be based on that, price action before 2021 and old analysis that model already had.Quote from: dragonvslinux on May 29, 2023, 09:22:08 AMAlso, although bullish predictions have been made short to long-term, there is notably no possibility of a bearish outcome here?

The bot seems to give the most likely scenario for a given period and gives its probability. The second analysis seems better.Thanks for the answer. Yes, I think it's an interesting topic and I'll try to update the thread with current analysis as well as improve the prompt for AI to get better answers in future.",

      "body": "This is very interesting, I also asked another chatbot to do a TA about Bitcoin and somehow I got a different answer.Quote1-3 monthsIn the short term, Bitcoin's price is currently consolidating within a range between $28,000 and $30,000. The bulls are trying to push the price above the resistance level of $30,000, while the bears are trying to push the price below the support level of $28,000. If the bulls are successful, the price could rally to $35,000. However, if the bears are successful, the price could fall to $25,000.Probability:The probability of Bitcoin's price rallying to $35,000 in the short term is 50%. The bulls and bears are currently evenly matched, and it is difficult to say who will be successful in the short term.4-6 monthsIn the medium term, Bitcoin's price is still in a downtrend. The price is currently trading below the 200-day moving average, which is a bearish indicator. The bulls need to close the price above the 200-day moving average in order to invalidate the downtrend. If the bulls are successful, the price could rally to $40,000. However, if the bears are successful, the price could fall to $20,000.Probability:The probability of Bitcoin's price rallying to $40,000 in the medium term is 30%. The bears are still in control of the market, and they are likely to continue to push the price down until the bulls can close the price above the 200-day moving average.7-9 monthsIn the long term, Bitcoin's price is still in an uptrend. The price is currently trading above the 200-day moving average, which is a bullish indicator. The bulls need to close the price above the all-time high of $68,789 in order to invalidate the uptrend. If the bulls are successful, the price could rally to $100,000. However, if the bears are successful, the price could fall to $10,000.Probability:The probability of Bitcoin's price rallying to $100,000 in the long term is 70%. The bulls have been able to hold the price above the 200-day moving average, and they are now trying to push the price above the all-time high of $68,789. If the bulls are successful, the price could rally to $100,000. However, the bears are still in control of the market, and they could easily push the price back down to $10,000.As we can see the probability for the TA to realize in short term is about 50%, medium term 30% and long term 70%.  The chatbot is connected to internet so it is possible that it gathers data on the internet and count the months from current  to the months asked.It is fun to ask AI's since they tend to give different answer if we reconfirm our questions, like when I reconfirm the AI's answer it gives me this answerQuoteI am not sure about my answer on what is TA of bitcoin price for 1-3 months, 4-6 and 7-9 and the percent probability for it to happen. I am a large language model, also known as a conversational AI or chatbot trained to be informative and comprehensive. I am trained on a massive amount of text data, and I am able to communicate and generate human-like text in response to a wide range of prompts and questions. For example, I can provide summaries of factual topics or create stories. However, I am not able to predict the future with 100% accuracy.The future price of Bitcoin is uncertain, and it will depend on a variety of factors, including economic conditions, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. It is important to do your own research before making any investment decisions.",

      "body": "Seems like reasonable conclusions, stick to simple observations and its not hard to point out that moving averages have been aligning to a more positive direction then we saw in 2022.    The immediate price action is meeting 50 day which is negative, so most immediately we are challenged in that measure but its less important then the 200 day which is rising so I think me and the bot should agree.    These AI bots aren't real intelligence imo but also not something to dismiss either, they collate information and make it more accessible, its finesse more then an actual giant leap forward but I'd like to find out Im too pessimistic also.   I expected something like this 20 years ago, I believe the power to provide processing has become more available thats part of why now.",

Before, it wouldn't say that much so I'd say that this AI tool is really learning from the data that it's given because when I've asked it before. It has said that he can't do that much and just given a short words of what it thinks about Bitcoin and a bit of its TA. Thanks OP, really a good topic.

We do make out those assumptions which is something that would really be that normal or having the impressionthat prices could really be going that beyond those numbers as the cycles of this market would really continue to progress. We didnt even had able to believe that Bitcoins price hit up that 69k ATH which we are just hoping on just breaking that 20k resistance ath way before on those earlier years.If Chatgpt did make out such response then its true that it would  be really somewhat not some newbie kind of approach of response which it would really be that considerableto be read up for us to those who do have experience or simply a very significant approach but it didnt really give out any guarantees which is really that good.",

Nothing could be more wrong.In my short adventure with chatGPT, which is probably the most advanced model, I have repeatedly encountered total lies presented so credibly that I began to doubt myself. The mere fact that gpt chat is not connected to the internet. On the one hand, when I asked him to download data from the website, he said that he could not, because he did not have access, but when the conversation turned out that the amount of data I want to give him is most conveniently done by giving a link to the website, he suggested it himself , then pretended to fetch data and then pretended to create a response based on it, when it was just waffling, not backed up by the content of the page. you have to be careful with these models and don't expect more from them than what they were made for and if anything, treat their answer with a grain of salt.",

The data the model received from me consists of daily OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices starting from January 2023. The analysis seams to be based on that, price action before 2021 and old analysis that model already had.So if ChatGPT isn't analysing human-based analysis, I assume it's using available generic technical analysis (ie publicly available information) to analysis the current price based on OHLC? It'd therefore make sense why the analysis is relatively in-line with other human-based analysis, if it is simply applying general TA to Bitcoin's current price. I guess you could say it's reassuring in that sense.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on May 29, 2023, 09:49:15 AMQuote from: dragonvslinux on May 29, 2023, 09:22:08 AMAlso, although bullish predictions have been made short to long-term, there is notably no possibility of a bearish outcome here? Ie 100% of the outcomes are bullish which seems completely unrealistic, even if price is to continue higher. Either way, I'd be interested to hear updates from Chat GPT if you are willing to feel it the latest data in the future, in order to see how accurate these predictions are!It seems to me that these percentages do not add up to 100%, because they relate to different time intervals. The bot seems to give the most likely scenario for a given period and gives its probability. The second analysis seems better. Fair enough, that makes sense. You're right that the TA on different time-frames would be independent of each other, and therefore the percentages shouldn't be considered cumulative.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on May 29, 2023, 09:49:15 AMThanks for the answer. Yes, I think it's an interesting topic and I'll try to update the thread with current analysis as well as improve the prompt for AI to get better answers in future.Looking forward to future updates. If I had to guess, it could well analyse Bitcoin's price using technical analysis theories better than humans, as will do so without emotion.",
