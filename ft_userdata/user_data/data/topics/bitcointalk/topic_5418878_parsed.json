  "content": "I first bought Terra Luna Classic at 0.0001 and sold half my position when it reached 0.00056 a few months ago I now have 2.5 million left and wondering if I should hold or sell when we have another significant pump. I know a lot of people now hate Luna and have been left very frustrated by what happened with it but I want to know what everyone is doing those like me who bought in at these very low prices?I don’t really understand what is going on with it at the moment to be honest, i don’t get all the tax burn etc but I do know I got in at a very low price and am just now waiting and hoping for the next thing to make this pump. I am planning on selling the other half of my investment when we reach 0.0006 again and then leave the rest of what I have as a free bag hoping for it to explode one day, even if I have to wait a few years thats fine with me. What price can this realistically reach? I see a lot people mention $1 but I don’t think that is possible, I am more hoping for something like 0.01 - 0.05 long term.",

The burn becomes no affective to the price of lunc. The price will be stagnant at this level. There will be only a small pump and dump. You can hold until 100 years later to see that lunc to reach such level. This coin has no utility after crash incidend that happened in the first quarter of this year. You didn't even have a reliable price to sell your coin. This is a zombie coin. Think about that. Did you think this scam foundation is comparable with apple to have trillions of marketcap by having $1 for each price of coin? WTF!Selling your coin at reasonable price is quite better.",

People who are dreaming about 1$ goal can be called delusional. Binance currently supports burning lunc but they can stop at any time and it won't have too much of an impact on lunc supplies, so in the long run I don't think it's feasible. I think you can still invest as long as you are willing to take the risk and you are better off looking at it as a short to medium term investment. Taking profits is never wrong, don't be too greedy the market will cause you pain.",

DYOR first.That's why it would never to be worth anything, because people know that they were cheated once and they might be cheated again, and that's why they would never put their money back into Luna and the price would never go up. There are a lot of people who lost so much money from Luna crash that, they do not see a reason to sell it now, it's so low that why would they even sell it. So, they are all waiting for it to recover, and to reach at least a decent price so that they could sell.But, unfortunately there are not enough buyers and only sellers, this causes it to be a bit of a problem in the long run. I am not sure what will happen, but it will not be even 10 cents if you ask me.",

How many are still buying or holding terra luna classic? Well, I'm surprised you still care about Lunc after all this trouble. With what FTX has done to the market recently, most people are starting to convert all their assets into bitcoin or they will convert to fiat, hardly anyone is interested in too many altcoins at the moment, especially shitcoins.The fall of FTX overshadowed Lunc, I remember there was still a lot of topic talk about Lunc before, but now it's almost gone. Does Binance still support Lunc? and is their team still active? I hardly update anything about Lunc.",

Good if you've got that 2 million for free and you've got your capital back to you. So, whether you sell or not, you're still going to make a profit from it. 0.0005 is quite that much but who knows when these pumps will bring you.
