Actually I was about to upload some image and found the error, then I went to Meta to see if it's only me who having the issue and found this thread. Imgur dont remove the old pics only, but also dont allow us to upload pics here. Seems seeking an alternative is the best way from now. Imgur has been acting weird since they renew its look and keep asking us to buy premium account.",
