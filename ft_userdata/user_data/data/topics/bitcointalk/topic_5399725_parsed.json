  "content": "Well, today is the main celebration of the Bitcoin Pizza day. May 22 marks the 12th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day, a day when the cryptocurrency was used in a real-world transaction for the first time.  Quotehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195#msg1195I'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day.  I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.  You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.Thanks,LaszloAlmost 12 years ago, a Floridian programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz was craving pizza. So, he bought two. But the catch here is, that he paid in Bitcoin in the first-ever recorded real-world transaction using crypto. Hanyecz announced on May 18, 2010, that he planned to use Bitcoin to buy pizza, preferably two large pies. He was willing to pay 10,000 Bitcoin to anyone who could place an order, collect the cryptocurrency, and bring it to him. Days passed and Hanyecz was still unable to find anyone who was willing to take up his offer. He was losing hope. But then, on May 22, Jeremy Sturdivant, a 19-year-old at the time, started turning heads on the forum. He accepted the offer of 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas, valued at around $41 back then. Sturdivant purchased the two pizzas and delivered them to Hanyecz’s place in Florida. Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the forum that he had received the pizzas and shared the following photograph with his family. https://www.businesstoday.in/amp/crypto/story/two-pizzas-for-rs-2260-crores-12-years-of-the-bitcoin-pizza-day-334204-2022-05-19A big lessonDo you know your Bitcoin asset can worth more than you could ever image in time? Hodl and buy more since price is down and await the future to decide. I'm a Bitcoin optimist!",

Sound money is a lot more than something you use to buy and sell stuff.Just because you are not buying coffee with your coin doesn't mean it's not money. Have you ever heard to expression: \"Sound money chases out bad money.\"?Basically, all of us here understand that gold, silver, Bitcoin, and even yack poop are all better money than fiat currency. Yet if I have $20 of coin, $20 of gold, $20 of yack poop, and $20 of fiat, you can bet your keys I will be spending the worthless fiat first and hodl my gold, coin, and yack poop.People tend to keep what is valuable to them and spend away what they consider less valuable. So bitcoin will at some point be used to buy coffee. We just gave to wait until your useless fiat becomes so worthless that you still will want to get rod of it, but nobody will want it.And that is what money is.",

Attention should be on him for making Bitcoin transaction believable. Many of us think (as it's today and now) that Laszlo was wrong to have made that deal because it would've worth a lot in today's world. Truth is that Bitcoin was worth what it was exchanged for then. Not many a people believed then that Bitcoin could be worth a fraction of what it's worth today and that was why it took Laszlo some time to even get his buyer at that exchange. I've read several articles in the past where Laszlo said he didn't have any regret doing what he did then. So, I think we shouldn't cry more than the bereaved on that issue. Yes, quite alright the value is worth a crazy figure now but I don't believe Laszlo would've kept his stash till date and had that benefit. He would've sold off during one of those FUD days before 2017.",

And a lot of my customers don't understand why I am selling coin now that the price has dropped so much. If I sell you $1 of coin, I sell it for $1.05, than I turn around and but $1.05 of coin again. I just made $0.05 of Bitcoin in profit. But they don't understand that. What do they think I do with that nickel?Two years ago when Bitcoin was at around $10k I sold my $6k of it to buy a vehicle for my work. Had I waited an other 6 months, that $6k of Bitcoin would have turned into $36k.But I don't regret it at all. I needed a truck for work. There was no way around that. I couldn't have taken it somewhere else because all my money was in BTC.",
