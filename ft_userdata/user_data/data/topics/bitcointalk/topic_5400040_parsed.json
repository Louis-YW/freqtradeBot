      "body": "Are there any plans to hold a token sale on some platform like the launchpad? Because selling tokens directly from the site is not trustworthy. Also, I looked at your staking, you give a high percentage of 18% to 30% APY. From my experience I can say that many projects which initially give such high percentages, quickly switch to floating percentages and lower APY for staking. How do you plan to maintain such a high percentage of staking rewards?",

      "body": "The staking APY will go down once a new set of pools will be created and stabilize at a certain level depending on the interest the platform strikes we will have different data to work with once we launch. So it will either be lowering the staking cap or lowering the APY. The token will be available through a seed platform in the near future it is quite a big one i'm not sure I can disclose the information yet since they haven't announced it either. We are also negotiating with 5 VC's that show interest in the project but there are still some things to settle and we cannot skip the seed phase.",

Nowadays project are beign criticized hard to prove their legality. So I think better focus on that matter for now. If you are gonna do any fundraising, I suggest pick a trusted launchpad platform or yet applied to gitcoin grant and asked for relative funds via defi donations. But that would be a hard task showing your legality cause you need to showcase product use case and much more.Im gonna dig deeper on your project. To see what I could say more to improve or develop there.",

      "body": "There are a few legal requirements to be met for such a company to work but we worked on meeting those requirements for 6 months now so we can be 100% legal and transparent which is usually quite rare in crypto. The issue the token addresses is also quite delicate and I don t think there are or have been any other tokens with a team that is actually capable to do what we are trying to achieve. I personally as a CEO have a degree in Alternative Investments and have been full time trading and investing in this specific field for 5 years now.",
