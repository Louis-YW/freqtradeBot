  "content": "This is to bring to everyone notice that I have decided to become active with this account piesel Alt until my main account is recovered, because I have missed the forum since my main account piesel was hacked sometime in January 2023, and I have submitted the relevant proofs by signing a message with my bitcoin address, that I am the original owner of the account piesel to the email provided by forum administrators for account recovery. While waiting for the admin response on that, I have decided to continue being active with this alt till I receive a response from the account recovery team, so I will like to bring to everyone notice, that I have resumed full activeness with this account until I recover my main account piesel which was hacked but now locked due to my usage of the secret question. So I urge you all to give me every necessary support needed in thos forum until I recover my account,  this account is officially announced as my alt, everyone please take note. You can follow up with the discussion in the threads listed below: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436479.msg61648673#msg61648673",

So I am sure the team are just following the normal procedures and I know for sure in the long run the account is going to be recovered but until then I will remain active with thos account.",

So we cannot say that it is ban evasion. According to the former thread, his main account was hacked and on trying to recover same with a secret question option, he was locked out.I think that the main reason that account hasn't been released to him is because another user is claiming the account also.

Lastly I would love to suggest op should keep having patient I think there are lots of cases to be responded to so why worrying your self, besides this is your alt account which you used to communicate here so the sole purpose of this account is to have access to communicate with the Admins and mods in progress of your main account and not to be active with it. Although I don't think this forum is against one having alt account but you should know this account was created for a reason in other to get back your main account, so I suggest you just lay it low instead of complicating issues.",

I don't think this thread is about reputation, but meta.That is right. I feel that Op knows that the board he posted this is the wrong board but in his quest to exhibit a civil disobedience, he made the post in the reputation board instead of meta. Using the account outside meta and outside the recovery thread has proven how he wish to use the account pending the decision about his main account under dispute. I do not think that any moderator will tell him out rightly here to start using this account and I also do not think that this account would be banned if he starts using it frequently. The only consequence would be delaying the recovery of the main account indefinitely.",

If am not mistaken, he might be among those that opened a btt account with any email address that pops out from the screen of their gadget when opening an account. Many of the forum members are guilty of this",
