They try as much as they can to retain the exact amount equal to that of the dollar or whatever currency they are pegged with, but over time they usually lose some value. For example, it sometimes moves from the figure of 1-1 and brings it over to 100/99; that is to say, 100 USDT might be worth 99 USD. The pegged one is losing some value, but this is not caused by it being depegged; I believe it's as a result of market demand. Correct me if I'm wrong.",

Ownership of such currencies is not limited to the private key that you own, but rather it belongs to the company and gives you the right to use it in exchange for paying its full value, so it is worse than cash, which enables you to act absolute in it.With the exception of DAI, almost all stablecoins are highly centralized.Read more ----> PSA: Most Stablecoins Can Be Frozen, Even in Your Own Wallets[1] Circle Confirms Freezing $100K in USDC at Law Enforcement's Request",

It's true that there's pegging and depegging. Talking about depegging, there have been series of stable coins that have already been depegged. Most of them that have permanently depegged were not even that popular but you get the idea that it's possible. Whilst for some popular ones, you can see that they're not exactly the value of fiat that they're pegged with especially with USD. A little bit of discrepancy like a few cents and that's already giving you the view of it.Quote from: Okwara on August 28, 2023, 02:33:23 PMI'm very happy I asked the question and other users really responded very well.

Thanks for the appreciation and good luck with your journey in the crypto world.Stablecoin may not be always stable but it provides traders with speculative opportunities. Those who exchange their fiat or other volatile cryptos for a stable currency have the intention to rebuy volatile crypto assets or they want to provide liquidity in any DeFi application. In most cases, this is the fact. People do not want to keep stablecoin in their portfolio because it will not grow. If you haven't done anything bad like hacking any protocol your assets won't be frozen I think. It is not like they freeze your stablecoin without any reason.",

And my advice for you in the stable coin is to never store your funds in stable currency, especially in USDC. As USDC has some high volatility levels. Store your assets in Bitcoin because of many factors. One of them is that BTC is the best investment against inflation as it is a hedge against inflation.This forum is basically about crypto, and the more time you spend here, the more you will learn. To be honest, I am still learning a lot of things from this forum, and who knows what I will learn further? But investing time here will bring good fruit to your table. Your efforts to learn new things never go to waste.Quote from: Nwada001 on August 28, 2023, 02:46:28 PMI believe it's as a result of market demand.

I think other newbies like myself learned a lot from the replies.I don't to think there's a need to open another thread since you have initially created a topic about stablecoins. You got a lot of valuable replies from forum members, if you wanted to appreciate their responses or have any further questions to ask you would have done it on the same thread. Stablecoins can be pegged and depegged any time, the depegging could be a soft or hard one and example of such cases is TerraUSD[1]. Aside being depegged, they are centralized and can be frozen[2] as well. When a hacker or scammer steals a stablecoin and it's quickly reported before it is converted to a decentralized coin like Bitcoin or ETH, the stablecoin can be frozen and rendered unusable by the hacker.

However, this stability can also be a valuable feature for investors looking to preserve their wealth without being exposed to the extreme price fluctuations associated with more volatile cryptocurrencies.  So, isn't a pretty good idea to hold a stable coin but yes, it's useful in trading activities.  It's frequently used for trading purposes and traders can swiftly move in and out of positions by converting their holdings into stablecoins during times of uncertainty or market fluctuations.  So basically, stablecoins are commonly used to provide liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and platforms, allowing users to earn returns on their holdings, not intended to hold them for a long term.",

All the responses were really helpful. I think other newbies like myself learned a lot from the replies.In general, all of the investments have risks, and stable coins aren't an exception to it.Depegging is only one of the risks of stablecoins. Centralization is also one of the risks of it since most of the stable coins right now have a central authority. I mean that's very risky, and the best example for that is Terra Luna's UST. One single glitch on the project, investors took advantage of it, and boom UST de-pegged for a few days. Many still expecting that it will go back to a dollar, but when they saw that it has been days, and it hasn't been returned to that price, they knew the whole project is F*cked already. Another one is Tether whose been into a lot of controversies, but within the last years, I haven't hear any problem with them anymore.TBH, I don't know the reason why there are some investors who are holding stable coins. I mean if they want to get profit then at least invest into volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin right? Can please share some reasons as to why there are some investors who are hodling some stable coins.",

Can please share some reasons as to why there are some investors who are hodling some stable coins.The reason is that they insure themselves against the volatility of BTC and altcoins, so when their price starts to drop, they transfer everything to stablecoins instead of fiat - which then enables them to have their funds at their disposal and can transfer them very easily and quickly between different CEXs. This certainly makes sense because that way you can have fast transactions and bypass the bank in the entire process of deposits and withdrawals, while the risk of stablecoins is already mentioned and is not something that worries most people. The vast majority of people still trust banks, and private companies that issue stablecoins are in a way digital money banks that actually use fiat to make their product valid and trusted, which means that if you believe in fiat, you also accept stablecoins as a completely normal thing.",
