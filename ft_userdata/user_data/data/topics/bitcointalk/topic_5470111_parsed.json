  "content": "There are wallets that are custodial which people can use for lightning network. Everything the person needs is to download the wallet do the backup and generate an invoice to receive payment.I have read before that not your node not your coin. There are ways you can be able to run your own lightning node to use lightning payment. Connecting to other nodes and allow people to open channels with you. This will help you in having privacy. On Electrum wallet, you do not need to have your own node but open a channel directly. It is not custodial lightning that you will just download a wallet, do backup and generate invoice. You have to open a channel. The channels that depend on lightning nodes just like light client wallets depend on full nodes.",
