You should first tell what hardware have you used for mining.Since your question is this generic, I can tell that I did withdraw when I was mining.But I've never used cloud mining, because I understood very fast that those are scams.And I have a feeling that you didn't mine with any hardware, instead you've gone for the nice (meaningless!) numbers the cloud mining scam websites are displaying.",

Cloud mining are scam as NeuroticFish posted already. Either free cloud mining to lure you to pay for premium and have better mining reward, but those are not real bitcoin, they are just numbers represented on the cloud mining sites. Which means you will not be able to withdraw as they are in control and they are not legit. As the free part of cloud mining is even having high reward compared to what bitcoin mining is today, you should know that they are scammers that only just want you to go for premium version inorder to scam you.",

It looks like a cloud mining site if you deposit there before you can mine?Mining Bitcoin or other Crypto always required a hardware machine and connect them to the pool. If you are mining on Bitcoin pool it requires minimum amount before you can able to withdraw from the pool but on Altcoin/other crypto I think if you mine to the pool the mine coins should be directly sent to your own wallet.",

A lot of the guys active here in the mining forum, who actually own their gear?But yeah, pretty obvious what happened, and sad that it's 2023 and there are still users falling for cloud mining scams.I don't really want to sound harsh but how have you let this happen for so long and haven't learned that \"mining\" where you buy packages on shady websites that promise you great returns is not mining at all and just scams?With mining is the same thing as with bitcoin:Not your keys, not your coins. Not your miners, not your income.Now, about the bolded part, we can already picture what kind of site that is, but do tell us, what's the name and adress?",

You are not mining. You are wasting your time to obtain updates in the databases of a site which is useless, or you give part of your computing power to individuals who are trying to exploit it to achieve profits in return for your promise that you will get profits.If you don't buy mining hardware, you trust meaningless promises.",

It is not entirely clear what you mean by the loss of access to your funds, if you mined cryptocurrency in pools and used a local wallet and did not save the private key, this is one thing. Another thing is if for payments you used the address of any exchange that ran away with your funds.

That scammer is probably gonna launch another service so do watch out for it.Quote from: Larty on February 10, 2023, 11:46:21 PMI have been mining for 4 years, developing the farm, updating it. As a result, there was a short circuit and everything burned down. I certainly made a certain amount of money, but it's not millions of dollars.   I don't think this is exclusive to crypto mining though, more like you need to be careful when doing electronic maintenance. If you mess with the wiring or something similar, any electronic device can break down. Visit the mining boards if you want to ask for suggestions or guides on your RIG maintenance, CMIIW. That being said, mining is obviously not for everyone if your goal is to get profit. You need a lot of capital to start and patience to wait until you get your profits. If you don't have any of that, don't try to mine or use a mining service since most of them are scams.",

Since you did not answer the questions above, it is likely that you used one of the hill services that give you free mining in exchange for downloading some sites or leaving the browser running.It is a method that will not make you any money, and if you do, then it is most likely that it is a fraud.
