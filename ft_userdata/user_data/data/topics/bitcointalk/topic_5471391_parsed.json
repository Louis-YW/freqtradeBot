  "content": "Stalin and Hitler might have gone about it in the wrong way, but their idea to get rid of the Jewish bankers was the right idea. Putin is a nice guy, simply trying to keep his country sovereign, rather than let it be trampled on by foreign investigators... who really represent the US banking system without knowing it.If we didn't have the banks, and the crooked bankers who underhandedly steal from their depositors, we wouldn't have the wars.All Wars Are Bankers Warshttps://www.lewrockwell.com/2023/10/joseph-mercola/all-wars-are-bankers-wars/The video above features a 2013 documentary, “All Wars Are Bankers Wars,” written and narrated by Michael Rivero,1 founder of whatreallyhappened.com. As explained by Rivero, all wars can be traced back to the private central bankers.“The more you study this, the more you’ll realize that ALL wars are wars for the private central bankers,” he says. American soldiers have fought and died in wars initiated for no other purpose than to force private central banking on nations that didn’t want them.Usury — The Birth of Money From MoneyThe philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) once said:“The most hated sort [of moneymaking], and with the greatest reason, is usury, which makes a gain out of money itself, and not from the natural use of it. For money was intended to be used in exchange, but not to increase at interest.And this term ‘usury,’ which means the birth of money from money, is applied to the breeding of money, because the offspring resembles the parent. Wherefore of all modes of making money this is the most unnatural.”What Aristotle described is the business model of all central banks. They make money out of thin air by lending money at interest, and in the process, they drain a nation of its wealth. The first bankers war example illustrated in the film is that of the American Revolution, fought between 1775 and 1783.Thirteen of Great Britain’s North American colonies revolted against British rule and established the sovereign United States of America, founded with the Declaration of Independence in 1776.American Revolution Was Fought to Prevent Central BankingHowever, as explained by Rivero, the American Revolution was instigated by the King George III Currency Act, which forced the North American colonists to conduct business using Bank of England banknotes borrowed at interest:“If you go back to the writings of Ben Franklin … [here’s] a direct quote: ‘The refusal of King George III to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system, which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators, was probably the prime cause of the revolution.’That’s Ben Franklin. Our public schools don’t teach that because you’re not supposed to know that the bankers were really behind the American Revolution.After the revolution, the United States adopted a revolutionary radically different economic system in which the government issued its own value-based currency, so that private banks couldn’t skim the wealth of the people through interest bearing banknotes. So the American Revolution was fought primarily to free the American people from King George the third’s Currency Act …”2When Corruption Fails, Threats Are Made...",

But did you really have to come up with the \"Jewish bankers\" BS and also imply both Hitler and Stalin were right? When all here know they both were paranoid genocide apologists who are supposed to remain in the trashcan of history.Implying the death of millions of people is justified because politics is a rock bottom which anyone would avoid to hit with their face.",

Or do you think that all Jews are bankers?Didn't you get the first part of my first line, \"Stalin and Hitler might have gone about it in the wrong way,\" meaning that they DID go about it in the wrong way. Their methods killed millions violently. The bankers' methods do their killing peacefully. But the bankers have killed way more than Stalin or Hitler could even imagine.If you are implying that the death of millions of people is a good thing, consider basic life. How many people are 300-years-old? 200? Then consider how many billions of people have lived over all time... (Do I have to paint a picture for you?) but aren't alive now. You seem to have a ignorant view of things... from the root word \"ignore.\" In other words, you simply ignore the things you don't want to realize.Didn't you listen to the video in the linked website in the OP? You might have to dig for the sources mentioned in the video a little, but they are there. Got any proof that the video is wrong... proof that beats the sources mentioned in the video? After all, I have been telling people about one of the major ways banks screw people out of money, and make it seem okay in the eyes of those people. You know. How the bankers loan, and then monetize the promissory notes, thereby inflating the money supply, which devalues all the money that people have, in favor of the bankers who don't have a basic right to the money they gained by monetizing the promissory notes.",

In light of Trump, all you are really saying is that he is bad. Just look at all his scandals that the courts are finding out, right?Yet, with Trump there was peace between the nations of the world and America. The general economy was good for the people. And Trump was working to eliminate government corruption. But he went about it in the wrong way. How do we know? Look at the world turmoil because Trump didn't get the job done.If Hitler and Stalin and Trump had gone about it in the right way, the banks would have been broken up. We wouldn't have the wars of today. The economy would be thriving. America would have become great again. And the world would have peace.Hitler and Stalin did it the wrong way by being violent with the people rather than doing good for them. Trump did it the wrong way by doing too much good for the people, and not seeing to it that the Federal Reserve Bank was shut down, and the money moved back under the US Treasury.So, instead of these guys doing it the right way, we now have the bank extending itself through the war in Ukraine where many thousands have died, and new wars are on the way... like Israel and Iran.We have people like Biden who is diving into destruction worse than Hitler and Stalin could have thought of. And we have jokers like Zelensky acting the part of an actor in real life, all for the destruction of as many people as he can get away with. And all this is supported by the bankers in their money loans to Ukraine and elsewhere through the Biden operation, and directly to Zelensky's Ukraine bank accounts.But you would rather focus on the small evils of Stalin, Hitler, and Trump, while ignoring the big evils of Biden, Zelensky, some of Israel's leaders, some Iran leaders, and the world banking system.

Lol.Hitler was born in Austria, he grew up in Vienna.Vienna at the time had a mayor that hated Jews. Being anti-Jew was a thing in the region at the time. So his hatred for the Jews began at a very tender age.After the First World War, propaganda spread that Germany didn't lose the war on the battlefield but that they were betrayed by Jews. The popular term was \"a stab in the back\". It was easy for people who already hated Jews to buy into this propaganda. Hitler even blamed the Jews for the \"Treaty of Versailles\". He blamed the Jews for unemployment in Germany. If a rat died in Germany at the time, it was the Jews' fault according to Hitler. Hitler capitalized on that hate and wanted to exterminate the Jews.So Hitler didn't hate \"Jewish bankers\", he hated Jews. And how naive can you be to believe a man who was ready to kill millions, and wipe out a full race and religion would make the world a better place somehow? He doesn't have it in him. All he knew was hatred. Hitler hated the Jews more than he loved Germany because if he loved his country more he wouldn't keep sending men to die despite seeing that he was losing the war.",

Don't you see that the bankers don't care how many they kill? Or if they are fellow Jews or not?While the world has had wars, most of the wars - or maybe all the wars like the thread title says - are banker wars. And basically, aren't the major banker leaders made up of the class of Jews called Zionists? - who really might not be Jews at all, but talk like they are.Perhaps Hitler and Stalin essentially murdered 200 million people combined. But their goals were to put down the bankers, even if they had to form their own money systems to do it. Why would they want to destroy the bankers? Because they understood how the bankers were destroying millions more than they could even dream of killing, throughout the world. It's like fighting fire with fire. But they went about it in the wrong way. The bankers are killing off people by the millions, slowly, right now, by their banking practices that rob people of the value of their own money property. And all you can do is try to start a battle over so-called Semitism rather than stick to the topic of wars being banker wars.",

Don't we have enough problems with the ethnic groups we already have? How long before you add plumbers and electricians and doctors and firemen and soldiers and every other occupation as an ethnic group.In Hitler's Germany the trouble was with the Jewish bankers. In modern days, many Germans have adapted to the banking profession and become bankers right along side of the Jewish bankers. Why? Because the Jewish bankers won, even though it looked like Germany lost WW2.Hitler was trying to get rid of the banking system of his day. The fact that it was mostly made up of Jews doesn't seem to have entered your mind. If the banking system had gone down, there would have been a more peace in the world... except for one thing. The Federal Reserve Bank was already in place before WW2.The Jewish bankers, and all their buddies, saw what Hitler was doing. They realized what was coming. So, they pushed ahead with as many banking systems all over the world as they could. And these banks are causing hardship all over the world... killing people by inflation and making them pay their loans back twice.In addition, the wars that the banking systems cause by encouraging governments to borrow money (so the banks can make money), and use it for things like Ukraine and the up-and-coming Israel war, and maybe WW3, are killing people directly, besides causing inflation to steal from them.So, you are right. Hitler's idea was the right idea. He just went about it in the wrong way, as did Stalin.",

It only take a little bit of reading to realize it.It disturbs me how blood thirsty some people can be nowadays, we seem to have learnt nothing.I almost completely agree with everything you say here^. Ridding the world of Jewish bankers by killing off all Jews is totally despicable. Hitler (and Stalin) should have gone about it in different ways.Some of the biggest conspirators are government people along with the bankers. Governments are supposed to bring peace to the people. But the leaders of governments cause killing and wars, which are against the purpose of the governments they are leading. And the major way they do it is to use banking and bankers against the people. We see it in the wars and unrest that is happening today.We the common people don't need conspiracy theories. We see it happening. We see the results of government and banker in their conspiring. No theory involved.We, the common people, have learned nothing, and we have forgotten much of what we have learned. Life has become so peaceful for many of us, that we forget what evil leaders are setting out to do. It's time that we wake up, and literally get rid of the wicked leaders and their bankers, so that peace reigns.The ONLY way this might ever happen is by people realizing that it is to their best interests for joy and glory in the afterlife. And the only way such will happen is by accepting Jesus-God as their personal Savior, and then following what is written about Him in the New Testament of the Bible.",
