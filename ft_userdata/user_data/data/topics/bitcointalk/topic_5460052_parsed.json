It's been 14 years since Satoshi published his white paper and the vast majority of people still don't understand what Bitcoin is and how to use it. Sure there are many people buying Bitcoin on crypto exchanges and speculating on it. However, the average guy on the street that I speak to, and even many people on crypto forums still don't understand Bitcoin's potential as a virtual commodity, or it's potential to create an alternative to Fiat economies. Maybe the problem is deeper than just a lack of understanding about the technology? Maybe it's a lack of understanding about economics as a whole? How many people are economists?I understand that my frustration might be due to the fact that I am coming from a very privileged position. What are your thoughts on this?",

You called it 13 years, did you know how many projects have failed in centuries and many more that have lasted centuries but have not gotten 1/100 of Bitcoin's achievement? There are many assets that have lasted thousands of years but do not have the value and adoption of Bitcoin, you can't just force it on people at once.Bitcoin speaks for itself, let it continue to do so. Time and the pain of missing out would force many others to adopt it.",

If you're saying, I mostly use Bitcoin as an investment, I only use Bitcoin few times to buy something, it's mean you're also not consider Bitcoin should be used as payment solution.",

Sure there are many people buying Bitcoin on crypto exchanges and speculating on it. What that is more important is adoption and we are getting it. How many people did you think that read the bitcoin white paper? I for one did not read it before I know what bitcoin is all about. There are many papers that are online that can brief you what is in the white paper. Bitcoin is not a project like altcoins that you need to read the white paper anymore if you do not want to read it.Quote from: urbanmerchant on July 17, 2023, 06:40:45 AMHowever, the average guy on the street that I speak to, and even many people on crypto forums still don't understand Bitcoin's potential as a virtual commodity, or it's potential to create an alternative to Fiat economies. Maybe the problem is deeper than just a lack of understanding about the technology? Maybe it's a lack of understanding about economics as a whole? How many people are economists?Anyone that understand the law of demand and supply can easily understand. I did that during my high school days. With that, knowing how bitcoin is limited in supply to not more than 21 million coins and how the demand is increasing which makes it valuable.Quote from: urbanmerchant on July 17, 2023, 06:40:45 AMI understand that my frustration might be due to the fact that I am coming from a very privileged position. What are your thoughts on this?Do not be frustrated. Bitcoin price is going high and the adoption is what we are seeing. With time, more people will understand more.",

      "body": "The problem is not with Bitcoin but the people,  because for the past 14 years of Bitcoin's existence bitcoin have succeeded in its primary role which is being an alternative to traditional commodities both in currency and in asset,  just as we all know that the way the public is wired to function is to favour centralization since the government don't want you to know shit so that you will not get the total freedom deserving to you. So at this point,  the responsibility is left for the individual to carry out a deliberate search for knowledge that will aid his freedom because left for the government always wants to create policies that only favour them against the freedom of the people and one of the ways for people to attain the freedom that will reflect every other aspect of the life is financial freedom and in this area government/central banks control the traditional economy so at that most of the things that aid that freedom is always kicked against by the government e.g decentralized cryptocurrency like BTC.   The government have created limitations to Bitcoin adoption and its mainstream awareness within the society because we have some countries that have a total ban on Bitcoin,  this will make Bitcoin awareness in such country to be low,  but being that as it may,  Bitcoin is still doing well because for bitcoin to have attained it a market capitalization that can compete against old commodities like gold it shows that Bitcoin has indeed attained a good level of success that we all have to be happy with.",

Bitcoin is is very good with all it's potentials but what if I don't have anything to do with it? Speaking from the layman's point of view. That how the average person speaks of it. The fact is, most people have heard of Bitcoin but have not really have the time to look into it. It's a privilege that we all in this forum have heard and had time to look into it. Most rich people don't want to know anything about Bitcoin but really want to benefit from it, so they employ people with good knowledge of it and have them make money for them. Having to disagree with somethings and agree to somethings is what makes us humans, some choose to go right so choose to go left. That's why not everyone is rich and some has to know of it while some don't need to know. It just vise versa to make the equation balance. If everyone knows the deeper knowledge of something then there will be no one to lead everybody becomes the leader. That's what economics talks about, so I suggest you talk the people that are interested into it and let the ones who pays deaf ears to it be.",

They may only understand how to benefit from the amount of savings deposited as a customer. Another possibility is that they simply understand some of their rights as customers from what was explained before opening an account.Their relation type to Bitcoin IMO is pretty much the same. Most people don't really care about the Bitcoin system. They probably know that Bitcoin has a good system and Bitcoin can give them a large amount of profit compared to the interest rate that conventional bank deposits can get if they invest long term.It could be that they just stop there in understanding Bitcoin because if they understand how money works, they will be confused about why fiat money works that way.",

Nah, that's till too early.Bitcoin needs to matter in a whole new level of popularity first to get to certain people, and it's still far from that right now, you OP are showing signs of hasty, you are impatience it seems.
