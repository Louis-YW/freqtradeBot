At one point I thought you were referring to your signature campaign earnings but it can’t be that since most of the campaigns pay their participants in bitcoins. You already have the bitcoins, hodl for as long as you can. There’s no shortcut, set a goal in mind and you hodl till the market reaches that point where you want to sell. I wouldn’t recommend trading or swapping for altcoins, you will quickly lose all your money.",

If it's big enough then it's good to reinvest it back after a few weeks or days from getting the profit or you wait until the price drop down so you can buyback with a cheaper price. But if you are planning to invest for long-term, then you should have one time big cash ready to invest and hodl it for a long time.",

And when you steadily DCA you should eventually get enough Bitcoin that would be substantial to hodl.Bitcoin does not only pay off after a \"one time big cash investment\", small, regular investments have the same effect and is very useful for those that do not have a large chunk of money stores away.",

But what you really seeking with after you profit from holding bitcoin? That's what you're looking for and maybe to some real business but since you've mentioned how small it is.You better practice first how to save the profits that you're making or just hold it and sell all at once so that you can reinvest it to what you think is also another good investment. As mentioning with these yield products, they're not enticing and your question seems to be wanting to look for an answer where you'll reinvest your profit in bitcoin into another altcoin and have it enrolled to a yield/APY product on exchanges and wallets.",

But as you know, when it's not your key, it's not anymore your coins. So you need to trust the exchanges where you are doing your lendings. You can also do some more sophisticated things like cash and cary trades with futures https://insights.deribit.com/education/cash-and-carry-trades/ or trying to chase bets with positive expected value on sportsbooks and casinos.",

If you receive some of your income in Bitcoin, then there isn't a need to talk about reinvesting it, you can just basically hodl it for the long term, and take any income received there as your long term investment. There are quite a lot of risky methods people might advice you to indulge in to make ROI from your Bitcoins, but more often than not they'll end up scamming you of your hard earned coins.",

Thanks everyone. If you already have income outside of bitcoin/forums then that's even better because your needs have been met so there's no need to bother with bitcoins that have been earned so far getting here so the most important thing is that you have to be consistent in holding bitcoins all this time.The best way to invest your bitcoins is, make payments from your signature campaign a weekly DCA strategy, so you don't have to spend money out of your pocket for this more clearly you keep holding bitcoins as long as possible this will make the value even greater for the long term.You can also earn from trading, but you have to be prepared for the risks, sometimes trading in the bearish phase will not be easy even though you already know the pattern of how to trade.",

But this is what some of ways that I am doing. I got earning from the campaign in Usdt. It is not really big, but enough for me as side earning for my life. I commonly will.split my earning into two, half for converting to my local fiat and half for investment. I decided to invest in Bitcoin although it is small by small amount because thsi is bearish era in which the price of Bitcoin is down enoguh. So, I think that collecting more Bitcoins during this bearish era will be worthy for me at least holding them until the bullish era happenijg. It may take some years later and if I can continue and stay splitting like this, this willl be good for adding amounts from month to months. It is no worry if I am investing only small amount because that is what I can afford. But if we are doing it consistently, I am sure it will be big for us later.",

As a rule of thumb, you may withdraw your earnings as soon as you accumulate a profit on your end. Regardless of the margin, the important thing to note is the profit that you would receive.As someone who has never purchased BTC, I earned primarily through participating in campaign signatures. In that way, majority of the BTCs that I receive is what I HODL for long-term since I never purchased it.",
