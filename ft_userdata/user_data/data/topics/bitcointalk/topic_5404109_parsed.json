      "body": "I'm not sure if the next update will be more positive for Cardano. Honestly, after much going through, I still expect the ecosystem to grow more than the competitors seem to be. Their position in this space needs to be exposed through more products. Hopefully, the bear market period does not make them abandon their ecosystem development plans, although it can be admitted that the fact that attraction is very unlikely at this time, looking at the long-term existence of Cardano, but the past year is well worth celebrating in this space.",
