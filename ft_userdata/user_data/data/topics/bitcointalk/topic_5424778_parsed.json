I am almost sure it's considered good for all the reporters if it's handled. Just make sure you don't report something you have already reported.2. I think that in some cases (like plagiarism) it may even happen that it's handled only after multiple reports.",

However, as correctly pointed out, generally if they're being reported for the exact same reason they will all be handled the same. Sometimes, a moderator might just delete a report, and not bother checking individual reports of the same report, since they're handling it in the order it pops up in their report queue. It's probably best from a moderators point of view to check all duplicate reports for the reasoning's, but unless you have a user script to bunch them up, this isn't always obvious since by default the report queue doesn't behave in such a way.",

Yeah, we see who reported the post, but honestly I don't really pay much attention to that. In fact, I've even hidden it in the past using a user script. Though, a feature was introduced earlier this year I believe, that made me switch that off. Yeah, it shows who is reported, and it shows the thread title. Then on hovering over that you can see the post ID. I've got a slightly modified report queue on my end via user scripts though which make it a little easier to digest. I'd love to see something done to the report queue to get it more efficient though. Although, reporting has died down a lot over the recent months, at least for myself. Yeah, I go into it a little more below, but most of the actions I've taken in the last few months have been through doing it myself rather than acting upon reports. Although, I've also been away, so this closing to the year has been a little sporadic from my point of view. Quote from: Halab on December 01, 2022, 04:14:12 PMIt can depend.

And it can depend on the GM. As of recently, I'd say the majority of my actions are non reported ones. I'd be interested in seeing what the percentages would be, although it would be heavily skewed as a few users earlier in the year went on a reporting spree. The last few months have been a little different though, definitely.",

Well, I think there's nothing wrong with that, we're all doing the one thing As long as the malware is gone or at least been trashed, that's what we're here for. I'm not bothered if someone takes my reports, I think that's the wrong attitude to have. When it comes to malware especially, that just needs to be dealt with as soon as possible to mitigate the damage. Hence, sometimes I just move it to the trash can when I can't nuke the user myself, and then allow the global moderators to see the report, and deal with it.Unfortunately, reports have died down in recent months so I imagine this effect is more noticeable.

I miss the days when I woke up to hundreds of reports, it's somewhat therapeutic to deal with.  Either the forum has drastically improved in the sense that there is less spam, or the most active ones have given up on their mission to clean the forum of all garbage. I would still say that it is the latter, although every bear market causes less activity on the forum, so that should also be taken into account.Is the reason why some have given up on mass reports that they don't want to waste time on something that they have no personal use for, or are people just tired and leave that work to someone else?",

The spam still exists, it just isn't noticed as much. The reduced activity has, and will always result in less reports, since there's less things to report as you correctly pointed out. The other thing; I've noticed some users getting a little disgruntled on getting bad reports or them staying unhandled. So, they've reduced their reporting activity, which is a shame. I do get why they would be frustrated by that, but it's not always that the report hasn't been seen it's just been chosen by those that have reviewed it that it was either bad or was better to stay unhandled. Also, the merit system probably has reduced the amount of users, and also means that a lot of the spammers stay new users, and therefore get picked up by the patrollers. Since there's more patrollers than dedicated moderators usually.",

If you aren't feeding it all the data, it won't know identify everything, just as we can't pinpoint the exact cause. Although, as I said it's probably a combination of all the above I mentioned, as well as some metrics which aren't easy to measure. We can only work with public data, after all.

Many of us were reporting for years for free before being selected. I did the majority of my reporting over a two year period I believe, but I was reporting fairly early on.
