If they are here to make transaction fee worse, more expensive for most of Bitcoin users, their chance to stay here is not too good. When bull market ends, bear market comes, hype gone, demands to get rich will disappear and those projects will die.Forget about those projects with promise for layer 2, x, y, but their root idea is to help their team richer by inscriptions, etc. because they will die in bear market. Look at side chain projects like Liquid, Rootstock.https://liquid.net/https://rootstock.io/I believe in future of those side chain projects.",

I agree that bitcoin at its core is what we should focus on but at the same time, it will only be a matter of time until all the issues piles up on bitcoin and it becomes almost unusable for most. I believe the developers are really trying their best to create solutions to every constant problems and challenges that the blockchain is facing.I am sure more problems will emerge later on however it can also be noted that technology is also improving so at least now we know we have a chance to create something that could finally solve a lot of things.",

It's as simple as that.Sure, ethereum is super powerful, but there's a human behind it. Even worse, that human is in the public eye, and subject to public opinion.I'm sure vitalik is a great guy, honestly I do. Same for the guys that run Solana.And this isn't maximalist thinking either, saying that layers are not here to stay. I just think it's the type of thinking that is reality and until a project comes around that is exactly like bitcoin in every way, the question will arise:Why not just use bitcoin?What, because the price is too high? Yeah, it's literally digital gold. What did you expect?",

Hmm so if a large number of community members are in favor of this narrative there will always be discussion and hype of solutions on the network to fix it. We can't do anything with it, except if there's no solution from the whole community to move on to other technologies such as scalable blockchain L2 and blah blah but the point is with Bitcoin you need to make some compromises if you can't then choose Bitcoin as a holding asset and other technologies for your day to day transaction.",

You are fundamentally confusing what you are talking about. You seem to be confusing bitcoin layers with things that are side projects working off the bitcoin network.Layers are absolutely here to stay. Layers are how we build upon and use the bitcoin network at a mass scale. You don't understand digital money if you think layers aren't here to stay. Payment networks are always built up through layers. But you aren't talking about layers, you are talking about non-bitcoin things that use the Bitcoin network. That's very different than layers.",

The primary cause for the decline in development on second layers, however, is the technical limitations within the current Bitcoin protocol.  Numerous layers, which I'm confident could function even more effectively than LN, remain theoretical due to disabled OP codes.",

The crypto space is clearly a free space for development of any innovation, but i think the OP is somewhat bothered about the too many projects coming on the Blockchain. If these projects are actually beneficial, then no one should be complaining much. But since some of them causes congestion and are only to target few users who are willing to spend their money, then not everyone would find it important at all. I don't know if the Bitcoin Blockchain can handle some of this things, because they where never part of the plans from the start. This is why white paper is always important for every new project.",
