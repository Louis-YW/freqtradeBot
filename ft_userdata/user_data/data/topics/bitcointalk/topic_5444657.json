I don't think just yet, the FED is going to pull some strings to delay yet again but how much longer can they hold up the inevitable? We likely will see domino effects in a branch of bank industry with similar model of Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, Signature bank. However I don't think the domino effect will be expanded to banks with different models and are healthier than those bankrupted banks. FED and FDIC are trying to resolve the crisis and prevent domino effects to other banks especially banks with different operational models.QuoteSilver and Gold are being purchased like crazy, and people are buying more Bitcoin too the price is going up as we speak.

Do you see in 2020 when WHO announced pandemic, people panic sold bitcoin. Later they think that pandemic gave Bitcoin chances and it rose up. Honestly, Bitcoin grows with time because of its design against centralization, hyper inflation. Governments, financial recession, collapses are only one of many things which can contribute for Bitcoin growth in long term.In short term, risk is always here.",

If this continues we may see a nice run on gold and silver as a way to hedge and store of value. Metals exchanges are running out due to the increased demand caused by all the bank FUD. I do think it's odd that these seemingly great conditions for BTC to rise haven't sparked a huge rise in price. Maybe you're right though maybe the next halving is the next stop for a new ATH, which I think everyone is thinking. But if BTC can't rise to the occasion in these conditions I guess anything can happen. Where's a pro Elon Musk BTC tweet when we need it lmao ðŸ¤£",

Surely BTC has a chance for a huge upswing. I mean honestly this is looking very BULLISH for BTC, is it not? Bitcoin price is going up for the opposite reason. Bitcoin price shot up today precisely because the FED said they would make any despositers in Silicon Valley Bank whole. Meaning that USDC is back to having a full reserve. You're trying to argue that Bitcoin is going up for the opposite reason of why it shot up today.Anyway banks failing is not good for Bitcoin. Maybe in the long term like over the decades as Bitcoin can move to replacing fiat savings for lots of people and fiat spending for lots of people. But 3 banks going under in the past few days is not good for anything. There's a reason why Bitcoin goes down when the economy looks bad or when there is bad economic news - because investors get scared and they sell their investments. Long term Bitcoin replacing some of banking is good, but short term banks failing is definitely not good for Bitcoin as people would just panic and among other things they'd get out of Bitcoin.",

But in most cases, it's made to give an opportunity for people to get in.Look what happened to the USDC after announcing the bad news that Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. USDC got a drastic drop but after a while it went back to 1$. Just because there's a bad news it doesn't always mean that it's time to sell, sometimes it takes as an opportunity to other to buy. Therefore, I believe that BTC are now getting bullish.",

Good news for the rest of the world that they will be affected less by USD collapse the more they dump USD.

It is indeed interesting to see that as soon as a crypto exchange collapses, they are all screaming for more and stricter regulation. That's ok of course if things are going the wrong direction. But banks can collapse as they please and I wonder what the consequences are there? More regulation? Stricter? Doesn't seem like it. Though you said the US recently defaulted on their debt. I tried to find something about that but the only info I can find states that if the debt ceiling isn't raised by congress, then the US is likely to fail soon. Is there any info I missed?",

It is, of course, unpleasant when banks to something wrong and then the taxpayers unwillingly save the banks, so that banks can then enjoy more profits till they do something wrong again. And I do agree that Bitcoin is a nice alternative here, as people are always free to use their BTC and having it isn't built on any authority being allowed to experiment with your money and invest it into something. Thank being said, will the US really bail out the newly collapsed banks? I thought it would just take over the assets to ensure they can be liquidated on the market and customers can get their compensations. In fact, when I just googled Biden bailing out the banks, various (see here, here) recent news said that it's unlikely to happen and that Biden's administration isn't planning to do that. So maybe it's not that bad right now, and the overprinting issue isn't relevant in this specific case.",

Just because these banks were involved in some crypto services I have definitely seen some articles about the banks shutting down as having to do with crypto. I dunno about Silverbank, that one was more involved with crypto, but SVB and NY Signature Bank failing had nothing at all to do with crypto but some people are trying to claim it was crypto that caused them to go under.
