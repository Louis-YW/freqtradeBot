      "body": "It seems there is issue on the first hashboard just like others pointed too.I have another suggestion As the above said it can void the warranty if you touch any hardware so focus on software-related issues and maybe we can fixed/bypass this issue and let the miner run normally.First, try to run the miner at low power mode you can find this under pool configuration this works sometimes.2nd if you want to bypass and want to keep the first hashboard try to boot this unit with Braiins OS and let it ignore the 1 ASIC chip.",
