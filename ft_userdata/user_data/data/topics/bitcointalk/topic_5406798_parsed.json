  "content": "Just spent a good couple of hours signing up and doing my KYC at Gate.io, only to have a frustrating experience. The interface is a mess, all I wanted to do was buy some damn token, so I did a trial buy on the Spot Trading section using \"Limit Order\" . I wanted to buy some POLIS tokens so I looked for the right pair ( POLIS/USDT ) and using some tiny USDT funds I had there I hit the \"Buy\" button. Nearly 12 hours later my order is still \"pending\" I check my Funds Overview and I only see the Tether Icon, there's no POLIS token there or anywhere ! Also my ticket has not been answered ! WTF !! All this trouble to buy one damn token ? Am I supposed to wait 48 hours or something ? What is this ? Not impressed !",

I was using Gate.io as of 2020 but had a terrible experience with them as of that time ,then I had to dump them and use other user friendly platforms, though I don't know if there's any changes they've made so far in order to improve their platform. I suggest you should go try out this platforms when you're dealing with any centralized exchanges when carrying out your Cryptocurrency transaction, I do think they're better in my opinion. Check out the list below FTX,Binance, Kucoin.",

      "body": "Perhaps it has something to do with the specified price in the Limit Order? I am not using Gate but I am certain that using Limit Order has little to no difference compared to Binance. In Binance, there is a certain price limit you can set based on the Market Price of the asset. This means that you can't just open a buy order of $50 per coin when it is currently at a price of $75.In other words, you can't make a trade when the price you set is not close enough to the market price.",

      "body": "What token do you want to buy? It can be a shit token. Which means the token may not have a good limit order price and if you use the market order, it can be a loss if you buy it as people are not demanding for the coin and make its market price to be very low than what appears on the market. Be careful when buying shit coins, you can buy at loss. Or what limit order price did you use. For example, if you want to buy bitcoin and its price is at $22000, a limit order at 19990 will not make the order filled unless bitcoin fall back to or below that price.I checked Coinmarketcap now, Gate.io 24 hours trading volume is $1,573,557,595.23. You can check that using this link: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/gate-ioThe problem is not from Gate.io, there is something you are not getting right.",

This exchange is used by me to buy new coins, of which there are a lot on this exchange, because unlike others, Gate.io conducts a free listing. Most likely, the problem is that you have incorrectly set the price of the limit order. Since POLICE has a low trading volume, you had to take this fact into account when opening a purchase order.",

      "body": "Quite a good read. Nice !Okay so I went back to Gate and still no POLIS in my Account. And by the way, only Gate and possibly FTX have this token ( Star Atlas DAO ) that's why I went with Gate ( KYC on FTX is a bit more thorough )I guess I am not familiar with the \"Limit Order\" feature on Gate. In KuCoin, there is a Limit Order feature, which mostly I would never use, using the \"Market Order\" feature instead ( buy at whatever the current market price is ). Why doesn't Gate have this feature ? I don't even remember setting a specific price, as I've honestly never placed a limit order before, nor do I want to use this in the future after my awful experience, but just out of curiosity I went and looked at the set \"Price\" on Gate.  It's clearly $0.53. Price is now $0.58 but 24 hours ago when I set the order it would have been below $0.53 . So what gives ? Why didn't the order execute ? I still got nothing on my account, and even my Tether is gone now because it's assumed I want to go through with that order. So basically I lost my Tether and never got the POLIS token I wanted. Yes I can probably recover the Tether USDT by cancelling the order, but I sure as hell don't want to try another order now !!Drives me nuts because I also want to buy Enjinstarter, which is also only available on Gate !",
