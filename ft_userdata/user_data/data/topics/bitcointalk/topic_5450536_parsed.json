I'm not sure, but that usually is a big indicator. Another point made in the article is that the increased amounts of BTC held on exchanges might renew investors confidence following the FTX collapse 'late last year' trying to make it seem like it was forever ago lol.

Just wondering how an increase in the amount of Bitcoins held in an exchange \"renews\" investor's confidence?Besides that, such stats mostly mean nothing because at the end of the day when the Bitcoins are sold, they just change hands to a new person who will hold them. It's not like they are going to be dumped somewhere in an exchange black hole in return for cash, never to be seen again",

Cheers, TREAD93It's not something special to hear that Binance hold that amount of Bitcoin because it's currently the top exchange in crypto world. Investors are still not satisfied even with such good news because the fear has somewhat made a home in their brain. It's really hard to go with crypto again for many of the investors who were almost bankrupted by some scam projects.I still believe that investors will at least consider Bitcoin as a viable option for long term investment because it has been performing up to the expectations of many investors and they might be speculating the price of Bitcoin for now to take some bold decisions later on. But, I'm hopeful that soon those investors will put their money into it as their confidence increases on it, until then I don't see huge investments coming to Bitcoin as of now.",

The recent crash of FTX or Luna isn't the first, we've had different crashes in previous bear seasons. It can be said that every time bear season comes, the collapse of some organizations is inevitable. So I don't think this will demoralize investors, everyone is just waiting for the bull season and just once the bull season comes, everyone will quickly forget everything. Regarding regulations, whether FTX collapses or not, regulations will also come, that is inevitable because the government can never let us be free forever. For me, regulation is bad, not good at all.",

Another point made in the article is that the increased amounts of BTC held on exchanges might renew investors confidence following the FTX collapse 'late last year' trying to make it seem like it was forever ago lol. There are two things I can’t deduce from this, it’s either the bitcoin was transferred to binance by those heavily involved in trading on centralized exchanges with features of like spot trading and future trading, or many people sold off their Alticoins to purchase the bitcoin which is clearly a good idea. But one thing that is alarming is the fact that people have returned back to trusting the centralized exchanges in holding their bitcoin again after all the saga caused by the FTX scandal. Personal I see this as a bad thing because people haven’t learn their lessons that it is best to have control of one’s funds than trusting even the top exchange. FTX was ranked third on list of top exchanges and still got into trouble same thing happened to Mt.Gox then, so i don’t see anything good in trusting binance once again",

On the one hand centralized exchanges are not ideal, they deviate from the initial idea of Bitcoin, they require KYC and they can sell your data or hackers can steal it. On the other hand, they are largely responsible for the price rising from less than a penny to tens of thousands of dollars because of the great liquidity they provide.Quote from: Zaguru12 on April 29, 2023, 02:31:59 AMBut one thing that is alarming is the fact that people have returned back to trusting the centralized exchanges in holding their bitcoin again after all the saga caused by the FTX scandal.

What are your thoughts on this?I can't say anything about what indications might arise when there are lots of bitcoin on the exchange. But yes, all those bitcoins might be sold or maybe just used as FUD to make traders panic. In this case the number of bitcoin will decrease over time as they will be withdrawn to the wallet of each trader or investor regardless of whether it has changed hands or may have been withdrawn by the same user to their respective depository wallet.The increasing number of bitcoins on the exchange can also be considered a reason why the exchange has such a good reputation, but who knows if Binance owns most of them? We can only speculate as to what might happen, but a centralized exchange is not a safe place in the long term regardless of who believes it.",

But it could also be manipulation by big players. To try to create a bit of panic in the market. But I personally wouldn't be too affected by this. because I keep bitcoins for long term. but for those who are day traders on the stock then maybe they will be a little affected by such indications.",

What are your thoughts on this?Of course, with all these regulations or any incidents related to FTX Exchange, are important right now in the cryptocurrency market. We must look closer on it because it will help the Bitcoin adoption, because I believe that in short term, the effect of these may be a huge but in the long run, you will not feel it. A lot of FUD spreading right now especially on exchanges.Challeng on exchanges right now are how they will gain trust of a lot of people after incidents of lot of centralized exchanges recently.",

With time these charts will only begin to look so much better to consumers and investors alike and so many anti bitcoin folk will have to eat their words and realize that they can't find anything more secure and advantageous to their own financial well being than owning bitcoin and being in full control of your own private bank.",

A market analyst perspective may only be a reminder as from Matrixport who warned that the rise could be an indicator of the imminent large-scale selling of Bitcoin meaning that anyone entering the market should be considered and monitored.Also in my view, given the current climate of fraud and fraud within the crypto market is a valid concern, and calls for increased regulation could be both positive and negative developments. On the one hand, regulations can help reduce fraud and increase stability in markets. On the other hand, overly or poorly designed regulations can stifle innovation and growth in markets.",

There is also another fact to consider which is that Binance is mainly an altcoin exchange and majority of people trade altcoins with their bitcoins (they want profit on the bitcoin they own). With the recent market activity there has been an increased altcoin pump and dumps taking place in Binance, that means a lot of altcoin traders started moving their bitcoins to Binance so that they can participate in these altcoin pump and dumps. Hence the increased amount of bitcoin on Binance.",

That doesn't make sense to me. They would take some action and not just risk deposits in a place that could go bankrupt, but not selling, only parking it there. Who would deposit loads of Bitcoin to then just wait and do nothing. I think we would have seen much more selling pressure if it was investors lining up to sell. Especially when they realize that others are depositing for that reason as well.",
