The attacker had access to BATM user privileges and was also able to access the database, read and decrypt API keys used to access funds in hot wallets and exchanges. In addition, the hacker could download usernames, access their password hashes, turn off 2FA, and send funds from hot wallets.Bitcoin.com News spoke with a U.S.-based cryptocurrency automated teller machine (ATM) operator who confirmed that all U.S. operators using General Bytes machines were shut down nationwide for the evening. The operator also mentioned that servers would have to be rebuilt from the ground up, which can be a lengthy process",

This attack hit almost everything possible, databases, usernames and access to password hashes either the attacker was too sophisticated or their systems really needed to be rebuilt from scratch.The stolen value is negligible compared to 9k machines",

There is something fishy about this story If I remember correctly, there was recently another case of another big Bitcon ATM shutting down their service, so I am starting to think all BitcoinATM companies are under attack by gov-agencies and their ''hackers''.Let's see if General Bytes will come back and reopen their service or it is shut down forever, but other BATM operators need to seriously improve security to avoid this remote attacks.",
