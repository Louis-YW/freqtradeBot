And if more hashrate come to the network, the difficulty adjust and the DAG grow is back to normal. But no nothing was released for KAWPOW algo, Network hashrate is stable, no peak.",

I think non-Video card tools have been releasedThe size of the DAG file is growing according to the plan of the developers. On graphics cards with 6 GB memory, you can mine until Q1 2027, and on graphics cards with 8 GB memory until the beginning of Q4 2030. It also depends on your operating system, because Windows uses up to 350 megabytes of video card RAM and Linux systems use several megabytes.If you have a 4 GB video card, then it is high time to change it or look for other coins, but I doubt that you will find anything with a good profit.https://minerstat.com/dag-size-calculator",
