Price fluctuations have determined their fate and you can probably find a lot of information about anyone who got rich in the last decade because of bitcoin.Quote from: math09183 on August 01, 2022, 06:02:35 PMWhat about others?

Are they crazy rich living in their own castles or did they lost their coins,They don't tell you how many bitcoins they have in their wallet, just speculating about them might not solve the problem you want to know about. But I can say that there are quite a number of traders and investors in this forum. They are rich because of bitcoin, but anyway we don't know how much.",

More money doesn't ensure that someone becomes rich, as a matter of fact if one suddenly runs into huge money without financial wisdom and discipline, he/she is at the danger of running into debts from an unplanned lifestyle. Early adopters have become rich if they still possess the bitcoins they purchased then when bitcoins was affordable to almost everyone.",

Aside from being an early adopter, it takes a lot of trust, determination, and patience to actually become very rich as an early btc invsetor.",

A lot of them probably sold even before bitcoin gained the traction that it needed in order to keep breaking records. Those who are considered as early adopters but aren't rich may have sold their coins along the way. I was in the game when bitcoin was around $200. Bought some during those times and kinda forget that I have some bitcoin lying around on a mobile wallet and sold those at 2017. Until then I'm just rebuilding the stash but was tempted to sell at $65k and hoping to rebuild my stash again. Am I rich? Far from it. But one thing is for certain though: those bitcoin profits that I have had helped me settle in an extremely comfortable position for my personal finances.
