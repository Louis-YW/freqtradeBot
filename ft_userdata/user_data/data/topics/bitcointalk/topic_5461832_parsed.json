So either people are not aware of it yet or may be there's something that I am missing.Sources:https://www.instagram.com/p/CvX8Gt8M5pT/?igshid=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng%3D%3Dhttps://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/896233",

There are two reasons behind it, the first Indian government and the second Uber Indian drivers. It seems now days they are asking more money than what Uber app is asking. I have recently shifted to Rapido from Uber & Ola as I found them better.",

I didn't face it with Uber but damn these Ola drivers keep asking for more money than the estimated fare.Also, I see this happening in selective cities only. Not all cities are facing this issue though.The amount they ask is at least 20% of the estimate fare which is insane.",

      "body": "Uber cannot accept bitcoin in India. For a simple reason - Indian government didn't make Bitcoin a legal tender. So legally you can't pay in Bitcoin for a product or service. Similarly no merchant can offer to accept bitcoin as a payment method. Uber can probably make it work in some countries but it's not at a great news for Bitcoin. It will make bitcoin more centralized and eventually big corporates will gain power to control the market. Not ideal.",

Initially it'll just be in American or probably European countries which are slightly crypto friendly and only after it is able to asses the success of this payment method that it'll bring to other countries. problem isn't only on the customer side, governments will be afraid that Uber might take away it's earnings directly outside the country using Cryptos and no country would want that to happen.",

Depending on the success of this payment system they would do a systematic roll out globally. I still don't think they would be able to use it in India. I do agree such a gesture by Uber would help Bitcoin mass adoption though.",

I do agree such a gesture by Uber would help Bitcoin mass adoption though. I don't think mass adoption will be this easy, first thing is how convenient will they be able to make this payment system. Because if you see bitcoin fees and transaction times are pretty high. Which means no one would be willing to pay additional fees for their ride fare unless they deeply want to pay using bitcoin. Also the time is an issue as well, so practical issues is always something that I look forward to whenever someone talks about bitcoin mass adoption.",

It will definitely take a good amount of time for crypto mass adoption.I personally think when few giant companies get into crypto only then adoption will start slowly and gradually increase.Coming to transaction time and fees, don't you think people can use lightning network on daily basis to overcome these issues.For example: Once a user setup lightning channel with Uber he will be able to make fast and cheap payments as long as he continues to use Uber.",

I consider manipulation to be an inseparable part of markets (whether it be crypto or otherwise) and I see no negative in people/entities purchasing BTC — someone buys, someone sells. At one side we want adoption while at the same time we say no to companies who can bring more people in market. Bigger pockets always influence the economy, there is no alternative.",

If we want global adoption then big companies will surely have to get involved with crypto.If big companies are getting involved with crypto they will make sure to stay in profits even if they have to manipulate the market.I think this has been happening with almost every market. Big players usually know how the market will behave when they throw big money in the market.Blackrock has applied for an ETF and there are rumors that the recent dump in BTC price was because Blackrock wanted to buy at a cheaper price.Although we can't believe these rumors but from one perspective, Blackrock does have enough capital to manipulate the market.",
