You can find some good clocks for the start at hashrate.no.",

And you using Nicehash quickminer so i am right  AMD or Nvidia doesn´t matter, on every gpu brand you have good and bad cards, but the newest releases from both manufacturer are very equal in OC.I know now dudes will come and say - AMD hotter and such shit.

Sorry guys but thats bullshit and i am out of a discussion about this subject.Anybody who thinks AMD video cards have bad thermal performance is an idiot. Look at NGreedia's GDDR6X models, which have thermal pad issues that actually limit mining hashrate. I have an RTX 3080 Ti that can only do 85 Mh without the VRAM being 100° C. I owned so many models of AMD cards in the past, including the RX 400/500 series and the RX 6800's. Not a single one out of 300 or so cards had a thermal issue or produced too much heat.I tend to buy low-end nVidia cards like the RTX 3060/3060 Ti because they have GDDR6, the efficiency is almost as good as high-end Ampere, and they're good at non-ETH algorithms. If you only care about ETH, then AMD/nVidia are equal since the 100% LHR unlock was released. Choose the model with the best balance of efficiency & hashrate/dollar. But never buy the RTX 3070 Ti or higher.",

We need to see one first before using Nvidia to compare, AMD is avoiding gddr6x probably because of the heat issue who knows?",

HBM memory is very expensive, so it's mostly used for servers. The only consumer AMD cards that have it are the RX Vega, Radeon VII or R9 Fury (which is obsolete). These cards are either old or bad at non-ETH coins.2 months ago, I bought old nVidia Tesla P100 cards because I thought they had great memory bandwidth (732 GB/s) and would get 70 Mh/s on ETH for a cheap price. But I was wrong, as the Pascal TLB bug limited them to 31.5 Mh @ 110w. I could not OC the core to get a higher hashrate since it was locked to 1328 MHz. They did get 57 Mh on ETC though or 138 Mh on ERG.",
