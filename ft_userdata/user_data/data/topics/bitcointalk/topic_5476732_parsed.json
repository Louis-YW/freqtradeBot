Yesterday when our supper falcons play their last group stage match, I suffer find where I go watch am tire but I no see, na so so update their Facebook page de drop, e no really make sense aswr.While I been de school, I was a part of my school team and from a first hand experience we de get zero support from the school even when each student de pay 5k for sports fee. You no get better ball, cone no de, and beep to use train de worry, and even field when school team suppose use train, them go sell am give outsiders and the team go just de confused and stranded.We still get a very long way to go but if we fit at least work on one sharp channel when go de project Nija sport, e no go bad, and the thing be say we like Sports wetin no good so why the unnecessary carelessness and lack of concern for this sector?",

Naija na we country  and I love our country but the truth be say our country no dey try when it comes to Sports. How many better stadium we get for this country? The government no dey really look eye that side because them no believe say football or sports fit benefit them directly so them no dey invest for that side.Them no need tell you before you know say our government greedy come still dey selfish join, if no be something wey go fit benefit benefit them directly, them no go put body. You dey talk about South African sports, if them tell you how much them dey invest for their Sports, your leg go first shake. Na e make if you watch them play for TV, e dey be like say na Pro football you dey watch.If our government and top men for this country look eye for that sector, you go see say change go enter asap, you self go confirm am.",
