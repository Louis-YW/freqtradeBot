But if they could buy it while using a decentralized exchange like \"Bisq\" and store the funds in a hardware wallet, I bet you nobody can discover they have such an amount in Bitcoin.",

Binance and cryptocurrency banned in Nigeria, but the citizens looked for a way to participate in cryptocurrency, that's the existence of P2P which served a crucial contribution and function for nigerians. The government know every single detail of cryptocurrency, they have it stores in their heavy gigantic portfolio but they denied the common Nigerians to invest. Nigerian politicians are corrupt and they embezzled national finance inother to satisfied their selfish desires. We know them and I'm getting use to their operation.",

Do you think that the monies they have embezzled are not traceable? They are. They siphon it through their own companies, that of their relatives and with the help of other external bodies.  The security agencies know this but their hands are tied because their bosses are in bed with these politicians and any attempt to expose them will get them fired. What pains me most about our security agencies is that they are not independent. Imagine politicians using EFCC, DSS, ICPC to harass anyone who steps on their toes? In the case of bitcoin, it is traceable. One thing we must know is that if these security agencies sit on your matter, they will dig out whatever bitcoin gotten through illicit and illegal means.

If they use a centralised exchange to steal the funds into, they can easily be caught since those exchanges require KYC, but they could still probably use another persons account to avoid been suspicious. Another way they can be caught even when they use a decentralised exchange is when they disclose their wallet address. Any funds that comes into such wallets can be noticed and traced to their accounts. But with the level of smartness by our politicians, they’ll still breach this and steal public funds without fear of being caught.",
