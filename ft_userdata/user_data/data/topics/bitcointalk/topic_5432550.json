  "content": "I don't know how to describe this emotion, but every year that passes seems progressively worse than the previous one in a variety of ways. The last few years seem to be going downhill, with something unpleasant occurring every single year. In 2020 and 2021, we suffered enough with Covid-19, in 2022, we thought that we'd possibly get a break, but nope, the war started on February, which was followed by excessive inflation and an economic recession.We're now entering 2023, and things aren't looking any better. Inflation keeps worsening, energy and oil prices are extremely volatile, while in our case in Greece and Italy, despite MWH being the cheapest it has been since the invasion, we're holding the record for the most expensive energy prices.On top of that, a few days before 2023, half of the U.S.A. is suffering a terrible blizzard, with temperatures even reaching as low as -50C. Climate change is real, and it's only going to get worse in the following years. I'm not sure if everything has gone downhill in the past few years or if I'm overexaggerating and making it sound worse than it really is. Perhaps my sitting all alone in my bed on New Year's Eve isn't helping.Anyway, happy new year to everyone and good luck on your bitcoin endeavors!",

Problems, crisis, climate changes and conflicts have always been present in a global level every years, but we tend to over-absorb all these negative news when we are in a bad mood and discontented with our own lives, especially during Christmas and New Year, when it should be the happiest moment of the year, to be shared with people we love reciprocally.Quote from: Ultegra134 on December 31, 2022, 06:25:13 PMAnyway, happy new year to everyone and good luck on your bitcoin endeavors!Happy New Year to you as well! That 2023 may be different in a personal level, because the problems of the world aren't solvable!",

Since 2018 every year seems to have topped each other on how crappy they are. When you finally think that this can't get any worse you get global epidemic, war, possible recession. Now i am in disbelief figuring out that how this could get any worse and not counting out the nuclear winter anymore. Then again we were riding high and in terms of TA recession was needed for correction. And it needs heavy fundamental reasons to move the markets. Now when that's happened, we can get back up soon?",

      "body": "You're not wrong when you say that each passing year is worse than the previous one, but you're not wholly correct either.It depends on which metrics and standards you're comparing from the passing year and the previous year. While it's a given that the economic conditions will continue to worsen as we enter a new year, there are also some aspects that may get better, such as technology, our knowledge in a lot of things, etc.But yeah, generally each passing year beats the previous one in a pretty negative way. 2022 was worse than 2021, especially the prices of a lot of food and necessity. Heck, a lot of middle-class families I know opted to just do a drive thru and ordered some food instead of cooking their own in New Year's Eve, which is pretty telling of how expensive it is to cook your own food as of the moment when you're trying to celebrate for an occasion. Hopefully 2023 turns this around, although with what 2022 left behind, I doubt we're in a position to really overcome what we've just went through that easily. Russia-Ukraine war is still raging, prices keep on soaring, and a lot of uncertainty in the public regarding their futures is looming.Anyway, here's to hoping for a better 2023. Happy New Year everyone!",

Even though COVID itself ended in 2021, the amount of money countries spent to keep their economies alive while young, able-bodied workers were not allowed to work will have impacted the global economy for years.The war is partly responsible for the energy price hikes, but just about everything else has at least some trace back to the COVID hysteria where trillions were wiped from the global economy because the government found it prudent to keep people locked in their homes and disallowed them from working.

If you're thinking now is a bad time because of fuel prices or the Russian invasion, you probably weren't around for the last time something similar happened or it wasn't as documented as what's currently happening is (you didn't have as many facts and couldn't derive as many conclusions from it).It's like the difference between watching a film as a kid and thinking \"that had a really happy ending\" to watching it as an adult and thinking \"that hasn't ended at all there's going to be a lot more to that story\" or \"that didn't end how I wanted it to, it's happy if you just focus on the ending as a static image, but if you try to imagine the next few hours, days or weeks, it won't be so happy\".I made a topic on here a few years ago about whether it was worth getting a higher income from a more intensive job than the one I had at the time and a lot of the responses were \"no\" because expenses often rise to match incomes - I think this applicable to these world stories too. The results of what you expect are being constantly diminished so your going to start to expect less in the hopes it keeps you sane (it might be best to find the best, the neutral and the worst outcomes from situations and try to accept those in advance before they happen).",

If you look at it from one year to the next, you might have that impression, but if you look at 30 years ago, where there was hardly any internet use, no cell phones, or 100 years ago where the world had just come out of one world war, was heading for another and global hunger and malnutrition was much more common, you will realize that we are doing better, much better. If you happen to look at what was happening 1,000 years ago, you might faint from shock.In the end, much of the blame for this lies with the market economy, letting people get rich if they produce useful goods and services for the rest of the people, which is something that pessimistic ideologies about the trajectory of humanity do not usually like.",

QuoteContributing author: Allison ReserClimate change continues to increase the rate of extreme weather events, disrupt ecosystems, and cause sea levels to rise, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The recent United in Science report compiled by the United Nations estimates that in April, daily global fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions dropped by 17 percent as a result of national lockdowns and confinement due to COVID-19. But by June, daily CO2 emissions rebounded to within five percent of pre-pandemic levels.The United Nations deems climate change the defining crisis of our times and according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, 54 percent of adults in the United States are alarmed or concerned about climate change.“Whatever scale, people want to address this, they want to do something, they want to feel empowered, they want to feel effective, and the best way to do that is to get together and share what everyone knows,” environmental activist and founder of Project Drawdown Paul Hawken tells Food Tank.Fortunately, there are hundreds of organizations around the globe who are working collaboratively and inclusively to find solutions.

And many problems that are happening in the world, including the Covid-19 pandemic, in my opinion, have not been 100% resolved. And also the Russian-Ukrainian war which I think is very prominent news and resulted in soaring inflation in various countries.",

Compare food prices and you'd see. Where I come from, the year 2020 was regarded as the worst since we had to battle with COVID-19 in the first half of the year and massive protests which affected lives and properties in the second. I've just learnt to take life as I see it, not really expecting much.",

Here we are dominated by holders of crypto assets and we all know how the storm has been through during the covid 19 pandemic. Now 2023 is still quite early and the impact of inflation in 2022 will continue in this new year. In addition to anticipating and learning how we manage finances very carefully. Reducing unnecessary purchases and continuing to invest in trusted assets while still preparing an emergency fund. The global economic war between major countries has a significant impact on all financial sectors.",
