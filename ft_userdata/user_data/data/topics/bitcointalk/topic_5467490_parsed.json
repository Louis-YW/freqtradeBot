My heart palpitates during this bet and I really love the intense feeling. Most of the time I lose on this but it's really worth it if I win since I recover my original bankroll plus sweet profit of 20% of my bankroll. I'm always doing this whenever I'm down after long gambling session just to finish with a big bang of surprise. When I lose at least I experience the thrill same with win since I have profit. Are you doing this intense gambling experience by betting significant amount of your bankroll? This is insane but worth it if you are a thrill seeker for entertainment.",

But you should know that the strategy is very risky. You can start with $0.5 and increase it in a way if you win the next round, you will recover your initial losses and make some profit.But if you are the type that prefer to spend long hours in betting, the strategy may not be for you.",

The win will be satisfying especially when it's the last one after the losing streak when you apply the martingale. Yep, I have done this and sometimes regret comes after losing it all.I couldn't remember how many times I tried this but it always lost it all. Sometimes I win but the next few hours, the house takes it all back.",

Are you doing this intense gambling experience by betting significant amount of your bankroll? This is insane but worth it if you are a thrill seeker for entertainment.Definitely, I guess it's just the quest for gamblers to get the thrill from time to time. Of course, it might not be good for us in the end specially losing this big money bet. Or if you really wanted to chase some losses and so you increase your bet with that significant amount that you might not used to it or haven't done it before.And so everything is based on what card you gonna get, or where the ball and what number it's gonna land if you are playing roulette, or if you will get 21 in black. So it's going to be intense and those adrenaline are going to pump in your body that you will not recall what time it is.Â  . Last night I have this kind of runs, like playing 6 hours straight in a land based casinos.",

I've seen people do the same strategy in different games but they decide to keep going when they get lucky on that final bet unless they really have something else to do or when their wife is already mad hehe.",

This is insane but worth it if you are a thrill seeker for entertainment.I've done that too!After you're already \"tired\" of playing, and with your balance almost exhausted, it's more fun to make an all-in bet than to just make ridiculously small bets and only prolong the pain of losing and having your account gradually become zero.Betting everything you have left will result in two outcomes:- Stop playing in style, knowing that everything was really lost, and after that being \"free\" to do something else without any worries in mind;- Earn good money and \"reestablish faith\" in the game, having new enthusiasm to continue playing a little longer without the need to place small bets.However, lately, when my balance is small, I like to spend the rest I have from sports betting on slot-machine's style that are much more fun even with small bets.",

When I am down to that percentage that you mentioned I try to prolong the playing experience and just also try to maximize the wager amount as best as I could. That way, when the weekly bonus comes I will have enough to wager again. Also, I am too scared now to make a big bet when it comes to casino games but when it is about sports, I will definitely go for it especially if the game I am betting for is where I am comfortable with. Analysis could enhance the winning chance and I will take that rather than put the risk against the house.",

Doing this type of bet always ends my session very early, and i'd rather play with the same bet size until the end because you never know if you could get a winning streak and steadily recover your losses. It also becomes a learning experience because I view these aggressive plays as mistakes.

I'd rather advise others to stick to reasonable betting. I don't know with you, but I often do this with a bit of frustration. Whenever I'm on a losing streak, I have the tendency to go rough, to gamble in its most literal sense. I'm looking for gambling; this is it! It's like challenging the unfortunate gambling session: make me broke or give me back all of my money! I don't know if you also share this, but whenever I spend hours gambling and the session is about to end and I'm still breakeven, it makes me a bit annoyed. It seems like I'd rather close the session with a loss than being breakeven. It's as if all those hours are nothing if my money is the same as when I started the session. It's like I haven't gambled at all.",

Are you doing this intense gambling experience by betting significant amount of your bankroll? This is insane but worth it if you are a thrill seeker for entertainment.It is indeed an extremely risky move and sure it will race your heart. It would certainly give you a high-intensity adrenaline kick if you win. The chance of which is 75% lesser if you think it in the other way. At the moment you are running for the 25% chance and if you are happy with it then you can continue. This is an unsustainable approach over time and you need to keep track of your bankroll. Â The correct way would be to stop after a certain loss limit as your method won't help you to recover your losses. In my opinion, this is a risky approach over time, it may result in financial loss and therefore you need to keep track of your bankroll.",
