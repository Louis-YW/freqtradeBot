You can integrate its API on your website easily to automate the payments. The Lightning charge can automate invoices without any issue. It can automate the invoice anonymously and it doesn't even requires the details of the customer. You should definitely give it a try, and I'm sure it will solve your problem. I will provide you the link of the Lightning charge below, you should visit the link and learn more about this amazing payment processor. https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning-chargeYou can also try OpenNode as that will serve the purpose as well, but I won't recommend that one as it's not open-source and it also requires customer details.",

[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444578.0Simply put, I need an LN payment to be made for every sale by an affiliate.  Eg you integrate the link with ref.  code of my store on your site and if you automatically generate a sale you instantly receive the due percentage.  How to automate this without using LNURL?",

If so, then:You could ask them to provide a lightning address[1] (looks like an email) during the registration process and then you can use the ZBD API[2] to send them payments.[1] https://lightningaddress.com/[2] https://documentation.zebedee.io/docs/pay-to-lnaddress/",
