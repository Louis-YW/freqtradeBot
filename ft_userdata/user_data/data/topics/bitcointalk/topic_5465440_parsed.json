  "content": "Bitcoiners do not care at all about using cryptocurrency mining to solve an important scientific problem because Bitcoiners generally have very low levels of intelligence. In the past before 2017, Bitcoin was still a novel idea, so Bitcoiners on average probably had a higher level of intelligence. But now that Bitcoin has become more mainstream, it has attracted a lot of dumb people who know nothing. Now, it is really difficult to find a Bitcoiner who is intelligent enough to understand that Bitcoin's mining algorithm was never designed to advance science. Bitcoiners usually hate science very much because they are braindead doofuses.",

Then they will start using the excess electrical power as another form of cryptocurrency, directly, without converting it to Bitcoin or an altcoin. Might not be your kind of science. But it's still science.",

      "body": "Many Bitcoiners may prioritise the financial benefits of mining cryptocurrencies over the scientific purposes.  Although some Bitcoiners are more concerned with prospective financial advantages, others may be more  interested in delving into the technological breakthroughs and future applications of blockchain technology. For the time being, I don't believe the enabling atmosphere or platform is in place. But, of course, if we continue to debate such concerns and raise awareness, we will, sooner or later, begin to tackle problems in that direction.Hosting up conferences, symposiums, or forums to emphasise the benefits of mining cryptos to advance science will go a long way.",

      "body": "OgNasty-It is easily doable. But the problem is that it requires EDUCATION. And education is lacking. I was a professor, so I know that universities promote violence. Universities have provided people with very little education. Universities have instead deceived people into thinking that they know something when in reality they know absolutely nothing at all. In fact, universities have deceived people into thinking they are educated just because they have met a lot of weirdos. WHAT A BUNCH OF CHLURMCKLETS!!! Since people and especially Bitcoiners lack education, they have absolutely no way of knowing whether an idea is good or not. And without this recognition, we do not advance science.BADecker-That makes no sense at all. Electricity should be used to do something as useful as possible. Yes. Cryptocurrencies are useful. But so is solving the most important scientific problem. Why would you refuse to solve the most important scientific problem for absolutely no reason at all?iBaba-That makes no sense. Do people honestly think that they can get rich by refusing to solve the most important scientific problem? That sounds like crazy-talk to me.",

Probably you have your own definition of \"Bitcoiner\" ??People just order ASIC, plug it into the socket, configure a bit, and start mining. Same thing about GPU mining. It's basically plug-and-play without needing to know the technical behind the algorithm. Everyone with any educational background can mine, that's the beauty of this system. It's all the same with the wallet, private key, etc., now users are just to be users. I am pretty sure bitcoiners who are more on the development side already working on their thing, it will probably advance science if they are successful.",

It is foolish.Hello, Dr Joseph.Nice to know you are still around sharing your ideas and thoughts with us.I had talked about the necessity of Education before with other people online, it was not within the context of technology or Bitcoin, but that is not relevant for this conversation. After talking about with with a person from the United States I was told that under the Constitution of such country people actually have the right to be ignorant or clueless about things which are not of their importance, hence in a practical sense/ legal stand point one cannot be imprisoned because ones lack of knowledge, am I right?So it would better to find a different approach to push forward and improve as society, convincing people there are things which are good to be learnt is harder but more constructive that an aggressive solution as locking people up may sound in the hears of many.Talking about Thermodynamics and getting catching the attention of regular citizens is difficult, so instead let us talk about its benefits so they will be prompted to seek for books themselves.",

If there is no difference I would like to know that is indeed a word you created or it is an actual variation from where you live. Also, Doctor, you mention that the Constitution of the United States can be changed (I suppose you are talking about a constitutional Referendum) but much of the population of that country see the Constitution as a sacred document which should not be altered and managing to charge some of the articles on it which set the liberties of people (like freedom or speech or the right to bear arms) would be a sensitive enough topic to start civil unrest in the country. The American society is already quite divided, changing one of the most importants documents in national politics wont help with that ...",
