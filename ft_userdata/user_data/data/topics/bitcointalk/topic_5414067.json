      "body": "It is commonly just used by traders to trade bitcoin and ether directly without converting one first to a stable coin. Some traders also like to go for ETHBTC margin trading as I can see the pair on margin account on the exchanges I am using. But for people to trade unstable coins for profit like this using margin ratio, I do not have any idea of the reason they are going for it. As for me, i prefer going for unstable coins paired with stable coins, like BTCUSDT.",

(Or any other ratio where two coins are compared. ) So what does it tell you? Why some people look at it. Traders make profit from comparing two trading pairs. The difference in their price ratio determine if the will be in profit or loss. In layman's term it is a way to decide if they will buy the pair, sell it or avoid trading those pairs. Just like the BTC/ETH pairs when the one can predict BTC could go long against ETH and if their prediction goes right the take some profit else the record their loss. Remember the bigger coin comes first when comparing the ratio. The bigger coin serves as the base while the other the quote coin",

Bitcoin and Ethereum are the 2 major currencies in crypto that’s why many traders are paying importance only to this 2 coin during bear market when they want to trade. The ratio is just a reference of crypto traders that don’t want to base there holdings on fiat and stocking there holdings in crypto unit only. Don’t get confused with this pair if you don’t care to view your holdings in crypto quantity than fiat. I still preferred fiat for a more stable reference.",

Anything else is just noise, and I'm discounting stablecoins.ETH pumps relative to BTC during any moments in demand that can be seen with the ebb and flow of the ICO market, the NFT market and anything else that has or will happen. It's probably one of the most reliable indicators to it's present level of technology and use of the Ethereum network.It makes a lot of sense too for people that don't price things in fiat currencies any more. If your goal is to own the most, say, Bitcoin, irrespective of $USD price, you may own more or less Bitcoin depending on Ethereum that you hold.",

I believe in \"the more the merrier concept\" and ordinarily like more people coming into this game. I'm not against other cryptocurrencies. You missed my point or I didn't state it correctly. But they objectively don't mean anything in the grand scheme of things presently. BTC/ETH are barely a blip on the financial radar. What significance do you think some sub 10B has on the greater economy?And also, personally, I think the most likely future, say 20 years from now, has multiple winners. Perhaps 5 or even more cryptocurrencies with their own unique functions similar to the modern economy. But for now, there are only two likely winners. That being BTC/ETH. Any other crypto that you could name is probably under 5% to succeed in the long run.",

They won't be called like that for no reasons but that can simply mean that they also have a value other than their price of course. It can be true that some of them are only just a noise or hype as others called it but let's admit it that they still did some contributions. They magnet many people in here and even those people lose because of them, they still be able to learn their lesson and now choose only the most worthy coins in this market.For the OP, using a ratio is important when building a portfolio.
