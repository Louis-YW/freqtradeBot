  "content": "Good day fellow degens,I would like to introduce my very first pet project www.web3ramen.com. It is a platform with free-to-use web3 tools to manage risk and protect yourself from potential scams/rugs especially in the wild wild west of DeFi.Officially launched on 1st January 2023. So it's less than a month old. At this point of time, there is only revoke token allowances tool. I'm adding more networks as time goes by with the short term goal to support 30+ EVM chains. Next tool that I'm aiming to put in would be the honeypot token checker, and would need some time to tweak it to achieve high % rate of detecting honeypot tokens.Hope you guys could give it a try and share me your thoughts and feedback. Also, do let me know what kind of tools that might be useful for your DeFi experience. I'll seriously consider it, of course, depending on my ability.Language wise, it supports ENGLISH, CHINESE and SPANISH for now.For those who do not know what is revoke token allowances tool, FAQ here. https://web3ramen.com/faqÂ  CheesyCurrently, i'm thinking about portfolio checker across 30+ EVM chains, emergency withdrawal? LP breaker? Honeypot checker is 2nd tool in the pipeline. And open to ideas. GrinThank you and cheers.",
