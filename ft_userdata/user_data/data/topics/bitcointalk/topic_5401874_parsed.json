Good at the beginning disappointing at the end, I believe this is the average user's skepticism. Is this another sneaky way of slowly accumulating bitcoins somewhere and when it becomes a lot and then locking it up by changing strict rules for \"minimizing illicit activities\" reasons?The government can do anything with the force of law, companies must comply or the license will be revoked.",

No other account questions will be asked.  If you receive a call requesting information other than your Zip Code, please DO NOT COMPLY and contact your financial institution immediately.",

When users sell their BTC for extra funds, the company uses spot exchange rates from third-party sites like Coinmarketcap without margin.Maybe they get a cut from the merchant fees of mastercard?",

Used to be you could just sign up with an email online and get all kinds of debit cards -- it's free money for the issuer as they charge you well high on reloads and fees. Now you do need to provide more info -- billing address proof, name, but I'm pretty sure it's still possible to get gift card type debit cards that don't bear a name.As nullama points out above too, virtual cards still don't need a name.
