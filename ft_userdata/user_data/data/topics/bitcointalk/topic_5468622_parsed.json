If a holiday is during weekend, it would be shifted to Monday. If you can call the president bubu, what should we call you for bringing this kind of useless topic?",

If you can call the president bubu, what should we call you for bringing this kind of useless topic?Okay tell me why you said is useless Charles-Tim? Was it not same thing you commented here I said above or was it because I used bubu instead of tinubu. Well the reason I refers him as Tinubu is because there is no different between their two and I don't see any reason you should ref this topic as useless. If you aren't info of this and you think Monday can be a day for transactions via counter then such person will miss. And besides you can see my title clearly where I said for 24hrs...Abeg mind the way you roll your tongue",

Not anything negative. I know everybody get him own opinion when it comes to things like this and everyone go want make him/her opinion carry weight. But thing be say, i no really see wetin dey wrong for this matter, since na human beings (Nigerians) too like you dey work for those banks and dem too need rest, and enjoy the rare joy and reverence wey such event they bring once in every year.October 1st na the day wey Nigerian collect freedom on top white people wey come colonize us move our properties dem, legally and illegally go their own country to go develop themselves con leave us inside the mess wey we dey today. At least, Nigerian people, our leaders of then, who are the very true-spirited leaders wey we get dem, stand up against those oppression con help us collect our independence, diplomatically.I believe say October 1st na one event way every brethren and progressive Nigerian go dey happy about. Hence the cause for the public holiday. So, I personally no see anything wrong with them closing for just 1 day. No forget say, even as them close, them ATM booths still dey open to collect cash.Thank Almighty say we also get access to cashless society where you fit do virtually everything for your phone and POS, if you are left with no other option – in worst case scenario. So for somebody like me, I no really see any problem inside so far as dem go leave cash inside their ATM machines for that day.",

      "body": "I don't see any special effect that this has on the people. We have been having national holidays every now and then. The last few days being Wednesday, there was a holiday, and the banking system was not excluded. In celebration of Nigeria's independence, we don't expect some sectors to enjoy the freedom, and some are working their asses out. This should just be seen as any other holiday we have in a while, and the reason for the holdiday being reasonable enough is not as if one cannot make use of their mobile banking; the only thing that's affected is that the banking sectors won't be open that very day, and it's not just the banks; some official workers who are government employees won't also be in office that day. It's just a day to enjoy and spread the freedom they believe we achieved 64 years ago. Let's just consider it a little free time given to workers to enjoy their time with their family and friends at home and enjoy the air and space of freedom.",

Me self I even suggest that apart from dates that are fixed for public holidays , Nigeria as a country needs to set aside some days for workers to rest just like some other western countries does.Moreover, shutting down banks for 24 hours shouldn't bother us as so many medium of monetary transactions have been made available for us online. So it shouldn't be an issue to us at all my people",

I don't think it will have an impact with the businesspeople. To be honest, we shouldn't criticize the federal government because this public holiday has been observed every year on October 1st since before Baba Tinubu was not elected, thus I don't see anything wrong with it.Everyone deserves to celebrate the 63th anniversary of our nation because we can all agree that we are proud of it, just as we do when it is our birthday. What will prevent you from celebrating your fatherland's freedom independence when you can celebrate your birthday?",

      "body": "From my secondary school days till date, I have known that once a public holiday falls on Saturday or Sunday, that means on Monday there will be no school because it's a holiday. It's both schools, banks and government workers won’t go to work, so it is not a bad idea for a bank to shut down for 24 hrs because it's a holiday. Besides, if banks don't open on Sundays and Saturday, businessmen and women who are in business are still doing well. It is just for everyone to plan ahead, so they won't be affected when it happens.Moreover, we have POS shops almost everywhere around us, so even if banks close for a whole 48 hrs it won't affect them because people will start making use of the POS more, but as long as bank ATMs are working 24 hrs, shut down will not be a problem for business people.",

Make you check your phone calendar you go see say from there e don indicate say Sunday and Monday na public holiday, so make you they sure say no be today they start this one and no be new thing for naija, normally if public holiday fall in weekend days they normally declare Monday to be also another day for workers to rest at home. So no be during tinubu this one start they been dey do am tey tey. However wetin I  reason about banks to shutdown for 24hrs be say be say make any worker just they house make them to respect this of independence that is why him include the banks and nothing wrong here. No be everything we go they criticize.",
