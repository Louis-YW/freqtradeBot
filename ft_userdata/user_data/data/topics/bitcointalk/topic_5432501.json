How would you determine how much 1 BTC is worth, or how will the user knows if their order will go through or not if the exchange rate, open order/order history etc is not visible? Do they have to wait until their transaction gets confirmed on the blockchain? If that's the case, then the risk for them will greatly increase since they need to depend on you to be trustworthy. I don't think this is the right choice to make since you'll never get any customers by doing so. You should rework this a bit, at least make it so that users can see the liquidity of your market. Also, what does the 0.00001 BTC/XMR at the bottom of the page mean? Is it the fee you take for every withdrawal and refund when a user can't buy/sell their coins? I understand that you want to take profit from every withdrawal, but why would you request additional funds when a refund is issued (assuming the cause is the inability to fulfill the order)? That would discourage traders instead. CMIIW.",

CMIIW.For this reason, launching the service with zero fees for swaps in exchange for charging fees for withdrawals is not very encouraging in this case, especially since the application works only on the exchange between Monero and Bitcoin and does not support more pairs. Unless, there are plans for further development.On this basis, launching the open-source application will not have the ability to attract a larger number of users. In addition, anyone can launch a competing application using the source.",

There are also some sections which are missing but they are common sense for any other website. Among others, there are no \"Contact\", \"Terms & Conditions\", \"Privacy\", \"Disclaimer\" sections. Social media links are not a must, but many websites add them as well.3. The website is localized only in English.4. The website works fine with Tor, which represents a plus. However, I did not see any .onion address for it.5. There is also no \"About\" section. Practically, there is no information about who runs the site, nor about how to contact the developers, in case a customer needs their support.6. The site says If we can't fulfil your entire order, we will refund the amount that was not exchanged. I don't know if this actually works. Some tests should be done here, but I don't know if anybody has such big amounts to exchange (and also such big guts).7. There is also a typo in the above sentence, as the term \"fulfil\" should be written as \"fulfill\".8. At \"API\" section there are multiple words written with underlined font which makes the user believe they are hyperlinks. However, they are not.9. Still at the \"API\" section, at the bottom of the page there are two more sections listed - Assets and Markets. However, their positioning inside the page is not aesthetic at all:Perhaps they should be rearranged somehow or placed in another location as, right now, their arrangement does not look well at all, compared with the nice table which is just above them.10. The \"Login\" page contains only a field for \"login\"... but none for entering a password (assuming the email is the user name). How does this login work? By simply inserting the email used for registration and that's all, no password required? If so, then if a user knows the registration email of another user, he will be able to login using second user's email, simply by typing it inside \"Login\" field?11. Still at \"Login\" page, I see that there is no option to delete the account. Practically, once a user creates an account on this website, his account will remain there forever? (This also implies that developers will always keep user's email in their database?)I will end here this feedback, but I will come back in case I will find any other bug on the website or in case I'll have more suggestions.

      "body": "I try to buy Monero without any account as shown in the picture above. The website is very quick to display my pending Bitcoin payment right after I send the amount using my Electrum. The only problem was there was such reference ID or anything that will bookmark my pending transaction in case I close the Fryx Finance window since waiting for 5 confirmations is a bit long. Good thing I didn't use an incognito browser that time and browse on my history the Fryx finance transaction page. I hope that you have an option in your website that can track pending transaction using a reference ID.Also since this is an exchange, I hope that there's a calculator cost for both Monero and Bitcoin. I do buy Monero using specific amount of Bitcoin but I don't know how much Monero I can get on my Bitcoin that I sent on the address since the calculator is only working for the Monero equivalent value in Bitcoin. I do a trial and error type on the value of monero calculator to come up on the Monero figure that equals to the Bitcoin that I sent.Please indicate minimum deposit amount and the fees on the exchange page so that user will be aware on this before they will send any amount on the deposit address.My payment is already confirmed as shown above but I still didn't received my Monero on my provided address. I'm already waiting more than 15 to 30mins until now for the Monero to arrive. I hope that you can include an estimated time of arrival for the coins since checking the wallet balance multiple times is so frustrating.If possible, add a chat support or a link that will direct on this thread so that user that has concern to the service can communicate to you.I will update this once I received my Monero to my Wallet.

I really suggest having a countdown timer or an update message on the transaction page when the Monero is already sent because the display didn't change even when I received already the Monero. It is still tagged as it will arrive soon. I don't know what's the conversion rate per Monero by the time I purchased, I believe adding a summary after a successful transaction such as total Monero received & conversion rate at the time transaction made is really cool.This service is almost as good as mixer since Monero is untraceable.
