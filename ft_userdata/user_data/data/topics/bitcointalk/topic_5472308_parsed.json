Di number of garbages dat we don report e don too many, we Don tire to report sef, so di best thing now is to submit the shit/spam posters to Global Moderators to ban and negative feedback (tag) nd to delete so dat di remaining users go restructure demselves. If you no get anything to create, comment on other threadsThe first set of shit/spam posters in di local board e dey under compiling list.Again and again, if you no know before, know it now.

Assuming we can get the sub boards, we would have had one dedicated for Bitcoin education because a lot of the posters display huge difficiency of Bitcoin knowledge. I know how I'm also trying to comprehend everything... it is not just easy. If people are well informed and equipped with the right knowledge,  that will show in their posting and interaction here. The non-Bitcoin related topics and discussions are not entirely bad but when they dominate discussion here day-in-day-out, it becomes somehow since here is a Bitcoin forum.

On the English board, we have Bitcoin boards, altcoin boards, economics which may be intended to be about bitcoin like the speculation board but not, the economy board is more about what that are not that related to bitcoin and moderators left it that way. We also have other boards like serious discussion and its child board, watch tower. There are other boards like politics and society, including the off-topic board. This is a bitcoin forum, but we have many other boards that what are related to bitcoin are not discussed. On the English board, the board that is most related to politics discussion  is the politics and society board.We are close to almost a year now and we are not looking for ways to have child boards. We discuss about politics and society and about off-topic related matters. We need boards for these. The reason some peoole like Igehhbotz and Agbe that are frustrating is because they see more of discussion that they do not like and that are of low quality. If there are boards for it, we can easily report many of the posts to be moved to the appropriate board. We can notice on the English board that some people said they are not visiting some boards because it is full more of low quality posts. If there are other boards, the irrelevant threads would have been moved there. I mean the thread some people see as irrelevant.

That wan na because many people don complain tire but no body is doing something.

Before that thread start Dem newbies be still dey try create quality post for we board. But all of a sudden I just come dey see rubbish full everywhere. Can you imagine someone bring this kind of post Peni*s is the most insensate organ in man's body  to a forum that clearly says BITCOINTALK. like watin una dey think say this place be.

I would like to see something done about this, but don't be too harsh on anyone. They should just know that hiding behind our local board and posting off topics to get merit would not show a good reputation to our people outside the main board. If you no Sabi post come dey post rubbish how you wan take earn better merit for main board? I just want everyone to learn nd understand why we need quality post on our local board as these white people they are watching our every move.

Which means Hugeblack's thread is still good which is the original and the best way than for it to become centralized. In fact, I 100% prefer Hugeblack's thread than it to be centralized. Hugeblack thread is also not opened to only Nigerian local board, but to other local boards. That Hugeblack thread does more good than for it to be centralized.We should not because someone is having headache, cut off the person's head. If drug should be used for it, then report the spam posts here, and let us also go for requesting theymos to create child boards. If there is off-topic or something like society board, Peni*s is the most insensate organ in man's body would have been moved there.

The thread you are referring to is locked and only CryptopreneurBrainboss is posting there without allowing some members to report any good post. It was never meant for you to report any good post or any other persons. If you come across a post that you believe is quality and deserve to me merited, you send merit to them and if you don't have you can report the post to Hugeblack main thread as he asked for quality post for review or other giveaway threads on the forum. That thread is there for interaction between hugeblack and me but he prefers to communicate through DM that's why it's locked and for clarification, just because your posts get listed doesn't guarantee you receiving merit from him and most times he reviews each thread I submitted and not just the post that I submitted, that's why if anybody has observed your post get merited by him even though yours wasn't among the selected posts for the week. To quote him directly;Quote from: hugeblack on September 05, 2023, 10:20:29 AMInstead of getting discouraged we can think of a compromise, I can give Nigerians LB about 150-200 merits per month, which means about 100 extra sMerit, just make a weekly list, PM me with it or through that thread and I'll look into it.I decided to bring the list public and I can decide to take it private too still my decision but to allow public eye see what's going on that's why it's public. You're not on a decentralized forum so don't think every decision has to pass through the public. I could have ignored this assistance from him for the board but I'm selfishly taking my precious time out of my schedule to do a task that doesn't benefit me in any way but for the board so you have to accept the way I do it provided it benefits the board, it's not a debate. As for the spam matter, report spam to moderators and they'll delete it. I dey report topics scatter, some dem go delete others dem no go delete but instead of complaining I keep on reporting and at some point I dey send people DM and we all can do the same. The child board is a welcome idea and Agbe you can discuss with others and come up with something for boards proposal and pass it through the community for approval before creating a request. Nobi everything una go dey expect me to do, this is our board not my board so decision can go on if the community approves.",

      "body": "This is a very good suggestion and plan you just brought up @ Agbe, because to me, I see that the high rate of this spam on our local board is simply as a result of improper guardians from those introducing people  (i.e newbies) into this forum, of which I have noticed that the ideology most of these newbies have is \"the more threads you create, the more merits you are likely to get to grow fast\", forgetting the fact that merit is simply always a reward for quality discussion, hence, you see newbies creating multiple threads in their journey to acquiring as much merits as possible, which is not ought to be that way. But however, one thing most people need to know is that though Bitcoin is the primary topic of discussion here, it is not the only topic of discussion, and as such we have got other boards such as gambling/economics/politics where all kinds of sport games/general discussions are been talked about daily, and the best place for a newbie to start from while engaging in that which he/she has good knowledge about it, instead of focusing mainly on \"local board\" while you know yourself you haven't got much knowledge to engage in a Bitcoin-related discussion. So the only solution to this will be to reporting or correcting whoever found to post a low quality contents not related to Bitcoin, our economy and  the forum in general. While others make sure to educate whoever they bring to this forum.",

This is a nice thread,  and if it can achieve it purpose because when everything has been published some Hero and legendary members will against the thread again to be lock or deleted because their friends, relatives or alt-accounts have been involved. I think what Igebotz said in his thread is correct. Because the number of scraps in the local board is too many and theymos dey see am so if we ask for sub-boards in this amist e go dey hard for im to grand us that one because e no dey encouraging at all.

We shouldn’t just be tagging their accounts, let’s look for another way to tackle that.Quote from: Igebotz on October 31, 2023, 11:25:33 PMI dislike leaving neutral tags on shitposters and spammers, but doing so will only benefit the community in the long run because such a user will be unable to join any signature in the future, thereby saving the forum from garbage. Do you think it's only our board that’s facing a similar problem? Check out other local boards and see how they are helping each other. We are planning to tag our own accounts. If you start tagging accounts, then wait and see how the activity of this local board will drop drastically, it will just be like our local board is dead because only a few people will be posting here, and it won’t be often. I know some posts are completely off point, but if you want people to be posting about bitcoin and cryptocurrency alone, then you won’t be seeing new threads often, because there is no serious bitcoin activity going on in our country currently. There are some posts that are dropped here, and they are not about bitcoin, but they are really useful. If you want to start tagging accounts, then everyone will be running away from here, nobody knows what they will post that will make you tag their accounts. If you will be tagging accounts, I know a higher percentage will be newbies, and I hope you know everyone started as a newbie and  we started growing with time. I am sorry to say, but check your post history and compare when you joined the forum posting pattern with your current posting pattern. Then you will see the difference. If your account was tagged, will you have gotten to your current position? Let’s just think about it twice before starting. The local board is supposed to be a place where we will assist, guide, and cover up for each other, we are not supposed to be exposing and spoiling each other’s accounts here. I know the way high rank members always come out and support their low-rank members if they are being dragged in the reputation board, and I am sure those people won’t go back to their local board and be tagging their members  accounts.I said it before and I will say it again, why is it that the same people complaining now are making comments in those threads that are off point? If you see any thread that’s completely useless, the only thing that’s supposed to be on the thread is people complaining about it, so next time the OP won’t create something similar to that, but most people don’t do that, they will still make a contribution to the useless post.",

I am just against reporting and tagging accounts, even if what they do doesn’t benefit the LB. We shouldn’t just be tagging their accounts, let’s look for another way to tackle that.Quote from: Igebotz on October 31, 2023, 11:25:33 PMI dislike leaving neutral tags on shitposters and spammers, but doing so will only benefit the community in the long run because such a user will be unable to join any signature in the future, thereby saving the forum from garbage. Do you think it's only our board that’s facing a similar problem? Check out other local boards and see how they are helping each other. We are planning to tag our own accounts. If you start tagging accounts, then wait and see how the activity of this local board will drop drastically, it will just be like our local board is dead because only a few people will be posting here, and it won’t be often.Normally no be only our local board get the same problem, but if other local board no they reason or try to harness this problem e no mean say we go follow them. Most of those local board wey u they talk about get merit source o, which make them get strong ground pass us. Us here we still they find way make them give us merit source. So we suppose they follow the rules so that they go look into our matter give us merit source then our ground fit strong more for the forum.",
