  "content": "Building a community around your product and attracting users to your platform is not an easy process. Thankfully, UBET Sports already has a thriving community and users on the beta platform. Now, we are ready to take further steps and expand our user base as UBET prepares to launch on the Polygon mainnet.While taking steps to grow our user base, trust has repeatedly come up and has prompted us to reflect on how to earn it. As we all know, trust means believing that someone is good, honest, and will not cause harm, or that something is safe and reliable, as defined by the Cambridge English dictionary. Trust is an essential component of human relationships and interactions. Even in the realm of products and services in business, large companies benefit from their established brands, which foster trustability and provide a significant advantage over startups.Earning trust is a laborious and challenging process that takes time. Let's consider the potential sources of trust-related concerns: 1.Being an unknown startup. 2.The prevalence of numerous crypto scam projects worldwide. 3.Lack of familiarity with blockchain and smart contract technology.Being a startup is an obvious reason, but it also highlights the importance of carving out a niche. We believe that one of our niches is our commitment to transparency and accountability. We achieve this by openly sharing our odds algorithm (our AMM smart contract code), adopting a non-custodial approach, and striving to democratize the sportsbook experience. It is worth emphasizing that decentralization is crucial for enhancing the sports betting industry and providing superior user experiences, especially when it comes to cashing out!Many users have lost trust in crypto projects, particularly given the numerous dramas unfolding in this bear market. We do not deny that there are numerous suspicious projects that are poorly managed and executed, seeking to exploit tokens for dishonest purposes. We firmly believe that such projects will not survive and will be eliminated in the bear market. If you are reading this or have been following UBET Sports, we distance ourselves from the aforementioned concerns. Our business and technology have been executed with precision, and our community has formed organically without relying on token airdrops. Betting is conducted using USDC, ensuring stability and reliability.Blockchain technology is still far from achieving global adoption, and many retailers remain unfamiliar with blockchain and smart contract technology. The primary selling point of blockchains is their decentralization and the ability to conduct immutable transactions through smart contracts. These features eliminate the need for central operating authorities and intermediaries. However, we acknowledge that trust issues are not entirely resolved. Newcomers still need to trust the platform's builders. They need reassurance that there is no malicious intent within the smart contracts and that the platform is secure without vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. It is important to know the individuals behind the project, the team that is building it, and the community of users. As we write this, we hope that readers will follow us and get to know our team and platform over time. We have a long-term vision and mission behind UBET Sports that will grow with the community!In the end, the product needs to be amazing, and that's exactly what we're striving for during our beta testing phase. We acknowledge that numerous bugs have been discovered, which we view as a positive aspect. It allows us to address and fix them while still in the testnet environment. Furthermore, we are diligently working on backend infrastructure enhancements that will seamlessly improve the user experience. These changes will empower us to scale up and deliver superior odds and wagering experiences. As mentioned earlier, we are rapidly approaching the launch on the mainnet. Our smart contract code has been completed, and we are now entering the code auditing process!We would like to hear from you about what trust means to you when trying a new app and what it would take to earn your trust. Please feel free to comment below, as your feedback will help us rethink and deliver a better product!Website: http://ubetsports.io/Twitter: https://twitter.com/UBet__SportsDiscord: https://discord.gg/9jthdpkfCTTelegram: https://t.me/+bSVMidWbDdljZTc0",
