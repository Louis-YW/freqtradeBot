Each category consists of a list of specific commands as links, which you can follow in order to find out what this command is for, what it does and what the proper syntax is to make it work. Examples of usage are also included, which is very convenient both for developers and regular folks.[1] https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/",

Although that problem mainly comes for the fact that the documentation is more oriented towards Bitcoin Core developers rather than users.",
