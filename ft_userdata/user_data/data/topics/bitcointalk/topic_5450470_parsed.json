Proposed treasury management principles include that ETH is Lido DAO's primary unit of account, Lido DAO funds are a source of protocol resilience and future growth, and can fund plans to further the protocol's decentralization and cybersecurity goals; The risk of loss of treasury funds is minimized; all treasury ETH must be pledged in Lido; LDO holders have the final say.",
