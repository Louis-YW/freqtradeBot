      "body": "Seems like a good offer, but what NFTs are you sending exactly?  Do you have any examples or can we see your wallet address to look at what sort of NFTs you're dealing with?  NFTs can be scary in that interaction with them can put the rest of your assets in jeopardy if the creator has nefarious intentions.  This is why typically people don't accept NFTs that are sent to their wallet for free.  Not saying that's what is happening here, but perhaps with more information someone would be able to take a look at the collections you're giving away for free to make sure the contract doesn't contain any funny business.  Stay safe and good luck!",

      "body": "As I can see this is your first post as a new bie on board this platform. No question of enquiries about  how things works on this board but your are quick to make a comment of members buzzing you via your telegram handle for free nft. I would not be surprised people complaining about any abnormalities in the near future in respect to dealing with you.  I would also advise that anyone who is interested in getting the free nft should thread with caution as there are no verifiable proof from OP to ascertain the genuineness of his or her claim and also, OP  state it clear here the type of nft you are giving out for free, let us know the platform on which the nft operates. If possible, reference us to transaction hash of minted nft you have successfully executed in the past and lastly what utility value does your nft possesses.",
