Top-up via gifting takes 72 hours for the 1st time (Steam gifting rules for newly added accounts). Top-up via login it's instant because we login into your account and add the balance directly.• Top-up via gift it's a bit safer for us than via login (That's why we offer better rates)We only take crypto. https://discord.gg/HerYGucQTG",
