I've debunked the same post he has copy and pasted above multiple times over the last several months:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5286821.msg62413682#msg62413682https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465398.msg62800032#msg62800032The fact that he continues to post it when it is blatantly false, means either he doesn't understand anything about coinjoins or he knows what he is posting is a complete lie. Either way, he is not interested in discussion and only in pushing his agenda.I've had him on ignore for months; I suggest everyone else does the same: Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on August 31, 2023, 06:01:21 PMIt's been clear for some time now that Kruw is either incapable or unwilling to address the vast myriad of valid points made against Wasabi in this thread, and instead can only result to copious amounts of hand-waving and whataboutism. Furthermore, it's also clear that Kruw either does not understand how Whirlpool and JoinMarket work, or he does understand but deliberate lies about them to spread his narrative.Either way, although I'll continue to point out to other users in this thread all the reasons they should avoid Wasabi, there is no point continuing to argue with Kruw.Anyone who wants to see the truth about Wasabi coinjoins being demixed, Wasabi doxxing their competitors, and Wasabi funding mass surveillance, can simply read the Wasabi thread. Any time he copies and pastes the same old nonsense again, just reply with a link to this post.Back on topic here: It is entirely fair to warn people that zkSNACKs are directly funding the enemy.Whirlpool works great. Yes you can be deanonymized if you do something stupid like linking unmixed coins to coinjoined coins, but that is the case with literally every coinjoin implementation or any other privacy technique.So yeah, to answer OP's question, I would suggest either Samourai or Sparrow via your own node.",

Even if in the past those coins came from their address.You could and you should, in my opinion! As I said in another thread, I would mix my UTXOs from this campaign (I wasn't part of it, but hypothetically) and send them to a wallet specifically created for this purpose. I wouldn't wanna mix these inputs with other inputs I have.I know you specifically mention CoinJoins, but if you wanna go a little further (I think you do, since you mentioned exchanges) you can read here: https://kycnot.me/search?type=exchange and find more tools to ensure your privacy. One tool I use a lot is UnstoppableSwap which allows me to basically swap between Bitcoin and Monero in a fully self-custodial way. Technically you could get rid of these UTXOs you own switching to monero and then follow the same steps in reverse to get fresh Bitcoin back.P.S in case you choose Whirlpool coinjoins, make sure to remember that it creates change UTXOs in an account that it calls \"Badbank\". Treat these UTXOs carefully.",

For now, I will trust the other forum members.I will make it as simple as I can for you.Kruw is a Wasabi contributor and will do and say any thing possible to convince you that Wasabi is the ONLY solution to Privacy for Bitcoin users.  Kruw is only suggesting you to use Wasabi or other Wasabi implementations because you asked for the BEST Coin Join Wallet and there is no way he would say otherwise.  Had you said any thing skeptical about Wasabi, the first thing Kruw would of said was that you are a criminal using Bitcoin from Sinbad Campaign.Long story short.  You either believe Kruw and start using the Wasabi Wallet.  But keep in mind that Wasabi is supporting and actively working with Blockchain Analysis.  So you can start using Wasabi but remember.  Kruw would say you are a criminal for owning Bitcoin from the Sinbad Campaign.  I have been accused for being a criminal by him for participating in a Mixer Campaign.  So your Address(es) may be blacklisted by his Blockchain Analysis partner already.  In fact I am very confused as to why he is recommending you to use Wasabi considering he would consider your UTXOs criminal money.  Per his own statements, you should be censored from Wasabi Coin Joins already.Or you can use common sense and become skeptical of all the accusations and spit Kruw throws at every single skeptic and Privacy solution that is not Wasabi.  And then you realize there is no reason you should not use Sparrow, Join Market, Atomic Swaps or any other Privacy tools.Privacy you gain from ANY of the tools will not be PERFECT ever anyway.  My favorite is combining Privacy tools to produce a final UTXO that is much less likely to be debunked.  You never know how long it takes before you hear there is a flaw they found in the one method you have always been using.",
