  "content": "Stake.com provide on their site a facility for players to retrieve the original un-hashed* server seed for their \"Stake Originals\" games. This in normal circumstances allows a player to verify bets in Stake.com's Provably Fair process.The problem is that there is a limited time frame in which a player can obtain the un-hashed server seed. So if a player for whatever reason is delayed in verifying their bets, the server seed may not be available to them and as a consequence those bets are no longer verifiable or Provably fair. Stake do not inform the players that there is a time limit on the Provably Fair process, nor do they specify what that timeframe is. If Stake.com have imposed a deadline on server seed retrieval, I think it's a reasonable expectation that players be informed that there is a restriction on server seed retrieval and what that restricted time frame is exactly.Personally I think when a player changes seed, the original server seed should be published in their bet archive. Then Stake's Sometimes Provably Fair can be just provably fair.*It's not currently possible to un-hash a server seed as sha256 encryption is one way. However I use the term un-hashed here as it is the term Stake.com use on their website.https://stake.com/provably-fair/server-seed-unhash",

(Virus Total Result)I don't play provably fair games in Stake but I do play on their sports betting. Most of the gambling site do give the previous hash after they renew their seed. I am not sure what's the process in the Stake and I am not sure if they were not giving it, maybe you can request it. We know that they are reputable and really one of the best gambling site maybe you can request it to them?",

Do you ever login to Stake before? Also OP didn't asked any question on here, instead he just told us his opinion regarding that \"Provably fair\".@OP, i don't think Stake can do that, if they are going to save all of people's betting history, it would blew up Stake's server because of too much data to be save on there and people who already trusted stake also won't mind to check every of their hash to prove it's provably fair",

      "body": "Personally, I didn't even know that a feature like this is available on stake casino, I've only seen and used this feature on freebitco a couple of time in their wheel of fortune which I play frequently.And I think OP have some good point here, there are many others like me out there who do not know that there is even a way to verify  Bets on stakes original games, which i play frequently by the way..Would be nice if they can make this seed public and open for the gamblers to view and use, and if at all there is a time Frame attached to each seed by which if it elapses, it would no longer function, then they should make all this known to the gambler, it is the gamblers decision to use it or not.@op, I would suggest you try to post stake related issues like this in their Announcement thread, important ideas like this I believe will catch the attention of the stake Admins more quickly than when it is shared in the new topic.",

      "body": "They do allow to verify on all of there bets. Having a time limit on how much bets you can verify is not worthy to categorized them as Sometimes Probably Fair because all their bets is verifiable at given time. I will agree if Stake sometimes didn’t allow to verify bets on given time frame but the issue that you are trying emphasize are due optimization of site for faster processing of bets. Not all users is interested on verifying there bets that’s why Stake set a limitation on this make the casino efficient as much as possible since they are processing tons of bets per second.",

I mean these guys have been behind PD who introduced how provaby fair works so I would not expect them to be unreasonable with stake.And I agree, the server seed should be revealed within the bet once the bet result is out since it won't be used again, right?",

Select a hashed server seed from 2020 and try to unhash it. I agree that players should always be able to check bets at any time they deem necessary.",
