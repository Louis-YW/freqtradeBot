Since you don't have a screenshot of your balance when it's 0.1 BTC, I assume we can prove your balance was around that through the past winnings?The software shows you replays of all your cash game hands actually. So if you want to see screenshots that must and can only be taken hand by hand. There is no overall win/loss ratio statistics that one can check and see.I mean collusion/chip dumping can easily be spotted of you observe every hand. Also every hand has a number so it can be checked by support if they for example raise, reraise, fold all the time to move the balance to a different account without actually a showdown.The \"thief\" could also just have withdrawn all the money since the account doesn't seem to be 2fa protected. But since withdrawals at SWC sometimes take a while chip dumping seems to be the \"easier\" way this could have happened.",

Although the regulars bring traffic, the rooms have been disadvantaging them for many years, giving them less rakeback and less promotions because they are net winners who end up withdrawing money from the money deposited in the room. The recreational players, on the other hand, are the ones who make the business work. So the theory that the room favors pros and regulars against recreational players is simply not true.",

Collusion between accounts controlled by the same person happenes frequently and the support does nothing. Me and some other players have encountered these scammers several times and nothing happened after a report.Then there are these sketchy accounts that NEVER lose, variance is not happening for them. Also, people working for swc are playing at the site as well, which is not a good look in my opinion. Needless to say they have no license and if and how the card distribution is fair is also nowhere to be found. We people ask that question they get banned or the message deleted from the telegram channel.But hey, we can all decide if we play there or not. Since so much questionable stuff happened there I stopped playing, just to be safe.",
