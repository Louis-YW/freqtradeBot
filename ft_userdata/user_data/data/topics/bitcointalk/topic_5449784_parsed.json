I am not a linguist; perhaps users from these sections will be able to find the truth and assure everyone that these languages are native. In addition to everything, you can ask the user himself, How did the change of preferences occur, that the posting language has changed dramatically?The account is currently participating in a subscription campaign run by Royse777.",

Looking at the account, it's nobody big in the community and it's a 0 trust account. For these reasons, I would say a neutral tag stating the account has likely changed hands around 2018 and is not the original owner. Had the account had some positive rep I would say message the users who left them reputation and show the evidence, if they don't remove the trust then a neg might possibly be warranted.**EDIT**I would also suggest that users ~and consider keeping the account from making it into the DT network. This is your choice of course, a discussion on the subject should happen and see what the consensus thinks. The account is not currently in DT.",

It's Nigerian Pidgin and at times it is even comprehensible to someone who comes with only knowledge of English. Look at their official board, you will notice for sure. At some point, I also participated in the discussion there (only a few posts), and then they explained to me this adjustment.There are a lot of reliable members there, I believe he can confirm this.Also there you can very often see that someone writes exclusively in English during the discussion.

      "body": "Good catch, OP. It's very likely that martyns is indeed a sold or hacked account. I haven't checked all his post history but his indonesian posts seem to be submitted 2018 or earlier, while his nigerian posts all seem to be submitted after his last indonesian post. While I've not checked every single post, it seems to be a very clear case, if proven right. In addition, the 4 year posting gap is making it even more obvious. For such cases, a negative trust is totally appropriate. Selling / buying accounts is one of the most famous reasons for negative trust. If it's a hacked + sold account, too. But we need to have a valid proof to give him a negative trust for being a bought account. Quote from: examplens on April 22, 2023, 02:29:52 PMAlso there you can very often see that someone writes exclusively in English during the discussion. That's why I wouldn't take all of this as 100% proof that the account changed hands.I would say, that it's up to martyns to prove that he's still a native indonesian speaker. If he is still the old account owner, it should be quite easy for him to prove it, considering that he has done more than 400 post in Bitcointalk's indonesian section. My favorite strategy would be to send him a PM, that he needs to prove that he's still a native indonesian speaker to avoid getting tagged, as hundreds of accounts have been tagged for selling / buying accounts before.",

What I mean to say is that we only see successful cases of finding, while in the shadows there is a huge amount of work that has not been crowned with a result. This is true?Nobody asked martyns to comment on changes from one locale to another? Perhaps he can explain it in an interesting way and I would like to hear his version.  P.S.
