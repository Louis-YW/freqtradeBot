  "content": "The OPL or Oasis Privacy Layer is an EVM compatible cross-chain solution that enables the connection between Web 3 networks and the Confidential EVM Sapphire, through the support of messaging bridges and paymasters/gas relayers. This means that any public blockchain network is able to leverage Confidential Smart Contracts if there is a messaging bridge that integrates with the Oasis Privacy Layer and is able to communicate with the public chain.An example is the Celer Messaging Bridge, which connects with most popular EVM compatible chains, including Ethereum, BNB chain, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.b Another is the soon-to-be-integrated Oraichain, which will enable Oasis Confidential Smart Contracts' customizable privacy over the Cosmos Ecosystem. However, this is still a work in progress.Celer Bridge Integration: https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/celer-messaging-bridge-integrationList of compatible chains: https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/opl/#supported-networksOraichain Partnership: https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/oraichain-integration-privacy-on-cosmosNow, the question is: how seamless will this integration be? how will user pay for gas fees? This is were paymasters and gas relayers step in. They will enable gas sponsorship to users by dApp developers themselves, or even enable you to pay for gas fees using your home-chain native token, without needing to exchange it for Rose to be able to enjoy Smart Privacy. This is possible thanks to EIP 4337, or Account Abstraction as coined by Vitalik Buterin 2021 and implemented on the Ethereum Mainnet in March 2023.https://metamask.io/news/latest/account-abstraction-past-present-future/But what happens in the case scenario where you want to use a specific dApp on one of the affiliated chains, but you don't have tokens in that chain and you need to pay for gas on your own? In this case, there are two solutions to increase interoperability between chains in the OPL. The introduction of syROSE, a synthetic token made by SYNTHR to increase liquidity and scalability, enabling seamless low-slippage cross-chain swaps between the Oasis Network native Rose token and assets from industry-leading blockchains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB chain and more. This makes it easier to obtain the tokens to use privacy-enabled dApps throughout Web3.SYNTHR and syRose: https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/syrose-launch-synthr-partnershipIf you don't prefer this approach, you will be able to use Illuminex, a Confidential Multichain Decentralized Exchange that enables MEV-free token transfers for all chains connected through the OPL. This path enables you to seamlessly obtain the tokens you need and engage with privacy-enabled dApps throughout Web3. Illuminex will also have a pool for syROSE x ROSE, providing an opportunity for liquidity providers to earn yield by supporting both efforts through a pegged-asset pair with low impermanent loss.Illuminex DEX: https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/illuminex-grant-sapphire-dexWith the growth and evolution of Web3 in mind, these efforts strive for a more interoperable, scalable and secure Web3 without borders, addressing an intrinsic problem of public Web3 chains: immutable transparency. However, with the integration Customizable Smart Privacy into every chain through the Oasis Privacy Layer, transparency is now optional for every dApp and DAO in any ecosystem. Now, with a privacy-enabled Web 3, we will be able to build a more data-responsible and user-centric future.Check here to find resources on how to enable privacy on your dApp with OPL.:https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/opl/",
