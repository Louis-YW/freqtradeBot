  "content": "It's been over 3 to 4 years of experience in product design and web design. I became increasingly interested in technology and wanted to start building websites as soon as I had the opportunity to learn due to my deep interest in it. However, there were some limitations at the time. I had little knowledge of basic CSS and HTML and no knowledge at all of JavaScript until I discovered WordPress and learned it. This marked my introduction to no-code tools. Last year, I came across Webflow and started using it to build interactive websites for clients. I also learned Framer and began working with it.I have delved deeply into learning Webflow, but I've heard many exciting stories about Framer, and I want to understand it better. I'm not sure if there are people in this forum who use no-code tools (perhaps this might be the first time for some individuals), but I would like to know which is more suitable and preferable for website building and what their limitations are.Based on some of my findings, here are the results and my preferences:1. Webflow has more integrations than Framer, making it more functional.2. With Webflow, I can export codes to my GitHub and manage the code there.3. Webflow has been around for a long time, with more sophisticated features and regular updates. Framer is relatively new, although it has an AI feature, which isn't unique to me.4. I initially appreciated the UI of Framer because it was easy to use and more accessible when Webflow was less beginner friendly. However, changes were made to Webflow in the last few months, and it now looks way     more appealing to me than Framer.I don't know of a no-code tool that suits me better than Webflow, it's the only real alternative for me. I would love to hear your opinions and suggestions. I can share some sites made with webflow and framer if a request is made for better comparison",

      "body": "Hi, I'm new here. Perhaps we could be friends. I am also a product designer with up to 6 years experience. I also use Webflow and embrace other no-code tools because believe no-code or rather, less code is the future of software development, because who wants to be writing when you can just command the writing is done for you, huh? Well a lot of developers who enjoy the craft more than the result do.To respond to your curiosity, I want to say I am curious as well. I have a fair amount of knowledge in html and css but not java script, and that is why I employ no code to fill in that void. Like you, I don't use framer, I was very excited when I discovered it about a year ago, and I even made some posts about it. However, I was heartbroken when I learnt that it doesn't export your code. This made me lose interest in it. Nevertheless, to answer the question: Webflow vs Framer - for simple websites. I'll say framer because you don't need any sophisticated knowledge on coding or web design to create something from start to finish using Framer. I have a friend who has like zero html/css skill and yet he was able to build and publish his e-commerce webisite. This is not the case in Webflow for even if you use a webflow template, you would need at least one week length of tutorial to complete your work with it. I'd still chose webflow any day mainly because it gives me my code to host anywhere(even though their css is unnecessarily long...like why!!!???).I'll pay attention to your thread to see what others have to say. I am yearning to quench my curiosity. Thanks for posting.",

Well a lot of developers who enjoy the craft more than the result do.Although no codes are interesting and they are effective  , coding goes beyond and deeper than that.You cannot really tell a machine to write a code you don't understand. Learning how to code open your mind to more possibilities , allowing you to be more precise and creature new stuff.Even chatgpt can write code for you today. But you need to know how to explain the code you want him to write  , for example. Those tools can do the hard work for you, and even make you learn faster. But learning basic/intermediate of javascript is a must for every web dev",
